Peronist and Argentina\u0027s President-elect Alberto Fernández, waves after voting in Buenos Aires on SundayMacri was elected president in 2015 promising to jumpstart the country\u0027s economy. Argentines rejected at the time a successor chosen by Cristina Fernández, who along with her late husband dominated Argentina\u0027s political scene for 12 years and rewrote its social contract. But the isive former leader, who embodies Argentina\u0027s enduring cycle of hope and despair, is back.\u0027I\u0027m so happy. We were waiting for this change for a long time.

President Mauricio Macri, who was running for reelection, throws a kiss to supporters after conceding the election next to his wife Juliana Awada waves in Buenos Aires on SundayThe result also marks a shift leftward for South America, which has seen conservative governments elected in Brazil, Colombia and Chile in recent years.

But overall frustration over the economy eroded the popularity of the pro-business former mayor of Buenos Aires. It also propelled the candidacy of Alberto Fernández, whose surge has sent jitters in the financial markets over a possible return to interventionist polices of Cristina Fernández\u0027s 2007-2015 administration.Macri\u0027s camp tried, but failed to capitalize on that unease, portraying her as a puppet master waiting in the wings. The presidential candidate has dismissed those fears and voters gave him a decisive victory over Macri in August primaries, which are a barometer of support for candidates ahead of the presidential election.

I think she looked towards the internet to give her support and help.\u0027She may well have received support and help, but what she also found was a dark, bleak world of content that accelerated her towards more such content.\u0027Mr Russell told BBC News: \u0027The algorithms the platforms use push similar content towards you, so if you have spent time looking at a particular subject it encourages you stay on their platform by providing you with further such content.\u0027I think Molly entered that dark rabbit hole of depressive suicidal content.\u0027Some were as simple as little cartoons - a black and white pencil drawing of a girl that said \u0027Who would love a suicidal girl?\u0027.\u0027Some were much more graphic and shocking.\u0027All in all they added up to something that led to Molly to a very dark and dangerous place indeed.\u0027Mr Russell said he was \u0027really pleased\u0027 that Instagram was taking a positive step forward in removing harmful posts.              Ian Russell has said the algorithms used by Instagram enabled Molly to view more harmful content, possibly contributing to her death. Pictured: Molly on holiday aged six and aged 11But he added: \u0027It would be great if they could find a way to take down 10 times the number of posts and really reduce the potentially harmful content that is on their platform.\u0027This is serious. I honestly believe that by doing so they will save young lives and stop other youngsters ending up like Molly did.\u0027Mr Russell told BBC News: \u0027I think it is really important for families to discuss their internet use quite openly.\u0027It is something that shouldn\u0027t just be talked about when there are problems. It is \u0027What are you doing online? What are you finding? Which apps are you using and how are you using them?\u0027 And trying to find a way to encourage an open dialogue between parents and children.\u0027\u0027It is hard to do, but if it isn\u0027t there it might allow someone to find content and disappear into that digital rabbit hole.\u0027And then it is very difficult for a parent to know how that youngster might be being affected by what they are viewing online.\u0027Molly was a lovely daughter. We all miss her very much, but the thing perhaps she best liked doing was helping others.\u0027I think we all get comfort in knowing that, even though she is not with us any longer, she is somehow finding a way to help other youngsters remain safe and get the support and help they need if they are having mental ill-health problems.\u0027For confidential support, log on to samaritans.org or call the Samaritans on 116123."},{"url":null,"title":"Chinese twins separated babies adopted different families astonishingly similar","story":"Share this article \u0027They are laughing one minute and crying the next.

I just wanted to move to a place where the door didn’t go “ding” every time someone walked through it.We moved to Coventry in the early 80s, when I was just coming up to my teens and the new-romantic movement was at its peak. Back then, it was enough of a concern trying to get my hair to flick right, so when we ended up living in a Chinese takeaway I panicked about the grease wilting my fringe. Little did I know that was to be the least of my worries.My parents and grandparents had emigrated from Hong Kong in the late 1960s. They were part of a postwar wave that had begun in the 1950s, of people arriving in Britain to work in a growing industry: Chinese food. It was affordable, exotic and suddenly very popular in the west. When we arrived in Coventry, we had already lived in Nottingham and Hull, but this converted two-up two-down terrace house was where we would stay.It was only recently that I found out the majority of Hong Kong immigrants who came over to work in restaurants and takeaways did the same, as it was the cheapest and most convenient form of accommodation. The downside was that they were trapped inside the building all day, with hardly any opportunities to socialise with the wider community. It was especially difficult for people like my mother, who was essentially uneducated (she left school at 13), because it severely limited the pool of other jobs she could do. Dad’s frustration manifested as frequent bouts of short temper, and both of them turned to casinos as an escape because they were the only form of after-hours entertainment available, which is probably one of the reasons there often seem to be a lot of Chinese people in casinos. No wonder they were, and still often are, known as the “silent minority”.But, as I say, I didn’t know that then. All I knew was that the ground floor of our home was taken up by the shop and extended kitchen. We made up for not having a living room by cramming an old sofa into my parents’ bedroom, alongside a table with a TV plonked on top. I remember spending hours poring over living-room pictures in the Argos catalogue, imagining a better life involving cornicing and pelmets.My sister and I were squashed into the other bedroom, which provided the only access to the bathroom. There was absolutely no privacy, so I missed out on doing all sorts of formative stuff, such as snogging poster pinups, for fear that someone would barge in at any second, desperate for a poo.Another challenge was that, even though our kitchen was industrial-sized, we couldn’t fit in a washing machine, which meant I had to go to the launderette every weekend because Mum was too busy frying pork balls. At senior school, I heard someone say to his mate: “Ugh, I can smell soy sauce,” while they both sneered at me, so I was paranoid about cooking odours clinging to my clothes. But no matter how much detergent I chucked in, our laundry always seemed to come out with an undertone of chicken chop suey.I would have liked to talk to my parents about my troubles, but I couldn’t because my Chinese was dire. For some reason, our parents never taught us how to speak our native language (although I do understand the odd phrase, such as “Come and gut these prawns!” and “One day you’ll inherit this takeaway!”). To complicate things further, my parents, who did speak Cantonese – the dialect most British Chinese people use – chose to speak Hakka at home, so the kids couldn’t communicate at all with extended family and friends, who would ridicule us for it. Add to that the fact that Mum hardly spoke English, Dad spoke good English, but didn’t like talking, and that my grandparents spoke no English at all, and you have a pretty sorry state of affairs.Random funny fact: mashed potato never existed for Chinese people before they came to Britain, so they didn’t have a word for it. They decided to call it by its English name, “mash”, but pronounced it “ma-see”. This, translated back into Hakka, means “horse shit”, which I’ve always found hysterical because I’m so infantile.I’m not sure why Chinese people bothered naming mash because they never eat it. When our grandparents attempted to make western food, we got spaghetti with golden syrup, and margarine and sugar sandwiches. Mum never made western food, and she never let us eat the food we served customers either because she said it had no nutritional value. Instead, we ate “proper” Chinese food, which consisted of bland steamed fish and vegetables, and sometimes chicken’s feet. My views on food became so skewed that one year I thought it would be honourable of me to donate a catering tin of bamboo shoots to the harvest festival at school. It wasn’t until it was on display in assembly that I realised how out of place it looked next to the custard creams and baked beans.After-school activities included bagging prawn crackers, chopping mushrooms and peeling prawns. Contrary to the “tiger parenting” now associated with Chinese child-rearing, all my parents wanted was for me to take over the business when they retired. I know they meant well, but I couldn’t think of anything worse than working 12-hour days with only Christmas Day off. So, instead of getting a pat on the back for top marks in art, I got a slap round the head for slicing the char siu all wrong. Once, I ended up chopping the end of my index finger off with a meat cleaver, which in hindsight probably required a trip to the hospital for stitches. But my parents didn’t believe in western medicine, and they just doused the wound with soy sauce and wrapped it up in a dishcloth.When I grew tall enough, aged 14, to see over the counter – just under 5ft (FYI, I’m still that height) – I had to start serving customers, and I hated it. Friday and Saturday nights were the worst, as that was when punters came in steaming from the pub. “How long’s it gonna be?” they would slur, jabbing at their watches as if they thought I needed a visual prompt. “About this long,” I’d say, indicating the length of the container it would come in. Then they would crack up and think they’d made a funny little Asian friend. I soon learned how to deal with them, by giving as good as I got.Occasionally, a fight would break out and I’d have to call the police because I was the only one who could speak good enough English. Once, a bloke started being racist to Mum, and my uncle – who was helping out – vaulted over the counter with a knife, Bruce Lee style, and chased him down the street while the whole neighbourhood watched. But all I could think was how embarrassing my family were and how much more bullied I would be if anyone at school found out.I’d been picked on all my life, though, so it was nothing new. At infant school, I was the only Chinese kid, and bullies would pull their eyes into slits at me and sing the Ching Chong Chinaman song. I used to go home, look in the mirror and think: “But my eyes are oval-shaped,” then get confused. By the time I went to secondary school, there were three other Chinese students: my older brother, my cousin and a boy I didn’t know. Takeaways and restaurants tend to be scattered about in different towns to avoid competition. The result is that we stand out wherever we go.Despite my growing insecurities, I managed to make a friend (let’s call her Tina). Tina was interested in meeting my family, but I was insistent that this would never happen. At the same time, I wanted to appear like any other “normal” teenager who invites friends over in a “normal” way, so I caved in. She had cornrows in her hair at the time, and as soon as she walked into the kitchen, Mum pointed at her and laughed because she thought Tina looked like an onion. Tina in turn thought this was the funniest thing she’d ever heard, and in her mind it made me the coolest mate she had ever had. Good job Tina wasn’t normal either.As if running a takeaway wasn’t stressful enough, Dad decided we should keep pets. The first was a fully grown alsatian called Lucky, who seemed to appear from nowhere. We didn’t know how to train her, so she kept escaping on to the main road and nearly getting run over (not so Lucky). Finally, she was given away to the man who delivered the beansprouts. Next up were two goats that Dad gave piggybacks to, up and down the garden (he was a bit eccentric). They were doted over, and allowed to roam wherever they wanted. But one day the brown goat got caught eating £20 worth of fivers out of the till and was sent off to live with Beansprout Man as punishment. Later, the black one broke into the shed, ate a whole bag of hops and exploded. I won’t even go into what happened to my little sister’s hamster.As soon as I was able, I left home and went to London with grand ideas of becoming an artist – which, perhaps unsurprisingly, wasn’t plain sailing. It took a long time to adjust to life outside a Chinese takeaway, especially as I didn’t have a clue about boys, booze or contraception. At the age of 19, I ended up pregnant and living in a King’s Cross squat.Twenty five years later, living happily in a house with a living room – and cornicing – I was asked by my agent whether I would consider a book about my childhood. I was horrified. Then I thought about all those other first-generation British-Chinese kids who probably experienced similar things to me, who might smile with relief and think: “So I wasn’t the only one!” I know they’re out there somewhere, and now I really want to hear their versions of the story.

Hope school was OK. Are you buying that? Hope you have a lovely dinner.’ That can be an encouragement – the world is a safer place than they think. And actually that transmission of kindness shows maybe there is a possibility of communication, particularly for those who are shy or withdrawn. It’s really important that they expand their experiences to learn that while they might have had really difficult experiences, there could be other people who actually can be protective and supportive.”Talking to younger childrenGetting people, especially children, to open up, and share their feelings and thoughts can be trickier than we sometimes think. But Bush suggests that the best reason to reach children is to remember that they are people, albeit a little younger than us.“Remember, children and young people are people. The reason I say that is, we like to be spoken to in an empathetic and understanding way. Most of us prefer someone to talk to us at our own eye height.“Let’s say a six-year-old child is banging two toys together. Instead of jumping to a conclusion, try: ‘Oh, I see Superman really wants to hit Batman today, what are they fighting about?’ You never know where those kinds of questions – which start with the experience of the young person, in their world, using their metaphors – can lead to. The way into it is just by allowing the person to talk in the way they want to talk.”Listen, understand, empathiseMaking sure we’re really listening, and understanding what a person is saying to us, might sound simple, but it’s all too easy to trivialise without even realising it. “The other really important thing is not to be overly reassuring, and not to dismiss things,” says Bush.“For instance, a 21-year-old comes home and says: ‘I’m having a horrific time at work. I feel bullied, I’m failing, I feel I need to just walk away, I’m really stressed.’ Someone might reply: ‘Yeah, we all feel like that’. This kind of response is so demeaning, so dismissive. It doesn’t recognise their pain and distress.“Listen, acknowledge and be understanding. The sheer amount of people who just wanted to hear ‘Wow, that sounds really difficult. I can’t believe you’re been going through that’ as a first response … They didn’t need platitudes or complexity. They just wanted to be understood.”Connections mean resilience“There’s a lot of evidence that shows that social connectedness, a feeling of belonging – particularly connecting with people who have had similar or shared life interests or experiences – is actually very protective,” says Bush. “So young people who feel like they belong, who feel they have a sense of community, and feel able to talk to others in some way, are more resilient in the face of adversity, difficulty or mental health problems.”Britain Get TalkingTo find out more about ITV’s Britain Get Talking campaign, run in collaboration with mental health charities Mind, YoungMinds and SAMH, visit itvbritaingettalking or stv.tvbritaingettalking"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8241f26a7215828bb9ceaff18e38c7db567f0836/304_1083_3272_1963/master/3272.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=374b5b2cadeae7836b2b660aa3d3bf2a","title":"from would you rather to desert island books 10 conversation starters for children and teenagers","story":"Whether you’re hoping to raise a laugh or build a deeper connection, these 10 open-ended questions can help get the conversation started – because it’s good talkNothing kills a conversation faster than the death knell of a generic question.

What was the hardest part of your day, and why?This might prove tricky to answer, but it can be a really useful question to ask if you feel that your child is in some kind of distress. By helping them pinpoint the most difficult part of their day, you might be able to unlock a broader discussion about how they’re feeling, and why.What are you thankful for today, and why?It may seem counterintuitive – especially if you’re in a hard place – but gratitude exercises can play an important role in improving mental wellbeing. Helping your child to pinpoint things they are thankful for every day, even if it’s just one or two small things, can help them lift their mood and gain some perspective.Is there anything that you need from me?

Over a year it is estimated that this could save 5 tonnes of plastic.Stephen Cawley, the head of sustainability at John Lewis said: “Our customers have told us they want us to help them reduce their impact on the planet and that reducing and recycling packaging is key for them. Our message that we want customers to take away just the product that they love and reduce and reuse the packaging that they don’t, will be clearly communicated throughout the shop.”As concern grows about the effect of single-use plastic on the environment, manufacturers and retailers have begun to tackle their substantial carbon footprints. Last month Sainsbury’s said selling milk and fizzy drinks in returnable glass bottles was an option, while Tesco will ban brands that use excessive packaging from its stores from next year.In other measures introduced at John Lewis’s Oxford store, bubble wrap is being substituted for recyclable eco-wrap for china and glass products. Customers can also bring back hangers – from any retailer or brand – to be reused or recycled.The shop will also reward My John Lewis membership cardholders who return empty beauty product packaging and used clothing with gift vouchers. The so-called BeautyCycle scheme, which was tested earlier this year, is being permanently introduced this week to 36 John Lewis shops with a beauty department. Customers booking home delivery for larger items will be offered the chance to help reduce carbon emissions by selecting an “eco-delivery” slot when a van would be close to their home.The trial will continue into next year and the retailer will evaluate customer feedback before deciding whether to roll it out. It has 50 shops across the UK (36 department stores, 12 John Lewis at home and shops at St Pancras station in London and Heathrow’s Terminal 2) as well as online shop johnlewis.The chain has taken a leaf out of the book of its sister retailer Waitrose – also part of the John Lewis Partnership – in choosing Oxford as a testbed.In June Waitrose launched a trial of its Unpacked system at the local Botley Road store to gauge shoppers’ reactions to packaging-free food and drink options including the use of refills, a concept that is being scrutinised by its competitors."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d9bd3885a86ad9db70b854cf9cb433b0a7157c10/218_348_3024_1815/master/3024.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a956b42d3a6a366d401ec99de4b3122e","title":"luxury goods group lvmh in tiffany takeover talks","story":"French conglomerate has held preliminary discussions with famous US jewellerThe French luxury group LVMH has made a takeover approach for Tiffany \u0026amp Co, valuing the famous US jeweller at $14.5bn (£11.3bn).The owner of Louis Vuitton said it had held preliminary discussions with Tiffany, known for its diamond engagement rings and robin-egg blue gift boxes but there was no certainty a deal would be agreed.Tiffany confirmed that it had received a proposal from LVMH to acquire it for $120 a share in cash and said it is “carefully reviewing the proposal”, although it is not in talks with the French firm at the moment.If a deal does go ahead, it would be LVMH’s biggest acquisition to date, giving the French group its first major non-fashion American brand.LVMH is the world’s largest luxury goods group, with brands including Christian Dior haute couture, Bulgari jewellery, Hublot watches and Veuve Clicquot and Krug champagne. It is owned by Europe’s richest man, Bernard Arnault.Tiffany employs more than 14,000 people, including 5,000 skilled artisans. The firm, which featured in the 1961 film Breakfast at Tiffany’s starring Audrey Hepburn, was founded in New York in 1837 by the 25-year-old Charles Lewis Tiffany and his friend John B Young, who opened a stationery and “fancy goods” emporium on Broadway. The Broadway store’s clean “American style” quickly became popular with New York women.LVMH, renowned for its handbags and designer dresses, moved into “hard luxury” – jewellery and timepieces – in 2012 when it opened a jewellery boutique in Paris. Its prices range from £180 for a pair of V stud earrings to necklaces and rings encrusted with rare diamonds, which can cost more than $1m.The Tiffany acquisition would bolster LVMH’s hard luxury arm, which also includes Fred jewellery and Tag Heuer watches. It would allow it to compete better with its Swiss rival Richemont – the company behind Cartier, Montblanc, Piaget and other brands – which sells watches, jewellery and luxury pens.They noted that in 2011, LVMH approached and acquired Bulgari in a similar manner, over the weekend. Alessandro Bogliolo, the chief executive of Tiffany, who is trying to reinvigorate the brand, was the chief operating officer of Bulgari at the time of the bid before exiting the following year.Bogliolo’s strategy at Tiffany has involved targeting new millennial consumers, especially in China, lowering the cost of jewellery and launching new items more frequently.The turnaround has been led by Reed Krakoff, the designer who transformed the struggling leather-crafter Coach into a $5bn handbag retail giant. He introduced a new range called Everyday Objects, which included a $165 pizza cutter and $425 protractors made of sterling silver. Tiffany also hired Lady Gaga, who wore its famed 128-carat yellow diamond on the red carpet at the 2019 Oscars.The Royal Bank of Canada analyst Rogerio Fujimori said: “Tiffany would become a better company and stronger competitor under the ownership of LVMH. This is illustrated by Bulgari’s tremendous success after being taken over in 2011 by LVMH.” Conversely, he said acquiring Tiffany makes strategic sense for LVMH because jewellery remains one of the most attractive categories in the luxury sector.“Hard luxury is the only subsector where LVMH is not the leader (and we know that Mr Arnault likes to be always number 1),” he said. “Jewellery is the least-crowded category in the sector, with only a handful of truly global players, and Tiffany has a proven brand equity in Asia, where it has consistently ranked among the top three jewellery brands in our Chinese consumer surveys over the years.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/be295620d28540634520bf1a6515e641b7a4dccc/231_550_6671_4002/master/6671.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=582cd80b8494a543923a530f36467fe5","title":"meet the councils quietly building a housing revolution","story":"The Stirling prize-winning Norwich estate is the tip of the iceberg: despite government cuts, local authorities are finding innovative ways to build housingA crescent of semi-detached houses stands on the edge of a playing field in Conisbrough, South Yorkshire, offering views of the rolling hills beyond. With pointed gables, big picture windows and generous back gardens dotted with trampolines, it looks like a development of aspirational “executive homes”, awaiting its gilded electric gates and four-wheel-drives.“We had people coming along trying to buy them when the hoardings came down,” says Charlotte Johnson, housing manager at Doncaster Council. They had to turn the crowds away – because these are council houses, some of the first built here for a generation. It is just one example of what many local authorities are now managing to achieve up and down the country, against the odds, after decades of central government inaction. Last week, the award for the best new building in the UK went to Goldsmith Street in Norwich, another exemplary development of council homes, marking the first time the hallowed RIBA Stirling prize has been given to social housing. The award sends a powerful message: despite government cuts, a number of bold councils are getting on and doing it for themselves.“Local authorities are doing a lot more to build housing than we generally think,” says Dr Janice Morphet, public sector planning veteran and visiting professor at University College London, who has been conducting detailed research into the different methods that councils are using to deliver homes in the absence of government grants . “Our findings suggest that around 13,000 homes were built by councils last year. Sure, it’s not the 300,000 we need, but it indicates the beginning of a slow and gentle revolution.”The 40 homes in the Conisbrough development are some of the 400-plus that Doncaster council has been building over the last few years, since the Labour council came to power in 2013, following the previous administration’s catastrophic legacy of mismanagement. It helps that the mayor, Ros Jones , is a former public sector accountant with a keen eye for detail, and that the council appointed one of those rare species: an in-house architect.“We’ve taken a similar approach to a speculative house builder, except we’re cutting out the profit,” says Matthew Clarkson, the New Zealander architect behind the new homes. “We realised that if we developed a series of standard house types, we could offer the economies of scale that a house builder would. But we’ve got more generous space standards and a higher quality specification to keep our long-term maintenance costs down.”Walking through the development, he points out numerous thoughtful details, from the deep welcoming porches with corner kitchen windows, so you feel connected to the street and can see who’s coming in, to future-proofed aspects, like convertible attics and extra large ground-floor loos that can fit a shower if needed, to the neat bin stores with planted tops. The black brick houses even have matching black mortar, giving them a sleek, monolithic feel. These are all features that few volume house builders would dream of shelling out for. “It’s not trying to be show-stopping architecture,” says Clarkson. “It’s comfortable, durable housing that fits with its surroundings.”Jason Hulme recently moved into one of the new homes with his three-year-old daughter and he can’t believe his luck. “It’s twice the size of my old private-rented place,” he says, standing in the living room where big sliding glass doors lead out to the garden, “and it’s so much lighter and warmer too.”Morphet’s research, conducted with colleague Dr Ben Clifford and funded by the Royal Town Planning Institute, shows that Doncaster and Norwich are not alone. From Bristol and Bournemouth to Wigan and Wolverhampton, their findings paint a picture of local authorities taking an interventionist approach and using a wide range of powers to deliver homes through a variety of means.It’s partly because they have no choice. While half of all local authorities no longer own council housing (having transferred their stock to housing associations long ago), the 2017 Homelessness Reduction Act imposed a legal duty on all councils to prevent and relieve homelessness. Given the scale and severity of the housing crisis – from employers struggling to recruit priced-out local workers, to the fact that homelessness has doubled in the last five years – there is growing public expectation for councils of all political shades to intervene.“We were interested to find that it’s not just Labour councils that are engaging with housing, nor is there an urban-rural ide,” says Morphet. “Some of the Conservative councils are more angry with the government than Labour.” Conservative-controlled Bournemouth, Lewes, Canterbury, South Norfolk, North Kesteven and Newark and Sherwood all cropped up in their survey as having active housing programmes, as did Lib Dem-controlled Eastbourne and Eastleigh.So how are they going about it? In the absence of central government grants, local authorities have been forced to be more creative in exploiting the various powers at their disposal. In the early 1990s, grants covered around three-quarters of the costs of building new sub-market homes, but this fell dramatically after the 2008 financial crisis. Under David Cameron and George Osborne, the 2011-15 Affordable Homes Programme gave no grant to social housing at all. There were high hopes when Theresa May scrapped the borrowing cap in 2018, which had previously constrained the amount that councils could borrow to build housing. But her triumphant rhetoric conveniently ignored the fact that fewer than half of all councils actually have any housing stock to borrow against – and those that do are very cautious, knowing that any new homes they do build would be subject to the right to buy policy. Last week the government imposed a shock rise in interest on cheap Treasury loans, further scuppering many councils’ carefully laid plans.“It’s been very difficult for councils to build proper social housing because government subsidy has vanished,” says Morphet. “So they’ve looked at all these other models to compensate for the fact they haven’t been able to do what they need to do. Councils have always had a large set of property powers, but they haven’t really thought of using them to build housing until now.” Desperate times call for desperate measures.She cites the 1963 Local Authorities Land Act, which gave councils the power to develop land the 2000 Local Government Act, which gave them the power to do anything that promotes the “wellbeing” of their communities and the 2011 Localism Act, which bestowed the “general power of competence”, giving councils the legal power to do anything a private inidual can do. None of these were housing acts per se, but their ramifications for housing have been significant, allowing local authorities to behave in a more entrepreneurial way.The results are wide-ranging. Bournemouth is building housing above many of its surface car parks, and has won planning awards for the results. Wigan is transforming tricky former mining sites with an exemplary programme of housing for older people. Exeter has one of Europe’s largest Passivhaus schemes underway, while Liverpool is developing rent-to-buy homes. Spelthorne was faced with a problematic pub-turned-strip-club in the green belt, so it decided to buy it and convert it into flats. Plymouth is building council housing for homeless veterans, involving the future residents in construction to help with their adjustment back to civilian life. They receive certificates in carpentry, plastering, bricklaying and management of site safety, making them more employable by the end of the project. The list of local innovations goes on.Colm Lacey, director of Brick by Brick, describes the company model as “a deliberate attempt to pull apart the development system and repackage the inidual elements so the council benefits”. The company borrows money from the council at commercial rates, so the interest goes back to the public purse, not a bank. “Nowhere along the way does money leak out to the private sector,” he says. Their planned developments have about three times the amount of affordable housing than schemes previously built in the borough, providing useful precedents for the council’s planners to demand these sorts of numbers from other developers.As Paul Smith puts it: “Our company allows us to set an example for other house builders, because it’s operating in a commercial way. Developers might claim they can’t provide social housing and low-energy features, but we’re showing that you can, and still make a profit.”A slightly different tactic is being used in Nottingham, where the council’s development company, Blueprint, has been building high-spec housing for sale to kickstart private-sector investment in a waterside regeneration zone. “Before we started building here, no developers were interested,” says Nottingham council’s head of regeneration and housing delivery, Mark Lowe. “Since the Blueprint schemes at Trent Basin, a whole range of sites have come forward, stimulating this new area of the city.”Waterside regeneration is one thing, but the pressing need is for more council homes. Nottingham has around 8,500 people on its housing waiting list, a figure that has doubled in the last four years. The council has been trying to keep up, building almost 600 affordable homes through its arms-length management organisation, Nottingham City Homes, with projects like the Lenton Green estate. Here, smart new low-energy brick houses with rooftop solar panels have replaced ailing 1960s towers, but it’s not nearly enough to keep up with the number of council flats being lost through the right to buy. Last year the city lost 436 homes this way, more than one a day.“It’s economic madness,” says Paul Smith. “Imagine building properties then selling them for less than you built them for. What kind of business is that? We’ve got 12,000 households on the waiting list in Bristol and 500 families in temporary accommodation. Why would you sell off the resource, at a cut price, that you desperately need more of?”Speaking to local authorities up and down the country, the right to buy recurs again and again as the biggest obstacle to delivering more council homes. In Rotherham, which is currently building 340 new homes, with 200 more set to start next year, housing manager Tom Bell is frank. “We used to have 40,000 council houses,” he says. “Now it’s around 20,500. We’re losing up to 200 homes a year. It’s incredibly damaging because you lose your best properties and your most stable tenants. It can change the dynamic of a place very quickly.”“The simple fact is we need more subsidy,” says Paul Smith. “The last 100 years of council estates was built on public subsidy, and it pays itself back. We’ve estimated a 30-year payback time, but it’s probably quicker. Every time we build more housing, it improves the finances of our business plan, because the new homes have lower repair costs. It’s financially positive for our budget to build more housing.”It is a message that Westminster must wake up to. Local authorities are ready, willing and eminently capable of building the next generation of high quality council housing. Many are already finding ways to do it, despite the constraints. They just need to have their full potentials unleashed.Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e012ecd4ed6d90775815f04c292b13d0d1fafe6d/0_194_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=72ece3e9171308deb5252f5ec2633600","title":"polls labour win general election","story":"The party should frame this campaign as a choice between more of the same and a new start, with hope of national renewalToday, Labour MPs will decide whether the country will head to the polls in December. Many are hostile towards the idea, fearing that they are facing an electoral wipe-out. Instead, they cling to the prospect of securing a second referendum as an alternative means to stopping Brexit. With the polls where they are, it is understandable that Labour MPs are fearful of facing the electorate.But this election could be far closer than is commonly imagined. The ascendancy of the SNP in Scotland, the rise of the Liberal Democrats in England, and the schism between the Tories and the DUP means that there are fewer seats in play for the major parties. Labour and the Conservatives must compete for around 540 seats with no viable coalition partners, the Tories must secure 322 seats for a majority of one. For that to occur, Labour must get no more than 218 seats – far below either its performance in either 2015 or 2017 (232 and 262 seats respectively). Conversely, if Labour can defend its current seats, it would enable an anti-Tory majority to be formed.Strategically, Labour approaches a general election with three major advantages.The first is that the deal Johnson has negotiated is truly awful for the country, leaving Britain substantially poorer according to the government’s own figures. The second is that the Tories have the record of their 10 years in power to defend – a decade during which public services and benefits have been cut, wages have stagnated and living standards have been squeezed – alongside Brexit chaos: a winter election highlights these issues, from the rise in concern about homelessness during the Christmas period to the likely winter crisis in the NHS as a result of systematic underfunding. Third, polling shows that Johnson is disliked by large parts of the electorate, and many people might be prepared to vote tactically to keep the party they dislike out of office. This opens up the route to at least some informal electoral pact between the anti-Tory parties – perhaps a loose agreement not to campaign in certain seats.Absent a settled strategy, Labour languishes behind in the polls. Its MPs focus their interventions on questions of parliamentary process and election timing rather than critiquing Johnson’s plans or articulating Labour’s policies. When politicians talk about their own priorities, not those of the voters, it should be little surprise that they are not rewarded by the electorate. This can and must change. So what would a more effective strategy look like?The public need to want to fire the Tories before deciding that they wish to hire Labour. It would be a serious error to think that Brexit can be ignored by simply talking about other issues. At the time of the 2017 poll, the chaos and perpetual crisis of the following two-and-a-half years was unimaginable. The mistake that Theresa May made was to call a general election after article 50 notification had taken place this meant most voters thought that Brexit had been sorted and that it was only a matter of time before Britain would leave the EU. No one thinks that now. Brexit will be front and centre in this election no matter how much some might wish it away.In any election, the public either want change or more of the same. In 2017, the Tory message of “strong and stable leadership” sounded like an appeal for continuity and so in what became a change election, they paid the price. Labour needs to present this campaign as a choice between more of the same with the Tories or a new start with Labour.That’s why the first phase of the Labour campaign should be to demonstrate how each strand of Johnson’s deal represents continuity with a decade of Tory austerity and misrule, heaping disaster on dismay. After 10 years of NHS cuts, the Tories now want to sell off the NHS to private corporations. After a decade without a real pay rise, the Tories plan is to strip away workers’ rights for a deal with Trump’s America where there’s no maternity pay, no sick pay, 10 days’ holiday and the ability for bosses to fire people on the spot for no reason. After a decade of putting the bankers first, their sell-out deal will mean the end of decent manufacturing jobs as the price of avoiding banking regulations. A vote for Johnson is a vote for more of the same. And to make matters worse, Johnson’s Brexit plan still includes a trapdoor to a no-deal disaster. The only way to stop a prime minister committed to a no-deal exit from the EU is to fight and win a general election that removes him from office.Next, Labour has to make, and win, the argument for a second referendum. Its message – “let the people decide” – has failed to cut through precisely because its strongest remain voices on the backbenches have focused more on timing and tactics than on bothering to prosecute the argument. More than that, the message sounds like one of exasperation: that Labour is incapable of making its own mind up, so it has outsourced the responsibility to the public. Instead, Labour needs to make a deeper argument about the kind of country we want to be: this could be extended beyond Brexit into an agenda for economic democracy and more public participation in decision-making.Labour also needs to offer the country an alternative project of national renewal. With a plan to settle Brexit for good, Labour should then offer to rebuild Britain instead. It can frame this as a 1945 moment: the chance to shape a new settlement for the decades ahead. That means a manifesto bursting with good ideas to improve the state of country and fundamental reform of the status quo. But it also needs to show how change can be meaningful: that will require translating big, bold, national policy commitments into what they could mean for every part of Britain. From the national transformation fund to the green industrial revolution, Labour has been willing to think big about the future of the country: it now has an urgent task to think small about what it might mean for each community and every household.Finally, Labour should ignore the idea of extending the franchise to 16-year-olds, which will be viewed as the naked pursuit of self-interest. It should instead argue that every voter must be offered a postal vote, given the hours of daylight and the potential for bad weather on polling day. All the evidence shows that electoral fraud is virtually non-existent and that postal voting increases participation, especially from those groups in society that are marginalised or vulnerable. Let the Tories explain why they want to inconvenience people during the cold winter months.There can be no doubt that Labour has an electoral mountain to climb. But there are reasons to believe that it can do so in this election of generational significance. The country cannot afford and should not expect anything less.• Tom Kibasi is a writer and researcher on politics and economics.

But don’t react, it only helps spread the messageYet this was hardly the gaffe it seemed. In an attention economy, the currency of every successful player is engagement. Paradoxically, the more people howled with laughter, or improvised cute putdowns, the more value the message had. The algorithms would ensure it appeared in more feeds. The words “Get Brexit done”, and the Conservative party logo, would be distributed as widely as possible. In itself, this is minor social media froth. But the Tories employ the same tactic in dealing with the mass media: getting attention with false or absurd claims which they then use to advance their narrative.Look at the party’s misleading hurrah over getting “Boris’s Brexit deal passed” by parliament. As Channel 4’s Krishnan Guru-Murthy pointed out, this was plainly not true. But it didn’t matter. The message still spread. Or consider the absurd claim made by a Tory spokesperson that, if the government didn’t get its way, it would effectively go on strike. Boris Johnson later used a television interview to quietly retreat from this position. But the work was already done: it made sure millions of people were paying attention to the Tories’ argument that they are just yearning for an election fight, if only parliament would stop dithering.As the insurgent, nationalist right has demonstrated, from Donald Trump to the Brexit party, trolling works. Forcing negative attention is still forcing attention.This is becoming so obvious as to be a truism. The far right pioneered the political use of trolling, in part as a means to distribute its ideas. As the neo-Nazi blogger Andrew Anglin once put it, the political claims of the far right had to be “couched in irony in order to be taken seriously”. Alt-lite celebrities such as Milo Yiannopoulos gained lucrative publicity from trolling, in his case by whipping up a racist mob on Twitter. But trolling soon evolved into a broader means of forcing attention.Public discussion of trolling strategies has focused on the use of troll armies and sock puppets. There is evidence that suggests Trump may have gone there. But there is a more banal sense in which trolling – broadly defined as communication intended to annoy and derail conversation – has just become ubiquitous. Nor is it particular to digital media. Nigel Farage’s notorious “shock and awful” tactic in the 2015 general election involved using television debates to engage in crude, hateful incitement, in a successful attempt to split the Tory vote. The more it hurt, the more it enraged, the more Farage benefitted. He and his allies repeated the feat with the “breaking point” billboard during the Brexit referendum. These tactics don’t change how people feel in any deep way. But they do organise attention at heightened moments of volatility, when it really matters.The sadistic element of this communications tactic is not incidental to its success. Consider the current Republican party efforts to defend Trump against impeachment proceedings. Trump is its candidate in 2020, and the GOP has made a clear decision to rally round him. The oleaginous senator Lindsey Graham, once a never-Trumper, has mutated into his most bombastic attack dog.As allegations emerged that Trump bribed the Ukrainian government with military aid in exchange for a public investigation into one of his Democratic party rivals, both Trump and Graham lobbed a rhetorical bombshell at the media. Trump claimed that he was being “lynched” and, shortly after, Graham added in his southern drawl: “This is a lynching in every sense. This is un-American.” Many social media users took the trouble to point out that lynching is very American, and it looks nothing like what is happening to Donald Trump.Just suppose, however, that Graham knows this. Suppose there was just an element of sadistic spite in the use of this metaphor. The more people who are repeating, even in outrage, the claim that Trump is being lynched, the fewer are talking about the evidence against him. And the more the “lynching” claim gets around, the more credibility it has for Trump’s supporters. The more it hurts, the better it works.Why, then, do we tend to fall for it? Particularly when the trolling so obviously and eagerly craves our outraged response? Why do we think we gain from quote-tweeting or replying to politicians and journalists who say things we find hateful? However clever, snarky or “fierce” our replies may be, we all know we’re helping to spread the very messages we want to discredit.The answer may lie in a version of what Natasha Dow Schull, in her study of machine gambling, calls “losses disguised as wins”. Gamblers, hooked on the machine, are almost certain to lose most of their money, most of the time. Yet the experience is punctuated with regular rewards, apparent wins signalled with flashing lights, noise and the clatter of change falling into the dispenser. Social media, with its notifications of likes and shares, offers similar pseudo-victories in exchange for our engagement.At a moment of great political volatility, the insurgent wing of the right has correctly surmised that the way to win in today’s political landscape is to polarise rather than seek consensus. The issue is who gets to determine what the axis of polarisation will be. If we remain so predictably susceptible to these techniques of attention-forcing, then we ensure that it is our opponents who always set the agenda.• Richard Seymour is a political activist and author his latest book is The Twittering Machine"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/09f9fd98ec847233304056134e4bac0c1190d6e3/0_224_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a52b977581e2f806e6ec4faf49e0636d","title":"wework finance workspace unicorn economic model","story":"The workspace company’s troubles are a sign that the ‘unicorn’ economic model cannot be sustainedIt happens every few years – not quite with the regularity of the seasons but with the inevitability of a natural disaster. A new company is founded on the basis of a new and seemingly ingenious concept, and then rocket-fuelled by growth-boosting investor capital. It briefly burns bright and then implodes, collapsing under the weight of its own balance sheet.The latest tech financial calamity is WeWork, an office space and “workplace solutions” operator that is now shrinking rapidly, after a planned initial public offering (IPO) was scrapped when potential investors rejected its absurd $20bn (£15.5bn) valuation. WeWork’s collapse is a business-school study in the excesses of private capital in an unregulated market that fetishises the wealth-creating genius of the lone pioneer.WeWork’s strategy wasn’t simply to fulfil a practical need: its aim was market domination, to be achieved by undercutting its competitors in a race to the bottom, using investor capital as oxygen to sustain losses while other serviced office-space providers ran out of breath and expired. The idea was then to leverage its reach to name its terms and prices. But despite investors’ indulgence of loss-making ventures that promise enormous future profits, WeWork tested that tolerance with a loss of $219,000 (£171,000) every hour while failing to reach ubiquity fast enough. What WeWork was offering – workspaces and hot desks for the urban freelance – was not, to use the jargon of such companies’ own marketing, sufficiently “game changing”.Adam Neumann, WeWork’s now ejected founder, is making off with a $1.7bn reward for failing to achieve his vision and appearing to lose investors eye-watering sums of money. As with most tales of financial hubris and reckless over-expansion, the architect absconds with the spoils while the company’s employees pay the price. About 4,000 WeWorkers are expected to be fired. Their new chairman told them they were “taking one for the team” – one of the lesser-known features of the market’s invisible hand.Neumann was a unicorn founder out of central casting. He is a long-haired messianic hyper-connected bro, whose rather basic business idea was propped up by a talent for raising money and the networks needed to do so. (His wife, Rebekah, is Gwyneth Paltrow’s cousin.) But the crisis at WeWork isn’t just one more bursting-bubble tale fronted by another Steve Jobs wannabe: it exemplifies the increasing volatility of the economic model that inflated the unicorns of the past. And it involves three trends that underpin the growth of enterprises looking to make money by catering to the modern workforce: the expansion of the gig economy, the relatively low cost of commercial real estate, and the increase in financial flows from sovereign investors in search of political capital.What sets WeWork apart is that it is a company built on the rubble of the financial crisis. Its customers are largely drawn from the precariat – workers who no longer expect to find permanent jobs and so instead become full-time gig-economy labourers. The financial crash, combined with the sophistication of remote working solutions, meant that employers were able to create two tiers of labour: full time with full benefits for their most profitable workers and task-specific gig contracts, without pension or paid leave, for everyone else. Even the cost of the physical space, the ground rent required to house employees, can now be passed on to workers, who pay to rent their own desks in co-working spaces.This is where WeWork comes into the picture: providing offices to house these satellite employees, and giving them a sense of belonging in their satellite workplace. WeWork buildings have canteens, free coffee stations, an engineered sense of camaraderie and community. Like the Japanese rent-a-family industry, WeWork will sell you the love and warmth of an employer when your real employer is absent, or short of affection.The aftermath of the financial crisis also made it easy for WeWork to buy and lease cheap commercial property as a result of a real-estate market crash followed by low interest rates – enabling it to become the largest private-sector tenant in New York and London. Its unravelling is already rattling property markets in the US, the UK and Ireland.Investments that pumped up WeWork embodied another post-crisis trend – financial adventurism as a geopolitical tool. WeWork’s largest backer, Softbank’s Vision Fund, is largely funded by money from Saudi Arabia and Abu Dhabi. This is what analysts call dumb money: huge investments in high-profile tech companies such as Uber, Slack and DoorDash, with the aim of multiplying political clout rather than financial returns, at a time when economic power is shifting from Wall Street to Silicon Valley. Saudi investments buy more than allies in Washington: lavishing money on Silicon Valley helps crown prince Mohammed bin Salman to land soft interviews in the western press and cosy chats with the titans of tech.The WeWork debacle should be an indictment of the character of contemporary finance capitalism – but it is almost certain to become another unremarkable instalment in the folklore of modern business, another natural disaster that wrecked thousands of lives and careers before the market moved on to its next unicorn. Nothing will change, and there will be no introspection. And it will happen again soon, because late capitalism is sustained by the myth that spectacular implosions like this one are acts of God – when they are entirely man-made."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9991057f433fe7249aaafe49941c75bd8329ebd5/15_1030_2800_1680/master/2800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4516d587ba0d736c588fc4f9f7fa2a54","title":"400m for school buildings is too little too late says union","story":"Academies and sixth form colleges receiving cash need to show executive pay restraintThe government has announced £400m investment to repair school and college buildings in England, but the money will only be available to academies that can demonstrate pay restraint on executive salaries.Academies and sixth form colleges have been invited to bid for a share of the money which can be used to replace roofs, upgrade sports halls or science labs, and deal with general wear and tear in ageing school buildings.But as schools continue to struggle to balance their budgets in the face of funding cuts, ministers are concerned that too many executives in multi-academy trusts are still paying themselves excessive salaries.Now the government has warned that any trusts where a single executive is paid more than £150,000, or there are two employees taking home in excess of £100,000 each, will be penalised in the case of an application for building repair money, and an award will be less likely.Since 2017, the government has challenged 278 academy trusts over excessive chief executive pay, but the Department for Education confirmed that fewer than a fifth (51 in total) have reduced top salaries as a result.Teaching unions condemned the money available as woefully inadequate. In 2017, the National Audit Office calculated that it would cost £6.7bn to return England’s schools to a satisfactory condition or better.Two years on the cost is likely to be even higher, said Mary Bousted, joint general secretary of the National Education Union. “This is simply far too little, far too late and it is unacceptable that, in the 21st century, so many children and young people go to schools which have Victorian conditions.”Bousted said government attempts to link funding to pay restraint only underlined ministers’ failure to address excessive pay in the academy sector. Although minsters may preach pay restraint, they have no levers to pull to make it happen, she said.The annual condition improvement fund (CIF) is open to smaller academy trusts and sixth form colleges to fund building repairs and improvements. It also pays for a small proportion of expansion projects, for institutions rated good or outstanding by Ofsted. It is one of a number of streams of capital funding available to different types of schools.The CIF announcement was made days before the deadline for parents to apply for a secondary school place for their child this Thursday. Councils have warned of a looming crisis as a population bulge moves from primary into secondary, increasing demand for places.Gavin Williamson, education secretary, said: “This government is determined to give all children the best possible education, but as well as great teachers, we want all pupils to learn in classrooms that enable them to gain the knowledge and skills they need for success.”The DfE said bids for CIF funding would be assessed on a points-based criteria. Applicants will get a four-point deduction if they pay excessive executive salaries or have not submitted a financial improvement plan. An extra point will be available to those that have signed-up to the most recent government funding agreement.Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said any additional funding for education was welcome, but dismissed the latest announcement as “hype” rather than proper investment.“The various strings attached – such as linking proposed funding to type of institution rather than to places of greatest local need – is deeply misguided, as is making allocations dependent on some assumed notion of inidual pay restraint.“The NAO couldn’t be clearer about the woeful neglect of too many of Britain’s schools and colleges. This announcement shows a failure by government both to grasp the urgency of the issue and the need to put fairness before ideology in tackling it”.School funding is likely to be a key battlefield in a general election. Boris Johnson’s government has announced plans to put more money into schools, starting in 2020-21 and continuing until 2022-23, when it says an additional £7bn will be spent. Unions say the extra money is not enough to reverse the cuts and the funding crisis is far from over."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bc0f8385e421753efcece36d2c66a6785a9bc921/0_127_4612_2767/master/4612.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=71500187cb82888907dbe4bc03baa38e","title":"guardian editors climate emergency pledge","story":"Editors from across the  explain how they are putting the climate emergency front and centreThe climate crisis is a story that reaches every corner of the world and on the international news desk our team of correspondents report on it from around the globe.For many readers, it is something they experience to varying degrees of intensity at first hand – a hotter summer, an earlier spring, floods in autumn – but by linking up those experiences, we are able to show how interconnected this crisis is.In the past few months we have covered stories ranging from the record-breaking European heatwave, where temperatures of over 45C were recorded in France for the first time, a heatwave and drought in India, where thousands abandoned their homes, and the unprecedented Arctic wildfires that could be seen from space.Such events are not just “weather”, however, and we follow their impact: the buckling European road and rail infrastructure not suitable for the new climate era, the desperate search for water in Chennai and the Greenland residents traumatised by the climate emergency as life becomes more precarious and social problems such as alcoholism intensify.In Italy, the Planpincieux glacier in the Mont Blanc massif is changing so rapidly that avalanches and debris falls have led to deaths and evacuations, leaving residents in the town of Courmayeur fearing how much longer it will hold.Our reporters have also travelled to where governments and iniduals are making it worse. Latin American correspondent Tom Philips took a 2,000km journey through the Amazon to see the new age of wrecking ushered in by Brazil’s president, Jair Bolsonaro, where the environmental agency is being dismantled and gold seekers and soy farmers anticipate an economic boom from deforestation.There are also those attempting to make it better. On 1 September 2018 we published an interview from Stockholm with a 15-year-old who just two weeks earlier, after Sweden’s hottest ever summer, had gone on strike from school in protest at the lack of action by politicians on the climate crisis. Now much better known, thanks in part to articles like this, Greta Thunberg’s solo protest has since become a global movement.Climate can also lie at the root of other stories. Failed harvests and rising food prices can often be the final straw that triggers political upheaval, in recent years notably the Arab spring, but we are now seeing in real time how the climate emergency is affecting migration patterns. As Donald Trump attempted to close the US border to Central American migrants, in some cases separating children from their parents, we spoke to those in Guatemala who after a decade of intense droughts and late rains have seen crops fail and wages fall one too many times. “I have to find a way to travel north, or else my children will suffer even more,” subsistence farmer Esteban Gutiérrez told reporter Nina Lakhani.Business and economics are right at the centre of the climate emergency. Companies are among the biggest polluters in the world – and are key to meeting the Paris agreement’s target of limiting global warming to 1.5C.From giant fossil fuel companies to agricultural and food businesses, retailers, airlines and car manufacturers – all must make big changes, for the sake of the planet, the global economy and their own future sustainability, providing goods and services and employment.These are huge questions, and  readers know there are no easy answers. So we will nurture the debate on what a sustainable economy looks like.Our economics writers are questioning whether traditional capitalism, which aims for perpetual growth, can ever deal with the huge challenges of climate emergency, or whether a new slow-capitalism or green growth – which does not pursue profit at all costs – must come.We are reporting on the changes being made by corporate executives – and alerting readers to those who fall short.Writing in the  earlier this year, the governors of the Bank of England and Bank of France – Mark Carney and François Villeroy de Galhau – underlined the importance of change. “If some companies and industries fail to adjust to this new world, they will fail to exist,” they said.Without action, the climate emergency poses the risk of huge losses for insurance companies as a result of catastrophic weather-related events. Last year’s Californian wildfires, for instance – the worst in the state’s history – cost insurers more than $12bn. Banks that have lent vast sums to fossil fuel companies could be left with mammoth losses if those investments decline in value and become “stranded assets”. The Bank of England has warned that as much as $20tn of assets could be wiped out by climate change if the problem is not addressed.Many companies are making changes. Global businesses including Nestle and L’Oreal have committed to reducing their carbon emissions to zero. We will track and report on their progress.We are reporting on climate crisis initiatives, and our journalists will ask if they go far enough. Last week we reported that British Airways is to offset all emissions from domestic flights from next year, and questioned whether offsetting can ever be the answer.Our reporters will expose companies that are not walking the talk. Last month Amazon announced a series of initiatives, from putting 100,000 electric vans on the road to handle its deliveries to reforestation projects. But, as our reporters also revealed recently, Amazon has also recently introduced plastic packaging that cannot be recycled in the UK.Most corporate bosses know they have to make changes. But progress is nowhere near fast enough. Oil companies are still seeking new oilfields. Giant new coalmines – like Indian billionaire Gautam Adani’s Carmichael coalmine in Queensland – are still being developed. Airbus recently predicted that the number of aircraft in the sky would double in the next 20 years.Investment groups that manage pension funds around the world can exert pressure on companies to clean up their businesses. Legal \u0026amp General, Europe’s second biggest fund manager, admitted earlier this year: “The effects of climate change will soon be irreversible. This will affect economies, politics and, as a result, our clients’ assets all around the world. We all need to move faster.”However, not every investment group is using its muscle – and we are calling them out. BlackRock, the world’s biggest investment manager, with $6tn under its management, says climate change is a big risk to the value of its investments. But it remains at the heart of fossil fuel investing and, as we reported, its chief executive, Larry Fink, still insists that BlackRock’s job is to make a profit for investors. He added: “Our personal views on environmental or social issues don’t matter.”They do matter, and our reporters are now treating the climate crisis as the default setting for how they approach business reporting.Fashion is about the zeitgeist, and climate change is the mostimportant issue of our age. And we know that our readers really *do* care. (Sorry, Melania.) So more than ever before, we want to put sustainability front and centre of our fashion coverage.We aren’t perfect and we don’t pretend to have all the answers. Wewill continue to listen to a wide range of voices – our readersparamount amongst those – to guide us. But we do know that we want to talk about sustainability how we have always talked about fashion – in a way that includes everyone in the conversation, whatever their age, budget, gender or background.We have always championed ethical fashion brands, but now we want to go further. The future of our planet isn’t a niche interest. We aim to continue creating fashion content that is accessible and appealing, desirable and democratic – but now with sustainability as a fundamental metric. We want to inspire our audience to enjoy fashion while being mindful of the impact on the planet.What does that look like? We try wherever we can to include vintagepieces in shoots and gift guides. When we report from London fashion week we talk to the Extinction Rebellion activists outside the shows, as well as having backstage chats with the designers. We championed Secondhand September and a year ago we updated my column in Weekend magazine so that you now see me wearing old clothes from my own wardrobe, and vintage pieces, alongside new clothes. This party season we will be reporting the best places to rent your dress, or source it pre-worn, rather than buy it.None of this means compromising on bringing you compelling, gorgeous, original fashion content. We are passionate about the latest fashion – and about the future of our planet, too.There’s an obvious connection between food and the climate emergency. Look at the deforestation of the Amazon to provide grazing for cattle and soy to feed it. But wherever cows are raised, they generate atmosphere-heating methane. As the global human population grows, it’s clear that we need to think about how to feed it, how to use land and what impact our choices have.Meat eating and animal farming have seized the headlines and the public’s focus. There are many reasons why veganism – or at least flexitarianism – is growing fast and sustainability is one of them.It’s important to talk about all this but what people eat is always going to be a highly personal decision. In many countries where we have the luxury of food options, we are in anxious, uncertain, ided times. Food is joyful. It brings people together – families, friends, communities and strangers – and reminds us both of our uniqueness and of what we have in common. It’s also a time when it’s difficult to know who to believe and to trust. I hope people can be sure of the ."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/afe269d9ec06740a551d25fa8d8e07c902892cd2/0_260_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=08d6b0d86d0b03a66ff9f5ee4bdec8e2","title":"guardian climate pledge 2019 images pictures guidelines","story":" picture editor Fiona Shields explains why we are going to be using fewer polar bears and more people to illustrate our coverage of the climate emergency At the  we want to ensure that the images we publish accurately and appropriately convey the climate crisis that we face. Following discussions among editors about how we could change the language we use in our coverage of environmental issues, our attention then turned to images. We have been working across the organisation to better understand how we aim to visually communicate the impact the climate emergency is having across the world.Our goal is to provide guidelines for anyone working with images at the . We are also asking the agencies and photographers we work with to provide images that are appropriate to the changing narrative.The concern over how best to depict the climate emergency led us to seek advice from the research organisation Climate Visuals, who have found that “images that define climate change shape the way it is understood and acted upon”.It was important to address our own use of images and understand the processes that lead to image selection for our environmental and weather stories. When given a story, a picture editor or subeditor may have a short time to choose an image from our database, which is why the availability and prominence of climate crisis photography is a key element in the process. It can also be difficult for photographers to capture images that reflect global heating, weather patterns and wildlife extinction, especially when trying to depict what cannot always be seen.We know, from years of experience, that people love polar bears and pandas, so it is easy to see how these appealing creatures have become the emblems for the topics of endangered species and what we previously termed as global warming. Often, when signalling environmental stories to our readers, selecting an image of a polar bear on melting ice has been the obvious – though not necessarily appropriate – choice. These images tell a certain story about the climate crisis but can seem remote and abstract – a problem that is not a human one, nor one that is particularly urgent.So it made sense when we heard that research conducted by the team at Climate Visuals has shown that people respond to human pictures and stories. Images that show emotion and pictures of real situations make the story relevant to the inidual. Rather than choosing, say, an image of a smoke stack pumping out pollution or a forest on fire, such as this: … we should consider showing the direct impact of environmental issues on people’s daily lives as well as trying to indicate the scale of the impact, such as these:In the UK, the weather is a national preoccupation and as such a subject of tradition for British newspapers. People enjoying a sunny holiday weekend, or a fresh fall of snow at home or abroad can deliver some delightful and beautiful images:But as we have reported, the science tells us a much more sinister story of regular heatwaves and unseasonal weather being a defining indicator of the climate crisis. So, although scenes of children playing in fountains and everyone racing to the beach can be uplifting and irresistible, we have to be mindful of the tone of our journalism. This summer, the British media published dramatic headlines issuing climate warnings and covered in detail the negative impact of the crisis, but the images were typically of people taking pleasure in the environment. The contradiction in messaging, between the headlines and imagery, can undermine the effect of the reporting and how we perceive the risks.In June this year we published a picture gallery on the heatwave across Europe. In its original form, this was of a lighter tone, but we felt on reflection this was wrong and disregarded the current context, so we amended the publication to include images that covered a range of human experience of the extraordinary temperatures.The photographer Brook Mitchell made an impactful series about the drought in Australia affecting families in New South Wales, which we published as a photo essay in July. The environmental scenes of the scorched landscape were striking, as were the suffering animals, but the portraits and stories of the people battling the catastrophe really anchored the piece and drove the level of engagement.It is an example of how, as picture editors and photographers, we are having to think again about finding the right focus. Many of the impacts to communities, bioersity, agriculture, water and food supply represent the escalating crisis our planet faces, yet visually they can be far more challenging to depict. We need new imagery for new narratives. This can be challenging in a fast-paced newsroom but it is important to be nuanced and creative with search terms to unearth photography beyond the usual keywords of climate change, heatwave and floods.As our stories make a journey from their initial point of publication through the various networks of social media we also have to be mindful of how the image is connected to the headline. We have to consider that the two must work together to allow the reader to make a broad sense of the article often simply at a glance. Relatable images that are not overly abstract have become a good choice.However, in its simplest form, getting the emotional tone of imagery in line with the issue is critical, rather than the visual overload of society universally having fun in the sun. We hope that if we keep having these conversations, we will be able to have even more of an impact with our climate coverage, and others will follow suit.If you are a journalist, a photographer or work with other news organisations depicting the climate crisis, please contact membershipeditorial@ to join our conversation."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3858d96ea129929c09d1781ed401f522605d3b80/218_2651_3014_1809/master/3014.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=32a34a700de9e45906839302b85b17e9","title":"have you spotted any new buds or flowers in october","story":"If you have seen any plants flowering unusually this month, we would like to see your photosAccording to former  environment correspondent Paul Brown, “new research published in Geophysical Research letters show that so-called “cold” days in European winters are on average 3C warmer than 70 years ago”.Some people have reported seeing new flower buds in the unseasonal temperatures, leading to worries the flowers will be killed by the winter weather and may not bloom again in spring.If you have seen any plants with new buds or flowers appearing we would like to hear from you.When did you first see them and do you have any concerns about what it might mean for them come spring?

Before you roll your eyes at what probably sounds like heavyweight food-writer virtue signalling, I should admit that it is, but not only. My wish to have a 3kg book spreadeagled at all times is because, yes, it is the best food reference ever to appear in the English language – a 900-page A-Z looking at a multiplicity of foodstuffs, also food literature, science, history and food habits from all over the world – but also because it is a delightful book.It’s a serious work, astonishing in its breadth and detail, but it doesn’t take itself too seriously. This is thanks to Davidson, the mastermind of this companionable matrix and author of a vast number of the entries. He is a brilliant writer – sharp, exacting, graceful – but also a humorous one. In a revised edition of the companion, Tom Jaine describes the impish humour that pervades Davidson’s work: the paradox of pink blancmange, Goan food-ways, why the London stock exchange is like gorgonzola, how oncom is fermented in Indonesia, why Chinese mooncakes caused a revolution – every entry, even the most detailed and dense, seems to wriggle with the delight of it all.Not having a huge walnut desk, I need to pull the 3kg from its position wedged between my little desk and the kitchen cupboard every time I need it, which is often. Today, it’s for cottage pie, a savoury dish of minced beef (traditionally from leftover roast, but also fresh mince) topped with mashed potato, which, like its twin, shepherd’s pie, “conjures up visions of shepherds long ago eating this simple fare, but the name does not seem to have been used until the 1870s when mincing machines were first used”. The entry goes on to quote Jane Grigson and how, with the first mincing machines, “prisons, schools, and seaside boarding-house cooks acquired a new weapon to distress their victims”. Happily, I have never been distressed by cottage pie: I have always enjoyed the delicious, easy and inexpensive versions the entry goes on to describe, even at school, when it was often followed by steamed pudding with pink custard, which I loved without even a spoonful of irony.So to the recipe – one that belongs to my family life.While the heavyweight was out, I looked up the ingredients in today’s recipe: the journey of carrots from Afghanistan to Europe in the middle ages how wild celery from temperate Europe and Asia was tamed and cultivated the etymology of onion. Another great thing about this book is how it continually reminds us of the evolution of ingredients in the hands of global gardeners, as Massimo Montanari writes: “Ingredients and alimentary traditions change with time, becoming modified as they come into contact with other traditions.”I am British and European, so it feels right that, for this British produce issue (and what brilliant British produce there is), I have made a recipe from my English childhood, with ingredients bought and cooked at home, in Rome.The most important part of the recipe is roughing up the surface with a fork, which I am now going to refer to as gadrooning.100g rindless streaky bacon3 tbsp lard, dripping, butter or other suitable fat for frying1 onion, peeled and diced1 small leek, trimmed and diced1 carrot, peeled and diced2 sticks of celery, diced1 bay leafSalt and pepper400g minced beef1 tsp Marmite (optional)300ml light stock1kg potatoes, peeledButterWhole milkIn a heavy-based pan over a medium low heat, gently fry the bacon in the fat.

Add the Marmite (if using) and pour over the stock. Leave to simmer for an hour, by which point it should be rich and thick with just a little liquid.Meanwhile, boil the potatoes in well-salted water until tender. Drain, then mash with butter and milk, seasoning to taste.Put the mince in the bottom of a Pyrex or porcelain oven-proof dish, then spoon over the mash and fork it into place, creating rough peaks on the top.Bake on the top shelf of an oven heated to 190C (170C fan)gas 5 for 25 minutes, until the edges are bobbing and the top is golden."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0a75082955b937fa9366cc04adc7250306625a9b/0_37_5730_3438/master/5730.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2e5be4272bc3ab47d807578534ac280b","title":"share your worst halloween pumpkin carvings","story":"We’d like to see your worst Halloween pumpkin carvings and find out what happened to them.

However, imagine yourself on a French mountainside and it is that thoroughly irresistible pain perdu that probably gave the US its inspiration. For our British issue, I’ve made a version with new-season squashes, which are all over farmers’ markets right now. The squash gives the caramel a wonderful flavour and tames its sweetness.The sweet-savoury flavour of pumpkin softens the dark, salted caramel and gives it a gorgeous deep shade of tangerine.½ small pumpkin or squash200g caster sugar50g butter100ml double cream3-4 tbsp dark rum or aged tequila½ lemonSaltFor the french toast4 eggs175ml whole milk6 slices white bread75g butterVanilla ice-cream, cream or yoghurt, to servePeel and cut the squash into equal 3-5cm chunks. Put in a steamer and cook for about 25 minutes, until tender to the point of a sharp knife. Remove the pan from heat and leave the squash uncovered to steam-dry.To make the caramel, put the sugar in a heavy-based pan and pour over four tablespoons of water. Set over a medium heat and keep an eye on it as the sugar melts and turns a deep, dark caramel colour, and the water evaporates. Just before it starts smoking, quickly add the butter, cream and rum, and stir vigorously until you have a smooth, silky caramel.Put 350g squash flesh into a bowl, pour over the caramel and . Use a stick blender to whizz until you have a smooth sauce. Taste, season with a little lemon juice and a few pinches of salt, and keep warm.To make the french toast, whisk together the eggs and milk, submerge the bread in the mix and leave for 10-15 minutes.Heat a large frying pan over a medium heat. Add one to two tablespoons of the butter and, once hot, fry one to two slices of the bread at a time, turning once the bottom is golden – three to four minutes. Set aside on a warm plate and repeat until all the toast is done. Dollop over scoops of the pumpkin caramel, season with a scrunch of sea salt, then serve with vanilla ice-cream, thick cream or Greek yoghurt.There is usually some leftover puree, so stir it through Greek yoghurt for breakfast with a touch of granola. Leftover pumpkin is delicious in a fiery Thai curry, and would make a lovely autumnal soup."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1e8f21c759b7c88918b63ee6d166a2ab78147a3f/0_0_4000_2399/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=00a4db8f8fdf41ed7aa31906adc1776a","title":"grassroots womens football booming uk lack pitches","story":"The Women’s World Cup has attracted thousands of new players but space to play is at a premiumColin Lowe, a football coach in Manchester, often receives calls from women in the area keen to join his new grassroots team. But when one woman called last week to ask where the team trained, he couldn’t give an exact answer. “I said to her: I’ll ring you back next week and let you know where we’re playing, because we’re struggling to find places to play.’”Lowe’s problem is one affecting grassroots women’s football teams across the country. The number of girls and women taking up the sport has skyrocketed since the Women’s World Cup, with 605 new girls’ youth teams and 260 new women’s clubs registered to play this season. But grassroots teams say the lack of affordable and accessible pitches has made it a struggle to establish themselves or grow to meet increasing demand.Last year, Lowe, the 49-year-old chairman and coach of Longford Park, invited mothers who were standing on the sidelines and cheering their children on to try out for a women’s team. Word and enthusiasm for the new team quickly spread and Longford Park Ladies now have 40 players. While it was relatively easy to find players, finding a space for the team to train has been a nightmare.Lowe said teams such as his have to settle for playing on hockey pitches for matches and training, much to his dismay. “There’s no control with the football … And when it rains, you haven’t got a chance. There’s no point in being there. It’s daft. It’s not football is it?” he said.Naomi Short, 41, who helps coach a girls’ team and set up a women’s team in Trafford, said the only slot left for her new team to train on the local pitch was between 9.15pm and 10.15pm on a weeknight because more established teams block-book pitch space for weeks at a time. “I’ve played football since I was five years old and there is so much more available today than there was then, but the pitches do get booked out far too quickly and we have a lot of mums on our team who can’t train at odd hours,” she said.Goal Diggers, one of London’s biggest grassroots football teams open to women and non-binary players, said they have to cap training at a local school to 60 players and spaces can go within minutes. Fleur Cousens, who founded the team four years ago, said she has been looking for bigger pitch space in Hackney and Islington for three years, but the search has become more desperate over the past few months.“Every night of the week there’s a men’s 11-a-side league that dominates those spaces and that’s 22 men using it,” Cousens said. “I think the fact the space is only being used by men needs to change … it makes it seem those spaces are masculine.”Ian Bruce, the chairman of AFC Stoke Newington in north London, said in general there were not enough green spaces to play football, affecting new girls’ and boys’ teams as well as disability teams. “It’s a huge problem in a city like London and we need to start asking how to better distribute pieces of land that can be used to better serve the community,” he said.Cousens accepts that while the booking systems are not trying to be discriminatory, they have to account for the fact that from 1921 to 1971, women were banned from playing on Football Association pitches and have long been widely discouraged from taking part in the sport. “We’re playing catch-up on space that has been taken by men,” she said.She called on councils to implement fundamental changes to their booking systems for pitch space, such as having one night in the week that is only open to women’s groups. As for the FA, a spokesperson said it was aware of issues relating to pitch allocation and was working with the Football Foundation “to deliver approximately 400 new pitches over the next three years”.Despite the difficulties of getting on a pitch, Christina Philippou, 37, a university lecturer, said she had been taken aback by the interest in the local women’s football team she set up in Guildford, Surrey. “Despite the fact it’s a pretty crap slot, training on a Sunday evening, it’s been amazing how many people continue to turn up. I’ve been really surprised by the demand, but there seems to be a gap in the market there,” she said.Nicky Ellison, an adult careers adviser, said the lack of pitch space meant she had an uphill battle in developing women’s football in Bournemouth, Dorset. “I’m going to have to start my own five-a-side league, but before we even get to that point, just training on a normal pitch is impossible,” she said. The team she set up plays at the local YMCA and though the facilities are not big enough, it is all they can afford.Ellison is determined to set up an accessible and affordable league despite the challenges, saying that she has seen women transform through playing with the team. “I think sometimes women focus on their families and other supporting other people, and they don’t do something for themselves, and I think we can do more to encourage that in this country,” she said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/95aa338a3b3bd928ee6347c3888c65131fd64215/0_67_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cde8a681508a5d98ff7563f23de4d979","title":"southampton players donate wages to charity after leicester mauling","story":"Southampton’s players and coaching staff will each donate one day’s wages to the Saints Foundation, the club have announced,after Friday night’s 9-0 home humiliation to Leicester which equalled the record score in Premier League history.The club said in a statement: “Southampton Football Club’s first-team players and coaching staff have announced they will be donating their wages from last Friday to Saints Foundation.“The squad has been in at Staplewood Campus throughout the weekend, working on putting things right for the club’s supporters.“As the first step towards that, the group has decided that they wish to donate their wages from the day of the Leicester game to Saints Foundation, in order to help the vital work that is conducted by the charity.”The Saints Foundation works with children, young people and at-risk adults in the Southampton area to develop their potential and transform lives.Southampton are currently bracing themselves for two consecutive trips to face Manchester City within the next six days, in the Carabao Cup on Tuesday and then in the Premier League on Saturday."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/85019e47e1d58039bf287599d736c741d20f9be8/0_0_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ff1aa4fe4d8c1cc7f4aa11b48e27c283","title":"womens super league talking points from the weekends action","story":"City looked out of ideas without Walsh, Graham was lethal for Spurs and has the tide turned for struggling Birmingham?The battle of the champions and last season’s runners-up was always going to be a tight affair and the game was won in midfield, where the Gunners were slick operators. Out of possession they were organised, compact and forced errors from Manchester City. With Lia Wälti pulling the strings in her holding role, Jordan Nobbs and Kim Little were able to add the creative touches up ahead of her and it was a crisp pass slipped through to Vivianne Miedema from Little that provided the chance for the match-winning goal. It was Miedema’s first in four games against City, who badly missed their midfield controller Keira Walsh. Walsh was serving the first game of a three-match suspension and without her they were devoid of ideas. It was City’s first defeat of the season, having won their first four games before it. Nick Cushing will have to find a way to replace Walsh’s ingenuity in midfield if they hope to bounce back strongly. The only real positive was the Ballon d’Or nominee Ellen White making her City debut after returning from injury.Considering West Ham only joined the WSL at the beginning of last season, the work manager Matt Beard has done in a short space of time is incredible. Their squad has 16 different nationalities and it is possible to hear eight languages being spoken by them on a matchday. But Beard has found a way to gel the cosmopolitan group together and foster a strong team spirit. This was in evidence in the first 60 minutes against Chelsea, when the Hammers went toe-to-toe with Emma Hayes’s supremely talented side before eventually taking the lead. The Canadian substitute, Adriana Leon, scored with her first touch after being summoned from the bench by Beard.This woke Chelsea up and Hayes must be grateful that Wales international Sophie Ingle appears to be peaking early in the season. She is high on confidence and this showed as she scored her second goal of the campaign to bring Chelsea level having not found the net for the club before this season. Having been provider for the first, Ji So-yun fired home a goal of the season contender for Chelsea’s second. Drew Spence got their third in injury time to confirm a win that takes Chelsea top. A fearless West Ham side can take heart from a valiant performance that would have been too much for lesser sides, though.Chloe Kelly showed why she recently earned an England call-up as well as being voted WSL Player of the Month for September with another superbly taken goal to lift her clear at the top of the league’s goalscoring charts. For all that Brighton have struggled this season, they were well-organised and offered resistance up until the 57th minute, when Kelly’s lightning quick stepover and finish gave the Toffees’ the platform to go on and win comfortably. Having lost their previous two games, Everton are back in form and a first senior goal for Esme Morgan, the young defender on loan from Manchester City, capped off a good day at the office for Willie Kirk’s side.A first win of the season for Birmingham condemned Liverpool to the bottom of the table in what already looked like an early relegation battle. Blues manager Marta Tejedor had big shoes to fill when she came in nearly a year ago to replace Marc Skinner, who was snapped up by Orlando Pride. She has implemented her style with limited success until now but the Blues were on top throughout this game, controlling possession and peppering Liverpool’s goal with 16 shots. There was a lovely moment for Kerys Harrop, who scored with a towering header from 15 yards out, to set her side on their way to victory on her 130th WSL appearance (a club record). Lucy Staniforth tapped in late on to secure Birmingham’s first points of the season. The only positives for Liverpool were the brave defensive display of Sophie Bradley-Auckland and bright spark Rinsola Babajide in attack. Avoiding relegation would be a success for either team. Maybe the tide is finally turning for Birmingham.I tipped newly-promoted Spurs to struggle this season but they’ve been great to watch and I’m happy to admit that it looks like I was wrong. They’re so strong in attack and it’s hard to fathom why Kit Graham had not scored in the league until Sunday’s game against Bristol City. She was lethal at the Stoke Gifford Stadium. Two sublime long-range strikes in two second-half minutes turned the game on its head and lifted Spurs up into sixth. If Graham can stay in top form, Tottenham should be able to enjoy a respectable debut season in the top flight.Having lost their opening two games, newly-promoted Manchester United have bounced back with three wins on the spin. Casey Stoney has obviously gone to work on the training ground since the early-season defeats and drilled the midfield and defence to make her side one of the ision’s toughest to break down. They also have well-rehearsed patterns of play on the left, where Leah Galton often finds space with clever diagonal runs. She was instrumental in United’s success against a seasoned Reading side on Sunday, with a break down the left and a dangerous delivery towards the back post finding Kirsty Hanson, who finished smartly after a late surge into the box. Dutch World Cup finalist Jackie Grownen provided the second, springing a sharp counter-attack with a defence-splitting pass to free Jess Sigsworth, in a central role, whose smart finish sealed three points that lifted United up into fourth."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/81e57b520e828a3fa108935d4e14f610c5e47ec0/0_0_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5ed3aba5d72169a6e58fa3d9f521b9ea","title":"premier league 10 talking points from the weekends action","story":"Arsenal fans turn toxic, Ralph Hasenhüttl faces a daunting week and Chelsea are no longer a one-man bandThere can be little doubt that Granit Xhaka has underwhelmed since his big-money move from Borussia Mönchengladbach three summers ago, failing to provide either the midfield bite or the drive that has been perennially lacking in Arsenal’s post-Vieira era. He has not, however, lacked effort or interest, no matter how low his performances have dipped and you wonder what exactly those home fans who booed the captain as he left the field in the second half were thinking. Certainly Arsenal’s supporters, who pay through the nose, deserve better and are entitled to vent their frustrations. But to single out an underperforming player for abuse is cruel, toxic and patently self-defeating. Xhaka could be seen mouthing a four-letter response and, for once after an Arsenal implosion, the sympathy should be with the player and not the fans. Alex HessTrent Alexander-Arnold should be renamed Trent Alexander-Bruyne. The quality and range of his passes – it would be an insult to many of them to call them crosses – is quite staggering for a 21‑year‑old, and for much of the game against Spurs he was Liverpool’s biggest threat. It feels a bit churlish, giving the brilliance of his attacking, to acknowledge his occasionally immature defending. But that’s what opposition managers will be doing because it’s the closest thing Liverpool have to a defensive weakness. Most of Spurs’ chances came down Alexander-Arnold’s side, where Son Heung-min was positioned by Mauricio Pochettino. Alexander-Arnold’s positioning and decision-making are sometimes awry. Then again, you can say that of most defenders of his age. If his attacking play didn’t have the poise of a world-class player in his prime, maybe we wouldn’t expect as much of him defensively. Rob SmythTen games into the season, seven points on the board, and another match when opponents sliced through them, Norwich City look like prime candidates for relegation. Daniel Farke was correct in his assessment that his team were short of the physical commitment to make this a contest. What he didn’t say was that they also lacked the pace to counterattack and the poise to keep possession, a quality that was supposed to be their forte. Opponents have worked out how to neutralise Norwich and Emi Buendía and Moritz Leitner, who appeared too good for the Championship, are struggling to prove their worth. The Canaries’ next play Brighton and Watford and improved performances and results will be needed if this Norfolk project isn’t to take on the appearance of a wherry holed beneath the waterline. Paul MacInnesBy finally bringing the best out in Adama Traoré, Nuno Espírito Santo’s second-half switch from 3-5-2 to 3-4-3 paved the way for his side’s comeback from a goal down to claim a point. But, and it is a big but, it should have been academic. Had Newcastle possessed an effective centre‑forward they would surely have had the game all but won by the interval. Joelinton cost £40m from Hoffenheim but the 23-year-old Brazilian striker – deployed in a left-sided attacking role in Germany where he was never a prolific scorer – is struggling badly and, failing to hold the ball up, emphasising why Steve Bruce’s predecessor, Rafael Benítez was so desperate to sign Salomón Rondón permanently from West Brom. Instead Newcastle’s hierarchy said Rondón was too old so both he and Benítez are now in China. If only Mike Ashley had listened. Louise TaylorIt was noble of Ralph Hasenhüttl to take responsibility for the 9-0 defeat against Leicester when really his players laid down and accepted their humiliation. The Austrian’s job now is to pick them up for back-to-back fixtures against Manchester City full in the knowledge that another mauling could cost him his job. No one expects them to get anything from the two games but considering the Saints manager’s acceptance that there was “no fight for anything” on Friday night, so the manner of the performances this week will be all-important: the players will need to prove to the fans that they are committed to the cause, and dogged determination is necessary to get them out of their current hole. Southampton are demoralised from their historic defeat so changes will be made to personnel but Hasenhüttl’s real test will be to change the mentality. Will Unwin • Match report: Southampton 0-9 LeicesterWest Ham were right to sell Marko Arnautovic. The Austrian was unreliable, he turned 30 in April and his behaviour left much to be desired before his move to the Chinese Super League last summer. But he was one hell of a player when he was in the mood. Arnautovic’s inidual quality was a crucial weapon for West Ham and his replacement, Sébastien Haller, is struggling to fit in. Haller toiled during this 1-1 draw and the £45m signing is crying out for more support and better service from Felipe Anderson and Andriy Yarmolenko. The 25‑year‑old is a more traditional target man than Arnautovic, who preferred to run behind defences and create chances for himself, and West Ham need to start playing to Haller’s strengths. The Frenchman has scored once in his past seven games, so Manuel Pellegrini needs to make changes. Jacob Steinberg For a team that haven’t won a league game all season, Watford are in pretty good health. Quique Sánchez Flores has stabilised the team as promised, with three consecutive draws and only one goal conceded. But their defensive improvement has had a knock-on effect at the other end. They rarely looked like scoring against Bournemouth, despite the highlights-friendly brilliance of Gerard Deulofeu. Sánchez Flores has preferred a back three – and, in this match, a fluid strike partnership of Deulofeu and Roberto Pereyra. It’s an intriguing, modern tactic, but it looks better on paper than it did on the pitch on Saturday. Watford are in need of something more old-fashioned: a No 9, a goalscorer and a hero. It’s all set up for Troy Deeney, who should return next month after a knee operation, to ride to the rescue once again.

Yurong is an Asian studies librarian and David is a professor of Chinese historyDavid had just graduated in the US when he went to China, aged 22, to teach English, with one instruction from the dean of his college: not to fall in love. “So I didn’t have any sort of intentions of romantic involvement at all,” he says. He arrived at Yunnan University in the summer of 1989, weeks after the protests in Tiananmen Square.In October, he asked to accompany a British teacher on a three-day trip through Yunnan province. She had already asked Yurong, who had studied English at university, to go with her as a translator. “I was waiting for them at the bus stop and, when they walked over, he was this tall, young guy,” says Yurong.They spent all of their first day on the train. “Peasants got on and got off with their livestock, their grain,” says Yurong. “There were people selling food. David was able to speak some basic Chinese, but I was the main person who helped them to communicate. He was sitting across from me and I was looking at him thinking: ‘His eyes are really beautiful.’ He was also very easy to talk to.”What does David remember about Yurong? “The Chinese wanted to treat foreigners in a very particular way, keep us in our own corner, but she was very laid-back,” he says. He was concerned she would think he wasn’t up to eating local food and feared three days of bland, foreigner-friendly dishes. “I said: ‘Make sure mine are spicy.’ She turned to the guy that was selling the noodles and said: ‘He wants his extra-spicy.’ I was eating this bowl of chilli noodles and she was smiling at me – she had a sense of humour, which I was attracted to.”When did they realise they had feelings for each other? “Day two,” says David. They both laugh. Their companion went to bed early and David and Yurong took a walk along the railway tracks out into the fields. “We made lots of jokes about what was surrounding us, the people walking by. Getting to know each other,” says Yurong. She was walking on the rail, with David holding her hand – “to keep her steady”, he says. “It seemed the right moment – and right height? – to kiss, so we did.”Back in Kunming, they were concerned about rumours of their relationship getting to Yurong’s family. “So, we had to make a decision about our relationship really quickly – there was no halfway,” says David. “By day five, we had decided we did want to be a couple and she had to tell her parents.” They also had to put up with attention from people unused to seeing a western man with a Chinese woman. “It’s almost like you have no privacy,” says Yurong. “We just had to ignore lots of the stares and not be bothered by that.” At the same time, another western teacher called David was rumoured to be seeing several young Chinese women. “When rumours about us got back to my university, they all thought it was that David, not me,” says David. “So we had this unintentional free run for a couple of months.”Yurong wouldn’t normally have considered marriage so quickly, but they had to think about visas. So, in March 1990, after months of paperwork, they tied the knot. David sent a telegram to the dean of his college: “Regrets. Advice not taken. Am married.”They moved to the US in July 1990, 10 months after they had met, where they both pursued careers in academia, specialising in Chinese history and occasionally working together. Since then, they have split their time between the US and China, and brought up their two children bilingually and biculturally.In Mandarin, the same word can be given different meanings by using different tones. “With one word, one tone can mean virtuous and another means stupid. A friend said we were virtuous and I think it’s the other way around, that we were stupid,” says David, with a laugh. “We went into it without realising what was ahead of us and it just worked out.”Want to share your story?

But I think my attention  was a bit short for academic life, so I started writing science stories for newspapers. My first staff job was at BBC Tomorrow’s World magazine, then BBC News Online. I went to New Scientist next and then the Financial Times. In 2008, I was delighted to be hired by the , which was – and is! – my favourite paper.How has awareness of the climate crisis changed in the last decade? What do you think the big milestones have been? When I joined the , concern about the climate crisis was running high, following a landmark report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and Al Gore’s film, An Inconvenient Truth – the IPCC and Gore went on to win the Nobel peace prize. But it was seen as a future problem. The transformative moment was meant to come at the 2009 UN climate change conference in Copenhagen. But it didn’t happen and after that the impacts of the global financial crisis grabbed all the attention. It wasn’t until 2015, by which time the role of human activities in driving climate change was undeniable, that a big step forward was taken with the Paris deal. How has your role in covering the environment changed in that time? has always taken the environment very seriously. In the decade I have been here, the team has expanded. But the basic approach has largely stayed the same – environmental issues affect everything, so should feature across all our coverage: reporting, exposing and holding to account. Today, the climate crisis is here, evident in more frequent and more severe extreme weather and climate change deniers have been relegated to the far fringes. With the global youth climate strikes inspired by Greta Thunberg and the Extinction Rebellion protests, 2019 feels like a new chapter. Those who have campaigned for decades are feeling hopeful. What would you say are the most important environmental issues?The climate emergency is the best known, and it will take systemic change to beat it. But the annihilation of wildlife and the destruction of nature is just as crucial in my view – we depend on the natural world for almost everything. The huge scale of the losses – from forests to insects to marine life – has only really become widely reported in the last few years. Pollution is the third issue, particularly the toxic air that causes millions of early deaths every year. Air is actually getting cleaner in some rich nations, but the understanding of how damaging it is – on everything from intelligence to miscarriages – is only really emerging now. Chemical pollution is also a serious global problem, from fertiliser to pesticides to PCBsWhat frustrates you about how these issues are sometimes be covered?One thing is the charge of hypocrisy that is often levelled at environment campaigners because they have a TV or something. Just because you have to live in the world as it is today doesn’t mean you can’t campaign to make it a better place tomorrow. But I think hypocrisy is the attack made by people who know they’ve lost the real argument.Has your work influencedinformed the way you live your life?Yes. It’s impossible to write about it every day and not act. I am vegan at home and whenever I can elsewhere. My home is fully insulated and my energy supplier is renewable. I rarely fly for holidays – one short haul flight in the last couple of years – and usually go to Ireland by ferry to surf. I’ve also cycled to work for about 13 years now – it’s cheap, fast and healthy. Being green is often worthwhile for many reasons.What would you say to readers who want to tackle the environmental crisis?The big shifts will be driven by the governments we elect (in democracies) and the companies to which we give our custom. Demanding urgent action from those leaders is vital. But personal action is also important, in itself and as an encouragement to others. The biggest action, according to scientists, is having fewer children, but that of course is a deeply personal and complex choice. Flying less and eating less meat and dairy also make big cuts in your impact, as does driving fewer petrol-powered miles and insulating your home.How can we build on the urgency we’ve seen from many campaigners in 2019 and keep the spotlight fixed firmly on the big changes we need?We are in a race against time and it’s not at all certain that we are going to win. We understand the problems and what we have to do, more or less, but the pace of action is far too slow. Putting pressure on politicians and business leaders is key – giving them a strong reason to move faster. The good news is that many solutions gain their own momentum once started. In many places, solar and wind power is now the cheapest electricity, and electric cars are the cheapest to own. But there are still big problems to solve, including agriculture and aviation. The young people involved in the climate strikes will be running the world in the not-too-distant future. But we have to make sure we are still in the race by then.What have been the highlights of your reporting at the  so far? What has made you most proud?I have written nearly 2,000 stories for the , and I’d hope most of them have played a part in building awareness of environmental issues. It’s usually hard to know how much impact stories have behind the scenes, but the restoration of slashed flood defence funding in England followed a lot of reporting by me, as did the EU ban on neonicotinoid pesticides, which harm bees. The recent resignation of the executive director of the UN environment programme also followed a string of my stories, which was a good example of the  holding power to account. The environment team get a lot of positive feedback from readers, scientists and policymakers, which is very heartening. One prominent scientist recently told me: “Thank God for the !”What is the area within your work and reporting expertise that you feel most passionately about?Usually the story I’m working on right now. But in recent years I’ve done a lot on pesticides, insects, the impact of livestock, microplastics and harmful subsidies. And badgers. I’ve written a lot about the cull in England. One of my editors here said I had “made the  the paper of choice for small mammals”, which may or may not have been a compliment.What about the highs and lows of doing the job?Often, this is the best job in the world. I’ve been fortunate to see a lot of the Earth’s natural beauty. I’ve tracked forest elephants in Gabon, been swimming with giant mantas in the Males and walked through extraordinary landscapes high in the Andes. On the other hand, almost every day I have to report more destruction and degradation of the environment. The most heartbreaking story I have covered is the poisoning of children with lead in a former mining town in Zambia. But I was glad to be able to expose it at least.What’s next for you and the team?The next 12 months are going to be absolutely pivotal for the world. There’s a major UN bioersity conference in China next year – the targets set a decade ago have been woefully missed. The UN climate summit in Glasgow, UK, in 2020 will also be vital – nations are going to have to make big increases in the carbon cuts they pledge if we are to get anywhere near the 1.5C temperature rise seen as a safety limit. And we’ll be reporting day in, day out, across the world holding nations and companies to account for the environment and for social justice.What makes the  unique?John Vidal, my brilliant predecessor as environment editor, says: “Environment is the world and everything in it”, and I think the issue now permeates all the newspaper’s coverage. That is because the  has always taken the issue seriously, with full support from the top and the resources to match. Our readers really care too, and they tell us. I’d guess there aren’t many places where all that is the case."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fac2fa965ca0e191c92b90f18c8c663e7386ae63/153_51_4735_2842/master/4735.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6194c433552b48ec981eb6a87d8bb722","title":"how to clock off five ways to leave work and its worries behind","story":"Equally, don’t do it today if it can wait until tomorrow. This is not contradictory. If you can get something done before the end of the day, do it while it is important, rather than leave it to become urgent tomorrow. This will encourage you to prioritise and work more efficiently during the day as you know you have to stop working at 5pm or 6pm. “Organised workplaces are productive workplaces,” says Henry Stewart, chief happiness officer at Happy Ltd. “I probably only call someone out of hours once a year, and that’s only if it’s absolutely necessary. People shouldn’t be expected to work after hours.” If a task is not simple enough to complete within the last half hour in the office, write a to-do list for the morning, pack away your things and you will soon get used to the idea of winding down towards the end of the working day.Accept that it is impossible to get everything done – there will always be one more thing you could get on with, but work needs to have an end point. Do your best every day and do not feel guilty about clocking off. Depending on the culture of your workplace, and the type of work you do, it may be difficult to mentally detach yourself after hours. You need to gradually redefine your limits in terms of understanding what you need in order to have a mental break and tell yourself you deserve to relax.Separating your working life and your leisure time is essential for better psychological, mental and physical health. For Germans, it is the idea of Feierabend – “calling it a day” – that upholds the evening as almost sacrosanct. Focusing on creative experiences through leisure and hobbies play a major role in alleviating stress, improving health and generally making us happier people (and workers). Whether it is going for a run, cooking a meal, toiling in the garden or catching up with friends that breaks you out of work mode, find something you enjoy, put it in the diary and stick to it.Establishing an unwinding ritual for when you get home retrains the mind to slow down – simple things such as changing out of your work clothes, having a bath or sitting outside in the fresh air can tell the brain it is time to relax. “I meditate to get my mind back in shape – even if it’s just for five minutes, pause and breathe, count to 10 five times, take time to think,” says Stewart. “We all need rest in order to be more productive and, in my experience, nobody gets their best ideas in the office.” Clear your head by reading a book, walking the dog, whatever you need to prepare your mind and body for rest. And, if you are catching up with loved ones, be present and try not to talk about work.An email here and a push notification there can easily descend into an unhealthy merry-go-round, so much so that a high-flying political journalist once said she has to leave her phone on a shelf in another room to stop herself from working. “Don’t use emails on your phone at all, because you’ll only look at it, and turn off all work-related alerts,” says Stewart. “I only check my emails three times each day – at 11am, 2pm and 5pm, and that means I actually look forward to it.” Wean yourself off checking your phone by utilising settings such as “night shift” and “do not disturb” so you can glance at updates in your own time. It is a process, but learn to have peace of mind that you do not have to respond to everything instantly. If it is urgent, they will call you. If it’s not, it can wait until tomorrow.This article was amended on 28 October 2019 to correct a quote and make it clear that some advice is dependent on the culture of a workplace."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a8926092fa45332f45f7157027c93a355e8060ff/0_0_2218_1331/master/2218.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2258d7983f2def2cf61033df59ab0c54","title":"morrissey performs in la wearing fuck the guardian t shirt","story":"Former Smiths frontman and supporter of far-right party For Britain has criticised the UK newspaper in the past Morrissey has performed in Los Angeles wearing a vest with the slogan “Fuck the ”.The former Smiths frontman wore the top during a concert at the Hollywood Bowl on Saturday, weeks after he described this newspaper as “the voice of all that is wrong and sad about modern Britain”.The 60-year-old singer, who has repeatedly expressed support for the far-right party For Britain, has increasingly been lashing out at the  in recent months.Writing on his personal website in May, Morrissey claimed he was the victim of an “inexhaustible hate campaign” by the , imploring his supporters: “Please do not buy this wretched hate-paper, whose every 2019 utterance echoes the late Mary Whitehouse.”During a May performance on the Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon Morrissey decided to wear a For Britain badge. In June, he reaffirmed his support for the party in an interview with his nephew, published again on his own website.Earlier this month he ejected an anti-far-right protester from his concert in Portland. The protester had been carrying two posters, one which depicted the logo of For Britain struck through by a red line, while the other read: “Bigmouth indeed.”Writing in the  in July, comedian and former Morrissey fan Stewart Lee said he found the best way to deal with the singer was to simply stop listening to him. “Suddenly, I just didn’t want Morrissey in my home any more.

It’s Charli baby, and I’m gonna take you to heaven.” Charli XCX knows how to throw a party, and this one – the first night of a sold-out UK tour – has it all. Rainbow-coloured strobes, mountains of smoke, surprise guests and, at the centre of the chaos, Charlotte Aitchison in a scarlet, matador-inspired two-piece, punching the air like pop’s own Power Ranger. Her opening words may read like hyperbole, but her most feverish Angels queued all day for a chance to meet her, and even the more casual fans at the back of SWG3’s largest room grab each other in frenzied delight when her biggest songs hit.The tour, the lights, the costume changes are all in honour of her newly released third album, Charli – an expansive follow-up to the playful, challenging mixtapes she dropped in 2017. In Charli-world, there isn’t much difference to split between a tape or an album, and the new record still feels like a frenetic mood board, but with a surprisingly confrontational vulnerability. The first hint of that, tonight, is found in Gone – an antisocial anthem written with Christine and the Queens’ Chris. Charli’s queasy, lonely chorus, “I feel so unstable, fucking hate these people”, burns up the room, turning each party-goer’s party inside out.She’s a generous, prolific collaborator, and reels off a brief, sweet speech thanking the many guests on the album: Chris, Haim, Lizzo, Kim Petras, Troye Sivan, Sky Ferreira, Clairo, Yaeji. The list is so long, and so glittering, that the moment could almost be a flex. And yet, the flex is more that their absence is barely felt in the live show. Charli breezily fills in on vocals, dances gleefully during their verses and employs the population of Glasgow to stand in for Lizzo. During Shake It – a bone-rattling rager built on the swag and spit of rappers Cupcakke, Brooke Candy and bounce queen Big Freedia – local drag queens take turns to provoke the screaming crowd.Tracks like Click go harder still. Finessed by her go-to producer AG Cook and post-PC Music innovators Dylan Brady and Umru, the beats are sugary whip-cracks. They pop like cash registers on Black Friday before the song explodes into harsh, satisfying noise. The bass is so heavy during the gothy glamour of Cross You Out that Charli stands, braced, as if enduring an earthquake. It’s barely 10pm on a Sunday night but it feels like 4am on Saturday morning.An emotional run through the album’s almost-ballads briefly shifts the tone. “Thank you for letting me be me,” she says, suddenly serious. “I’m gonna make you feel the same way.” She holds herself with poise and precision, pushing through the swelling, self-interrogating tragedy of White Mercedes: “I hate the silence, that’s why the music’s always loud.”The encore is stuffed with big singles: Icona Pop’s freewheeling I Love It (she wrote it), female-gaze anthem Boys and the silly kitsch of 1999 – a song as irrepressible as the Vengaboys, which proves that any of her songs could be a radio smash if she chose it to be. Often it’s assumed Charli will eventually choose a side – mainstream shine or underground clout. Tonight, she shows that her laser-sharp focus is concentrated only on the future."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/44e59d6cd7702eb6ac95caaa8918fe77f1055edb/0_127_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8a2c9dcdd4747bcb43977fd19d7b10cd","title":"eu agrees brexit extension to 31 january flextension","story":"Donald Tusk announces ‘flextension’ that allows UK to leave earlier if deal ratifiedThe EU has agreed to a Brexit extension to 31 January 2020, with the option for the UK to leave earlier if a deal is ratified, clearing the way for opposition parties to back a general election.After a 30-minute meeting of European ambassadors, Donald Tusk, the president of the European council, said the EU27 had agreed to the request made by Boris Johnson just over a week ago.He tweeted: “The EU27 has agreed that it will accept the UK’s request for a new flextension until 31 January 2020. The decision is expected to be formalised through a written procedure.”The prime minister, who said he would rather die in a ditch than delay Brexit, is now under an obligation to agree to the terms, breaking his pledge to leave on 31 October, “no ifs, no buts … do or die”.Guy Verhofstadt, the European parliament’s Brexit coordinator, tweeted: “Relieved that finally no one died in a ditch. Whether the UK’s democratic choice is revoke or an orderly withdraw, confirmed or not in a second referendum, the uncertainty of Brexit has gone on for far too long. This extra time must deliver a way forward.”The Liberal Democrats and Scottish National party have said they would back a general election on 9 December if no deal on 31 October is “taken off the table”. Downing Street has let it be known that it is considering how to respond to the opposition parties.Labour continues to insist it will not back an election unless there are further assurances the UK will not crash out on 31 January.Boris Johnson has three options to try and call a general election. Under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011, an election may be called if it is agreed by two-thirds of the total number of MPs. Johnson presented motions for an election on 4 and\u0026nbsp9 September\u0026nbspand failed on both occasions when the majority of Labour MPs abstained. Johnson could try this again and potentially secure Labour backing, because the Benn act has removed the imminent possibility of a no-deal Brexit.This lowers the threshold of MPs needed to trigger a general election because it requires a simple majority to pass. This could work in Johnson’s favour. However, it is amendable, which can involve the moving of an election date to a time that works for the opposition.\u0026nbspThe leader of the opposition, Jeremy Corbyn, can call a no-confidence motion in the prime minister. This needs a simple majority to pass. He has been urged to do this by Johnson several times as a way of triggering an election, but Corbyn has resisted. It begins a 14-day period in which either the prime minister or someone else can try to form a new government. While Johnson could potentially lose this, and therefore his place as prime minister, to another Conservative, Corbyn could also struggle to get enough MPs to rally around him to form a government. The Scottish National party has said it would back him, but the Liberal Democrats have been\u0026nbspextremely vocal\u0026nbspin saying they would not support him. An election is triggered if, at the end of the two-week period, no alternative government has been formed.Under the terms of the extension, the UK has three months more of EU membership but it can leave on the first day of any of those months if the withdrawal agreement is ratified in both Westminster and the European parliament in the meantime.The EU has insisted it will not renegotiate the withdrawal agreement again. The UK also has “an obligation” to nominate a candidate to join the European commission. The prime minister has previously said he will not put forward a nominee.By agreeing the extension through a written procedure, to be completed by Wednesday at the latest, EU leaders will avoid convening for a summit in Brussels.“Tusk will launch the written procedure among EU27 with a deadline of 24 hours,” an EU source said. “The formal flextension decision is made upon the positive conclusion of the written procedure. We hope this to be concluded by Tuesday or Wednesday.” The decision to grant a third extension followed intensive discussions over the weekend, including a conversation between the French president, Emmanuel Macron, and Johnson.Among weekend developments that persuaded Paris to drop its objections to a further delay of up to three months was “the significantly more likely prospect of fresh elections, now backed by several parties including the Liberal Democrats and the SNP”, a French official said.The conditions attached to the extension had also been “further specified and reinforced” on Saturday and Sunday, the source said, in particular the “non-renegotiability” of the deal and the fact that the EU27 will be able to work on the bloc’s future plans without the UK.While wishing to preserve the unity of the EU27, which had been the guiding principle throughout the negotiations, the source said, Paris had “insisted on these conditions as necessary”.During the ambassadors’ meeting, France’s representative complained that the three-month extension would lift the pressure on MPs to ratify the revised withdrawal agreement, but reluctantly gave his support, EU sources said.France’s EU affairs minister, Amélie de Montchalin, later tweeted: “Obviously, and this is our position for months, the Europeans will not oppose a postponement of Brexit linked to a democratic clarification, like new elections. We are neither interfering nor indifferent.”The terms in the draft agreement are in line with those stipulated under the Benn act, which forced Johnson to make a request to the EU for a further delay.The EU Withdrawal (No 2) Act, often referred to as the Benn act, is a law that was passed by MPs in an attempt to prevent Boris Johnson\u0027s government leaving the EU without a deal.It specifies that by 19 October the government must have either secured a deal that parliament has approved, or secured explicit approval from parliament to leave without a deal.If neither of those conditions are met – and if Johnson cannot get his deal passed on \u0027super Saturday\u0027 – it requires the prime minister to write to the EU to ask for a further Brexit extension. The form of the letter that the prime minister must send is set out in full in the act.The act says the extension should last until 31 January 2020, or longer if the EU suggests.Here is the full text of the European Union (Withdrawal) (No 2) Act 2019“The period provided for in article 50 (3) TEU as extended by the European council decision (EU) 2019584 is hereby further extended until 31 January 2020,” the agreement says."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4fb6235ed6bb9206288e172d398422335ad0adf7/552_1064_3091_1854/master/3091.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8f000011386f2c378a2b63e2c82a8a1d","title":"harriet harman on political survival if youve been an outsider you never forget","story":"After almost 40 years in parliament, she wants to be Speaker and restore public faith in politics. She talks about anger, antisemitism and abuseIt is the end of yet another momentous week in parliament and Harriet Harman’s kitchen is a picture of cheery domestic chaos. Her two beloved cats are climbing the curtains, there is a pile of washing waiting and Holly, her young granddaughter, who is currently staying, toddles in and out. Harman apologises for the mess, but is clearly rather enjoying having a highchair at the table again.It is 37 years since she arrived in Westminster, heavily pregnant and feeling like a “fish out of water”, as she described it. Male Tory MPs would shout “stupid cow” at her across the chamber, while the things she longed to debate – such as her south London constituents’ struggle to find childcare while they worked, or feminist reforms she had taken up as a young lawyer – were deemed trivial. At her lowest ebb – contracting pneumonia while exhausted from juggling an opposition frontbench job and small children – she considered quitting. But instead she rose to the cabinet under Tony Blair, served as caretaker Labour leader after Ed Miliband left and is now running to succeed John Bercow as Speaker of the House of Commons when he retires next month, on a platform of putting parliament back in touch with the public that it serves.Leafing through her notes from the mini listening tour she has undertaken, asking people around the country what they think of parliament, underlines how difficult that has become. Westminster politics is seen as aggressive, entitled, phoney and unprofessional, a braying bear pit hopelessly out of step with modern workplaces, where respect and empathy are increasingly valued. “One woman said: ‘I’m a trade union negotiator. I’d get nowhere if I walked into a negotiation and behaved like that,’” Harman recalls. “One of the things that’s been very striking is that people think the anger that’s displayed in parliament is an artefact, that it’s basically fake, playing up to the cameras. So if anybody’s under the impression that their anger is regarded as inspiring by people outside – people don’t buy it.” And that hints at something more complicated than the crude “people v parliament” narrative pushed by Downing Street, pitting furious leave voters against a supposedly obstructive elite.Harman’s research suggests the angry, uncompromising stances that many Brexiters (and, arguably, parts of the left) see as connoting passion or ideological purity don’t always come across that way to voters, many of whom see squabbling and ision merely as proof of impotence. Resorting to shouting is seen as “the ultimate failure of an institution”, says Harman. “In the outside world, people disagree about Brexit but they get along.” If she’s right, then politicians who believe they are channelling the public mood by ratcheting up their language may be in for a shock come a general election.She insists that doesn’t necessarily mean a bland or neutered politics, citing the 2003 debate over the Iraq war, during which the foreign secretary, Robin Cook, resigned. “Nobody felt that there weren’t passionate beliefs on all sides, nobody felt that was not a debate of the utmost seriousness. There were very big isions in the country and in parliament. Yet the debates did not descend into shouting, abuse and finger-jabbing. It’s not about dumbing down parliament or fudging over differences, it’s about respecting what the people think about their parliament. We can’t ignore that because, if people have contempt for their parliament, that’s undermining parliamentary democracy and creates a vacuum.”Parliament rarely looks more out of touch than during the state opening, when the Queen arrives in a horse-drawn carriage to a flurry of bowing, but Harman isn’t advocating reducing the pomp. “I think people recognise that for what it is, part of our culture and heritage and tradition.” And while she backs changing summer recess dates to reflect Scottish school holidays, which would allow Scottish MPs some time away from Westminster while their children are off, more broadly she insists that it’s not for the Speaker to dictate how parliament should modernise, but merely to facilitate what MPs want.Still, the longest-serving female MP must think it is ridiculous that MPs have no formal right to maternity leave from their constituency and that Labour’s Stella Creasy has had to have a public battle to get locum cover for when she gives birth this autumn. Harman says that attitudes have shifted thanks to the influx not only of women MPs but of men who expect time off when they become fathers. “I remember, back in the day, one of my fellow MPs got up and said: ‘On a point of order, Mr Chairman, can I just ask the committee to take note that my wife has just had a baby?’ I was thinking: ‘So why are you here?’ but everyone was like ‘hear hear’ and then we carried on with the committee. That’s not the aspiration of men having young families now in the House of Commons or outside.” Yet as she concedes, it was just last year that pregnant MPs won the right to vote by proxy, and that was only after Labour’s Tulip Siddiq arrived in a wheelchair on the day she was due to give birth. “You mustn’t ram raid things through, but really, it’s kind of glacial, the pace of change.”Worse still, some now fear progress shifting into reverse, thanks to a tide of threats and abuse disproportionately targeted at female, black and gay politicians and seemingly designed to intimidate them out of public life.“Women speaking up is like a red rag to the misogynist bull,” sighs Harman. “That’s what the response to the significant advance of women in parliament has been a significant backlash together with social media enabling anonymous threats and abuse.” She doesn’t see it putting Labour women off standing for parliament, but worries that “people stand down earlier than they might because of that”.And latterly, such abuse hasn’t always come from outside the party. Female and ethnic minority MPs have been disproportionately targeted so far in the trigger ballots allowing local party members to seek to replace their candidates, just as women warned would happen when Corbyn changed the rules. Lucy Powell, the Manchester Central MP, has argued the process has become in parts about “trying to put a lid on opinionated, outspoken women” in South Shields, Emma Lewell-Buck has raised allegations of bullying and harassment within the local party.Like many Labour MPs, Harman expressed dismay when Louise Ellman, the Jewish Labour MP for Liverpool Riverside who had faced a long and vitriolic campaign to oust her, resigned the whip, saying Labour was “no longer a safe place for Jews”. (Ellman’s critics accuse her of jumping before she could be deselected. That isn’t true, Harman insists she was tipped to survive the trigger ballot process.) So what, apart from issuing anguished statements of regret, are MPs like Harman going to do about tackling antisemitism within Labour?Shouldn’t Corbyn take some personal responsibility for what is erupting within his party? Harman chooses her words carefully: “I think the thing about leadership is that it’s your responsibility not just to have the right position, but to ensure that it’s the position of the party as a whole. That’s not just about saying: ‘I’m totally opposed to antisemitism, I do not condone it, I’ve never engaged in it.’ Leadership is about making sure that wherever it shows itself, it’s absolutely stamped down on. I think that has been the problem.“It’s important to respect and support the autonomy of the members and that’s a role of leadership, but it’s also a role of leadership that if members are doing something which is egregiously wrong, you clamp down on it. You have got to be tough and directive to be an effective leader as well as supportive of your grassroots.”Even such veiled criticism is significant because, unlike many of her old political allies, Harman has remained publicly loyal to each successive Labour leader, whatever her private misgivings. (She declined to serve on Corbyn’s frontbench, arguing that she had had her turn, but her husband, the MP Jack Dromey, does.) She takes a broadly stoical view of the current turmoil, having lived through Neil Kinnock’s struggle with the hard left when Labour councillors going into meetings were spat on by local activists. “My constituency party had to be suspended in the 80s because there were fights in general committee meetings. Someone pulled a gun at a meeting and I was like: ‘This has really gone beyond ...’ and they said: ‘No, it was only an imitation gun,’” she recalls. “I’m not saying that what’s happening now should be discounted, but the party found its equilibrium after that turmoil and it will do again after all this.”Yet in the Speaker’s job she has perhaps identified a role that would lift her out of the fray, obliging her to become a neutral servant of parliament during a constitutional struggle over Brexit that transcends party lines. While critics argue she’s too establishment for what became, under Bercow, a reforming and even activist role, she clearly finds the charge bizarre, having spent her life being criticised for being too radical in her feminism, only to find her causes eventually becoming mainstream.“I’ve certainly been there a long time and stuck it out – if that’s what you call establishment, surviving, definitely ... But if you’ve been an outsider, a very young woman in a parliament of older men, you never ever forget the contempt with which your views were treated and you never ever forget your complete frustration that other people’s views could be accepted with reverence.”Does she feel sympathy then for Theresa May, as Tory Brexiters who snubbed her deal leap on board her male successor’s version? For the first time, Harman falters. “You stand or fall by what you can achieve,” she says eventually. “I wouldn’t want to, because she’s a woman, make excuses ... I mean, she was the prime minister, for heaven’s sake. If you can’t take responsibility for your own successes and failures when you are prime minister, then when can you?”She is more comfortable agreeing with the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, that the next Labour leader should be a woman, having ducked out of running for the job herself in the past. “I do remember people saying, when I was acting leader: ‘Why aren’t you going for the real thing?’ but I sort of treated it as if they were being polite. I wasn’t quite convinced they really meant it.”Instead, at 69, she sees herself as part of a wave of older women refusing to leave the workplace quietly. “There are a lot of women who stepped back when their kids were younger and they’re now ready to step back up, but find that, too often, people think: ‘Oh, now you’re past it,’” she says. “One minute you’re too young, the next you’re too old, whereas with men they’re always in their prime.”Yet with age, she thinks, comes at least one consolation. “If people have just got used to you, they’ll deal with what you say at face value, and that gives you opportunities to do things that you wouldn’t have been able to before ... A lot of them were scared of me when I first arrived for good or ill, I don’t frighten them any more.” She grins. “I’ve obviously got to up my game.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6a12f888ded2733b82dc26cd8a5fa198ac4bcd14/320_151_4010_2406/master/4010.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fdfa94c524db294d708260b43d61f7dc","title":"labour release forecasts sajid javid scrapped budget obr","story":"Chancellor must make OBR analysis public so voters are informed, says John McDonnellLabour has demanded Sajid Javid immediately publish economic forecasts prepared for the budget to ensure the government does not avoid public scrutiny before a potential election.In a letter to the chancellor seen by the , John McDonnell called for the urgent release of forecasts compiled by the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), the independent Treasury watchdog.He also demanded Javid set a new date for the budget, warning Britain’s standing in the world had been tarnished by the chancellor tearing up his plans for delivering tax and spending pledges on 6 November.The Office for Budget Responsibility is the government’s independent forecaster, which gives its verdict on the outlook for growth and the public finances twice a year.The forecasts are published to coincide with the chancellor’s two big set pieces of the year – the autumn budget and the spring statement – and takes into account the impact of any tax and spending measures announced in those statements.It was established in 2010 by the then chancellor George Osborne with the aim of improving the credibility of the government’s official forecasts for growth. The forecasts were previously produced by the Treasury itself and often criticised for being unrealistic.The OBR is led by three members of the budget responsibility committee, including chairman Robert Chote, a former director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, with support from the OBR’s permanent staff of 27 civil servants.“Inconsistency in decision-making in government over financial matters naturally adds to the current instability in the country’s affairs and its standing in the markets,” McDonnell wrote.“It behoves the chancellor therefore to at least keep the public informed of the government’s intentions.”Javid has come under mounting pressure to release the OBR health check since he confirmed his budget would be postponed. Economists warned voters would lack vital information to inform an election campaign.James Smith, the research director of the Resolution Foundation thinktank, said: “The fact that the autumn budget has been scrapped is bad news for democratic debate in this country, as it means we are heading for the polls without up-to-date forecasts for the health of our economy and the public finances. This matters because the OBR’s forecasts provide crucial context for the promises that the parties will make during the election campaign.“The hard work of producing these forecasts has already been done. The government should allow them to be published asap, irrespective of whether there’s an imminent budget or election.”McDonnell said the OBR had probably already completed some of its forecasting work and shared the details with the Treasury, arguing in his letter to Javid that there was “no good reason why these should not now be made public”.The OBR last published an assessment of the economy and public finances in March. Since then, Boris Johnson has ramped up public spending while the economy has slumped close to the point of recession as Brexit uncertainty holds down growth.The tax and spending watchdog must publish two forecasts in each financial year, under rules first introduced by George Osborne. They must be commissioned by the chancellor, although the OBR is understood to be considering what it would need to do to meet its requirements in the event the forecasts were not commissioned.The Treasury is still understood to be planning to hold a budget and spring statement in the current financial year – key moments when the OBR would typically publish its forecasts – leaving Javid less than six months to comply.A spokesperson for the Treasury declined to comment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/61de7652c789f056aa3e3cd97f0cf53af8058a50/0_26_2001_1201/master/2001.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1a0f1673fa3c8d08bc4b178cc90d8027","title":"no 10 says it could back lib dem plan for 9 december election","story":"Government could back plan if it fails to pass motion under Fixed-term Parliaments ActDowning Street has indicated it would back a plan by the Liberal Democrats to change the law in order to hold a December election if Labour refuses to back Boris Johnson’s motion on Monday for an early poll.A No 10 source attempted to put pressure on Labour to back its motion under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act for an election on 12 December, saying the government would turn to the Lib Dem plan as an alternative.The law requires there be at least 25 working days (five weeks) between calling an election and polling day. That only realistically leaves three Thursdays when the UK could have an election this year.12 December has emerged as Boris Johnson\u0027s favoured date.\u0026nbspAny later seems unlikely as it will be seen as an unwelcome intrusion into the festive season - and difficult to organise, as many of the venues needed for polling stations will be busy with Christmas and holiday events.Despite repeated assurances, Boris Johnson seems set to miss his 31 October deadline for Brexit. The \u0027Benn Act\u0027 specified 31 January 2020 as the UK\u0027s preferred length of extension and new Brexit date, but it is possible the EU might opt for a shorter period of time to focus minds. Any EU extension is likely to be a \u0027flextension\u0027 - with a set end date, but the opportunity for the UK to leave earlier if parliament can ratify a Withdrawal Agreement.An alternative scenario is for Boris Johnson to prefer to use an EU extension period to force his Withdrawal Agreement Bill through parliament before Christmas, exit the EU with his deal at the end of January, and then press for an election in FebruaryMarch 2020 having \u0027got Brexit done\u0027.Johnson needs Labour support to get a two-thirds majority for an election under current legislation, but Jeremy Corbyn is refusing to back one while the possibility of a no-deal Brexit is still alive.Over the weekend, the Lib Dems offered to help Johnson change the law to allow an election on 9 December, which would need only a simple majority in parliament.A No 10 source said: “Tonight is Labour’s last chance to have election with Brexit delivered – they can vote for the 12th and get Brexit done before. If not, we will introduce a bill almost identical to the Lib DemSNP one tomorrow.“This parliament has repeatedly failed to deliver on its promise to respect the referendum. Millions of families and businesses can’t plan because of constant delays. We need a new parliament by Christmas so we can get Brexit done in January and the country can move on.”It is not clear how the government’s proposal for a bill would differ and it is possible No 10 could be using the idea to put pressure on Labour before tabling legislation that the Lib Dems could not back.However, Lib Dem sources indicated they would be willing to support any legislation that was fundamentally similar to their own and confirmed they would not pursue amendments in order to ensure the bill had the best chance possible of getting through.It is understood the bill would need to be tabled on Tuesday and passed by Thursday in order for a 9 December election to take place."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ee5263eead54572946104a1f8f3906d6bbb3154b/0_163_4071_2444/master/4071.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8f2474cb02dc6417bae3754e29169d76","title":"chicago bears are a masterclass in how to waste a great defense","story":"Khalil Mack is at the heart of a formidable defensive unit. But the Bears’ failure to build a convincing supporting cast is inexcusable There was a moment in the first quarter of Sunday’s tilt against the Los Angeles Chargers when the Chicago Bears looked like the Chicago Bears again. After Kyle Fuller picked off Philip Rivers, most of the defense gathered for a delightful performance of the Cha Cha Slide, led by Prince Amukamara. They were having fun, taking comfort in that fact that they are still a dominating force that on Sunday would hold the Chargers to just 231 total yards.Then the rest of the game happened, and the Bears lost 17-16 when Eddy Pineiro missed a 41-yard field goal as time expired. But this loss, and this season which is officially in disaster mode, was not Pineiro’s fault. Nor was it the fault of a Bears defense which still ranks in the top-10 despite losing disruptive defensive end Akiem Hicks to an elbow injury.Sunday wasn’t the type of signature Bears defensive performance we were treated to every week last season, when the unit consistently terrorized the quarterback and seized every turnover opportunity. But the defense did its part, stymying Melvin Gordon, who only had 31 rushing yards. Khalil Mack also had a nice sack.This game was also a needed change of pace for a defense that had been gashed on the ground in recent weeks because the offense had no ability to keep them off the field with sustained drives. But on Sunday Matt Nagy finally utilized his powerhouse running back, David Montgomery, which kept the defense well rested. For a while, the flow looked like a sliver of last year’s formula. Then the Bears were firmly back in the present.The defense watched as Mitch Trubisky ended the third quarter with an interception and began the fourth with a fumble that the Chargers converted into a touchdown. The defense watched again as Trubisky actually drove Chicago into field-goal range on the final drive leaving enough time to attempt another run, which could have improved the field, position or heck, even led to a score. But Nagy insisted on kicking it right away. Miss. Bears lose again.At this point, the Bears owe Mack and Eddie Jackson and Danny Trevathan and the entire defense an apology. Chicago now sit at 3-4 in the cellar of the NFC North without much hope given their quarterback and perplexing playcalling this season. The defense hasn’t been perfect you’ll hear players like Mack or Trevathan talk about tackles they didn’t perfectly execute or how they still “believe in this team.” But they know the reality. They see the undefeated San Francisco and New England with crushing defenses and must salivate.In case you haven’t heard it before, the Bears selected Trubisky in the 2017 NFL draft ahead of Patrick Mahomes and Deshaun Watson. And yes, instead of watching Trubisky look like a deer in headlines, it’s a fun exercise to close your eyes and dream of Mahomes or Watson paired with this defense.Then reality hits and Bears fans have to watch their team waste a season waiting for Trubisky to make some incremental progress. Meanwhile, the organization is wasting this special collection of defensive talent. Mack is 28 and in his prime. Some guys are older, some are younger. Even with Trubisky’s contract, which some Bears fans are trying to buy out, Chicago’s front office has made the numbers work. That likely won’t be the case starting this offseason.Unless Trubisky makes a massive transformation or the Bears pull off some blockbuster trade before the Tuesday deadline, this team is wasting more than this season. It’s painful to watch. Imagine how Khalil Mack must feel.A lot of 49ers performed in an electric 51-13 win over the Panthers but no one dominated quite like the rookie Nick Bosa, who has been a beast this season. After the game, Richard Sherman continued lobbying for the young pass rusher to get Rookie of the Year consideration. Defensive Player of the Year should be in the conversation as well.Cooper Kupp’s magical season continued Sunday with seven catches for a whopping 220 receiving yards and a touchdown in a 24-10 Rams win over the Bengals. It was Kupp’s fifth game of the season in which he topped 100 yards and the most receiving yards by any Ram in one game since Isaac Bruce in 1997.Kupp feasted all day but it was his 65-yard score on a brilliantly called and executed double-reverse fleaflicker in the second quarter that altered the momentum of what was then a tied game.“Keeping a completely healthy player from being on the field isn’t protecting anyone.” – Cardinals linebacker Cassius MarshArizona linebacker Cassius Marsh went down at the end of a Michael Thomas run in the first quarter and was soon ruled out of the game with a concussion. Marsh’s public disagreement was stunning because it came from the locker room mid-game in the form of a now-deleted tweet. (Marsh will be receiving a letter from the NFL since players are not allowed to post on social media during a game.) But Marsh’s words also illustrate a sad reality in the NFL that, despite the emphasis on safety, players know their worth is tied to being on the field.There are no superlatives left to describe Adam Vinatieri’s career, and the collection of moments he’s accrued since joining the NFL in 1997 would fill a palace. The 46-year old (he turns 47 in a month) added to the list with a clutch 51-yard field goal to seal a gripping 15-13 victory for the Indianapolis Colts over the Denver Broncos. Vinatieri’s smooth kick keeps the Colts atop a tight AFC South. More importantly, it was a lovely reminder that life in sports, or in general, doesn’t have to disintegrate at 40.-- Drew Brees made his return from injury and despite a shaky overthrow to start, he settled in nicely and led the Saints to a convincing 31-9 win over Arizona. Brees finished with very Brees-like numbers: 373 yards, three TDs and an interception. Have to wonder what Teddy Bridgewater could net the Saints from some team desperate for an upgrade at quarterback (ahem, Bears).-- The Patriots now stand at 8-0 after beating the reeling Browns 27-13. Through their first eight games the Pats have a +189 point deferential which is tied for third-best in NFL history. In other words, they are ridiculously dominant.-- A usually mellow Joe Flacco was furious about his team’s decision to punt on fourth and five at the Colts 48 with a 1:40 left and a one-point lead “Well, c’mon, I just look at it like we’re now a 2-6 football team, and we’re like afraid to go for it in a two-minute drill, you know?, Flacco told ESPN. “Who cares if you give the ball back with a minute, 40 seconds left? They’ve obviously got the field goal anyway.’’ He’s not wrong.-- Given that the Broncos have lost three games in the last 30 seconds, first-year coach Vic Fangio may be on the hot seat. But it’s hard to imagine any seat hotter than Dan Quinn’s in Atlanta. The Falcons are now 1-7 with road games in New Orleans and Carolina in the next two weeks.-- Deshaun Watson put on another show Sunday in a 27-24 win over Oakland. Watson was almost flawless, putting up 279 yards and three TDs, and displayed his incredible body awareness and heart on a mindboggling touchdown pass to tight end Darren Fells. In not-as-sunny Texans news, JJ Watt tweeted that his season is over after suffering a torn pectoral against the Raiders.-- Talking of Watson’s brilliant touchdown throw, Aaron Rodgers came up with a half-decent effort for the Packers agains the Chiefs during Sunday Night Football:-- The Jets quietly released Kelechi Osemele on Saturday after a bizarre dispute over whether or not Osemele needed shoulder surgery for a torn labrum. The Jets injected him with Toradol before his last two games but Osemele declared he could no longer play in so much pain and after a third outside opinion, decided to get the shoulder surgery (which the Jets would not authorize). This saga will continue as Osemele is filing grievances in an attempt to recoup his salary and fines for missing practices. But at the surface it’s safe to say that the Jets are in their own category of utter ineptness, particularly when it comes to medical matters.-- The Dolphins did not lose on Sunday! (They play Monday night.)"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/69757b7b64d408c15a14e0faf95da8f8aa407d7e/0_35_4738_2842/master/4738.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=48318805413a1a910b34f62aa543c333","title":"tiger woods japan zozo championship japan golf","story":"We may never know the extent to which Tiger Woods really values the matching of a record for PGA Tour victories. Whereas now – quite understandably – the haul of 82 as achieved decades earlier by Sam Snead is uppermost in golf’s vernacular it is the figure of 18 – as relating to Jack Nicklaus and major wins – that has always seemed to be Woods’s barometer.What can be said without fear of contradiction is that Woods’s latest success, achieved by three shots at the Zozo Championship in Japan on Monday morning, adds to his extraordinary year. The 43-year-old indulged in sporting fairytale by winning his 15th major, the Masters, in April, upon return from the depths of physical despair. Woods cut a jaded figure during so many events thereafter, fuelling speculation about to what extent his Augusta glory had impacted both physically and mentally. When news broke of a fifth knee surgery, as undertaken in August, it felt as if Woods’s career was again heading for neutral gear.Not so. Woods comfortably held off Hideki Matsuyama to claim a trophy from an 11th different country whilst a professional. Snead was 52 when he won his last PGA Tour title.“I probably thought about the record when I got north of 50, but then unfortunately I went through some rough patches with my back and didn’t play for a number of years, so that record seemed like it was out of reach,” Woods said. “Having had my fourth back procedure and being able to come back and play at a decently high level again, it put the number back in the conversation again. Lo and behold, here we are tied.“As far as playing until 52, I hope that’s the case. If you would have asked me a few years ago, I would have given you a different answer, but certainly the future looks brighter than it has. The body can’t do what it used to but I can still think my way around the golf course.”Woods complied rounds of 64, 64, 66 and 67 to reach the 19 under par total sufficient to keep home hero Matsuyama, three shots behind, and the remainder of a stellar field at bay. Rory McIlroy recovered admirably from an opening 72 to share third at 13 under. “Stressful,” was the adjective Woods used to describe his feat albeit he is still to be overhauled when holding at least a three-shot lead with 18 holes to play.“This week was a good sign for the future,” Woods added. “Hopefully I can be as consistent as Sam was, well into my 40s and early 50s.“It’s satisfying to dig my way out of it and figure out a way. There were some hard times trying to figure it out but I’ve come back with different games over the years, moving patterns and this one’s been obviously the most challenging. Then having another procedure a couple months ago and again coming back and winning an event? Not easy to do.”The PGA Tour’s commercial department will need scraping from the ceiling. The first staging of this tournament, in Chiba, drew massive crowds with even the delayed finish owing to storm disruption not impacting on the topic on everybody’s lips. It helps the Tour in the here and now, of course, to have strong interest in Japan and a global spotlight on Woods making records in the here and now. Tiger remains very good for business, long after so many had written him off. An endearing photo, of Snead signing an autograph for a very young Woods, was circulated via the Tour’s social media channels as the dust settled in Japan.Effusive analysis arrived from Woods’s fellow players. “His ball striking was a joke his distance control was something I’ve never seen,” said Gary Woodland, who partnered Woods during rounds one and two. “He looked like the best player in the world. It was impressive to watch.” Woods has actually risen to No 6 in the world rankings.Woods still has captaincy duties for the US team at the President’s Cup to perform before rounding off his 2019. In what provides a further nod towards the cash register – albeit there is now competitive reasoning – it would be a surprise if he doesn’t name himself as a wildcard pick.“Once he gets that confidence up, he’s tough to beat,” asserted Woods’s caddie, Joe LaCava. More than five months are still to run before Woods begins his Masters defence. The wait feels like a form of sporting cruelty."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b67c8ea098f3435d5c09cf1e775eabd2dbbf1b7e/0_267_5472_3281/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=423ed946ab85ce60ba136427d40e955d","title":"talking horses where have all the classy two year olds gone","story":"Could it be that Europe doesn’t need so many races for staying juveniles, now that so few trainers seem to have those horses?Like me, you were probably taken aback at the news that the Vertem Futurity, lost to the weather along with the rest of Doncaster’s card on Saturday, is to be restaged on the all-weather at Newcastle on Friday evening. Newmarket, which is still referred to by some as the headquarters of British Flat racing, is staging action on Friday and Saturday – why not just send the race there?The answer, of course, is that Newmarket is owned by the Jockey Club, whereas the Vertem Futurity belongs to the ARC group of racecourses, which quite naturally wants to keep the valuable and prestigious contest at one of its tracks. And here we are once again, deep in racing realpolitik.But, on reflection, this is not the bit of the story to worry about. After all, why shouldn’t Newcastle have a top-class Flat race, at least once? Horses like Enable and Straarius have had happy early experiences on the Tapeta surface there. Vertem, the Futurity sponsors, are based in Newcastle. There’s already top-class races demanding our attention on Friday evening (I’m thinking of the Breeders’ Cup action from Santa Anita, for those of you who haven’t been paying attention), so the Futurity can be a juicy build-up to that.The thing to worry about is whether there’s still enough classy two-year-olds around Europe to stock the top-class staying races for them which we currently maintain. From the five-day stage, there was only one British-trained entrant for the Futurity last week. In France yesterday, Longchamp’s Criterium International was a two-horse race. At least there were eight in Saint-Cloud’s Criterium the day before but three of them were Aidan O’Brien’s.Is it time to kill off at least one of these races, so that the others can remain competitive? Well, it might be but no one in a position of power wants to make that decision. Vested interest will ensure that these races continue as long as at least two horses show up. When I approached the British Horseracing Authority last week to ask if the Futurity race conditions needed to be examined, I was told this was a racecourse issue and I should take it up with Doncaster or ARC.I’m told that ARC will, in fact, conduct a review of the race in the coming weeks, to see if it can be made more attractive to potential runners. I’d guess they will look at reducing the cost of a supplementary entry, among other things.In fairness, the Futurity was going as strong as ever until last week. A year ago, the finish was fought out by Magna Grecia and Phoenix Of Spain, who both won a Guineas this year. The year before, Saxon Warrior and Roaring Lion duked it out at Doncaster they won five Group Ones between them the next season.Magna Grecia and Saxon Warrior, of course, were both trained by Aidan O’Brien, who has no problem getting his hands on the right material for these two-year-old races. But if other trainers struggle to do so, what future is there for these contests?With the Rose Dobbin yard back among the winners, I’m tempted by the 16-1 about Attention Please (2.45) at Ayr, which stages the only racing. With a couple of ‘P’s in his form figures, he was never likely to attract much attention in the market but he could benefit from his outing at Kelso three weeks ago, his first run since February when the yard was struggling with a virus.A year ago, he was also pulled up on his first run of the season in mid-October but then did much better to be second in this very race, beaten only by a Gavin Cromwell raider after starting at 33-1. His rating went up when he won at Musselburgh in December but he’s back down to a beatable rating in an open-looking contest.Aurora Thunder (1.00) has the best form in the opener and can be backed at 5-2, while I’m surprised to see Rightdownthemiddle (3.20) drifting to 2-1 for the staying handicap hurdle. This veteran is back with Gordon Elliott, having dropped two stones down the ratings during a 10-month spell with Sean Curran. Maybe this won’t be his day but I wouldn’t be betting against him.The nap is at Kempton, where Bryn Du (5.30) runs in a nursery with Oisin Murphy taking over in the saddle. William Haggas’s lowly rated colt put up his best effort yet in a first-time tongue tie when third at Newcastle recently and gets to run from the same mark here. He’s 6-4."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6ca5696da5c249d214290ce07b9b696af08df105/0_149_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=51a2adb317bc1f41096baa32ed6ca98d","title":"bianca andreescu v simona halep wta finals 2019 live","story":"First set: Andreescu 6-3 Halep: That was quite an incredible set of tennis from Bianca Andreescu, who was absolutely dominant aside from one two-game stretch of excellence from the Romanian. Andreescu has dominated the exchanges, both by being the aggressor and constantly changing the pace. She’s throwing in loopy high balls, drop shots, you name it. Halep isn’t playing badly at all but she hasn’t been able to stay with the Canadian.First set: Andreescu 5-3* Halep: Andreescu throws down another love hold, this time sealed with an ace. Cahill suggested taking on her backhand down the line and going after the early balls a little more, but it’s so tough when Andreescu is putting her under this much pressure.Meanwhile, Coach Darren Cahill is back on-court with Halep. He was due to officially join her team again in the new season after taking a break this year, but clearly they just couldn’t wait.First set: Andreescu *4-3 Halep: The one constant so far has been Andreescu relentlessly attacking the Halep second serve. But after wasting two more break points, Andreescu mixes in a few slices and forces an error to break again.First set: Andreescu 3-3* Halep: No problems for Andreescu after losing two games in a row. She absolutely crushed a few forehands, landed some first serves and held to love.First set: Andreescu *2-3 Halep: Both women are starting to thrive now and the rallies are tough. Andreescu absolutely obliterated a couple of Halep’s serves to bring up 0-40, then Halep erased the danger with some quality counterpunching. Incredible work from Halep at deuce - she soaked up a series of big forehands, retrieved an Andreescu overhead and then immediately flipped the point, finishing with a forehand winner. First set: Andreescu 2-2* Halep: Well, it appears that Simona Halep has arrived. Some tough rallies end with Halep passing Andreescu at the net twice. First she easily retrieved an Andreescu dropshot, then held her ground and redirected a big Andreescu forehand past the Canadian at the net. High quality stuff.First set: Andreescu *2-1 Halep: Andreescu snatches the first break and she is already looking so sharp. Unsurprisingly, it’s the Canadian who is controlling most of these points early on and dictating the pace of the rallies. She hits a brilliant winning dropshot and then crushed a great inside-out forehand winner at 30-30. Halep isn’t dealing with her weight of shot well so far.First set: Andreescu 1-1* Halep: Andreescu levels up immediately, holding to 15. A couple of huge forehands from Andreescu, who is already serving big.First set: Andreescu *0-1 Halep: As expected, Andreescu us already showing off her variety. She opened the match by narrowly missing a volley the net, then slipped in a slick drop shot winner. Despite being pushed to deuce, Halep rallies out a deuce game to get her first hold.How will this match be won?Good question. The most striking part of Andreescu’s rise has been her style of play. She already possesses one of the biggest forehands in the world, she moves well, she returns extremely well and she can be really aggressive. But it’s her variety that has really set her apart she’ll throw in dropshots, loopy balls, net forays and she’ll try to break Halep’s rhythmHalep will have to soak up all of that pace and variety and she may look to move Andreescu with her angles. But this will be their first ever match-up so it will be fascinating to see how they try to outmanoeuvre and outthink each other.If Andreescu’s surname didn’t make it clear, the most notable aspect of this match-up is that Andreescu’s parents are Romanian. She spent some of her youth in Romania, speaks the language and proudly represents both parts of her heritage. Naturally, she considers Halep her idol.“Yeah, I just told her that she has to stop juniors because she’s strong enough to make the step,” said Halep“It’s amazing what she has done. To win a Grand Slam at 19, play few tournaments and win them, it’s a great, great job. I just want to tell her that she deserved because she played really well these tournaments.”Hello! Welcome to our coverage on day two of the WTA Finals in Shenzhen. The best eight players in 2019 will be battling throughout the week, and there are few better prospects than this upcoming battle between Bianca Andreescu and Simona Halep.No 4 Andreescu has been the sensation at the top of the game in 2019, breaking through in March with her title at Indian Wells as a wildcard, then stamping her spot at the top of the game when Angelique Keber infamously called her “the biggest drama queen ever”. After struggling with a bad shoulder injury, she only played one match the following four months. Upon her return, she immediately win the Rogers Cup at home in Canada before winning her first grand slam title at the US Open. Her win-loss record is an astounding 48-5.On the other hand, No 5 Simona Halep has been here before. This is her sixth(!) straight appearance at the WTA finals in 2014 and she has been by far the most consistent player in this period.

Her marriage to Laurence Olivier inevitably made her part of showbiz aristocracy but Plowright brought to British theatre a quality of earthiness and emotional directness shared by near-contemporaries such as Albert Finney, Peter O’Toole and Billie Whitelaw. As the daughter of a Lincolnshire newspaper editor, she could hardly be called working-class yet she was part of a movement that helped British theatre shed its aura of evasive gentility.You could, for the sake of convenience, ide Plowright’s working life into three phases: her Royal Court period, her National Theatre years and her post-National freelance career.Rather than catalogue her performances, I would pick out three that illustrate her capacity to give us the unvarnished truth. She came to prominence in the Royal Court of the 1950s but, although I missed her in The Country Wife and the double bill of Ionesco’s The Chairs and The Lesson, where she played a wizened crone and a preyed-on pupil, I did catch her as Beatie Bryant in Arnold Wesker’s Roots – which quickly became a landmark in postwar drama.The point about Beatie is that she is the daughter of Norfolk farmworkers who, on returning home, first parrots the opinions of her London boyfriend and then, when he fails to turn up, discovers her own voice. Wesker’s play is part of a long line, harking back to Shaw’s Pygmalion and anticipating Willy Russell’s Educating Rita, about female self-realisation. Everyone who saw it remembers the ecstasy that illumined Plowright’s features as she realised she was at last speaking, and thinking, for herself. But Plowright caught no less well Beatie’s potential for joy in the scene where she danced round the stage as her mother clapped to the rhythmic excitement of Bizet’s suite from L’Arlésienne.Olivier claimed to be “knocked off my feet by her performance”. By 1961 he and Plowright were married and she became a vital part of his inaugural Chichester Festival theatre seasons, which provided a launchpad for the National Theatre company. It can sometimes be tedious to bang on about old productions but anyone who wishes can still find on DVD Olivier’s Uncle Vanya which played at Chichester in 1962-63 and then at the Old Vic. It was one of the great Chekhov experiences of the 20th century, and Plowright’s performance as Sonya, hopelessly in love with Astrov (played by Olivier), was a model of stoic endurance in the face of unfulfilled passion.The great moment comes at the play’s end when Sonya is left alone with her uncle to face a future of loveless toil. It would be easy to play Sonya’s final consoling speech sentimentally. Instead Plowright, looking at the desolate features of Michael Redgrave as Vanya, struck a note of almost buoyant optimism as she claimed: “When our time comes, we shall die without a murmur … we shall see a light that is bright and lovely and beautiful … we shall rest.” Plowright caught perfectly Sonya’s note of defiant faith in a way that brought tears to my eyes at the time, and that still does when I watch or listen to that performance.Plowright went on to do many fine things at the National including a strong-willed Maggie in Hobson’s Choice, leading her chosen groom off to the marriage bed by his ears, a deeply sensual Masha in Three Sisters and a single-minded Portia in The Merchant of Venice who first preaches mercy and then displays a vindictive cruelty to Shylock. She was an integral part of the National company at the Old Vic, but the determination to avoid any sense of favouritism – and the fact that she had three young children to bring up – meant that her potential was not always fulfilled. I would love to have seen her play Cleopatra, Lady Macbeth, or Hedda Gabler.After the National, however, Plowright achieved much. She did Shakespeare at Chichester, Chekhov in the West End, two fine plays by Eduardo di Filippo and enjoyed a late-blossoming film career often under the direction of Franco Zeffirelli. But, if I had to pick out one performance that revealed her unrivalled capacity for earthy truthfulness and emotional honesty, it would be that as Poncia in Nuria Espert’s production of Lorca’s The House of Bernarda Alba at the Lyric Hammersmith, and then the West End, in 1986. The character is the servant to the tyrannical heroine (played by Glenda Jackson). Everything about this performance was perfect, from the way Plowright evoked a lifetime of household drudgery, by smoothing the nap of folded linen, to the hint that she shared the same longing for life and gaiety as Bernarda Alba’s imprisoned daughters.This is a quality that has characterised much of Plowright’s work: the ability to combine down-to-earth practicality and common sense with an irrepressible joie de vivre. From reading Plowright’s fascinating memoirs, And That’s Not All, you realise how much the National in its early years – and Olivier in particular – owed to her quiet wisdom. Looking back over her rich career is to be reminded of how much she has been a force for change in British acting."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c9f305632f420dd260ea247f89bfb51f51602b37/0_421_2000_1201/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6583e4e7b8d70b7c85244d7f5da61fb8","title":"lenny henry review watford colosseum","story":"Watford ColosseumThe comedian has his buddy Jon Canter tee up one big-name anecdote after another in a cosy night that pays tribute … to himselfAt one point in his touring show, Lenny Henry recalls a Tiswas sketch he took part in that riffed on the once popular TV show This Is Your Life. Its host Eamonn Andrews may be long dead but his spirit lives on in the fashion for tours like Henry’s: staged autobiographies, liberally illustrated with clips and celebrity anecdotes from his illustrious career. Henry’s offering – to promote his memoir Who Am I, Again? – typifies what’s good, and what’s insufferable, about the genre. It offers perspective on the man and his remarkable career, inspiring affection and respect. But by the end, after an inauthentic second-act Q\u0026ampA, I found it off-puttingly cosy and self-admiring.Others may differ but, for me, employing someone to interview you on stage – to ask toadying (and obviously scripted) questions about your recent PhD, acting success and charity work – is unbecoming. Particularly for a comedian, from whom we’re entitled to demand something more subversive or self-ironic than this. It’s not that the results aren’t passably entertaining, but no more so than a TV chat show, as Henry’s pal Jon Canter tees up one clubbable big-name anecdote after another, or asks just the right question to prompt Henry’s rubbish rap about the new black family on Coronation Street.The show begins as Henry bounds on stage to announce “I’m 61!” – the age, he says, when people want to tell their life story. It’s a little disingenuous, given that several previous shows covered the same material (on his strict mum on his childhood torn between Dudley and Jamaica) as this one. But fair enough: he tells the stories well, replete with slides and readings from his book. He has the audience mimic his mum’s “Jamaican laugh”. He tells a horror story about setting his childhood home on fire and a cheerful one about the friendly flasher in his local park.His mother dominates proceedings as she did Lenny’s youth, even if the tales of her authoritarian parenting seem familiar. Henry acknowledges as much, then hits us with a story that’s his alone, about revelations on the other side of his family, and a feeling that he “fell between two dads”. Racism features, too, in the story of a friendship crudely sundered with a white boy next door.The memoir runs from 1958 to 1980, or “birth to Tiswas”, Henry tells us. So it is disappointing that the narrative ends just as he was finding success – beautiful and fresh-faced at only 16 – on TV’s New Faces talent show. The footage of his act – both boy and era a weird mix of innocent and compromised – is mesmerising. Then the story abruptly stops, substituted for a Q\u0026ampA hopping across Henry’s five-decade career. The focus of the first act is squandered, although the conversation does prompt interesting remarks from Henry about the overlap between “h’integration” (as urged by his mum) and mimicry, the skill with which he made his name.The show could use more of these deeper, harder-won reflections on Henry’s bifurcated sense of self as a pioneering black entertainer of mainstream audiences. Instead, we get backstage gossip about Dustin Hoffman, and Henry’s loving Tommy Cooper tribute act. He seems less at ease with himself in this second act, as if he senses the format is phoney. I left liking the man but wishing he’d created a more coherent, less self-congratulatory show.

There is still very clearly more work to do. This work never ends.” Speaking about his daughter, Russell told the BBC: “I think Molly probably found herself becoming depressed. She was always very self-sufficient and liked to find her own answers. I think she looked towards the internet to give her support and help. She may well have received support and help, but what she also found was a dark, bleak world of content that accelerated her towards more such content.”He said the algorithms used by some online platforms “push similar content towards you” based on what you have been looking at.He said: “I think Molly entered that dark rabbit hole of depressive suicidal content. Some were as simple as little cartoons – a black and white pencil drawing of a girl that said: ‘Who would love a suicidal girl?’ Some were much more graphic and shocking.”Andy Burrows, the head of child safety online policy at the NSPCC, said the move did not change the fact that the industry as a whole was irresponsible, and called on the government to progress legislation intended to impose a duty of care on social media platforms.“Molly’s death should be a galvanising moment to act,” Burrows said, “but the reality is while Instagram has taken positive steps the rest of the tech industry has been slow to respond – on self-harm, suicide and other online harms.“As Ian Russell says there is a pressure of time and there is a price for not moving quickly enough, which is children’s lives. That is why the government needs to introduce a draft bill to introduce the duty of care regulator by next Easter and commit to ensuring it tackles all the most serious online threats to children.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c17b6944bfd55a04eed306570eab25abbb8201c4/133_262_4318_2590/master/4318.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2f2a151afc6cd9077efabfe911283273","title":"dafne keen his dark materials lyra bbc philip pullman","story":"Facing down fascists in the BBC’s Philip Pullman adaptation is child’s play for an actor whose improv left Wolverine speechless. The prodigy talks jellyfish, religion and her night out with Lin-Manuel MirandaDafne Keen does not much look like Lyra Belacqua, at least not as Philip Pullman describes her in His Dark Materials. In Northern Lights, the first book of the trilogy, she is “like a half-wild cat”, with dirty fingernails, green eyes and grubby blond-ish hair. Keen, who is half British, half Spanish and lives in Madrid, is darker and is already the master of an intense glare, as anyone who saw her alongside Hugh Jackman in the Wolverine swansong Logan will know. When we meet, in a London hotel, she has the self-possessed cool of a total pro, even at 14. But there are plenty of Lyra-esque flourishes that make it obvious why she got the part.She was almost 12 when she finished filming Logan. She had heard about the BBCHBO adaptation of His Dark Materials, then in its early stages, and sent in an audition tape. But she didn’t hear back. “I thought, never mind, I’ll just carry on with my life,” she says. “Which is when I got stung by the jellyfish.” The production team had finally replied, asking her to make another tape. Keen was on holiday in Puerto Rico. “I thought, right, I’m going to have a chilled-out swim and then I’m going to get ready. I suddenly felt this thing on my face and then it started stinging and then it expanded all over my face. I ran to my mum and I went, ‘Mum! Is it really red?’ My mum went, ‘No it’s fine.’ And then she went, ‘Oh no, it’s not fine.’” Her face was red and swollen but she had to do the tape. “So my audition is with a jelly-face,” she smiles.The next step was to meet Ruth Wilson, who plays Mrs Coulter, one of the best evil characters in children’s literature. “I was sitting in the waiting room with 20 other girls,” Keen remembers. “I was thinking, oh god, they’re all blond. I don’t physically look like this character, and these girls all do. I went in, shook hands with Ruth, and five minutes later, she looked at me and said, ‘You know, you have the same eyebrows as me.’” Fans of the books will know that this is a big thumbs up. Days later, she began rehearsals, with Wilson and puppets. In Pullman’s books, people have daemons, an animal manifestation of their “inner self”, which lives alongside them. Because the daemons on screen are CGI, the actors shot their scenes with puppets to make their interactions as authentic as possible.Naturally, Keen is practised at describing what her own daemon would be, were this world to have daemons in it. “Mine is quite easy to figure out, because it’s what everyone called me on set. Everyone calls me Monkey.” In the books, daemons change form until their human reaches adulthood, when they settle as one fixed animal. Keen particularly liked hers as a pine marten.We meet the morning after the world premiere of His Dark Materials, which was the first time Keen had watched it. “Everybody had seen it apart from me! I’m really busy filming season two, so I had no time to watch it. I had Philip Pullman right next to me, and I was like, oh god! But I think he liked it.” Did he offer his approval? “His wife came up to me and was really lovely and was saying I was the perfect Lyra. I was really happy to hear that.”Keen had not read the trilogy before she auditioned. “Now I’m a massive, massive fan. As soon as I read the books, I knew this was a good message to the world, and it’s important that we have stories about young girls, because there aren’t many,” she says. At the premiere, Jack Thorne, who wrote the screenplay, likened Lyra to Greta Thunberg. Though she does not know it, the future of the world rests on Lyra’s shoulders, and she has to fight tooth and nail to defeat the forces that wish to suppress free will and independent thought. Keen approves of the Thunberg comparison. “I am genuinely in awe of that girl.”There have been various adaptations of His Dark Materials over the years: a Radio 4 series, a play at the National Theatre and the 2007 Hollywood attempt, The Golden Compass, with Nicole Kidman and Daniel Craig. It was supposed to be a trilogy, but only the first was made – and Pullman’s theme of an abusive authoritarian religious body was watered down almost beyond recognition. The television series seems more comfortable with its source material, and its Magisterium, the governing body of the Church, is portrayed as a fascist regime.In 2007, the Catholic League called for a boycott of The Golden Compass, despite the religious references being excised, and the Vatican also denounced the film and Pullman’s writing. Keen had seen it – was she aware that this new version might be controversial, given the backlash the movie attracted? “I thought that was sad, but I understand why they had to do it,” she reasons, diplomatically, of the decision to soften the book’s themes. “But I think people are reading too much into it. When Philip writes about the Magisterium, he’s not bringing down the church, he’s bringing down the system.”Keen was born and raised in Spain and is bilingual. Her mother María is Spanish, and as well as being her acting coach is also an actor, as is Keen’s father Will. He has a part in His Dark Materials, as Father MacPhail, part of the Magisterium faithful. “He is terrifying,” says Keen. “He always plays bad people. I don’t know why because he’s so nice. I genuinely think it’s because he’s bald and has green eyes.” She practically grew up in a theatre rehearsal room, because of her parents, but she thought she would be a biologist, like David Attenborough. “Then I found out you have to study biology, and to do that you have to study maths, and I went, mmm no, I’m not doing that. I hate maths so much, you can’t even imagine.”A friend of her mother’s was making a short film, and needed a child for it, so Keen gave acting a go. She loved it. She did a series in Spain, The Refugees, alongside her father. (“He was playing my evil father, yes. Always got to give it the psychopathic twist.”) She picked up an agent, who put her forward for Logan, and she got down to an audition with Jackman. “In the waiting room, once again, there was this perfect LA beautiful blond girl. I was just, like, a small, scrappy Latin girl. I always think it’s not going to work out for me, and then it went really great.” She auditioned with Jackman, then asked if she could try again, only this time she said she’d like to improvise the scene. She was 11. “My heart was beating big time,” she says. “I thought, I’m just going to e in and ask them, and they loved it, so I was lucky.”Right now, Keen is preparing to go back to Wales to film season two, which loosely adapts The Subtle Knife, the second book in the trilogy. The third season, which will take on the astonishingly ambitious The Amber Spyglass, may take a little longer to pull together. Still, she is happy to live as Lyra for a while yet. She has taken plenty of her away from the experience already. “She taught me to speak up. Be bold, be brave, be yourself. Don’t follow rules, because rules can be useful, but they can be very stupid and pointless,” she says – sounding very much like her Lyra herself."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0c1af67f847dd5115fd033d4a11e73bcdfa0910f/0_0_4000_2401/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fbc64917dc09c48d4d5a0054004342d5","title":"virtual insanity how facebooks woes made silicon valley unmissable tv","story":"As it returns for the last time, Mike Judge’s tech comedy feels thrillingly urgent, thanks to uncanny parallels with the real world. My God we need it now more than everIt would be very easy not to be excited about the return of Silicon Valley. It’s been off the air for almost a year and a half, which meant it has faded from the conversation a little in its downtime. Executive producer Alec Berg has shifted focus to the darker and more exciting Barry. The cast has been waylaid, either by Oscar success (Kumail Nanjiani), career-ending allegations (TJ Miller) or unexpected interviews about their open relationship (Thomas Middleditch). Add to that the fact that the plot of Silicon Valley has been stuck in a pattern of thwarted success for what feels like years and, well, expectations aren’t high.But my god, we need Silicon Valley more than ever right now. Its final season, which begins in the UK tonight, sees the show as strong as it has ever been, perhaps even stronger. The series opens with Richard Hendricks (Middleditch) facing a Senate committee about the ethics of big tech. There is no possible way that the timing could have been better to see Hendricks facing the government – sweating and stuttering and gulping like a misprogrammed android – is to immediately recall Mark Zuckerberg’s systematic dismantling at the hands of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez last week. It’s so uncanny that you could be forgiven for thinking it was a last-minute rewrite. The fact that it wasn’t only speaks to how necessary Silicon Valley is.Better still, the show seems emboldened by its proximity to the finish line. Where before it always seemed to be playing a cute game of cat and mouse with the tech industry, this time Silicon Valley comes out with murder in its eyes. Time after time it takes big, explicit swings at the moral decay at the heart of big tech. Promises about data privacy are waved awaywith knowing references to Google and Facebook’s corporate spiel.So aggressively anti-monopoly is Silicon Valley this year that it even manages to evoke some level of sympathy for Gavin Belson, the crazed billionaire antagonist of the series, who finds himself outgunned by a larger real-life competitor. But the core of the show is still Hendricks, an awkward man with a grand vision, whose dream to build a more democratic version of the internet is slowly eaten away by all the moral and ethical compromises he has to make along the way. Now that he has finally reached the exalted position he has always longed for, those compromises are far bigger, and their consequences reach much further.Not that this is perfect. Even in its last stretch, Silicon Valley has a DineshGilfoyle problem, where they’re forced into an insignificant and easily resolved B-story just because the creators can’t think of anything better to do with them. And this is a shame, because Martin Starr and Kumail Nanjiani could easily handle something with more weight.But that’s a minor concern because – thrillingly – this is the most Mike Judge the show has ever felt. In its final race to the end, Silicon Valley has become as scathing about its subject matter as Office Space was about employment and Idiocracy was about the decline of society. You can smell the blood in Judge’s nose this time around. Silicon Valley’s weakest aspect has always been its unwillingness to race ahead, often meekly resetting itself after every big plot point. But this time, if the show can keep up the pace of the premiere, then nobody will be left alive. I can’t wait."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ec66db34fd1cf0d9c49f924fab90c887841e73d7/0_0_3800_2281/master/3800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=77b783aefab44dcb97885000b9a567b0","title":"argentina election macri out as cristina fernandez de kirchner returns to office as vp","story":"Victory of Alberto Fernández’s presidential campaign puts an end to the pro-business economic policies of Macri’s administrationIn a dramatic comeback, Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, one of Argentina’s most popular presidents during her two terms in 2007-2015, has been voted back into office as vice president.A large crowd of supporters burst into a roar outside the Frente de Todos (Everybody’s Front) party bunker in the Chacarita neighbourhood of the capital city of Buenos Aires at 9pm when preliminary official results gave the victory to the centre left presidential candidate Alberto Fernández and his running mate Fernández de Kirchner.Incumbent Mauricio Macri conceded defeat on Sunday night, telling supporters at his headquarters that he had called Fernández to congratulate him and invited him for a breakfast chat on Monday at the Pink Presidential Palace.“We need an orderly transition that will bring tranquility to all Argentinians, because the most important thing is the wellbeing of all Argentinians,” Macri said.President-elect Fernández, who assumes office on 10 December, is a moderate Peronist who has pledged to respect the $57bn IMF loan taken out by Macri last year to try and salvage Argentina’s creaking economy while promising to improve wages and benefits for workers and pensioners.His victory was widely expected and car horns started sounding non-stop in Buenos Aires after polling booths closed at 6pm on Sunday celebrating his victory.In one quiet neighbourhood, a group of bicycle delivery workers– one of the few job opportunities available for young people during Macri’s administration – rode through the streets tinkling their bells ecstatically celebrating the end of hisgovernment. Argentina’s elections, traditionally held the last Sunday of October, coincided this year with the ninth anniversary of the death from a sudden heart attack of Néstor Kirchner, the husband and predecessor in office of Fernández de Kirchner. During his 2003-2007 administration Kirchner led Argentina’s recovery from its economic collapse and monumental foreign debt default in 2001-2002.Cristina Fernández served as president from 2007 to 2015. By the time she left office she was entangled in a string of court cases involving accusations of bribery, money laundering, corruption and allegations that she had helped cover up Iran’s involvement in a terrorist bombing that prosecutor was investigating. Some of the corruption cases are ongoing. She denies any wrongdoing.The memory of the period of sustained economic growth in the 2000s, during which time Fernández was cabinet chief, played an important part in the election campaign.Reflecting his confidence in an easy win, Fernández, an amateur musician who enjoys hanging out with rock stars, spent a relaxed Saturday afternoon playing guitar and singing 1960s and 70s Argentine rock songs with Gustavo Santaolalla, the Argentine musician who won two consecutive Academy Awards for Brokeback Mountain and Babel in 2005-2006. A short video of the impromptu jam uploaded by Fernández’s spokesman Juan Pablo Biondi soon reached over 170 thousand views on Twitter.On Saturday Fernández de Kirchner visited her husband’s mausoleum in the Patagonian city of Río Gallegos and Sunday midday she was greeted by a large adoring crowd at the polling booth. “This is such an important day for democracy,” Fernández de Kirchner said to journalists after voting."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a41ea055d9551130848838472eb69a7a011f1a58/0_171_5046_3028/master/5046.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b0a382e2798fb3394f37cb94652ee9f7","title":"barcelona tourist industry cost lost week of rioting","story":"Still reeling from the collapse of Thomas Cook, Spain’s tourist industry is now counting the cost of prolonged rioting in Barcelona, the nation’s most popular urban destination.A week of violent and destructive disturbances over the jailing of Catalan political leaders left the city with a clean-up bill estimated at €3m but it is feared that the images of airport chaos, running battles with police and flaming barricades will cost the city a great deal more.“Last week was a lost week from the point of view of restaurateurs,” Pallarols said. “Things are quiet now but if this continues restaurants will have to lay off staff because the profit margins are very small.”“There was a lot of damage but at least, unlike the gilets jaunes in Paris, the demonstrators didn’t set out to destroy shops and restaurants.”Manel Casals, head of the Barcelona hoteliers association, said there have been cancellations but relatively few, although he has no figures as yet. “What we are seeing is fewer people are making reservations than is normal at this time of year.”The same is happening with Airbnb and other holiday apartment platforms. According AirDNA, which analyses the short-term rental market, reservations for the week from 14 October, when the protests began, were down by nearly 1,000 on the same week last year, from 12,515 to 11,537.As well as tourism, Barcelona is one of the world’s favourite conference venues. There are conferences every day of the week but the real money-spinner is the Mobile World Conference. Last year the 100,000 visitors to the congress spent €473m while creating 14,000 temporary jobs. The current contract with the city expires in 2023.“Conferences are organised a long way in advance and aside from an American convention I don’t know of any cancellations,” said Christoph Tessmar, director of the Barcelona Tourism Convention Bureau. “In recent years Barcelona has had to confront major crises but has maintained its position as a world leader for conferences, although the images we’ve seen in recent days could have a negative impact in the short term.”Barcelona is also the cruise capital of the Mediterranean. At least three cruise ships carrying a total of 6,000 passengers opted not to dock in the city during the disturbances. However, the financial impact will have been felt more by the port authorities than the city as cruise passengers spend little when they go ashore.According to the government, ports, railways and airports between them have lost about €4m as a result of the protests. Altogether, around 175,000 travellers were affected either by cancellations or delays caused by road blocks.For now, everyone is banking on Barcelona’s famed capacity for resilience. During the crisis in 2017, when the city was rocked by both a terrorist attack and the illegal declaration of independence, thousands of businesses moved their headquarters out of Catalonia. However, the city bounced back and Sans believes that the political uncertainty in 2017 made the situation worse than it is now.“These events can damage the city’s image but this conflict isn’t going to continue forever and we’ll get back to normal,” said Gabriel Jené, president of Barcelona Oberta. “We’re more worried about the ability of politicians to deal with the conflict than the capacity of the city to overcome it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/883b02ece11302d32193053815dc1aed5d2e3417/0_30_3200_1920/master/3200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=72ad53126663f85102e6005177517c91","title":"belgium first female pm sophie wilmes","story":"Caretaker leader replaces Charles Michel, who will be European council presidentBelgium’s first female prime minister in its 189-year history has taken office, after Sophie Wilmès was named as the head of the country’s next caretaker government.Wilmès succeeds the liberal leader Charles Michel, who will become president of the European council on 1 December. Her role has been described as a poisoned chalice, as linguistically ided parties struggle to form a government.Belgium has had a caretaker government since December last year when Michel’s four-party coalition collapsed as the Flemish nationalists quit in protest at a UN migration pact.Elections in late May failed to yield a fresh government and reinforced the country’s political ide, with the wealthier Dutch-speaking Flemish north voting in large numbers for the nationalist right, while the francophone south handed victory to traditional socialists.Describing her appointment as a “great honour and a great responsibility”, Wilmès acknowledged leading a caretaker government “does not leave us with much opportunity to act” and urged the formation of a fully fledged government as soon as possible.Belgium went 541 days without a government in 2010-11, a world record for a country in peacetime. Northern Ireland’s Stormont assembly and executive, which has not sat for more than 1,000 days, overtook the Belgian total in August 2018, but is not considered eligible for the record since laws can still be passed at Westminster.Wilmès, 44, has had a rapid rise in politics since joining Belgium’s federal government in 2015 as budget minister. Born in Brussels to a political family, she began her political career as a local councillor in the Belgian capital. Wilmès was later elected to local government in Rhode Saint-Genèse (Sint-Genesius-Rode), one of six Flemish communes encircling Brussels that have large French-speaking minorities, leading to frequent disputes over language rights.Her task as prime minister is complicated by being a member of the francophone liberal party, which lost ground in the May elections and is only the fourth-largest party.Wilmès is seen as an ally of the outgoing prime minister and has been criticised in the fiscally conservative northern Flanders region for not doing more to deliver a balanced budget.The Dutch-language daily De Standaard pointed out Wilmès was little known in Flanders, but said she spoke good Dutch and had “a good dose of charisma”.In a front-page editorial, Le Soir said her nomination was “an elevator to the scaffold”, calling Wilmès a prime minister that hid a political vacuum. While describing her appointment as a big step forward for women in Belgium, the leader writer Béatrice Delvaux accused the country’s politicians of “great hypocrisy”. She pointed out Michel’s government had failed to reach gender parity during its five years in office."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/93480ef866e69649d6dd8b166ac6747716da0de7/0_0_1654_992/master/1654.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=37b4c5ac9754cd645072f06210505517","title":"samira ahmed takes on the bbc in landmark equal pay case","story":"Presenter claims being paid one-sixth of Jeremy Vine’s pay amounts to unfair treatmentAhmed was cheered when she arrived at the central London employment tribunal on Monday morning. She was accompanied by colleagues and supporters, including the BBC Breakfast show presenter Naga Munchetty and the broadcaster Aasmah Mir.Ahmed will demand hundreds of thousands of pounds in back pay for her work on the BBC programme Newswatch, which she has presented since 2012 and received £440 an episode for. She will claim her male equivalent at the broadcaster was Jeremy Vine, who was paid as much as £3,000 a show for his work on the Points of View programme.Ahmed’s legal case, supported by the National Union of Journalists (NUJ), will argue both Newswatch and Points of View are presenter-led programmes lasting about 15 minutes that offer the public the opportunity to air their views on BBC content, and that she has a right to equal pay for equal work. The corporation’s legal team, however, will argue the two presenters were not doing the same or similar work because the programmes are different formats for different audiences.Although Ahmed was accompanied by female BBC colleagues, many were reluctant to talk to journalists owing to their work for the organisation, while some are also pursuing pay complaints.Another supporter, the poet Lemn Sissay, who is the chancellor of the University of Manchester, said he wanted to show solidarity with Ahmed and all the women bringing equal pay cases against the BBC.“I would hope if I was in a similar situation, people would support me too. Like Samira, I love the BBC and this action is for the betterment of the BBC. We are here to improve the practice of an organisation that we love,” he said.“I love my job on Newswatch, despite it being difficult and challenging,” Ahmed said in a statement. “I know that it is an important part of demonstrating the BBC service to all its audiences and the licence-fee payers.“I have a sense of pride working for a public service broadcaster which seeks to represent the ersity of Britain and its licence-fee payers.“On the back of my BBC ID card are written the BBC values, which include ‘we respect each other and celebrate our ersity’ and ‘we take pride in delivering quality and value for money’. I just ask why the BBC thinks I am worth only a sixth of the value of the work of a man for doing a very similar job.”The case will be heard at the central London employment tribunal over the next seven days."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fee70b54e34ff759af4913f4cac4dab07f39e437/147_0_4637_2783/master/4637.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=25dc181dbb5501a7726c668ee5e9ae5a","title":"umbria election salvini and italy rightwing berlusconi donatella tesei","story":"Donatella Tesei, backed by Matteo Salvini’s League and Silvio Berlusconi, appears set to win in centre-left Italian strongholdMatteo Salvini’s political fortunes have been given a boost after an exit poll by Italy’s state broadcaster pointed to a win for a rightwing coalition backed by his League party in a regional election in Umbria.The vote in the traditional centre-left stronghold, which has a population of less than 900,000, restores impetus to Salvini after his political blunder that saw the League lose power nationally this summer.The hard-right leader walked out of government with the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement in August, expecting to trigger a national election that polls predicted he would win. Instead, 5-Star struck a deal with the centre-left Democratic party (PD), shunting Salvini into opposition.However the initial indications from Umbria suggest the new 5-StarPD alliance has failed its first electoral test.The League chief had criss-crossed landlocked Umbria for weeks, promoting his national pledge to introduce a flat-tax rate many economists say Italy cannot afford, but which the League insists is needed to revive the sluggish economy.Umbria marks the eighth straight victory for the centre-right in regional ballots since the last national election, in March 2018.More important tests lie ahead that could potentially undermine the new national government.In December, the poor southern region of Calabria goes to the polls and it will be the turn on 26 January of Emilia Romagna, a northern region with more than four times the population of Umbria and which is the historic heartland of Italy’s left."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Organisation is recognised for eliminating three landfill sites and creating community recycling system over 20 yearsSinn F\u0026eacutein\u0026rsquos Martin Kenny supports plan to house asylum seekers in BallinamoreMan arrested at Dublin Port \u0026lsquoof interest\u0026rsquo, UK police sayThe scene at Emyvale Garda station has been preserved for a forensic examinationOne-third of the IT equipment outstanding issued to ex-senator James HeffernanComplaints about Niall Collins, Timmy Dooley and Barry Cowen to be consideredGreen Party\u0026rsquos rising star will back a coalition with commitments and wants a new type of politicianGarda action and increased drug consumption are contributing to higher detectionsLack of demand casts doubt on Department of Education\u0026rsquos planning by demographicsMore disposable income means people are spending more on drugs, says Garda sourceEssex Police seeking man in relation to deaths of 31 women and eight menGarda\u0026iacute and drug workers say cocaine is being used in even the smallest rural villageUnion says driving bus in \u0026lsquoconcrete jungle\u0026rsquo is \u0026lsquoonerous\u0026rsquo and will bring findings to pay talksConcerns raised over proximity to \u0026Aacuteras, housing crisis and \u0026lsquoharassment\u0026rsquo of deerProposal for minimum passing distance previously shelved after AG concernsConsultants to be commissioned to advise on shape of central core of health authorityDUP leader Arlene Foster criticises \u0026lsquotrite\u0026rsquo comments about \u0026lsquored letter boxes\u0026rsquoThe capital\u0026rsquos people show their supportive side for the race\u0026rsquos 22,500 competitors"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4057998.1571674594!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"the irish times most nominated in newsbrands shortlist 2019","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tRosita Boland with her trophy at the 2018 Newsbrands Ireland journalism awards Photograph: Simon CarswellThe  has received 32 nominations in the shortlist for the NewsBrands Journalism Awards 2019 – the highest number for a publication in this year’s competition.The NewsBrands Journalism Awards are open to any work published in print, website, online, mobile, video, audio or any other news delivery format from any NewsBrands Ireland member title.Five of the six journalists shortlisted in the Foreign Coverage category write for The : Sally Hayden Derek Scally Suzanne Lynch Lara Marlowe and Patrick Freyne.The  received four of the six nominations for Best Use of Video, citing the work of Simon Carswell, Kathleen Harris, Enda O’Dowd and Bryan O’Brien.Jack Power of The  was nominated in three categories Business Story of the Year Investigative Journalism and Young Journalist of the Year.  reporter Sarah Burns was also shortlisted as Young Journalist of the Year as was current  reporter Shauna Bowers for her past work at The Times, Ireland edition.Markets Correspondent Joe Brennan is shortlisted for Business Journalist of the Year.In the Campaigning Journalism category, The ’ No Child campaign has been shortlisted.Fintan O’Toole and Hilary Fannin are both nominated in the Broadsheet Columnist category, while in the Critic of the Year category The  has four writers shortlisted: Catherine Cleary Patrick Freyne Niamh Donnelly and Fintan O’Toole.Three  writers are shortlisted in the Features Broadsheet Writer of the Year: Rosita Boland, Conor Gallagher and Conor Pope.Carl O’Brien is nominated, along with Power, in the Investigative Journalism category.

Photograph: EPAPATRICK SEEGEREU ambassadors have agreed to accept the UK’s request for a Brexit “flextension” until January 31st 2020, European Council president Donald Tusk has said.Just three days before the United Kingdom was due to leave the EU on October 31st at 11pm, the bloc agreed to delay the deadline by three months or until the UK parliament ratify the deal.The UK will be allowed time to have a general election ahead of Brexit and may leave the EU on the 1st of any month until that date once the withdrawal agreement is ratified by the CommonsMr Johnson, who won the top job by pledging – “do or die” – to deliver Brexit on October 31st, was forced by opponents to request a delay after he was defeated in parliament over the sequencing of the ratification of his orce deal.Written procedureFormally speaking, the ambassadors set in train the “written procedure” for approval of decisions by leaders in the absence of a a full summit. That will happen after the UK signals its acceptance of the extension, likely to be through its ambassador to the EU, and is expected to be completed without difficulty within 24 hours.The UK had previously been granted an extension to Friday, and is required under the terms of its Benn Act to accept the EU’s offer of extension to January 31st unless the Commons votes it down.The agreed delay comes ahead of crucial votes in the UK Commons on Monday on proposals from the government and opposition Liberal Democrats to call a general election in December. Labour, whose vote would be crucial to the government motion, has been waiting until the EU spelled out the precise duration of any extension.But reports from London suggest that the government may circumvent the need for a two-thirds majority on its motion by backing a Liberal Democrat amendment to the Fixed Term Parliament Act setting December 9th as a date for the election.Simple majorityThat would require only a simple majority. If it does,\u0026nbspLabour’s position becomes moot.However, the general election would take place before any vote on the withdrawal bill,\u0026nbspraising the prospect that a new government could seek to renegotiate it.Although Mr Johnson would prefer to fight an election having secured Brexit, the Tories remain well ahead in the pollsBrexit has already been delayed twice – from March 29th and April 12th – after Mr Johnson’s predecessor, Theresa May, failed to get her deal through the British parliament.‘Averts risk’The Government welcomed the decision of the EU27 countries to grant another Brexit extension to the UK.“This averts the risk of a disruptive no deal Brexit,” said a Government spokesman. “The decision extends the deadline to the end of January but allows for an earlier exit by the UK if ratification is completed quickly.“We hope the extra time will be used to ensure that the withdrawal agreement between the UK and EU27 is ratified, enabling an orderly Brexit.”Fianna Fáil’s Brexit spokeswoman Lisa Chambers said that “more time” being created by the extension was welcome.“It prolongs the uncertainty, but it’s better than a crash out,” she tweeted.She said that “we have no idea” when a British general election will take place “or what it will throw up,” but warned that the next end of January deadline “won’t be long coming around.”Sources close to the Elysee confirmed over the weekend that France’s president Emmanuel Macron had accepted that the increased likelihood of an election in the UK had made his opposition to a three month extension less tenable.

His strict security made it impossible to communicate with supporters, aside from his sporadic and brief audio messages.Nor, by all accounts, was he involved in any of the group\u0027s day-to-day operations. The loss of Isil’s territory in March stripped him of the last of the trappings of his self-appointed role of caliph and made him little more than a fugitive in the desert.Indeed, reports circulating earlier this year suggested Isil had already chosen a potential successor, Abdullah Qardash, a former officer in Saddam Hussein’s army who quickly rose through Islamic State’s ranks.He first met Baghdadi, an Iraqi national whose real name was Ibrahim Awwad Ibrahim Ali Muhammad al-Badri al-Samarrai, while they were held by US forces in Camp Bucca detention centre in Basra over their links to al-Qaeda in 2003. It was there that Baghdadi forged close alliances with Qardash and a handful of other inmates, while refining his vision for the so-called caliphate.Qardash, who was born and studied Islamic studies in Iraq’s second city of Mosul, was nicknamed the “Professor” and the “Destroyer” and was recognised as a cruel and authoritarian leader within Isil.Whatever plans were being hashed out by Isil’s new leadership on the ground, in Washington US President Donald Trump was declaring it a “good day” for America.Reaction was more muted in the Middle East, where Isil’s victims continue to suffer the fallout of their terrifying five-year-reign. For them, the death of Baghdadi has not heralded a new, safer era. The US has killed the man, but not the ideology.Isil reportedly selected a successor to Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi earlier this yearBaghdadi tapped into a sense of Sunni grievance against the Shia and Alawite-led governments in Syria and Iraq, one that still continues to burn.“My concern is that Americans will think, from listening to Trump’s speech, that his job is done, that Daesh has been defeated,” said Tobias Ellwood, Conservative MP and former defence minister. “That simply isn’t true. We’ve seen Isis flags popping up again in places they had been chased out. We have no post-conflict strategy and it is absolutely not job done.“I’m afraid the region will only see extremism continue to grow.”Isil has already returned to its insurgent roots. In its former territory in eastern Syria and western Iraq, it carries out near-weekly sleeper cell attacks and suicide bombings.The main force that had been battling them in Syria, the Syrian Democratic Forces, were abandoned by the US earlier this month to continue that battle alone.Tens of thousands of devout followers held in prisons and detention camps in north-east Syria are waiting to regroup.Talk to any of the women in al-Hol detention camp and they will tell you they are waiting for the men to return for them and “reinstate the caliphate”. They see this period of “hardship” as simply a test from God of their commitment to the cause.“Baqiya,” they shout, the Arabic word for “remaining” – a reference to the Isil slogan “remaining and expanding”.Brexit latest news: EU agrees Brexit extension in major boost to Boris Johnson\u0026#39s hopes of securing Christmas electionComment: The Conservatives will only win the next election with a powerful vision for life after Brexit\tLook but don\u0026#39t touch: Tourists face on-the-spot fines for hassling Kyoto geishaComment: People\u0026#39s Vote never fooled anyone - no wonder it\u0026#39s tearing itself apartDonald Trump\u0026#39s decision to withdraw US troops from Syria \u0026#39jeopardised\u0026#39 Baghdadi missionComment: Fracking\u0026#39s time has passed already – Britain should be focused on clean energyComment: My fellow Brexiteers need to recognise that this is the endgameStrictly Come Dancing 2019, Halloween results: Catherine Tyldesley sent home after dance-off defeat to Mike BushellStrictly Come Dancing week 6 - Judi James on the body language. \u0026#39Success is Michelle and Giovanni moving in a sexy single unit\u0026#39Halloween 2019: How Celtic trick-or-treating and Gaelic turnip-carving led to the American celebrationWho will win Strictly Come Dancing 2019?

The message was clear - without new financing WeWork would run out of money within weeks.“Do you still believe in the company?” Neumann, who had stepped down as chief executive but was still WeWork\u0027s chairman, asked a room of JPMorgan bankers on the 42nd floor of their midtown Manhattan headquarters on 6 October, the sources said.The JPMorgan bankers, led by asset and wealth management chief executive Mary Erdoes and debt capital markets head Jim Casey, told Neumann and other WeWork directors they would back the company, and were confident they could raise the money. But they would not underwrite the deal on the spot, as one board member requested.With questions swirling around WeWork\u0027s chances of survival in the wake of its failed IPO, the bankers told Neumann they needed some time to sound out investors first, according to the sources.Created with Sketch.Tech giants to be hit by new tax in France Show all 7Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Amazon reported revenue of $232 billion worldwide in 2018Google\u0027s parent company reported revenue of $136 billion worldwide in 2018Apple reported revenue of $265 billion worldwide in 2018Facebook reported revenue of $55 billion worldwide in 2018Microsoft reported revenue of $110 billion worldwide in 2018Cisco reported revenue of $49 billion worldwide in 2018Criteo reported revenue of $2.3 billion worldwide in 2018Amazon reported revenue of $232 billion worldwide in 2018Google\u0027s parent company reported revenue of $136 billion worldwide in 2018Apple reported revenue of $265 billion worldwide in 2018Facebook reported revenue of $55 billion worldwide in 2018Microsoft reported revenue of $110 billion worldwide in 2018Cisco reported revenue of $49 billion worldwide in 2018Criteo reported revenue of $2.3 billion worldwide in 2018A few days later, an alternative rescue plan began to emerge from WeWork\u0027s largest shareholder, Japan\u0027s SoftBank.Both were far from perfect. But given its dire straits, WeWork was fortunate to have a choice.This account of how WeWork\u0027s financial rescue came together over the past three weeks is based on interviews with eight people with knowledge of the negotiations. They requested anonymity to discuss the confidential deliberations.WeWork, SoftBank and JPMorgan declined to comment for this story.Requests for an interview with Neumann were also declined.SoftBank offered $9.5bn\u0026nbspto WeWork, including new debt and recommitted equity, as well as a tender offer to partly cash out Neumann and other shareholders.In addition to providing more funds than JPMorgan, the SoftBank deal resolved what some WeWork directors privately referred to as the company\u0027s “corporate governance problem” - Neumann\u0027s controlling grip.SoftBank\u0027s deal would strip Neumann\u0027s voting power and remove him from the board. Neumann was blamed by other WeWork investors such as Benchmark Capital and China\u0027s Hony Capital, for the company\u0027s precipitous decline, some of the people said.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailHis erratic management style, combined with WeWork\u0027s lack of a clear path to profitability, alienated potential IPO investors.The problem was that Neumann could still wield power over the company even after he quit as chief executive\u0026nbspon 24 September because, as WeWork\u0027s founder, each of his shares had 10 voting rights. Others had only one vote for every share.WeWork staff outraged at former CEO’s payout while they face job cutsIt was clear to SoftBank, as well as to a special board committee formed to consider the financing plans, that Neumann relinquishing control would come with a price tag, three of the people said.In meetings in New York between Neumann and SoftBank Chief Operating Officer Marcelo Claure, the contours of a side deal came together. SoftBank would provide a $500 million credit line to refinance Neumann\u0027s personal borrowings made against WeWork\u0027s stock, as long as he used proceeds from cashing out up to $970m of his shares to repay SoftBank for that loan first.SoftBank\u0027s latest offer valued the company at as little as $5.9bn based on the repricing of warrants it was already committed to exercise, according to Bernstein research, a far cry from the $47 billion it had assigned to WeWork in January.Neumann\u0027s special pay-off did not stop there. He negotiated with SoftBank a four-year non-compete agreement with a $185 million “consulting fee” in return for stepping down from WeWork\u0027s board. He would now only get to observe board proceedings instead of participating.WeWork\u0027s special board committee members expressed concern that Neumann\u0027s bailout would cause outrage among many WeWork employees whose stock options had a much higher strike price than the valuation in SoftBank\u0027s tender offer, some of the people said.The committee declined to comment for this article.SoftBank\u0027s offer to buy up to $3bn of WeWork stock from employees and existing shareholders would value the company at about $8 billion, higher than the new valuation based on the warrants.Neumann attempted to push up the valuation of the tender offer in his negotiations with SoftBank, one of the people said.SoftBank stood firm. Anticipating criticism from its own shareholders for possibly throwing good money after bad, it wasn\u0027t prepared to pay more.Most WeWork directors wanted Neumann off the board, and many minority shareholders, which the special committee was formed to represent, wanted to cash out, the people said.Goldman Sachs profit hit by losses on investments in WeWork and UberWeWork\u0027s nosee is proof Adam Neumann can\u0027t walk on waterAs WeWork embraces big business, will it lose its cool?JPMorgan had not pursued raising additional money for shareholders, in part because WeWork only tasked the bank with delivering $5 billion of debt financing.When the bank submitted the debt package on Monday, only private equity firm Starwood Capital Group, run by real estate mogul Barry Sternlicht, had committed to join JPMorgan in sharing the financing burden.JPMorgan agreed to provide the rest and transfer the money by Thursday. But the deal also included a condition, known as a covenant, that would trigger a debt default if SoftBank did not make good on $1.5 billion that it had already committed to provide when warrants came due next April, the people said.JPMorgan wanted to ensure SoftBank would honour its financial commitment, which would lessen the risk for investors holding debt that would one day need to be repaid.But SoftBank told WeWork\u0027s board that it would not pay the $1.5bn if its financing offer was rejected, two of the people added.The problem from SoftBank\u0027s perspective was that those warrants were based on January\u0027s $47bn valuation of WeWork. It wanted to change the pricing radically to reflect WeWork\u0027s dramatic fall in value.JPMorgan dealmakers, on the other hand, believed WeWork\u0027s contract with SoftBank prevented the telecommunications and technology giant from reneging on that earlier commitment, other people familiar with the matter said.In the end, the risk that SoftBank wouldn\u0027t fulfill its commitment if the JPMorgan financing package was chosen helped swing the special committee\u0027s deliberations in favor of SoftBank\u0027s offer, they added.SoftBank had made WeWork an offer it had to accept.On Tuesday, SoftBank unveiled a deal that increased its ownership of WeWork to 80 per cent\u0026nbspfrom 30 per cent, but sought to avoid having to consolidate WeWork\u0027s liabilities on its balance sheet by not taking full control of the expanded board. SoftBank will only have 5 of the 10 seats.But unless SoftBank can turn WeWork around quickly, it could be a pyrrhic victory.WeWork has burned through almost $2.5bn\u0026nbspof cash since the end of June, and Claure will have to cut costs quickly, including slashing thousands of jobs and helping the company to find a way to get out of expensive leases. Otherwise, the new cash injection may not last long enough to stabilise the business.As predicted, Claure is also facing some staff anger over the size of Neumann\u0027s payout. He told employees on Wednesday that it was the “price” that had to be paid to get rid of Neumann\u0027s voting rights. Otherwise, he said, “Adam could do whatever he wanted.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Show all 30Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Photographer Colin Lane met the Strokes in early 2001, after being commissioned to shoot them for The Face magazine. The album cover happened by chance – after hanging out on another shoot a few weeks later, Lane heard the band’s art director hassling them to choose an album cover. He’d brought his portfolio with him, which included the now-infamous “ass shot”.230 29) The Notorious BIG – Ready to DieBiggie Smalls picked a baby resembling himself to star on the cover of his debut Ready to Die. By doing so, he summed up the album’s autobiographical content, which begins with childhood and closes with death. He also uses the notion of childhood innocence to foreshadow how our surroundings can have a lasting impact.It might not be the quintessential David Bowie album, or the one that introduced fans to Starman. But the face staring back at you from this particular album cover is, undeniably, the most recognisable Bowie look: red mullet a gaunt, sombre expression and that famous lightning bolt across his face.One of the greatest debut albums – and arguably the best hip hop record – of all time has a fittingly arresting cover image. A photo of a seven-year-old Nas was superimposed over Danny Clinch’s snapshot of one of the housing projects in the New York rapper’s native Queensbridge. Designed by Aimee Macauley, it was intended to reflect how the projects used to be Nas’s entire world, “until I educated myself to see there’s more out there”. But Nas was also inviting you to see through his eyes and into those very projects where he grew up, and feel immersed in that world via the power of his storytelling.Years after its release, Kate Bush noted how The Dreaming was deemed by many to be her “she’s gone mad” album. Its multiple, disparate narratives and metamorphic production intertwine with movie influences, particularly music hall crime capers of Houdini’s era. On the sepia-toned album cover, Bush plays the role of the escapist’s wife, looking to the distance, rather than at his face, as though trying to contact him via a different medium than mere speech. The way she holds his face in her hands gives her an additional, mesmerising power and conjures the old-world, eccentric mysticism with which she was – and still is – associated.Photographer Michael Spencer Jones had a task on his hands organising Oasis for what is indisputably their best album cover. It was different to what the band originally envisioned – Noel Gallagher had spotted a photo of the Beatles sat round a coffee in Japan, so thought Oasis could be photographed at the dining table of guitarist Bonehead’s house in Manchester. Jones didn’t see this working, so spread the members around Bonehead’s living room instead, and asked them to bring objects that were personal to them for decoration. Noel liked Jones’s idea of hanging an inflatable globe (brought by one of the roadies) from the ceiling. “Yeah, global dominance,” he said. Soon after the album’s release, that’s exactly what happened.Andy Warhol conceived the idea of a vinyl cover with working zipper that would reveal a pair of white briefs beneath the bulging jeans of a male model, who has to this day never been identified. Many fans assumed it was Mick Jagger, but people working on the shoot said several models were photographed and Warhol never revealed which one was used. It represented what the Rolling Stones quickly became famous for: an edgy, hyper-sexual kind of swagger.German painter Mati Klarwein – who also created Santana’s artwork for Abraxas – was behind this gatefold cover that served as an embodiment of Davis’s creative manifesto. The surreal and complex renderings mirror what Davis does with the music itself challenging traditional notions of structure and juxtaposing concepts of passivity and aggressiveness, anger and love.930 22) ACDC – Back in BlackBack in Black’s all-black cover design fit the mood of a band emerging from dark times. In the wake of the death of vocalist Bon Scott, ACDC had tracked down Brian Johnson, whom Scott had previously mentioned to the band. Certain people at their record label, Atlantic, weren’t so keen on the cover, but the band were insistent: it was a memorial to Scott. And now one of the most instantly recognisable and best-loved album covers in rock history.Visually striking and symbolic of what Debbie Harry was doing both as a woman and an artist in the music industry, Parallel Lines’ cover was shot by photographer Edo Bertoglio. It was apparently rejected by the band but later chosen by their manager, Peter Leeds. The juxtaposition between the band, who beam in their matching dress suits like a bunch of schoolboys at their senior prom, and Harry, who stands defiant in her white dress, hands on hips, is wonderful. “I’m not impressed,” her stance seems to say. “Try harder.”Dylan walks arm-in-arm with then-girlfriend and muse Suze Rotolo through the West Village in freezing New York, February 1963. Rotolo described the circumstances to the New York Times in 2008: “He wore a very thin jacket, because image was all. Our apartment was always cold, so I had a sweater on, plus I borrowed one of his big, bulky sweaters. On top of that I put on a coat. So I felt like an Italian sausage. Every time I look at that picture, I think I look fat.” Yet her memoir, A Freewheelin’ Time, also noted the cover’s significance, how it “influenced the look of album covers precisely because of its casual down-home spontaneity and sensibility”.Led Zeppelin couldn’t have picked a better image to serve as a visual introduction to their fans. It’s an easy tactic – using a photo from a real-life tragedy, in this case the Hinderburg disaster, for shock factor. But it worked, and the cover went on to become one of the most indelible images in rock music.1330 18) Never Mind the Bollocks – Here’s the Sex Pistols“The album will last. The sleeve may not,” said the adverts for the Sex Pistols’ first and only studio album in 1977. The Sex Pistols were already controversial before the release of Never Mind the Bollocks – Here’s the Sex Pistols. They’d caused nationwide uproar for swearing on live TV, been fired from two record labels, and been banned from a number of live venues in England. Using the word “bollocks” on the front of their artwork caused instant censorship, and more controversy that would only benefit its performance. Despite many major retailers refusing to sell it, the album debuted at number one on the UK album charts. Today, it is arguably the most recognisable punk album cover in music history.For a limited time, The Roots’ Grammy-nominated album Things Fall Apart was available with five different covers, which reflected each of the world’s “greatest turmoils”. The most enduring was a photograph taken during a Civil Rights Movement-era riot – a stark black and white image showing riot police as they chase two terrified black teenagers.Yes, Dark Side of the Moon, with Storm Thorgerson\u0027s geometric design, is the most iconic of Pink Floyd covers. But the shot he conceived for Wish You Were Here – taken by Aubrey ‘Po’ Powell – is by far the more visceral. It shows two businessmen shaking hands, with one of them on fire, and to the band it represented the fear of revealing your true feelings for fear of “getting burnt”. Two stuntmen were involved, with one (Ronnie Rondell Jr) dressed in a fire-retardant outfit covered by a business suit, and his head protected by a hood, covered beneath a wig. Unfortunately, high winds meant he lost his moustache and eyebrows to the flames. Hopefully he felt the resulting shot was worth it. Fans definitely think so.Just two of Fleetwood Mac’s then-five members appear on the cover of their best-selling and arguably greatest album. Stevie Nicks and Mick Fleetwood’s legs are entwined, which serves as a pretty good metaphor for the entanglement between band members that resulted in so many of the record’s lyrical back-and-forths. And really it’s just a gorgeous, classic image, photographed and conceived by Herbert W Worthington with the band, and designed by Desmond Strobel.The instantly iconic cover of It’s Blitz! shows little but says a lot. There’s a sense of female defiance in showing the woman’s hand, nails in red polish, crushing the egg, a symbol of fertility. It also embodies what the Yeah Yeah Yeahs did on this album, which is take traditional sounds, equipment and ideas and scramble them into something completely subversive.This shot was taken by celebrated photographer Herb Ritts, who later teamed up with Madonna for the “Like a Prayer” and “You Can Dance” covers. It is one of her most recognisable images, inspired in part by Andy Warhol’s pop art and also by the iconography of Madonna’s idol Marilyn Monroe. Here, she invites fans to make the immediate connection between pop art and commercial value, making her the first to exploit the late Eighties concept of pop artist as brand.The Clash paid tribute to Elvis Presley by mimicking the pink and green lettering from his 1956 self-titled album. Yet the image, one of the most iconic in rock history, blows that version of rock and roll to kingdom come: everything “safe” that the King had offered was replaced by Pennie Smith’s photograph of “the ultimate rock’n’roll moment – total loss of control”. Bassist Paul Simonon later told Fender that he’d smashed his guitar out of frustration with bouncers for not letting fans stand up from their seats at the Palladium in New York City. The captured moment is visceral, dangerous and anti-establishment – just like The Clash.Elvis Presley appears mid-belt on the cover of his self-titled album, clearly performing one of those iconic vocal whoops. It’s a visual introduction to rock’n’roll for his unsuspecting American audience, done 20 years before The Clash would replicate that classic pink and green lettering to do the same for their British fans.Six guys stare down toward the ground, one pointing a handgun right at the viewer. This is the cover art for Straight Outta Compton, the pioneering debut by NWA. The photographer was a 28-year-old white guy, Eric Poppleton, who was struggling to make ends meet after graduating from art school. He and his art director Kevin Hosman spent a day following the guys around alleys in LA, until Poppleton found a spot where he got on the ground and asked NWA’s members to stand over him, with one holding “what was hopefully an unloaded” gun. He had no idea the photograph would become one of the most iconic images in gangsta rap. Poppleton would go on to shoot four other NWA album covers.2230 9) Bruce Springsteen – Born in the USAThe Boss tells you everything you need to know about him with one image. An epitome of the blue collar American, Springsteen’s seventh album cover was shot by Annie Leibowitz and shows the artist’s from behind, dressed in worn blue jeans and a simple white t-shirt, with a red cap hanging out of the back pocket after a long day’s grind. “We took a lot of different types of pictures,” said Springsteen, “and in the end, the picture of my ass looked better than the picture of my face.” Combined with the American flag in the background, the cover parallels the themes of Springsteen’s music.An album cover that would inspire future generations of bands to slouch moodily against brick walls. The Ramones were near-impossible to gather together for a posed photograph, but Robert Bayley – a photographer for Punk magazine, managed to get a shot that captured the band perfectly. Wearing ripped jeans and leather jackets, they stare blankly at the camera through sunglasses, or fringes that half-conceal their eyes.Few album covers can profess to have literally stopped traffic, and it’s testament to the iconic status of Abbey Road’s artwork that thousands of fans have attempted to recreate it. The band, and photographer Iain McMillan, had just 10 minutes to get the shot, which was taken from a step-ladder while a police officer held up traffic behind the scenes. Six photos were taken, which McCartney later examined with a magnifying glass before making his decision.Before he tried to “break the internet” with a nude Kim Kardashian on the cover of Paper magazine, Jean-Paul Goude took some of the most memorable images of the Eighties for Grace Jones’s album Island Life. She appears on the cover in what looks like an impossible pose it is, in fact, a composite of her in different positions, cut and pasted together for one of the most striking images in music history.2630 5) The Velvet Underground and Nico – The Velvet Underground and NicoLike the working zipper of The Rolling Stones’ Sticky Fingers, early versions of The Velvet Underground and Nico asked the owner to “Peel slowly and see”, upon which they’d peel the banana skin to reveal a flesh-coloured banana beneath. MGM was happy to fork out for the additional costs of manufacturing the vinyl, with the assumption that its ties to Warhol would help boost sales. It’s one of very few albums where the person behind the album art, rather than the band themselves or the album title, are named on the cover.The cover art for Joy Division’s debut album was designed by Peter Saville, who had previously created posters for Manchester’s Factor Club in the late Seventies. The chosen image, which was picked by Bernard Sumner, is based on radio waves from pulsar CP 1919 – from the Cambridge Encyclopaedia of Astronomy. “The duochrome Peter Saville cover of this first Joy Division album speaks volumes,” Susie Goldring said in a review for BBC Online. “Its white on black lines reflect a pulse of power, a surge of bass, and raw angst. If the cover doesn\u0027t draw you in, the music will.With its star-studded cast and bold colour scheme, the cover of Sgt Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band came to define artist Peter Blake and also The Beatles themselves. There are 88 figures in all, including the band themselves, on a set photographed by Michael Cooper. Blake collected a list of names from three of the four Beatles. The list included Tony Curtis, Marilyn Monroe, Aubrey Beardsley, Oscar Wilde, and even Adolf Hitler (requested by John Lennon, and hidden behind other figures). If you bought the record, Blake later said, “you also bought a piece of art on exactly the level that I was aiming for”.Critic Camille Paglia once suggested that Robert Mapplethorpe’s photo of his former lover, friend and collaborator Patti Smith is the greatest ever taken of a woman, and seeing it, you feel inclined to agree. The godmother of punk herself said she thought she looked like Frank Sinatra, dressed in a crisp white shirt with a black ribbon around her neck. A black jacket with a horse brooch on the lapel is slung casually over her shoulder.  “The only rule we had was, Robert told me if I wore a white shirt, not to wear a dirty one,” Smith told NPR in 2010. “I got my favourite ribbon and my favourite jacket, and he took about 12 pictures. By the eighth one he said, \u0027I got it\u0027.”Photographer Colin Lane met the Strokes in early 2001, after being commissioned to shoot them for The Face magazine. The album cover happened by chance – after hanging out on another shoot a few weeks later, Lane heard the band’s art director hassling them to choose an album cover. He’d brought his portfolio with him, which included the now-infamous “ass shot”.230 29) The Notorious BIG – Ready to DieBiggie Smalls picked a baby resembling himself to star on the cover of his debut Ready to Die. By doing so, he summed up the album’s autobiographical content, which begins with childhood and closes with death. He also uses the notion of childhood innocence to foreshadow how our surroundings can have a lasting impact.It might not be the quintessential David Bowie album, or the one that introduced fans to Starman. But the face staring back at you from this particular album cover is, undeniably, the most recognisable Bowie look: red mullet a gaunt, sombre expression and that famous lightning bolt across his face.One of the greatest debut albums – and arguably the best hip hop record – of all time has a fittingly arresting cover image. A photo of a seven-year-old Nas was superimposed over Danny Clinch’s snapshot of one of the housing projects in the New York rapper’s native Queensbridge. Designed by Aimee Macauley, it was intended to reflect how the projects used to be Nas’s entire world, “until I educated myself to see there’s more out there”. But Nas was also inviting you to see through his eyes and into those very projects where he grew up, and feel immersed in that world via the power of his storytelling.Years after its release, Kate Bush noted how The Dreaming was deemed by many to be her “she’s gone mad” album. Its multiple, disparate narratives and metamorphic production intertwine with movie influences, particularly music hall crime capers of Houdini’s era. On the sepia-toned album cover, Bush plays the role of the escapist’s wife, looking to the distance, rather than at his face, as though trying to contact him via a different medium than mere speech. The way she holds his face in her hands gives her an additional, mesmerising power and conjures the old-world, eccentric mysticism with which she was – and still is – associated.Photographer Michael Spencer Jones had a task on his hands organising Oasis for what is indisputably their best album cover. It was different to what the band originally envisioned – Noel Gallagher had spotted a photo of the Beatles sat round a coffee in Japan, so thought Oasis could be photographed at the dining table of guitarist Bonehead’s house in Manchester. Jones didn’t see this working, so spread the members around Bonehead’s living room instead, and asked them to bring objects that were personal to them for decoration. Noel liked Jones’s idea of hanging an inflatable globe (brought by one of the roadies) from the ceiling. “Yeah, global dominance,” he said. Soon after the album’s release, that’s exactly what happened.Andy Warhol conceived the idea of a vinyl cover with working zipper that would reveal a pair of white briefs beneath the bulging jeans of a male model, who has to this day never been identified. Many fans assumed it was Mick Jagger, but people working on the shoot said several models were photographed and Warhol never revealed which one was used. It represented what the Rolling Stones quickly became famous for: an edgy, hyper-sexual kind of swagger.German painter Mati Klarwein – who also created Santana’s artwork for Abraxas – was behind this gatefold cover that served as an embodiment of Davis’s creative manifesto. The surreal and complex renderings mirror what Davis does with the music itself challenging traditional notions of structure and juxtaposing concepts of passivity and aggressiveness, anger and love.930 22) ACDC – Back in BlackBack in Black’s all-black cover design fit the mood of a band emerging from dark times. In the wake of the death of vocalist Bon Scott, ACDC had tracked down Brian Johnson, whom Scott had previously mentioned to the band. Certain people at their record label, Atlantic, weren’t so keen on the cover, but the band were insistent: it was a memorial to Scott. And now one of the most instantly recognisable and best-loved album covers in rock history.Visually striking and symbolic of what Debbie Harry was doing both as a woman and an artist in the music industry, Parallel Lines’ cover was shot by photographer Edo Bertoglio. It was apparently rejected by the band but later chosen by their manager, Peter Leeds. The juxtaposition between the band, who beam in their matching dress suits like a bunch of schoolboys at their senior prom, and Harry, who stands defiant in her white dress, hands on hips, is wonderful. “I’m not impressed,” her stance seems to say. “Try harder.”Dylan walks arm-in-arm with then-girlfriend and muse Suze Rotolo through the West Village in freezing New York, February 1963. Rotolo described the circumstances to the New York Times in 2008: “He wore a very thin jacket, because image was all. Our apartment was always cold, so I had a sweater on, plus I borrowed one of his big, bulky sweaters. On top of that I put on a coat. So I felt like an Italian sausage. Every time I look at that picture, I think I look fat.” Yet her memoir, A Freewheelin’ Time, also noted the cover’s significance, how it “influenced the look of album covers precisely because of its casual down-home spontaneity and sensibility”.Led Zeppelin couldn’t have picked a better image to serve as a visual introduction to their fans. It’s an easy tactic – using a photo from a real-life tragedy, in this case the Hinderburg disaster, for shock factor. But it worked, and the cover went on to become one of the most indelible images in rock music.1330 18) Never Mind the Bollocks – Here’s the Sex Pistols“The album will last. The sleeve may not,” said the adverts for the Sex Pistols’ first and only studio album in 1977. The Sex Pistols were already controversial before the release of Never Mind the Bollocks – Here’s the Sex Pistols. They’d caused nationwide uproar for swearing on live TV, been fired from two record labels, and been banned from a number of live venues in England. Using the word “bollocks” on the front of their artwork caused instant censorship, and more controversy that would only benefit its performance.

Stevie Nicks and Mick Fleetwood’s legs are entwined, which serves as a pretty good metaphor for the entanglement between band members that resulted in so many of the record’s lyrical back-and-forths.

Kelly then rushed off to ask the Queen if she liked the idea.“I asked him and Edward to give me five minutes so that I could ask the Queen,” Kelly writes in the book, which has been extracted in Hello! Magazine. “I remember the look of shock on Danny’s face that I would be asking Her Majesty straight away, but there’s no point in waiting around with these things: if she said no, that would be the end of it.“I ran upstairs and luckily the Queen was free. She was very amused by the idea and agreed immediately. I asked then if she would like a speaking part. Without hesitation, Her Majesty replied: ‘Of course I must say something. After all, he is coming to rescue me.’Created with Sketch.30 times things went wrong on film and TV sets Show all 30Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.130 Margot Robbie – The Wolf of Wall StreetThe actor says that acting in the scene where she has sex with Leonardo DiCaprio on a bed of money was really painful in The Wolf of Wall Street. “I got a million paper cuts on my back from all that money! It\u0027s not as glamorous as it sounds,” she said. “If anyone is ever planning on having sex on top of a pile of cash: don\u0027t. Or maybe real money is a bit softer, but the fake money is like paper, and when I got up off the bed, I turned around to get my robe and everyone gasped. I said, \u0027What is it?\u0027 And they said, \u0027You look like you\u0027ve been whipped a million times. Your back is covered in a thousand red scratches.”During the filming of the sequel to Steven Spielberg’s Jaws, cast members were terrified when real hammerhead sharks started circling them in the sea. The trouble was that their screams went unheard. The crew didn’t think they were in real danger to start with because it was written into the script that they yelled for help at that point.330 Sylvester Stallone and Dolph Lundgren – Rocky IVThe fourth in the Rocky film franchise to focus on the boxing career of the fictional Rocky Balboa, played by Sylvester Stallone, has some gripping and authentic-looking fight scenes. It’s no wonder then that during filming, Stallone actually asked Dolph Lundgren, who plays his opponent, Ivan Drago, to try to knock him out for real. But Lundgren hit him with such force that he was sent to the hospital and was in intensive care for over a week.Brando was infamous for his bad on-set behaviour. That is one reason why Paramount was nervous about getting him involved in Francis Ford Coppola’s mafia film. It didn’t start well, when on the first day of shooting, the actor who played the patriarch in the family, Vito Corleone, missed his overnight flight from LA to New York. His scene was rescheduled for the next day, but it cost producers $40,000.In his autobiography, rapper Gucci Mane said he was so tired on set of Harmony Korine’s crime film Spring Breakers, that he fell asleep during his big sex scene. The rapper, who plays Big Arch, a rival drug dealer of James Franco’s Alien character in the film, is seen having sex with one woman, while another sucks his toes. “I couldn’t keep my eyes open. I was knocked out, snoring . . . Harmony kept having to wake me up for takes.” In another interview, he explained why he was so exhausted. “I had a concert down there in St Petersburg, Florida, one of the days I had to shoot a scene. Same night. We started shooting at 10 o\u0027clock in the evening until 1 or 2 o\u0027clock.”The action star broke his ankle while doing his own stunt on set of the sixth Mission Impossible. The scene sees Cruise completing a fast rooftop jump from one building to another, when his foot slams into the side of the wall. But instead of collapsing in a heap, he keeps going as if nothing has happened, until the end of the scene when he can be seen hobbling away. He said: “I knew instantly my ankle was broken and I really didn’t want to do it again so just got up and carried on with the take. I said, ‘It’s broken. That’s a wrap. Take me to hospital’ and then everyone got on the phone and made their vacation arrangement.”730 Lizzy Caplan and Michael Sheen – Masters of SexCaplan was nervous when she had to take her clothes off in front of co-star Sheen in the TV series. It made her feel better that they were both shaky. But then disaster struck. “And we complete the scene, I place the hand on my breast and they yell “Cut” and he immediately walks over to a garbage can and throws up.“ Turns out Sheen had eaten something that upset his stomach, but Caplan didn\u0027t know that. She said: ”My whole self-confidence plummeted to the ground and I realised that I\u0027m a monster and anybody who touches me will immediately start vomiting and that’s just the way it\u0027s going to be.”830 Nina Dobrev and Paul Wesley – The Vampire DiariesNina Dobrev accidentally broke Paul Wesley\u0027s finger while shooting a sex scene in The Vampire Diaries.930 Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan - 50 Shades of GreyObviously this could be a load of hype to promote the first erotic film in the franchise, but there were certainly a lot of terrible sex scenes in which things could go wrong. Johnson, who plays Anastasia Steele, becomes romantically linked to Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan) and they act out their BDSM desires. Johnson, who wore a modesty thong glued to her body while Dornan wore a “wee bag” to protect his modesty, said: “I got whiplash once from him throwing me on the bed. So f***ing painful. I wish we had a gag reel from the shoot.”Michael Imperioli is best known for his role as Tony Soprano’s protégé, Christopher Moltisanti in The Sopranos. During the filming of his death scene in Martin Scorsese’s Goodfellas, Imperioli cut his hand on a glass and was taken to hospital, where the doctors sped in to treat his fake bullet wounds.During the filming of Groundhog Day, Murray was more irritable than usual as he was going through a orce and was prone to disappearing from set. He had been asked to get an assistant to ease communication between him, the director Harold Raims and the studio. He was against the idea, so he hired somebody who was deaf and spoke only in sign language, which nobody on set, including Murray, could understand. Ramis said: “Bill said, ‘Don’t worry, I\u0027m going to learn sign language.’ And I think it was so inconvenient that in a couple of weeks, he gave that up. That’s anti-communication, you know? Let’s not talk.”It was a small mishap for Dunham when her nude patch kept falling off in scenes that required nudity. Dunham, who plays aspiring writer Hannah in her comedy-drama TV series Girls, said: “I stopped wearing the nude patch after the first season of Girls. There’s not one guy who works on that show who hasn’t seen the inside of my vagina. You glue it over your vagina. It gets sweaty and always falls off. My male co-stars, at the end of the day, don’t care.”In one scene of Quentin Tarantino’s 2015 Western thriller, Jennifer Jason Leigh as Daisy Domergue plays a guitar. It is a vintage Martin guitar from the 19th century, worth roughly $40,000, which had been loaned out from the Martin Museum in Pennsylvania. But a misunderstanding on Russell’s part led to an expensive mistake. The valuable guitar was meant to be swapped over with a replica prop when he snatched it from her. Russell had not read the memo, though, and smashed the antique guitar against a wall, while shouting “Music time is over”. As a result, the Martin Museum – which called the guitar a priceless, irreplaceable artefact – vowed never to loan guitars out to movies again.1430  Robert Pattinson and Julianne Moore – Maps to the StarsThe Twilight and Lost City of Z actor played Jerome, a limousine driver and struggling actor, in David Cronenberg’s acerbic Hollywood satire. It was while he got intimate in the back of a car with Moore’s character, a washed-up actress, that he ran into problems and started sweating profusely. “I sweat like a f***ing crazy person,” he said. “I was trying to literally catch drops of sweat to stop them hitting her back. Afterwards she was like, \u0027Are you having a panic attack?\u0027 It was so embarrassing.”1530 Anne Hathaway and Jake Gyllenhaal - Love and other DrugsHathaway accidentally stripped off too soon when she thought cameras were rolling during the filming of Love and other Drugs. She stars alongside Jake Gyllenhaal in the erotic film based on the non-fiction book Hard Sell: The Evolution of a Viagra Salesman by Jamie Reidy. “I have to remove my trench coat and be nude underneath, and I thought we were filming,” she said. “But it turned out we were just rehearsing and I got unnecessarily naked in front of a lot of people!”In a 2007 episode of the reboot of Battlestar Galactica TV series, Olmos’s character William Adama, the commanding officer of BS Galactica, is playing around with a model ship when he gets carried away by improvising and smashes it to smithereens. The model ship was, however, museum quality and according to Olmos, who had no idea at the time, it was worth roughly $200,000.1730 Allison Janney and Michael Lerner in Life During WartimeDuring a sex scene against a wall for the 2009 comedy-drama, Allison Jamey\u0027s co-star Michael Lerner went crashing to the ground. “We had to have sex up against a wall and they started spraying us with glistening stuff to make us look sweaty, but no one seemed to realise that we were standing on a marble floor,” she said. “They said ‘Action’ and he pulled me up against the wall and his feet slipped out from under him and he went crashing down on the floor. It was terrible, but it was one of those moments I\u0027ll never forget.”1830 Ryan Reynolds and Olivia Wilde in The Change-UpThe Deadpool star was taken aback when his co-star Olivia Wilde painted smiley faces on her underwear during a sex scene, that he completely forgot what he was doing. “In the scene, she’s sitting there and I take her top off and the bra off, and she has those panties on, but she’s drawn these adorable little smiley faces on them,” he said. “And I forget every line. Not just from this movie, but from every other movie I’ve done.”1930 Sean Connery and Lana Turner – Another Time, Another PlaceSean Connery and the American actress Lana Turner were filming a love scene when Turner’s gangster boyfriend Johnny Stompanato showed up uninvited. Turner was playing an American journalist who has a love affair with a BBC war correspondent (played by Connery). But her boyfriend was so jealous that he showed up with a gun in his hand, and threatened to kill Connery. Bravely, Connery grabbed the gun from his hand and twisted the boyfriend’s wrist until he fled off the set. Turner’s turbulent life continued when her daughter Cheryl killed Stompanato with a kitchen knife fearing that he was going to kill her mother after he showed up at their house in the US – but in the trial it was deemed as justifiable homicide.2030 Christian Serratos and Michael Cudlitz - The Walking DeadThe long-running TV show focuses more on blood and violence than sex. But during one scene between Rosita (Christian Serratos) and Abraham (Michael Cudlitz) things nearly went pear-shaped when they had to get intimate in front of 30 crew members, who  were drinking coffee and eating ramen noodles. Cudlitz, who was on top of Serratos, said they were nearly naked but covered – but then as they were “humping”, the cover got knocked off, leaving Serratos practically naked. The actor said: “Then we just started laughing, because it\u0027s ridiculous. It\u0027s two people, we barely know each other, lying on top of each other naked.”During the filming of Blazing Saddles, a man wandered into a scene of the film. He wasn’t part of the crew or cast but when the director Mel Brooks got the man moved on, he returned again, seemingly not understanding the request. Brooks then sent over a waiver for him to sign and left him in the movie for a laugh. He can be spotted at the end of the film wearing a jumper and standing on a sidewalk watching the action as people run out of the Warner Brothers studio front gates.Not really a mishap, but it was certainly an awkward moment behind the camera for the then 17-year-old actor, who legally had to have his mother on set for his first-ever sex scene, in which he says, “It’s in. Oh, my God, it’s in.” “She got there, and I had fake sexual intercourse in front of her,” Mintz-Plasse said. “Afterwards we didn\u0027t talk about it we still don\u0027t speak about that moment.”2330 Sylvester Stallone and Sharon Stone – The SpecialistStallone and Stone had absolutely no chemistry in the 1994 American spy thriller, but when the Basic Instinct star refused to get naked for the shower scene, it was potentially a huge problem. Stallone admitted they had to get drunk on vodka for filming to even start. “Ok. Let it be known, I didn’t want this scene because Sharon was not cooperating. We get to the set and she decided not to take off her robe off. The director asks only a few of the crew to remain, and she still won’t take it off. I promised her I wouldn’t take any liberties, so what’s the problem? She said, ‘I’m just sick of nudity.’ I asked her if she could get sick of it on somebody else’s film. She was having none of it, so I went down to my trailer, bought back a bottle of Black Death vodka that was given to me by Michael Douglas and after half-a-dozen shots we were wet and wild.”2430 Margot Robbie and Alexander Skarsgard – The Legend of TarzanApparently Robbie – who plays Jane - punched her Tarzan co-star Skarsgard after getting carried away during the filming of their climatic sex scene. The director David Yates asked them to be a little more violently passionate. “I didn’t injure Alexander,” she said. “And I didn’t punch him in the face, at least not hard. But he’s a pretty strong guy. He can take it. We just got carried away a bit.”Cavill says he had to “apologise profusely” after he got aroused on set, adding that “It had only happened to him once”. “A girl had to be on top of me, she had spectacular breasts and I hadn\u0027t rearranged my stuff into a harmless position. She\u0027s basically rubbing herself all over me and, um, it got a bit hard.” He claimed there was nothing sexy about onscreen sex scenes. “All you’re doing is smacking your nuts against someone and nothing is going in.” But he added: “It’s not great when you’re in a professional acting environment and somebody gets a boner, is it?” It’s not just Henry Cavill who got aroused during filming a sex scene. Metcalfe, who played John Rowland, experienced the same issue during his first onscreen sex scene with Eva Longoria’s Gabrielle Solis. He said: “We were rehearsing and then the director was like, \u0027OK, get out of bed, we have to reset the set\u0027, and I was like, \u0027I need a minute.\u0027“ He added: “It doesn\u0027t happen that frequently” because ”there are a lot of people on set, and it can be very technical, but it happens from time to time.2730 Christopher Guest and Cary Elwes – The Princess BrideWhen you see the dashing Westley (Cary Elwes) fall to the ground unconscious during a fight scene in Rob Reiner’s The Princess Bride, it really happened. Christopher Guest, who was playing Count Tyrone Rugen, knocked Elwes out by accident, when he hit him on the head with the butt of his sword. Elwes also broke his toe during the first week of filming when he was “messing around” between scenes on co-star Andre the Giant’s all-terrain vehicle. But the actor, who was in his first major role, hid the injury for the rest of the film as best he could. “I was limping a bit, you can see it in some of the scenes – you can see that I was limping into the fire swamp (during a scene with Robin Wright).”The star was filming the scene in which he storms off after he discovers Craig Schwartz (John Cusack) has been renting out his brain to strangers. According to the director, Spike Jonze, a drunk extra then threw a beer can from a moving car at his head while shouting “Hey Malkovich, think fast!” Jonze liked the scene so much that he left it in the film. The extra had his day rate bumped up to $700 a day because he had a speaking role.2930 Viggo Mortensen – The Lord of the RingsWhen Aragon (Mortensen) thinks that two of the hobbits are dead in a scene in The Two Towers, he lets out a gigantic primeval cry as he kicks his helmet in anger and falls to the floor. This behaviour would seem like an appropriate response to the grief his character feels but in reality, the actor had actually broken two toes while kicking his helmet.3030 The entire cast of RoarBut whatever the mishap, nothing can surely be as bad as it was on set for director Noel Marshall’s family, who were cast in his 1981 adventure comedy film Roar? During filming, his then wife Tippi Hendren and her daughter Melanie Griffith, as well as his two sons, John and Jerry, were mauled by lions. Heddren suffered multiple scalp wounds while Marshall was bitten so many times, he ended up hospitalised with gangrene.130 Margot Robbie – The Wolf of Wall StreetThe actor says that acting in the scene where she has sex with Leonardo DiCaprio on a bed of money was really painful in The Wolf of Wall Street. “I got a million paper cuts on my back from all that money! It\u0027s not as glamorous as it sounds,” she said. “If anyone is ever planning on having sex on top of a pile of cash: don\u0027t. Or maybe real money is a bit softer, but the fake money is like paper, and when I got up off the bed, I turned around to get my robe and everyone gasped. I said, \u0027What is it?\u0027 And they said, \u0027You look like you\u0027ve been whipped a million times. Your back is covered in a thousand red scratches.”During the filming of the sequel to Steven Spielberg’s Jaws, cast members were terrified when real hammerhead sharks started circling them in the sea. The trouble was that their screams went unheard. The crew didn’t think they were in real danger to start with because it was written into the script that they yelled for help at that point.330 Sylvester Stallone and Dolph Lundgren – Rocky IVThe fourth in the Rocky film franchise to focus on the boxing career of the fictional Rocky Balboa, played by Sylvester Stallone, has some gripping and authentic-looking fight scenes. It’s no wonder then that during filming, Stallone actually asked Dolph Lundgren, who plays his opponent, Ivan Drago, to try to knock him out for real. But Lundgren hit him with such force that he was sent to the hospital and was in intensive care for over a week.Brando was infamous for his bad on-set behaviour. That is one reason why Paramount was nervous about getting him involved in Francis Ford Coppola’s mafia film. It didn’t start well, when on the first day of shooting, the actor who played the patriarch in the family, Vito Corleone, missed his overnight flight from LA to New York. His scene was rescheduled for the next day, but it cost producers $40,000.In his autobiography, rapper Gucci Mane said he was so tired on set of Harmony Korine’s crime film Spring Breakers, that he fell asleep during his big sex scene. The rapper, who plays Big Arch, a rival drug dealer of James Franco’s Alien character in the film, is seen having sex with one woman, while another sucks his toes. “I couldn’t keep my eyes open. I was knocked out, snoring . . . Harmony kept having to wake me up for takes.” In another interview, he explained why he was so exhausted. “I had a concert down there in St Petersburg, Florida, one of the days I had to shoot a scene. Same night. We started shooting at 10 o\u0027clock in the evening until 1 or 2 o\u0027clock.”The action star broke his ankle while doing his own stunt on set of the sixth Mission Impossible. The scene sees Cruise completing a fast rooftop jump from one building to another, when his foot slams into the side of the wall. But instead of collapsing in a heap, he keeps going as if nothing has happened, until the end of the scene when he can be seen hobbling away. He said: “I knew instantly my ankle was broken and I really didn’t want to do it again so just got up and carried on with the take. I said, ‘It’s broken. That’s a wrap. Take me to hospital’ and then everyone got on the phone and made their vacation arrangement.”730 Lizzy Caplan and Michael Sheen – Masters of SexCaplan was nervous when she had to take her clothes off in front of co-star Sheen in the TV series. It made her feel better that they were both shaky. But then disaster struck. “And we complete the scene, I place the hand on my breast and they yell “Cut” and he immediately walks over to a garbage can and throws up.“ Turns out Sheen had eaten something that upset his stomach, but Caplan didn\u0027t know that. She said: ”My whole self-confidence plummeted to the ground and I realised that I\u0027m a monster and anybody who touches me will immediately start vomiting and that’s just the way it\u0027s going to be.”830 Nina Dobrev and Paul Wesley – The Vampire DiariesNina Dobrev accidentally broke Paul Wesley\u0027s finger while shooting a sex scene in The Vampire Diaries.930 Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan - 50 Shades of GreyObviously this could be a load of hype to promote the first erotic film in the franchise, but there were certainly a lot of terrible sex scenes in which things could go wrong. Johnson, who plays Anastasia Steele, becomes romantically linked to Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan) and they act out their BDSM desires. Johnson, who wore a modesty thong glued to her body while Dornan wore a “wee bag” to protect his modesty, said: “I got whiplash once from him throwing me on the bed. So f***ing painful. I wish we had a gag reel from the shoot.”Michael Imperioli is best known for his role as Tony Soprano’s protégé, Christopher Moltisanti in The Sopranos. During the filming of his death scene in Martin Scorsese’s Goodfellas, Imperioli cut his hand on a glass and was taken to hospital, where the doctors sped in to treat his fake bullet wounds.During the filming of Groundhog Day, Murray was more irritable than usual as he was going through a orce and was prone to disappearing from set. He had been asked to get an assistant to ease communication between him, the director Harold Raims and the studio. He was against the idea, so he hired somebody who was deaf and spoke only in sign language, which nobody on set, including Murray, could understand. Ramis said: “Bill said, ‘Don’t worry, I\u0027m going to learn sign language.’ And I think it was so inconvenient that in a couple of weeks, he gave that up. That’s anti-communication, you know? Let’s not talk.”It was a small mishap for Dunham when her nude patch kept falling off in scenes that required nudity.

Within minutes, I was back in Edward’s office delivering the good news to Danny — I think he almost fell off his chair when I said that the Queen’s only stipulation was that she could deliver that iconic line.”Kelly’s book further reveals details about the Queen’s clothes\u0026nbspand her interactions with notable public figures throughout the 25 years Kelly has worked for the royal household.The book marks the first time a serving member of the royal household has been permitted to write about their experiences while still working for the Queen.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It belongs to the millions who support us all across the country, from the staff in Millbank and in the field to the volunteers and activists, including the million who marched in London nine days ago.“Late last night, Roland Rudd, as outgoing chair of Open Britain (one of the founder organisations of the People’s Vote campaign), sent an email to all staff announcing a boardroom coup. This email invited all staff to a meeting this morning, which Roland Rudd cancelled at the last minute, despite promises made. Instead he decided to go on TV.“The team are not prepared to wait around indefinitely for Roland Rudd to come and provide answers to our questions, so the overwhelming majority of the staff team decided to leave the building together.Long tailbacks as Brexit operation to slow parts of motorway overrunsJohnson’s Brexit deal isn’t just about his agenda, but his backers’A general election cannot solve the mess Brexit has got us into“This is a crucial week for the campaign and the country. With everything to play for in our unstinting efforts to secure a People’s Vote, the last thing anyone needs is to be distracted by a few iniduals playing boardroom politics. The team are now having a meeting to discuss how the People’s Vote campaign, which we all care passionately about and have dedicated our lives to in recent years, continues to be the largest and most vibrant political movement in the country.”Former Ed Miliband spin doctor Baldwin said the row stemmed from Rudd’s preference for the campaign to fight openly for the UK to Remain in the EU, rather than to seek to persuade people on both sides of the Brexit battle that a public vote is the best way to settle the issue.But Mr Rudd said that it was time for People’s Vote to be reconstituted on a “more structured basis” under a single chief executive.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

We new need a much clearer structure as we move forward.”\u0026nbspMr Baldwin told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “It’s a curious situation. We are three days before the Brexit deadline with the prospect of crashing into a general election or out of the EU per both. The Liberal Democrats appear to be playing games… they have abandoned their principled support for a People’s Vote.“Roland Rudd has chosen this time to put a wrecking ball through the campaign… He is making the mistake that a lot of businessmen do when they dabble in politics, which is to think that because they have a certain title on a board, they then own the campaign.“The People’s Vote campaign belongs to the people, not just to one businessman who is hardly ever seen in the campaign.”Mr Rudd told Today that there were opportunities for Mr Baldwin to take a different role in the campaign, saying he wanted to have “a proper civilised chat” with him about it.“This is an absurd argument,” said Mr Rudd – brother of former home secretary Amber Rudd. “Everyone knows perfectly well that we are made up of people who want to Remain.“He complained that elements in the campaign were undermining the push for a referendum by alienating possible support with attacks on Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and the Liberal Democrats.“We can’t get involved in these kinds of politics,” said Mr Rudd. “We are making a coalition with people from all parties and it’s not for us to write off any one political party or any leadership.”He said there was a “real opportunity” this week of having a second referendum attached to Boris Johnson’s Brexit deal.Mr McGrory released a picture of the People’s Vote staff on social media, with a message to say: “It’s easily the greatest privilege of my professional life to be part of such an amazing team at the People’s Vote campaign. All this fantastic group of dedicated and passionate professionals want to do – and all we’ve ever wanted – is to campaign for and get a People’s Vote.”The Independent has worked with People\u0027s Vote on its Final Say referendum campaign, including collaborating on staging three demonstrations in central London that were among the largest ever seen in the UK.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The message was clear - without new financing WeWork would run out of money within weeks.“Do you still believe in the company?” Neumann, who had stepped down as chief executive but was still WeWork\u0027s chairman, asked a room of JPMorgan bankers on the 42nd floor of their midtown Manhattan headquarters on 6 October, the sources said.The JPMorgan bankers, led by asset and wealth management chief executive Mary Erdoes and debt capital markets head Jim Casey, told Neumann and other WeWork directors they would back the company, and were confident they could raise the money.

They requested anonymity to discuss the confidential deliberations.WeWork, SoftBank and JPMorgan declined to comment for this story.Requests for an interview with Neumann were also declined.SoftBank offered $9.5bn\u0026nbspto WeWork, including new debt and recommitted equity, as well as a tender offer to partly cash out Neumann and other shareholders.In addition to providing more funds than JPMorgan, the SoftBank deal resolved what some WeWork directors privately referred to as the company\u0027s “corporate governance problem” - Neumann\u0027s controlling grip.SoftBank\u0027s deal would strip Neumann\u0027s voting power and remove him from the board. Neumann was blamed by other WeWork investors such as Benchmark Capital and China\u0027s Hony Capital, for the company\u0027s precipitous decline, some of the people said.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailHis erratic management style, combined with WeWork\u0027s lack of a clear path to profitability, alienated potential IPO investors.The problem was that Neumann could still wield power over the company even after he quit as chief executive\u0026nbspon 24 September because, as WeWork\u0027s founder, each of his shares had 10 voting rights. Others had only one vote for every share.WeWork staff outraged at former CEO’s payout while they face job cutsIt was clear to SoftBank, as well as to a special board committee formed to consider the financing plans, that Neumann relinquishing control would come with a price tag, three of the people said.In meetings in New York between Neumann and SoftBank Chief Operating Officer Marcelo Claure, the contours of a side deal came together. SoftBank would provide a $500 million credit line to refinance Neumann\u0027s personal borrowings made against WeWork\u0027s stock, as long as he used proceeds from cashing out up to $970m of his shares to repay SoftBank for that loan first.SoftBank\u0027s latest offer valued the company at as little as $5.9bn based on the repricing of warrants it was already committed to exercise, according to Bernstein research, a far cry from the $47 billion it had assigned to WeWork in January.Neumann\u0027s special pay-off did not stop there. He negotiated with SoftBank a four-year non-compete agreement with a $185 million “consulting fee” in return for stepping down from WeWork\u0027s board. He would now only get to observe board proceedings instead of participating.WeWork\u0027s special board committee members expressed concern that Neumann\u0027s bailout would cause outrage among many WeWork employees whose stock options had a much higher strike price than the valuation in SoftBank\u0027s tender offer, some of the people said.The committee declined to comment for this article.SoftBank\u0027s offer to buy up to $3bn of WeWork stock from employees and existing shareholders would value the company at about $8 billion, higher than the new valuation based on the warrants.Neumann attempted to push up the valuation of the tender offer in his negotiations with SoftBank, one of the people said.SoftBank stood firm. Anticipating criticism from its own shareholders for possibly throwing good money after bad, it wasn\u0027t prepared to pay more.Most WeWork directors wanted Neumann off the board, and many minority shareholders, which the special committee was formed to represent, wanted to cash out, the people said.Goldman Sachs profit hit by losses on investments in WeWork and UberWeWork\u0027s nosee is proof Adam Neumann can\u0027t walk on waterAs WeWork embraces big business, will it lose its cool?JPMorgan had not pursued raising additional money for shareholders, in part because WeWork only tasked the bank with delivering $5 billion of debt financing.When the bank submitted the debt package on Monday, only private equity firm Starwood Capital Group, run by real estate mogul Barry Sternlicht, had committed to join JPMorgan in sharing the financing burden.JPMorgan agreed to provide the rest and transfer the money by Thursday. But the deal also included a condition, known as a covenant, that would trigger a debt default if SoftBank did not make good on $1.5 billion that it had already committed to provide when warrants came due next April, the people said.JPMorgan wanted to ensure SoftBank would honour its financial commitment, which would lessen the risk for investors holding debt that would one day need to be repaid.But SoftBank told WeWork\u0027s board that it would not pay the $1.5bn if its financing offer was rejected, two of the people added.The problem from SoftBank\u0027s perspective was that those warrants were based on January\u0027s $47bn valuation of WeWork. It wanted to change the pricing radically to reflect WeWork\u0027s dramatic fall in value.JPMorgan dealmakers, on the other hand, believed WeWork\u0027s contract with SoftBank prevented the telecommunications and technology giant from reneging on that earlier commitment, other people familiar with the matter said.In the end, the risk that SoftBank wouldn\u0027t fulfill its commitment if the JPMorgan financing package was chosen helped swing the special committee\u0027s deliberations in favor of SoftBank\u0027s offer, they added.SoftBank had made WeWork an offer it had to accept.On Tuesday, SoftBank unveiled a deal that increased its ownership of WeWork to 80 per cent\u0026nbspfrom 30 per cent, but sought to avoid having to consolidate WeWork\u0027s liabilities on its balance sheet by not taking full control of the expanded board. SoftBank will only have 5 of the 10 seats.But unless SoftBank can turn WeWork around quickly, it could be a pyrrhic victory.WeWork has burned through almost $2.5bn\u0026nbspof cash since the end of June, and Claure will have to cut costs quickly, including slashing thousands of jobs and helping the company to find a way to get out of expensive leases. Otherwise, the new cash injection may not last long enough to stabilise the business.As predicted, Claure is also facing some staff anger over the size of Neumann\u0027s payout. He told employees on Wednesday that it was the “price” that had to be paid to get rid of Neumann\u0027s voting rights. Otherwise, he said, “Adam could do whatever he wanted.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Condemning these elephants to a life of captivity in Chinese zoos is a tragedy.\u0026nbsp“We and others have been working for months to try and stop these elephants being shipped because all that awaits them in China is a life of monotonous deprivation in zoos or circuses.”\u0026nbspMore than 50 elephants starve to death amid severe drought in ZimbabweEleven elephants die after falling into waterfall trying to save calfBeloved elephant Tikiri dies after being forced to perform for decadesEU set to overturn ban on baby elephants being sent to foreign zoos She added: “As an elephant biologist used to observing these magnificent animals in their natural wild habitat, I am devastated by this outcome. These animals should be roaming in the wild with their families but, instead, they have been ripped away from their mothers for more than a year and now sold off for lifelong captivity”.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

No incumbent could survive in these conditions.”Mr Gedan added that Mr Fernandez is “an untested leader” who is inheriting a ruinous economy and unfavourable international conditions.\u0026nbsp“The government of Alberto Fernandez and Cristina Kirchner will feature Peronists of varied political tendencies, but the crucial question is what the dynamic will be between the pragmatic president and more ideological and polarising vice president,” Michael Shifter, the head of the Inter-American Dialogue, a Washington-based think tank, said.Brazil sends in troops amid anger at failure to tackle vast oil spillBolsonaro poll rating plummets in Brazil over Amazon fires falloutChile’s president to sack entire cabinet in bid to end protestsArgentina and Uruguay suffer ‘massive’ power outages to millionsArgentina could close 10 government ministries to help stabilise peso“The nature of that power struggle will determine the direction of Argentina\u0027s economic, social and foreign policy in coming years.”However, Mr Shifter did not believe a return to the populist policies of Ms Kirchner’s presidency was likely.“Today, Argentina simply does not have the economic conditions for unchecked spending,” he said.“This will not be a replay of her presidency.”Additional reporting by APShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

That is totally understandable. But there is a risk to attempting it before delivering Brexit as he promised.There is a danger too, of course, that Remainers will kill his deal in the next fortnight via fatal amendments. Most Labour “moderates” in Leave seats cannot be trusted to back it, however much they hope to pull the wool over their constituents’ eyes.But the PM can then go to the polls promising that a Tory majority will reverse their tricks and finalise his deal.As it stands, Labour must agree to any election. And it is truly jaw-dropping to watch them running away, having screamed for so long for the chance to replace the dastardly Tories.With their ratings in freefall and in mortal fear of Boris’s popularity, they concoct ever more ludicrous excuses to dodge a reckoning. It is shredding the last remnants of their credibility.The public wants an election, by  per cent to . Labour cannot hide from it.They are stricken, ided and handicapped by the most unpopular political leader in UK history — but they will be seen too as snivelling cowards who put their party before their country.For the moment, though, Boris’s best bet is as his slogan says: to get Brexit done.IT is a scandal that the fracking revolution was strangled at birth.The Whitehall report saying it is “years behind schedule” doesn’t nearly cover the failure.Shale gas could power Britain cheaply for a generation, lower bills and create thousands of jobs. It would be far more eco-friendly than burning coal.But the Tories lost the PR war against a green social media campaign which terried the public using debunked and out-of-date US scare stories. Most people know little of fracking except that they are meant to despise and fear it.The Cameron Government could have pushed back hard. Instead it buckled and hit fracking firms with regulations making exploration all but impossible.What a calamitous missed opportunity.IT is impossible to imagine the terrying ordeal of the  migrants who died in a refrigerated truck.And we recoil at the evil and greed of the traffickers who have profited from this appalling tragedy.The only comfort is that there is every chance, from the details already known, that they will be brought to justice.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I don’t see that happening, either.In the documentary, Meghan, , talks about the grass always being greener, but there are logistics that come into play when you’re a member of the royal family.Some of them are a little bit more obvious. So they move to South Africa, so who pays for their security there Yes, they’re both independently wealthy and they could support themselves there. But is the South African taxpayer suddenly paying for their security, or is the British taxpayer paying for that  Neither party are going to be particularly happy.It comes after Prince Harry revealed in an hour-long ITV documentary Harry  Meghan: An African Journey the pair have struggled with the fame that comes with the job.He said: “Ever since I came to this continent as a young boy, trying to cope with something I can never possibly describe, Africa has held me in an embrace that I will never forget.”If Harry and Meghan were no longer royal, their family wouldnt be eligible to receive funds like this from the Queens Sovereign Grant, which goes toward supporting her and those who carry out royal duties on her behalf.There is no suggestion the Sussexs have any plans to renounce their titles or royal privileges.The Queens own uncle, Edward VIII, infamously abdicated in .He gave up his thrown to his younger brother, George VI, so he could marry American orcee Wallis Simpson.Their relationship allegedly started in , but Edward – then a prince – denied this to his dad King George V.On January , , George V died and Edward ascended the throne.The Church of England felt Edward could not marry a orced woman with two living ex-husbands and Brits were also reluctant to accept an American as a queen.This prompted Simpson to flee to France to avoid the heavy press coverage.He renounced his position as king in December  and married Simpson the following June at the Château de Candé but no members of Edward’s family attended.They became Duke and Duchess of Windsor.Unlike Edward VIII, Prince Harry is extremely unlikely to ever be king so abdication isn’t really on the cards.But he could ditch his title and become a commoner, rejecting the allowance that he gets from the “the firm”.The exact amount of that is unknown but in , Harry, Kate and William had a combined allowance of £ million.Eventhe Sussex’s did stop taking the allowance they wouldnt be short of a bob or too with Meghan having a pre-marriage personal fortune of around £. million, according to The Independent.Prince Harry is also allegedly personally worth around £ million, most of which was inherited from his great-grandmother the Queen mother, and from his mum, Princess Di.Sarah Ferguson famously did this after she split from Prince Andrew, becoming the face of Weight Watchers and collaborating with QVC.Another possibility is that they could be allowed to keep their titles as the Duke and Duchess of Sussex but stop using the address His Her Royal Highness as Princess Diana and Sarah Ferguson did when they got orced.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

They want No Deal “taken off the table”. No one is fooled. Labour fear Boris, and Corbyn is toxic.Boris cannot govern this Remainer-dominated Parliament with no majority against an opposition so extreme and so utterly without principle.Labour blocks his Brexit deal. It blocks No Deal. It tries to block all Government legislation. It cannot block an election too.It will be a monstrous abdication of responsibility motivated by naked cowardice. Not that the Lib Dems or SNP are any better.These Remainer clowns have brought our democracy to its knees. Most of Britain is ashamed of them.OFCOM’S report into the BBC makes grim reading for a corporation in rapid decline.It is fast losing young viewers to Netflix, YouTube and Amazon. Butit is worried by that, it should be petried by the likely impact of its decision to strip over-s of their free licence.This giant empire, funded by a compulsory “tax”, needs massive reform.It must throttle back on its crazy expansionism, sht away from areas covered ­better by commercial organisations and bite the bullet over its £billion-a-year public funding model.The licence fee is almost a century old. It is as out of date as the Beeb itself now looks in this new era of multiple choice funded by voluntary subscription.The BBC remains an important part of British le. But the TV tax, with prosecution for non-payment, has to go.THE explosion in kne-carrying offences is a testament to the success of the police’s revived stop-and-search tactics.Yes, it is depressing these crimes are at a nine-year high. But that was inevitable when searches were also increased by a third over a year.Their scaling-back by Theresa May as Home Secretary in  was a disaster.The Tories’ “two strikes and you’re out” policy, automatic jail for a second offence, is disgracefully ignored by courts. Figures last year showed almost  per cent of repeat offenders swerved a custodial sentence or had it suspended.If judges are that lenient, why wouldn’t thousands take the risk Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But Johnson admitted the EU was inclined to offer an extension to the end of January and that Emmanuel Macron was fighting a lonely battle against it.Earlier in the day, the Elysée told No the French President was too isolated on the issue to veto a longer extension.In a sign of how much he is relying on Macron, Johnson then pleadingly recited the opening line of the carol “Oh come, oh come Emmanuel” to ministers.One of No’s hopes is that EU leaders will see the Opposition refusing both a general election and to pass the withdrawal agreement as is and come round to Macron’s way of thinking: That there is little point in offering this country a three-month extension as ­Parliament will just waste the time.One No source predicts that the sight of the opposition blocking an election will “push the EU towards either the Macron position or a very long extension”.In a sign that Johnson’s gambit is having some success, the EU is waiting until Parliament has voted on an election before deciding whatof extension to offer.If this doesn’t work, the Government hopes it can shame Labour into having an election.The Chief Whip told those present that they would “make Labour look like right d***s”they didn’t vote for an election.But not everyone is convinced this will work.One of those present tells me thatthey were a Labour MP, they would “rather look like a d*** than lose their seat”.I understand, though, No intends to bring multiple votes to try to force an election. One Cabinet minister who has discussed this strategy with Johnson tells me: “Every time , it advertises that they are not prepared to support Brexit or have an election.“It reinforces the sense that he is the only person trying to get things done.”Johnson himself has told allies thatLabour rejects his offer to pass the withdrawal agreement and have an election, then it will be an “effective demonstration” that this Parliament won’t — and can’t — break the current deadlock.Proving this Parliament can’t break the deadlock is one thing. Actually breaking it is quite another.One of those present on Thursday tells me Johnson seemed genuinely angry at Labour’s refusal to give him an election and “betrayed a sense he’s cornered”.Something must happen before January , though.If it doesn’t, the threat of No Deal will be back on the table.Andthe UK has wasted this extension, European patience may snap and they might not offer another one.One senior Cabinet minister tells me “there will be an attempt to use an SOto put the Withdrawal Agreement Bill before the House”. This would involve the rebel group around Oliver Letwin trying to bring the deal back to Parliament so that the Commons could vote on it. But it is far from clear whether this approach could work.Another possibility is the Opposition bringing down the Government. If they did this, they would have to agree on an alternative prime minister or end up in a general election.British politics looks more deadlocked than ever today. Johnson’s hope is that pressure from voters will eventually break this deadlock and sweep away the obstacles to him passing his Brexit deal.But he will almost certainly have to put up with a delay both to Brexit and the election before he can get his way.NO one at political Cabinet spoke against the idea of a December election. But privately, several ministers have grave doubts about the wisdom of this strategy.One frets: “Who jumps out of bed on a cold December morning to vote for the Government ”There is a view that the Government could have used getting the Commons to approve its deal in broad terms as a spur for pressing on with the ­legislation, bringing a new timetable to the Commons after MPs rejected its initial offer of three days’ debate. One complains that the election idea is “a massive distraction”.“Why aren’t we using the momentum of getting a second reading ” they ask.On the backbenches there are also concerns. One senior backbencher tells me: “We’ll vote for an election with great reluctance.”He worries that “being seen to try not very hard to get the bill through” undercuts the new Tory message that they are the deal party.The other great worry is that while the public mood is with Boris Johnson now, that could change. One minister warns it is a huge risk to have a “winter election at a very febrile time”, adding: “We’ve no idea what public opinion will be on polling day.”IF Boris Johnson gets his way and there’s a general election this year, what happens to those Tories who lost the whip for voting for the Benn Act At Thursday’s gathering, Nicky Morgan argued that the party needed “clarity” on what would happen to those who had lost the whip but had voted with the Government against the Letwin amendment and for the Brexit deal and the accelerated timetable for passing it.Boris Johnson has previously been adamant that he would not allow any of the  to stand as Tory candidates at the next election. But I am told he made sympathetic noises in response to Morgan’s point.Inside Boris Johnson’s circle, there’s the beginnings of a sht in attitude. There is a feeling that those who have consistently voted with the Government in recent weeks are worth bringing back in.With a deal secured, the issue that led to their rebellion has been addressed.At the same time, several of these MPs would be better placed to hold their seat for the Tories than any other candidate.AT political Cabinet on Thursday, Boris Johnson pointed at the Northern Powerhouse Minister Jake Berry and said “Kwasi”, a reference to Kwasi Kwarteng the Energy Minister.Cabinet ministers were baffled at how the PM confused the two.They don’t look at all alike.After Berry deadpanned, “An easy mistake to make”, the room fell about laughing.A Budget would offer the Tories a chance to outline some of their more popular economic policies and highlight plans to boost infrastructure.If the Opposition voted it down, it would make the case for the election Boris Johnson so desperately wants.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

When the nation voted on whether or not to leave the EU, it was boiled down to the simplest possible question and answer: Yes or No.So the die was cast and we voted to split with the EU. But that’s the thing about orce.Between the time you say you want one, and the time you actually get your decree nisi there is a whole lot of pain as the time is filled with blame, retribution and name-calling.Because of the lack of clarity from the vote on what it meant to leave, no one thought about the most important aspects, the red lines, of how Britain should leave the EU.It didn’t need a clairvoyant to predict that lots of those dferent Brexit visions would be fundamentally incompatible.We can’t stay in the customs union and have complete control of immigration.We can’t have no hard border on the island of Ireland the Good Friday Agreement and also leave the single market. I could go on.The point is that the nation answered Yes or No to something that — it turns out — our politicians have decided to interpret in multiple ways.And that has been the fundamental problem.Because MPs have been unable to compromise in order to find a deal that pleases them enough for it to be passed. And the public despair.Politics only s effectively when a party has a clear majority to get their legislation through government. And this one doesn’t.It’s no surprise that neither party has a clear majority while they are being led by the more extreme and dogmatic elements.I was in the House of Lords and the House of Commons on Wednesday and the contrast in atmosphere between the two is stark.Politicians in the Commons don’t listen or pay each other any respect.And the amount of average front bench MPs on both sides is shameful. No wonder we have stalemate.There is an unbridgeable gulf between Leavers and Remainers, and an inability among politicians to compromise.We’ve either got to leave with No Deal or we have to revoke Article  altogether.There is nothing in between, no room for compromise or pragmatism. As a result, we are paralysed. So the answer has to be to have a general election.Usually it’s politicians who tell us what to do for the good of the country, but now we need to tell the politicians what to do.Because only with a majority government can we put an end to the Brexit misery.Although who relishes the prospect of voting on a dark December night  Least of all Jeremy Corbyn, the only Opposition leader in history who has refused the offer of an election more than once.It’s no wonder when you look at the polls. He’s unelectable, but still using his position to block Brexit and stop us from getting on with it.Until there is an election we remain in this terrible limbo. I voted Remain but, like most people, now I just want it over with.Politicians must stop using Brexit for their own political aims.If they don’t soon come up with a solution, the risk is that people are increasingly likely to vote for extreme options in a bid to make it stop.And that is a scary prospect.WHEN it comes to le choices I am a big believer in the live and let live school of thought.Andpeople choose to have cosmetic surgery because it makes them feel better, that’s their choice.But in the latest photos of Lauren Goodger her flawless complexion and insanely pillowy pout are so extreme I didn’t realise it was her.Which, to me, raises the question of why anyone would want to render themselves completely unrecogniseable IT is ironic that one of the most important causes of our time – climate change – is being eclipsed by the behaviour of the very people professing to be addressing the issue.Following last week’s debacle with the protestor on the Tube at Canning Town, this week a jobless Extinction Rebellion protester who spray-painted a war memorial has been ordered by a judge to pay £ as punishment for “senseless vandalism”.The volunteer tree-planter, Joseph O’Malley, wrote the word “mother” on the ft tall bronze sculpture in Whitehall last November, Westminster Magistrates’ Court heard.And protestors who act like this wonder why we have no sympathy for them.Meanwhile, this year’s ongoing Extinction Rebellion protests have so far cost the taxpayer £million, it emerged this week.Sure, their argument would be that the cost to the taxpayer will ultimately be a lot more than thatwe do nothing about climate change.But these tactics and statistics make me seethe with anger.I, like most of us, have to go to work so people like O’Malley can choose instead to spend their time damaging a memorial dedicated to heroes who sacriced their lives so that, ironically, yobs like him can enjoy freedom.In my view a fine is not enough. His benefits should be stopped and he should be jailed for such a disgraceful and disrespectful act.Make no mistake, stopping climate change is essential for all of our futures.But these tactics are not only distracting and damaging to that cause they are actively counter productive.But put together with another story this week showing that the number of children aged between eight and  with anorexia has doubled , it is a good reminder that we should all keep an eye on our children’s phone use.ANYONE  catch Nigella Lawson’s ultimately down to earth confession that she followed up an evening of fine dining at Noble Rot, a snazzy award-winning restaurant in London, by eating a bag of pickled onion Monster Munch in bed.You’ve got to love the fact that after eating oysters, black pudding and venison Nigella has a Monster Munch nightcap.I am fully supportive. It’s just that, well, in bed  I can think only of the crumbs.SO sorry to hear about Amanda Holden’s bad luck breaking her leg on holiday at half-term.Buther cloud has a silver lining it is surely the fact that there are not that many people who could manage to look quite so glamorous with a leg that’s broken in two places.THIS week it was announced that jail sentences for terrorists will be increased.The Sentencing Council will propose changes to its guidelines after Parliament passed a new anti-terror law earlier this year which allowed for longer terms of imprisonment.Under the moves, the “starting point” for judges when jailing someone for “encouragement of terrorism” will double to ten years in the worst cases.But isn’t there something wrong with the fact that laws to delay Brexit get passed in hours, yet laws like this take months GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But the voters will not forget this treachery.EX-POLICING minister Sir Mike Penning’s discovery that he could easily obtain lethal knives online using  data is shocking.As he said, this wasn’t so much a loophole in the law but a “giant chasm”.Home Secretary Priti Patel must stem the flood of such weapons, while Amazon should face severe penaltiesit has failed to police its online adverts.Knives are fuelling a spate of murders of our young people.

By denying us a vote on his deal HE is now the one blocking Brexit.The  Labour manesto on which I was re-elected was clear: “Labour accepts the referendum result”.It promised we would “seek to unite the country around a Brexit deal that works for every community in Britain”.I repeated these words countless times in my constituency, a former mining area of Nottinghamshire that suffered under Conservative governments.I told them Labour would respect the  per cent of them who voted to leave, but that we would never stop fighting for a Brexit that brought them closer to prosperity not further away from it.This could be our last chance to keep that promise. That is why I voted with the Government on Tuesday.I did so not because I like Boris Johnson’s deal, but because I don’t like it and I want the chance to change it.This version of Brexit is flawed. It weakens workplace rights, consumer rights and environmental protections.It doesn’t include a customs union, which would be good for workers and businesses.This is not about supporting the Tories and their miserable agenda. It is about my role as an MP in opposition.I agree with John McDonnell, who said earlier this week: “By amending the Withdrawal Agreement Bill . . . MPs have an opportunity to reject the  choice between Boris Johnson’s bad deal and No Deal, and instead support an agreement that works for everyone.”I have signed Tory MP Ken Clarke’s amendment to stay in the customs union, safeguarding our economy and the many businesses that would sufferwe leave it. I want to make sure that working people are protected.I want to ensure that Brexit doesn’t give the Tories a chance to attack workers’ rights, as they have been doing for a decade.If we can’t get those changes, I won’t vote for the Bill at the final stage. In , I launched Labour’s Remain campaign alongside Jeremy Corbyn.I travelled the country making the case for the EU as the best way to guarantee workers rights, economic stability and environmental protections, among other things.But we lost that campaign. AndI stand for anything, I stand for respecting the voices and interests of working class people, who overwhelmingly voted to leave the EU.Some  per cent of those who voted to leave say that politicians don’t listen to people like them. It is these people I came into politics to give a voice to.I can’t ignore them on the major issue of our time. I know Labour colleagues who voted against the Government this week are also deeply committed to those voters.These decisions are not easy for any of us. There is an appetite for compromise in the country which is not reflected in Parliament.Earlier this year, I invited both passionate Leavers and Remainers in my constituency to meet. The debate was lively, but there was none of the shouting and jeering we see in Parliament.The majority of Remainers said they were willing to respect the result and Leavers still wanted to leave — but with a deal, not without one.If voters can compromise, why can’t politicians  I didn’t come into Parliament to protest, but to deal with the world as it is, and make it a bit better.However I can, I want to tell my constituents that I did everything I could to get the Brexit nearly  per cent of them voted for, while protecting jobs and rights in the process.Shortly after the referendum I was at a bus stop in my constituency. I was chatting to a woman and the conversation turned to Brexit. Having voting to leave the EU, she asked: “Do you think it will actually happen ”I didn’t hesitate to say, “Of course! We are a democracy and that’s how people voted.” I never thought that three-and-a-half years later we would still be arguing.If Boris Johnson really wants to deliver Brexit he has to do the one thing he’s so far failed to do — and that’s compromise. This General Election will be about so much more than Brexit.It is a chance for us to create a country where power, wealth and opportunity are in the hands of the many and not the privileged few and I will be giving my all to bring that about.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Lose weight and watch your waistline. Exercise regularly - aim for  minutes a week or half-an-hour most days. Eat a healthy diet rich in whole grains, fruits, veg, low-fat dairy and low in saturated fat and cholesterol. Lower salt levels in your diet. Limit the amount of booze you drink. Quit smoking - each cigarette raises your blood pressure for minutes afterwards, but quitting will help itto normal. Cut back on caffeine. Reduce stress levels. See your doctor regualrly and monitor your blood pressure. Get support from family and friends to help improve your healthCo-lead author Professor Costantino Iadecola said: “The results identy a previously unknown pathway linking dietary habits and cognitive health.“They indicate that avoiding high-salt diets could maintain cognitive .“Our data provide a previously unrecognised link between dietary habits, vascular dys and tau pathology.”While Dr Evangeline Mantzioris, programme director of nutrition and food sciences at the University of South Australia, praised the “important” research she also added a note of caution, saying: “We cannot with certainty say the same effect would happen in humans”.Professor John Funder, a neuroscientist at the University of Melbourne, also added a note of caution.He said: “Any extrapolation from mice on a salt intake of eight per cent to the human situation may be cute, but it is grossly irresponsible in terms of science.”Lowering your salt intake can also help reduce your blood pressure which signicantly reduces brain power loss and may protect against dementia.Scientists found it cut risk of cognitive decline - an early sign of Alzheimer’s - in older people by a fth.Loss of brain power – also known as cognitive impairment – is one of the first signs of dementia.Around , Brits have dementia and the figure is expected to hit one million with a decade.There is currently no cure but some drugs can control the symptoms.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He has already put himself out for hire for £, in recent days.Bercow whines he is “entitled to make a living”, and after ten shouty years on the globally screened Parliament Channel he has achieved lucrative star status.As cartoon TV hero Homer Simpson has proved, audiences love grotesques.Once free from high office, Bercow can quickly fill his boots with fees worth tens of thousands a time.But could there be another motive for his decision to go now rather than after he has completely screwed Brexit Had he stayed on, it seems he risked being “tried” on incendiary allegations of bullying and bringing Parliament into disrepute — an offence which might have cost him an automatic peerage and a seat in the House of Lords.Once out, he is “beyond the jurisdiction of Parliament”.Bercow has been haunted for years by allegations of volcanic temper tantrums and humiliation of staff, including some of the Commons’ most senior officials. He denies all the claims.Official probes have been shamelessly stymied by Labour because of Bercow’s “Bollocks to Brexit” stance.Labour grandee Dame Margaret Beckett blurted out her party’s motives, insisting Bercow must stay because Brexit “trumps bad behaviour”.The hypocrisy stinks. Labour claims to be the workers’ party. Here it is standing up for the bosses’ class.Parliament has also been criticised for failing victims of bullying. But kicking these charges into touch seems to have worked.Bercow’s decision to go now has persuaded former Black Rod David Leakey and the Speaker’s ex-Private Secretary, Angus Sinclair, to abandon claims of humiliation and abuse.In  Mr Sinclair, hardened by  years before the mast, told BBC Newsnight that Bercow mimicked him and was “prone to over-the-top anger”.Mr Leakey, an ex-Army Lieutenant-General, spoke of “the red mist descending” as Bercow “banged the table, yelled and was highly insulting to me personally”.He warns the Sundaythat a Bercow peerage would bring the House of Lords into disrepute at a time when politicians’ reputations are already at an all-time low.“Whatever Bercow’s merits as Speaker, I believe he should be treated in the same way as any other successful but disreputable citizen of the country,” says Leakey.“He is disreputable because, as a high-profile public figure, he has set an appalling example to the country, not least in publicly demeaning MPs in the chamber and on television.“As a senior figure in any other organisation, his behaviour would likely have resulted in investigation, censure or even dismissal.“He should not be rewarded with ‘baubles’ or a peerage.”Having watched this snarling, purple-faced Mr Punch discredit the constitution, stain the reputation of Parliament and demean the most distinguished post in British politics, it is impossible to disagree.There is now a chance for MPs to clean out this soiled stable and restore Parliament’s reputation.Decent Labour MP and popular Deputy Speaker Lindsay Hoyle is front-runner for the job. But none of the candidates could be worse, even preachy Labour veteran Harriet Harman.To quote the former Black Rod, it should not be rewarded by any party with an unelected place on the overstuffed red benches of the House of Lords.BREXIT-cancelling Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson thinks we are all stupid.Her plot with the SNP to stage a snap election on Monday, December , has flashing red lights all over it.It would be a vehicle for oddball amendments including votes at  – just the impressionable age when fantasy politics appeals most.She pretends she is trying to stop Boris “crashing out” with No Deal.Yet Boris wants a deal.

And soon, his poisonous ideology may be stamped out for good.IN a simpering interview yesterday, Justin Welby made a dig at Boris Johnson for “pouring petrol” on the isions of our country.Not for the first time, the interfering Archbishop has got it all wrong.It is not the Prime Minister who has torn Britain apart, but a small group of Remainers refusing to honour that vital principle underpinning democracy: losers’ consent.It was them and their MPs who instigated all this and who now — via their deranged campaign for a “people’s vote” — are blocking all progress on the Prime Minister’s pragmatic and sensible deal.The Remoaner Archbishop is part of the problem.Time he stopped meddling in politics and got back to his dwindling flock.IT is appalling that John Bercow — who steps down later this week — has been allowed to get away without being investigated over grave allegations of bullying.There is a new rule allowing investigations into grievance claims by ex staff, but oh so conveniently, it comes too late for the current Speaker.Shocking though it should be, this establishment stitch up is no surprise.Labour MPs happily propped up weaselling Bercow when he was inventing precedents willy-nilly to aid their Remoaner cause.ButMPs think that voters haven’t noticed what’s been going on, they’re living in cloud cuckoo land.An election is round the corner, and our useless MPs are in for a rude awakening.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But just as that motion dies, a separate bid is gaining momentum from the SNP and Lib Dems which pushes for a December  election instead.Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson wrote to the Tory Prime Minister today asking for clarity after No sources suggested Downing Street could swing behind a similar plan.Crucially, because itaposs a Bill this second bid would only need half of all voting MPs to back it - not the -MP apossuper majorityapos that Boris Johnson needs tonight.A vote could be held on the fresh election bid as soon as tomorrow, and pass evenit doesnapost have Labour backing. No said it would consider backing “something like” this optionit loses tonight’s vote. Furious Labour blasted the Lib Dem and SNP bid as a ridiculous stunt as Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell raged: Looks like the Lib Dem and Tory pact of  is being re-established.  They are back together, selling out the People’s Vote campaign and the cross party campaign to prevent a no deal. The Lib Dems will stop at nothing to get their ministerial cars back. But despite Labouraposs fury and initial Tory brush-offs the fresh election bid appeared to be gathering momentum. Yesterday, Tory chairman James Cleverly branded the Lib Dem plan a “gimmick” while Culture Secretary Nicky Morgan also called it a “stunt”. Yet last night government aide Bim Afolami said: Iaposm not necessarily averse to it. And today schools minister Nick Gibb did not rule out backing a move similar to the Lib Demsapos, despite accusing the party of disobeying the  vote to leave the EU.It came as EU leaders agreed to delay the Brexit deadline for the third time, setting a new flexible date of January  - which will come earlierthereaposs a deal agreed. A source told Reuters the SNP Lib Dem election bid was a factor that persuaded EU leaders to get a three-month extension over the line. Labour has insisted it wonapost back an election until Mr Johnson makes absolutely clear a no-deal Brexit is taken off the table. That had been widely thought to mean a no-deal on October .But Jeremy Corbyn has since suggested it also includes a threat of a no-deal in  - one which is wrapped up in Boris Johnsonaposs Brexit deal.Boris Johnson sailed so close to the deadline this time that a no-deal plan known as Operation Brock, slowing lorries to mph on Kentaposs M, had already come into force at am today. There was a slim chance Labour - which has told MPs to abstain or vote against an election tonight - could still change its tune before tonightaposs vote. Jeremy Corbyn was due to summon a meeting of his shadow cabinet later today. Boris Johnson wanted MPs to back a general election through the Fixed-Term Parliaments Act - which crucially would not fix the date of the poll in law, or have any conditions.The Lib Dem bid on the other hand would set the date of December  in law. Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson said this would remove his wriggle room to sneakily schedule a poll after the January  deadline. Because people canapost trust what this man says, I think setting that date in law is a very good idea, she said. But her bid for a one-line Bill could also failit becomes snarled up in amendments, such as for EU citizens to voteor to extend the franchise to -year-olds. Despite backing votes at , Ms Swinson suggested she wouldnapost want amendments saying the Bill should be as simple as possible.  She told the Today programme: It certainly, it seems to me a sensible way forward. We also understand from our contacts in the EU that putting forward this bill and sending the letter that we did has helped out EU friends have confidence thatthey offer the extension that theyaposre discussing today that that will be time well spent. One of their big concerns was that they offered an extension earlier this year, said aposdonapost waste the timeapos, and then we had a Conservative leadership election and Boris Johnson mucked about not trying to get a deal, shutting down parliament, and you know, the very master class in time wasting so, understandably, they had a degree of reluctance, I think evidenced by the fact they didnapost grant the extension on Friday when many thought they would. So Iaposm hopeful that as a result of what weaposve done we will see that extension granted today because otherwise weaposre still in the very real risk of crashing out without a deal on Thursday. She said there are ious reasons why December  makes more sense than December  for an election.  Clearly, itaposs three further days away from Christmas and I understand that the public appetite for an election around Christmas is not necessarily high so I think from the point of view of the economy and retailers, keeping it as far away as possible is helpful. We also have the consideration that there will be many people that will be moving around the country around that time. Many students who live in two places but might only be registered to vote in one place. We wouldnapost want to see people disenfranchised and so having it earlier rather than closer to the end of term time for them I think makes sense as well. And also, it is the earliest possible date where we can pass this Bill, and then have an election, so it gets it done as soon as possible, Ms Swinson added. How does a one-line election Bill work By MIKEY SMITHIf the PM can’t get the two-thirds majority he needs to trigger an election under the cumbersome Fixed-Term Parliaments Act, there is one other option. He – or anyone  – can table a one-line bill that would legally change the FTPA just like any other law. It’s a neat way around the FTPA, but it’s risky. Because it’s a fully-fledged bill, not just a motion, MPs can change it once it is under way. They could tack on anything they like – including a second referendum. But like a game of legal Buckaroo, every extra thing they hang on it makes it more likely to be pulled.

The Prime Minister claims that the NHS is not “on the table”, but only % believe him, compared to % who say he is lying and % who say they “don’t know”. The poll found that % of people are either “very concerned” or “quite concerned” about the impact a trade deal with Donald Trump could have on the NHS. And the overwhelming majority of the British public do not want the NHS included in any trade deals with any other country, according to the poll commissioned by campaign group We Own It, carried out by Survation.    It found % said they didn’t think the NHS should be included in trade deals, compared to just % who said that they did. When asked which parties they trust to ensure the NHS is a publicly funded and publicly run institution, just % said they trusted the Conservative Party compared to % for Labour - the highest of any party. Mr Johnson has denied the NHS is up for grabs in a deal on numerous occasions and ahead of meeting Mr Trump in New York last month, the PM said he would tell the President: “When we do a free trade deal, we must make sure that the NHS is not on the table, that we do not in any way prejudice or jeopardise our standards on animal welfare and food hygiene in the course of that deal, and that we open up American markets.”    The polling comes as a coalition of more than a dozen organisations - led by Keep Our NHS Public and We Own It - have come together to push the government to protect the NHS from trade deals. Ellen Lees, campaigns officer of We Own It, said: “This poll shows clearly that the public understand just how big of a threat a US trade deal is to our NHS. And it shows that they’re firmly against the idea that our NHS could be sold off bit by bit to Donald Trump and American private healthcare giants. “Because the private sector already has a major role in the NHS, it is automatically on the table in a trade deal - no matter what Boris Johnson says. “That’s why it’s absolutely vital that the government ends the privatisation of our NHS once and for all. That’s the only way we can protect it from being sold off in a trade deal.” DR Tony O’Sullivan, co-chair of Keep Our NHS Public, said: “The NHS has faced six years of destructive top-down disorganisation.

Detonating a suicide vest to take his own le and those of three of his own children, according to US reports, was al-Baghdadi callously showing no mercy to the very end. Islamic State and its medieval violent ideology isn’t vanquished, Donald Trump blindly giving the jihadists a boost by giving Turkey the green light to ethnically cleanse Kurds when he withdrew US forces. But it’s leader dead, like al Qaeda’s Osama bin Laden before him, is a signicant blow. The challenge is to end the bloodshed, establish a peace and stop the Middle East, or anywhere  for that matter, being a breeding ground for hate-filled extremists.

The -year-old fell into an inner-city Birmingham gang as a teenager and knows how lucky he is to still be alive today. There was the time he was surrounded by  rival gang members armed with knives at a bus stop. It was only running full pelt that saved him then. The time another rival smashed a mirror over his head. The time guys from his own gang turned on him with a metal bar during a dispute. And the time during a fight he was passed a kne to protect himself, only to then be battered into the side of a car, crushing his hand and pushing the weapon clean through it.  These are the stories he now tells young teens who find themselves, like he was, drawn to gang culture, often due to a sense of not belonging, little hope for their futures, or because their own families have broken down. And it is Hezron’s achievement in turning his own le around, and his dedication to helping others do the same, which has seen him crowned Prince’s Trust Young Achiever at the Mirror’s Pride of Britain Awards, in partnership with TSB. “I show the young people the scars on my face, my hands, and I tell them what happened with each one,” he explains. “I see how it opens up their eyes. They have been in those situations, they know it could have gone wrong. I say aposAny of those times I could have lost my le.apos I make them concentrate on their lives. I tell them the gang does not love them and there is another le.”    He adds: “I never thought someone like myself would be put forward for something like this. At one point, I didn’t even knowI would be alive today. “It has made me realise anything is possible, but you have to believe in yourself, and you can achieve. That’s what I try and do for the young people. I want to be the person I didn’t have when I was younger, who they can ask for advice. I needed that person, but I felt alone.” Today, Hezron runs his own business, More Talk More Action, which aims to reach more young people in this position. He is also a Prince’s Trust Young Ambassador after being signposted as a young man to a theatre scheme run by The Prince’s Trust, which enabled him to first find employment. It is a le far from his experiences as a child and teenager. Aged five, a terrible accident saw Hezron fall into a bath of boiling water at home and suffer debilitating burns across his body. But it was the bullying he suffered when he came out of hospitaland started school which was to have the most damaging effect.    Hezron’s method for coping with the bullies became to fight back, and soon he developed anger issues which spiralled and affected both his school and home le. He was excluded from both primary and secondary schools, and admits his own mum became frightened by his outbursts and their relationship eventually broke down. “It was a cycle, I became so angry I wouldn’t know what I was doing. I was violent towards my mum, my whole family. She was scared of me,” he admits. From a young age he sofa-surfed with friends and family, and even found himself sleeping rough as young as . By  he was housed in emergency accommodation, then a BB and finally given a council flat, but he felt completely alone, frightened, and struggled to cope with the pressures of adult le. By , kicked out of college after a row with a tutor, he was drawn into the gang. “It offered me a family, to me it was a bunch of brothers who would support each other, it made me feel safer” he explains.    “A lot of them were in similar positions to myself. It was just good to be part of something – I wasn’t doing anything .” Hezron began selling drugs, and although he didn’t carry a kne for fear of being stopped and searched by the police, he opted instead for a sharp pair of scissors as a “deterrent” he explains. “A lot of young people I speak today carry a kne,” he says. “But they do it out of fear. They don’t want to be a victim, they tell me they wouldn’t leave their house without a kne.” Hezron remained with the gang for around two years. In the end, it took just one supportive comment from one empathetic person to help him decide to leave. It was what he had been waiting for. Finding himself convicted for robbery aged , he went to his pre-sentencing report appointment, and the woman writing it greeted him sadly.    He recalls: “She said ‘Not another black man’. She asked me what had happened and she told me ‘You don’t deserve to go to prison. She seem like a nice guy, hanging around with the wrong crowd.” She told me things would only get worseI went to prison. “She wrote my report, and I didn’t go to prison. It made me realise that everything I was doing was pointless.” Hezron says he immediately stopped hanging out with the guys in the gang. Determined to change completely he went shopping and ditched his black hoodie and balaclava for a white top and new jeans.

And Rubeka Hussain claims their replacement was a aposhellish hotelapos with a bright green, fly-infested pool which gave her toddler a nasty eye infection. The -year-old booked an all-inclusive trip to Didum Beach Resort, costing £,, through Teletext Holidays after losing their original flights with Thomas Cook in September. Their seven-night trip was supposed to be an anniversary treat for the mum and husband Wasim Khan - and was also the first holiday for two-year-old daughter Isla Khan.    It was set to be a dream experience away from their Small Heath, Birmingham home, with the advert boasting three restaurants, four bars, waterslides and a range of activities for families and children. But on arrival at the beach resort - which featured a huge pool and aqua park - the couple discovered it had closed for the season just a day earlier and they were instead shted to another hotel. When we arrived the taxi driver took us outside the hotel and the guard outside told him that this hotel is closed and we need to go next door, Mrs Hussain told BirminghamLive. But when I booked, the agent told me everything will be open as I made it clear I want entertainment and amenities. We were robbed of our hard earned money. We booked for a five-star resort.    The family were moved to the Elegance Hotel, which they claim was a disastrous experience. This Elegance Hotel was not even a two star in my opinion, along with many holidaymakers that were in the same position as us, Mrs Hussain said. The mum says she was horried by the state of the hotel and said her daughter came home with an eye infection from the aposfilthyapos pool - which was bright green. Claims of exposed wires, brown running water from taps, a smelly apartment and centipedes crawling on the bedroom floor were among complaints outlined by the family to Teletext Holidays.    Curtains hanging off the rails, a mattress marked with dirt and ripped wallpaper can also be seen in photos taken by the family. They also said there was no entertainment as promised, dficulties getting hold of the reps and a fire exit blocked off by a trolley. Mrs Hussain said: We booked all-inclusive so we wouldnapost have to worry about going out to eat, but the food was inedible. Drinks were only fizzy so nothing for a young child. The pool was dirty, green and had loose wiring and caused my daughter to catch an eye infection. It was because they didnapost clean it. I think the cleaning filter was off  not working.    They had two pools - and the second one was closed because a girl cut her foot on a cracked tile. They offered to change our hotel when we called to complain, but we just wanted to come back to the UK. We were lied to and given  promises. This was meant to be a holiday but I’ve been so stressed in Turkey and now that we are back the stress continues. Mrs Hussain claims she has yet to receive compensation or a refund.

Alisha Bartolini, who had just started going to Liverpool Hope University, thought she may have caught aposfreshersapos fluapos following a Halloween night out.But after putting herself to bed the next morning she never woke up. Following the tragedy on November , , her mother Michaela is campaigning to ensure more young people get vaccinated against the infection.She told the Liverpool Echo : It was flu like symptoms - like freshersapos flu from being away from home and the late nights and not eating properly.Itaposs very much flu-ey type symptoms. She got up feeling unwell one morning and she put it down to being hungover from being out at a Halloween party the night before. She got up, had a shower and went back to bed.    Michaela added: She had a headache and was vomiting and everything - she was quite feverish. Thataposs just what you put it down to. Her friends didnapost think anything from it other than her being rough from the night before or coming down with something. It wasnapost in the back of their minds because you associate meningitis with babies and toddlers. Michaela, who said she would do anything to hear Alishaaposs laugh again, is backing a campaign to raise meningitis vaccination rates in Liverpool after figures showed the region has one of the lowest uptake rates in the country.    She said that while one of Alishaaposs friends from home received a letter inviting her for a vaccination, Alisha herself did not receive such information and wasnapost aware of the threat. As the five year anniversary of her daughteraposs death approaches, Michaela remembered what a vibrant, warm and friendly person Alisha was. One of the youngest in her year group, Alisha celebrated her th birthday shortly before moving to Liverpool - and was only at university for five short weeks before her death. Michaela said: At first she was a bit hesitant about going [to university] because she was a family girl but she loved her friends and was very sociable and was looking forward to that side of it.    She would make friends with everyone. I remember moving her into her halls and all the girls on her floor - by the time we left her she was already friends with everyone. She loved a chat. Older teenagers and new university students are at higher risk of infection because many of them mix closely with lots of new people, some of whom may unknowingly carry the meningococcal bacteria at the back of their noses and throats. Students can get the vaccine via their registered GP surgery or their University Health Centre. Meningitis Now is now carrying out a pilot campaign focusing on Liverpool, with specic efforts to work closely with universities and targeting students with ads on their main bus routes through the city.    Michaela said: “There isn’t a day that goes by when I don’t think about Alisha. “Her le was cut so tragically short andI can help to prevent this happening to even one other young person, I will. “Please make sure you or your child is vaccinated. Please make sure you or they know the signs and symptoms of meningitis. It is a rare disease, but it is also a disease that strikes indiscriminately and strikes fast. Because of this, knowing the signs and symptoms really can be the dference between le and death.” She added: From such a young age, Alisha was always a kind, caring and happy child growing up into a loving, thoughtful and beautul young lady. “She loved spending time between her family and friends, enjoying evenings in at home, particularly with her baby brother or catching up with her friends socially. “But one thing was for certain, Alisha was a aposMother Henapos. She would always make sure others were okay before herself and she just loved taking people aposunder her wingapos.

Further details of the daring raid which killed one the USaposs most wanted men have been released by government officials following a press conference by Donald Trump . Al-Baghdadi evaded capture for nearly a decade thanks to a series of extreme security measures. “They even made me remove my wristwatch,” recounted Ismail al-Ithawy, a top aide who was captured last year. He spoke from a jail in Iraq, where he has been sentenced to death, reports the New York Times. Baghdadi, , blew himself up with a suicide vest after being cornered in Syria by US special forces, the president said. The operation was first suggested roughly a month ago when the US began to receive intelligence on the whereabouts of Baghdadi, including aposhelpfulapos information from the Kurds. Two weeks ago intelligence officials were about aposscope outapos the ISIS leaderaposs exact whereabouts.    But it was only three days ago that Trump became aware of the plans to take out Baghdadi. As part of the plan the US had to secure permission from Russia to fly over its airspace. Trump said the White House did not disclose the nature of the operation to Russia, but told Russian officials they would like it. On Saturday, Trump arrived back at the White House at roughly .pm local timeafter a round of golf in Virginia, according to his official schedule. At around pm, he gathered in the White House Situation Room with Vice President Mike Pence, Defense Secretary Mark Esper, national security adviser Robert OaposBrien, and other intelligence officials.    They watched the raid unfold live asyou were watching a movie, said Trump. The raid soon got underway with US military personnel and military dogs lted-off in eight helicopters from an as-yet unidentied military base in the Middle East. A US official told Reuters the operation was staged  from an airbase in western Iraq. The on-the-ground operation in the Idlib region of Syria was supported by military aircraft and ships, said Trump. The soldiers were also equipped with a military robot but did not ultimately use it.    When they arrived at Baghdadiaposs compound the helicopters came under gunfire but US forces were able to quickly suppress the assault and land safely. Believing the main compound door to be booby trapped, they entered in just seconds by blasting through the wall, said Trump. We were getting full reports on a minute-by-minute basis, he added. US forces quickly cleared the compound with people either surrendering or being shot and killed, said Trump. Eleven children were removed, uninjured, and taken into care by a third party whom the president declined to name. Soldiers captured and later imprisoned several Islamic State fighters.    Baghdadi fled into a subterranean area of the complex and into a tunnel, dragging three of his young children with him. Esper told CNNaposs Jake Tapper on Sunday that US forces called for Baghdadi to surrender but the worldaposs most wanted man refused. Chased by the dogs and confronted by a dead end, Baghdadi - whimpering and crying and screaming, according to Trump - ignited his suicide vest, killing himself and his children and causing the tunnel to collapse. No military personnel were hurt although one dog was badly injured.  With Baghdadiaposs body mutilated by the blasts, US forces used a DNA test onsite to confirm his identity in around  minutes. The test results gave certain, immediate and totally positive identication. It was him, said Trump. Military, intelligence and counter-terrorism officials told the New York Times that raid was a success aposin spiteapos of Trumpaposs actions in pulling US forces out of Syria. The soldiers searched the compound, taking highly sensitive material including information on Islamic Stateaposs origins and its future plans.

So far , people are positive for the virus but health officials fear the number of those infected could be far higher as less than a quarter of the cityaposs , population has been tested.    The outbreak came to light when residents fell sick with fevers that resisted treatment, leading to a frenzied panic as they rushed to get tested for the virus. Health officials then revealed that many of the infected children had gone to the same paediatrician, Ghanghro. Local journalist Gulbahar Shaikh got his children tested as they had been treated by the suspect and was horried to discover his two-year-old daughter had the virus.    Another resident, Imtiaz Jalbani, said Ghanghro treated all six of his children and four of them contracted HIV.His -month-old child and three-year-old daughter have now died. He alleges that he saw the paediatrician rummage through rubbish for a syringe to use on his six-year-old son - who also has the virus - and that when confronted Ghanghro claimed he was only doing so because Mr Jalbani was too poor to pay for a new one, according to The New York Times. Ghanghro reportedly insisted he is innocent and never reused syringes, and health officials have said he is unlikely to be the only cause of the outbreak, as there was evidence of numerous doctors reusing syringes.

What I’ve seen since coming back is the mentality of the club changing.”And Butcher is calling on the fans to turn out in their numbers tomorrow as the Tangerines look to maintain their perfect home record on the back of three away defeats.And that kind of form, performing at two ends of the spectrum is something he and the rest of the squad are keen to put right.Butcher added: “All I can say to the fans is they need to get behind us still and they’re going to be our driving force to get us to where we need to be.“We need to make sure we’re not performing at two extremes.“We’ve been really extreme this season, going back and forth with results.

There’s some big games coming up and people are going to drop points but we just need to go on a four, five, six-game run and make sure we’re all together, pulling in the right direction. Turnarounds from defeats can make a season.”Of opponents the Pars, Butcher added: “The last time we played them we identied that they were a strong side.“We also know that every team who plays us wants to beat us more than any other team in this league.

He’s looking for a big performance, having bemoaned the Dons’ lack of aggression yesterday.After Aberdeen failed to lay a glove on Neil Lennon’s team, he said: “I can only apologise to our supporters.“They deserve better than that. I think I deserve better than that.”McInnes added: “I thought we were awful. After losing the first goal we lacked personality and determination and I felt every time the ball went in our box it was a goal to Celtic.“In the first  minutes we looked like we knew what we were doing. The first goal is awful, just awful.“Edouard can amble through and the lack of determination to stop it happening was particularly poor.“We lost confidence from there.“We can lose that game but I don’t expect to lose like this. I expect us to let Celtic know we are there.”McInnes retained defenders Zak Vyner and Greg Leigh in midfield, so impressive had they been in the - win at Fir Park. However, their lack of experience told against the champions.But they were just two players in an opening period where every man in red was out of sorts.The gaffer said: “I felt for Greg and Zak in there.“As good as they were last week, they were up against three international players .“It was dficult to get to grips with them. But that wasn’t the big issue.”Midfielder Craig Bryson, who is ing from injury and yet to have a run in the team since signing from Derby in the summer, was thrown in for the second half to shore things up.However, McInnes wasn’t taking comfort from the score staying at - after the break against a Hoops side who had fought to a - Europa League win over Lazio on Thursday.He said: “Celtic eased up in the second half as the job was done.“We can’t take Celtic on in a possession-based game, but what we can do is let them know they are in a game.“That was a huge disappointment for me.“I was astonished at some of the defending and the goals we lost. It was painful.”McInnes added: “I spoke about Celtic’s squad and ability to rotate but I saw them putting so much into the Lazio game as a real advantage for us.“I wanted a quick tempo, contact, but good players were allowed to be good players.“We spoke about not letting Celtic enjoy the game and they found a way.“They have good players as do Rangers but they are not my concern.“I’m looking for a standard of performance and we were miles off that today.”Celtic boss Neil Lennon thought his league leaders were “outstanding” considering their exertions against Italian side Lazio.He said: “We were magnicent.“The mentality of the team was fantastic and my overall feeling is of great pride.”Lennon added: “The first half was relentless and the quality of the play was fantastic to watch.“I’m just grateful for the win. It was a big ask to come here after Thursday.“We’re in a good vein of form at the minute and we’ve got back to winning ways away from home in emphatic fashion.“We knew how dficult the opposition could be and you could sense the players were up for the game.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/10/382aabe4-d7f4-41af-afaa-82b69465234b-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/10/382aabe4-d7f4-41af-afaa-82b69465234b-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/10/382aabe4-d7f4-41af-afaa-82b69465234b-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/10/382aabe4-d7f4-41af-afaa-82b69465234b-240x180.jpg 300w ","title":"sponsored dont miss your favourite wwe stars at pj live","story":"The line-up for the WWE show at PJ Live has been announced, and it’s packed full of superstars.Big names like Seth Rollins, Drew McIntyre and Alexa Bliss will be bringing the irresistible energy and drama of WWE to the new Aberdeen arena on November , pm.Tickets are still available to see Universal Champion Seth Rollins defending his belt against ‘The Fiend’ Bray Wyatt, and ‘The Man’ Becky Lynch fighting to extend her reign as Raw Women’s Champion against Sasha Banks.Plus, for the first time on Scottish soil, The Women’s Tag Team Championship will also be contested.The full line-up is as follows:Universal Championship MatchSeth Rollins vs Bray Wyatt⁠RAW Women’s Championship Match ⁠Becky Lynch vs Sasha Banks⁠Six Man Tag Team MatchKevin Owens and The Viking Raiders vs The O.C.⁠Rey Mysterio vs Randy Orton⁠WWE Women’s Tag Team Championship Match⁠Alexa Bliss and Nikki Cross vs The Kabuki Warriors⁠And more including…Rusev vs Bobby Lashley w LanaRicochet vs Drew McIntyreTickets starting from £. are still available online.

Last year, it rehomed over , domestic pets and successfully released , wild animals back to their natural environment. The society now also delivers industry-leading animal welfare educational programmes to people of all ages.In my short time with the society I know of hundreds of examples of our dedicated people going above and beyond to do all they can for the animals and humans they come across. So, I can only imagine how many fantastic stories must be out there about the people who’ve worn our unorm since we were formed.As well as those who have had a positive experience with us in the recent past, we are hoping to uncover some long lost tales from descendants of those we’ve touched in decades gone by.The society wants anyone with any interesting anecdotes or memorabilia to get in touch via the website or by emailing .years@scottishspca.org.Kirsteen Campbell, chief executive, Scottish SPCASir,The likelihood of the UK exiting the EU has now shted from ‘possible’ to ‘probable’.That gives greater focus to our efforts to prepare and proof our farming industry from the impacts of no deal.Whilst it always has been  the position of NFU Scotland that the UK must secure a favourable deal on the terms of exit with the EU, we must also support our industry through any change in the operating environment.Many NFU Scotland members might think that their businesses won’t be impacted, but the reality is that there will be implications for all of us. Some will be direct and immediate, and others more indirect and emerging through time – but the one certainty is that these will be felt by all of us involved in the agri-food chain.There are a few things that would make a big dferenceapplied right across the board in the UK.First, the UK Government’s proposed import tarf schedule desperately requires revision. It would expose some produce # specically cereals, oilseeds, potatoes, eggs and horticultural produce # to a tarf going into the EU, but would allow that same product to come into the UK with no tarf.This is farcical.To apply asymmetrical tarfs on any products between us and the EU is to completely misunderstand the nature of food security in the UK and fails to recognise that trade is vital to both the UK and the EU.One thing that can be done, regardless of Brexit, is for our own governments to prioritise using our own products when it comes to public procurement.All our politicians like to talk about how good our agricultural industry is in comparison to others across the world in terms of standards and environmental benefits, but we don’t see near enough in the way of Scottish or British products being prioritised for use in schools, hospitals and other public services.Yes, it may add one or two pence to a meal – but I would challenge governments and public procurement buyers what the real cost is of bringing products in from other parts of the world.These products certainly don’t meet our standards – not to mention the impact on climate change with food miles taken into consideration.It’s only a couple of years since the kids in our schools were getting their chicken from Thailand. Things are improving, but it’s still not Scottish chicken.This is within the gt of both Holyrood and Westminster, but it might just be the catalyst for governments to work with local authorities to do the right thing when it comes to feeding those who use our public services.Martin Kennedy, vice president, NFU ScotlandSir,I read with interest the letter from Doctor Strain in the August  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser.Might I suggest that to produce a meaningful logo for the GP practices the following criteria are applied:The logo will need to show:May I suggest there are better ways to provide a service to treat patients, without resorting to gimmicks.Name and address supplied.Sir,I was intrigued to read Finlay Craig’s ramblings in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser.Would he be willing to share the location of his magical bramble bush for it appears the fruits of this bountul bush, when mixed into a pie, contain mystical properties that can transport the diner to another world May I suggest he tries a cold slice of reality pie now and again which would snap him out of his biased reverie and bring him back to the reality of the UK parliament being suspended and the Scottish representative of the party responsible for that outrageous manoeuvre vacating her post in protest In contrast, the Scottish government is working, along with others, to stop Scotland being dragged out of Europe against its wishes. Or perhaps the suspension of democracy is okay in his dream world If Mr Craig or any of his friends eat too much of his prodigious pie, I am sure they will not hesitate to avail themselves of a free prescription for their malaise and, should they need it, free bus travel to the chemist to pick it up, all supplied by the Scottish Government. If they live on one of our beautul islands, they can soon jump on one of the new ferries being completed as I write, again thanks to the Scottish Government.All this aside, when he rejoins us on planet earth, Mr Craig might think of entering his mysterious pie in the baking section of next year#s Mid Argyll Show, though I think by that time we may all be in need of something a little stronger from Scotland’s political larder to extract us from the bitter reality of Brexit Britain.Charles Ambrose, Lochgilphead.Sir,The National Autistic Society wants to find exceptional people, schools and services making a huge dference to autistic children and adults and their families.

It keeps its money as close to home as possible so that, amid historically drastic cuts, the amount spent locally has gone up as featured inon January ,  which notes #where other authorities privatise, Preston grows its own businesses#.Preston ensures that its resources prioritise local providers and businesses wherever possible.

Its stated aims commendably include:There is no particular emphasis, however, on using its resources to grow Argyll and Bute businesses, to reduce carbon emissions and food transport miles or to foster healthy eating strategies that would benefit our local farmers through #joining up the dots# of local supply and demand.The climate emergency demands a bolder and more innovative respond, and demands it now.Mary MacCallum Sullivan, ArdrishaigSir,I wish to comment on Mr Henderson#s  open letter to Brendan O#Hara in the September  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser.The expression #crash out# of Europe is used by Conservative members of parliament, the BBC and the press. While emotive, this is what many people directly affected by Brexit feel is happening.For example, on the matter of Germans buying our fish without a trade agreement the tarf will be  per cent on our fish exports to the EU. The Germans will no longer buy our fish.We can all read about other examples of the harm being done in the press every day. The cost of implementing a no deal exit will be borne by all of us, through further austerity , increased taxes , increased national debt or a combination of all three. To my mind, such measures will indeed cause serious economic and social harm.While Brendan O#Hara received a minority of the votes in Argyll, the present government was elected  by less than  per cent of the  electorate.David Inglis, Ardrishaig.Sir,During this, National Air Ambulance Week , may I draw readers# attention to the amazing work of the country#s only charity-funded air ambulance service # Scotland#s Charity Air Ambulance .Since  this le-saving service has been flying help and hope to communities all across Scotland in response to serious illness and injury.From our base at Perth Airport, we have responded to more than , time-critical emergencies and impacted on the lives of thousands # and the need goes on.The recently-established Scottish Trauma Network has seen four key major trauma centres created at hospitals in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Dundee. The aim is to transfer all serious patients to one of these centres following pre-hospital emergency care within  minutes.The value of a helicopter air ambulance is therefore obvious.Working alongside the Scottish Ambulance Service#s air fleet, SCAA relies entirely on public donations to keep this vital resource flying.Please consider supporting SCAA in it#s le-saving work during a week when the country focuses on the crucial work of air ambulances everywhere.For further information please visit www.scaa.org.ukDavid Craig, chief executive, Scotland#s Charity Air Ambulance , Perth AirportSir,I get a magazine called #Clean Slate#.In it this month is an article where a -year-old girl, Greta Thunberg, along with  other youth activists, have issued this invitation to adults around the world: #Starting on Friday September  we are going to kick-start a week of climate action, with a world-wide strike for the climate. We are asking adults to step up alongside us and make this a turning point in our history.#Greta Thunberg was welcomed by the Speaker of the House of Commons, the leader of the Labour Party and the Secretary of State for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs.

Two men were paid to accompany Patrick the Fool on his journey from England to provide entertainment for the King and his guests while residing at Tarbert.Also recorded is a figure for #making a suit for the King at Tarbert#.  Bruce visited Tarbert on many occasions. His final visit was in the year of his death.Tarbert is believed to have been one of the earliest Royal Burghs in Argyll. An early reference as such was made in . It is also said to have had one of the earliest paved streets in Scotland.King James IV also had a close connection with Tarbert. The addition of the #keep# to the castle, part of which still stands today, was constructed at his direction. Whilst this work was underway, James summoned parliament to meet him here to discuss matters local to the area. This meeting took place on July  .Over the years, many travellers of note have passed this way and commented on Tarbert and its scenic surroundings.In  Thomas Pennant arrived by sea at East Loch Tarbert and described the scenery as #picturesque#.CGS Teighnmouthpassed through the Kyles of Bute in  and commented that #it offers no scenery worthy of notice#. He continued to note that #the romantic little harbour of East Loch Tarbert – with the overhanging keep of its ruined castle # form a scene singularly picturesque#. He became a frequent visitor to Tarbert.In  Lord Cockburndescribed the Kyles as #rugged and picturesque# but, arriving at his destination, exclaimed: #But Tarbert! East Tarbert!

The visual impact of this scheme as presently proposed will have a negative effect on the experience of everyone who lives in, or visits, Tarbert.Tarbert was designated as a conservation area in the s. Argyll and Bute Council imposes restrictions on works likely to have a visual impact on its appearance.But the council has apparently raised no objection to this visually damaging proposal. Similarly, Visit Scotland is reported as having raised no objection as well as closing all its tourist offices in Cowal, Mid Argyll and Kintyre in the past year.With the recent decline in the Loch Fyne fishing industry, Tarbert is increasingly dependent on tourism to provide employment.Other issues include the sterilisation of ground under the proposed line of overhead wiring. Opportunities to extend social housing will be restricted under the present plan.OFGEM administers a £ million fund set up to mitigate the impact of electricity infrastructure on national parks and #scenic areas#.Tarbert, along with its harbour and the isthmus linking it with West Loch Tarbert, without doubt, constitutes a #scenic area#.Reconsideration of this proposal is essential."},{"url":null,"title":"accordion and fiddle club back in tune","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe new season of Inveraray and District Accordion and Fiddle Club gets underway on Wednesday October .Guest artistes for the opening night are accordion maestro Gordon Pattullo from Coupar Angus, with Malcolm Ross on drums making a welcometo the club.Margaret Mather encouraged supporting players to join for a tune: #Without you there would be no club, so why not look out your accordion or fiddle and head for the Inveraray Inn.#This season, the club has opted for a new starting time of .pm for each session."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column october 4 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsTo an observer, it seems that Argyll and Bute Council is, at best, confused over its approach to autism.The people who know this best are those affected by the condition and their families and their view of senior council officials was made crystal clear when Autism Argyll gave up banging its head against a brick wall a year ago.Little seems to have changed since then.A council Autism Strategy Group is apparently being bypassed in the formulation of a strategy, yet the councillor in charge of health and social care says the strategy is the responsibility of the HSCP.Yet again, it is people affected by autism who are losing out.

John Kennedy played the ball between the penalty spot and the D where Allan MacDonald let the ball run across his body before turning and blasting home, giving Cameron Sutherland no chance in the Oban goal.There were harsh words in the Oban Camanachd dressing room at half-time and revamp saw Keith MacMillan replace Gary McKerracher whilst the forward line switched to a three-one formation with Andrew MacCuish on the D.The switches paid idends when the home side drew level just four minutes into the second half when Daniel MacCuish ran forward and Daniel MacVicar volleyed the ball into the net to make it -.Oban Camanachd took the lead on  minutes when Andrew MacCuish’s turn and shot flew past the keeper.Just a couple of minutes later, Andrew MacCuish turned provider as he found Scott MacMillan who finished with a low drive from the left although his effort may have taken a slight deflection.Two of the game’s best young goalkeepers were on show, and Inveraray’s Scott MacLachlan saved his side from a bigger defeat though Oban Camanachd did have to rely on Cameron Sutherland who made good saves near the end from Garry MacPherson and Allan MacDonald.The win for Oban Camanachd means that they and Kyles are the only sides, other than championship favourites Kingussie, in the title race as the season moves into the closing stages."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column october 11 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowACHA tenantIt has been a while since we carried a story where a tenant has a complaint about a housing association property.

feeding plastic pieces to their chicks but how often do we look to see the damage done to our own streams and rivers \"We need to realise that plastic pollution affects us all.\"The TownsRiver clean in April was a real success and I would like to do everything in my power to keep this issue in the public eye.\"There will be organised cleans in more than  Borders towns on six dferent rivers for you to join.\"Alternatively, you and your family can do your own litter pick on your local stream or river.\"The Great Borders River Clean is part of a broader effort to reduce the use of single-use plastics across the region.\"Mr Rawsons school was the first primary school in Scotland to successfully eliminate single-use plastics and the town is also making progress to becoming one of

further improvements are required across much of the local authorityambitious savings plans and satisfaction ratings are to be met.Audit Scotland carried out a major review into Scottish Borders Council between January and May.As well as interviewing councillors and senior officers, auditors sat in on meetings, reviewed documents and files, and held meetings with trade union representatives.While the resulting -page report card highlights an improving picture since the previous audit in , bosses have been told to communicate better and form better relationships with partners, such as NHS Borders.The report also highlights required improvements in some departments and the need for elected councillors to be better equipped for the tough decisions they face.Graham Sharp, chair of the Accounts Commission, told us: ldquoThe continued progress Scottish Borders Council has made to transform services is encouraging.\"Now it must focus on several critical areas including tackling underperforming services, ensuring councillors have the right training to enable them to fulfil their responsibilities and getting to grips with both staff and community engagement.Across the  performance indicators used in the Best Value Assurance Report, Scottish Borders Council was found to be below average in more than half.While education and social work are doing well, other aspects of the local authority arent quite making the grade.A lack of investment in creating employment and boosting tourism was criticised, as was the low amount of contracts awarded to local companies and the fall in the number of bills settled within  days.The deteriorating condition of local authority buildings was also highlighted.Problems since the outsourcing of IT services to multinational firm CGI - a -year contract worth pound million - were also raised by auditors.While the report identies the delays and issues which plagued customer access of the councils online services, auditors said it was too soon to gauge the impact of iPads taking over more traditional teaching methods in Borders schools from this year.And the methodology of farming out senior staff, such as the Executive Director for Commercial Activity spending four days of his week as managing director of the failed SB Cares, and the Executive Director for Strategic Partnerships seconded to the South of Scotland Enterprise Agency three days each week, was also questioned.The report stated: \"While this is a positive and innovative approach aimed at realising the councils wider ambitions, it must continue to ensure that there is sufficient capacity to deliver local services.\"But, perhaps, coming in for the most criticism was the current culture of secrecy and the need for better communication and engagement with staff, councillors and the public.The report stated: \"The council should be more effective in evaluating, managing and reporting its performance, bringing greater clarity on where and how its services need to improve.\"It also needs to get better at the reporting of performance - both in terms of information considered by members and in reporting to the public.\"Budgeting at the local authority, though, was applauded by auditors.And, during extremely dficult economic times, the managing to maintain its usable reserves in case of emergencies was also identied.Although Audit Scotland identied further development was needed for the ambitious Fit for  mid-term savings plan, which aims to trim pound. million from budgets by , the report is complimentary of cost cutting to date.The report stated: \"The council has a good record of achieving savings and has reflected the impact of demographic change on demands for services and pay increases for staff, in its financial plans.\"However, in common with all other councils, the financial outlook remains a signicant challenge.\"Council chief executive Tracey Logan welcomed the detailed analysis of her local authority.And she admitted many of the problems in the Audit Scotland report are already being tackled.She told us: \"We will take on board Audit Scotlandrsquos feedback and recommendations, many of which we had already identied ourselves and are taking action on, and continue to drive forward transformational change across all our services through our Fit for

Council will be asked rethink its controversial playparks proposals, following two petitions that were signed by over a thousand concerned residents.In May , the council agreed plans to consult on the possible closure of  small playparks it says are underused and falling into disrepair.Instead, the council plans to spend poundm over the next decade on six large playparks, three skateparks and four fitness shelters.However, following a backlash from residents in Hawick and Kelso, two petitions have been handed into the local authority objecting to the plans.Nine Kelso playparks are at risk of closure: High Croft Meadow Court Orchard Park Rosewood Gardens Springwood Rise Spylaw Park Sydenham Court Woodside Gardens and the Kelso petition has attracted  signatures.Ten playparks are at risk in Hawick: Bowden Road Burnfoot School Hawick Green Hislop Gardens Leaburn Drive Mayfield Millers Knowe Waverley Walk Wellington Court and Wilson Drive and the Hawick petition has attracted  signatures.Those petitions were presented to the councilrsquos audit and scrutiny committee today, October , so it could hear from the lead petitioners and decide how to respond.Appearing before the committee, Kirsty Wichary, lead petitioner for Kelso, told councillors: ldquoWhat do we want our towns to look like in the future  Financial constraints aside, do we not look to have a beautul

choice, which would they choose ldquoTechnology isnrsquot helping our children to lead healthy, well-rounded lives. The stress of being a youngster in the st century is enormous.ldquoWe should be investing in more play areas and green spaces instead of taking them away.ldquoThe thought of removing these playparks seems a very backwards step, a step towards a cultural desert and a future for our youngsters with more weight problems, more mental health issues and future generations unable to communicate effectively, even within their own peer groups.ldquoDo you really want to be remembered as the council who handed out iPads but took away the parks Hawickrsquos lead petitioner, Greg Dalgliesh, owner of the townrsquos Think Fitness  Less gym in Hawick, was unable to attend the meeting due to a family bereavement, soHawick and Hermitage councillor Watson McAteer presented his petition on his behalf.He told the committee: ldquo mainly local residents, parents and family members in Hawick have chosen to exercise their right to object to a proposal that would see  playparks across the Scottish Borders, including  in Hawick, the largest town in the Borders, effectively close as a result of a disinvestment of financial support from this council.ldquoThe vast majority of these people and the many who support this action through other means are stakeholders in Scottish Borders Council. They live here, they are required to pay their council tax and, consequently, they have a right to determine how that money should be spent.ldquoI quote from the petition: lsquowe believe in this instance lsquobigger and better facilitiesrsquo should not be justication to remove the smaller playparks that are situated in the ious housing estates in Hawick and the Borders.ldquolsquoIt is very clear from the comments associated with this petition and via social media these smaller parks are still well used and have been described as a safe place to play and exercise on the doorstep of many homes.ldquo lsquoNot everyone can access the likes of Wilton Lodge Park on a regular basis, and children with additional needs also find these areas too busy and noisyrsquo.Councillors discussed a number of possible actions including sending the playpark proposals back out to the public for further consultation and gauging the opinion of community councils in affected areas.In the end, councillors voted to support sending a motion to the next full council meeting, scheduled for Thursdayasking it to reconsider giving authority to officers to determine which playparks can be closed.That motion was proposed by Tweeddale East councillor Heather Anderson and seconded by Selkirkshire councillor Elaine Thornton-Nicol.A counter motion, proposed by East Berwickshire councillor Jim Fullarton and seconded by Jedburghrsquos Scott Hamilton, was also put forward, but it lost out to Ms Anderson and Ms Thornton-Nicolrsquos suggestionby five votes to three.Speaking after the meeting, Ms Wichary said: ldquoIrsquom very happy that itrsquos going to have to go back to the council to be reconsidered.ldquoIrsquom assuming, hopefully, that our petitions in both Kelso and Hawick have given them a lot of food for thought and that we wonrsquot see the closure of all the parks that were mentioned.ldquoItrsquos very clear that there are cost implications, but Irsquom quite confident that there will be some sort of compromise made.Mr McAteer added: ldquoI am delighted that the majority of the councilrsquos audit and scrutiny committee have supported the Hawick petition

And a reminder that Im not getting any younger as I try to grow old gracefully.JCCs, now a septuagenarian, style has remained a constant.His image of the suit, shagpile black hair and sunglasses remain intact. His social realism poetic constructs seem relevant today as they did during his inception, extrapolated initially from the often nihilism and tales of social decay that earmarked punk mark one.Poetry is often a barometer of an epoch or epochs. Combining observation and the written word. JCC has become a master of mind imagery, social commentary, surrealism, and semantics and above all story telling. We get it because it resonates with us.It is us or we know someone who it references. Sometimes dystopian, often hilarious and never dull. Add the heavy Salfordian brogue the chemistry set is complete.The performance was slightly peculiar to what I was expecting.Maybe my expectations were misguided or unrealistic. There were some long periods of stand-up comedy that laboured at times.It was only when \"Johnny\" ed to his natural home of poetry recital that he got back on track. Though his joke about Billy Bragg being in crisis because he hadnt released an album in two weeks, I found amusing.But when he got back to the poetry it was a reminder why most people were here.Most poems were from the back catalogue and instantly recognisable. A greatest hit set list.JCC proceeded with Hire Car and the sharply expletive named Get Back on Drugs You Fat F***.Well it was an adult show after all.Common language for common poetry. And it never did Billy Connelly any harm. The poem insinuating it was easier to lose weight being on drugs.Beasley Street, arguably his most well-known poem received one of the best reactions of the night. Imbued with the description of a rock bottom street, a dreg of society and where everything that could go wrong did in this street. A caricature of a threadbare existentialism. Mainly bought on by social and economic deprivation.And then a natural supersession in the form of an epilogue Beasley Street Bouled recital, as the street had now changed into middle class suburbia.Next up Ive Fallen in Love with My We. A reference to marriage, the vows and marital bliss. Tongue in cheek of course.The \"bloody song\" Evidently Chickentown, was greeted with widespread applause. More nihilistic scorn and deprecation of a town, that is in a state of dys.Funny how we tend to laugh at the misfortune of others. But we do.Twat was another poem that represented consistency in tonights performance. A crowd pleaser for all times. Twat being the ultimate character assassination and castout. Bringing sporadic fits of laughter within the audience.The closing recital I Wanna Be Yours, famously adopted by The Arctic Monkeys for one of their songs, represented a slight U-turn in the writing of JCC. More linked to a character who wishes to show an undying love for someone . The positives of the human condition.

That race took place over the course of last weekend.The series featured five rounds at dferent venues, and each race was set up like a car rally, with untimed uphill transition stages leading to ious timed downhill sections, the results of which were amalgamated into an overall race time. The stages ied massively in , from as little as  seconds to an absolute behemoth we endured at Laggan in April which took us  minutes to ride! The topography and trail surface dfered wildly from venue to venue but also from stage to stage, and the taped trails we raced down last weekend at Fort William epitomised this eclectic set-up.Stage  was the easiest and least technical track we have raced on all year, an entirely man-made sprint through flowing banked corners coated in compacted quarry dust. Of course you had to be careful you didn`t push too hard, it is all too easy to wreck a race run by hitting the deck on an easy stage. We assumed that the organisers were trying to lull us into a  sense of security with stage #and we were so right!Stage  started halfway down the legendary World Cup track , channelling riders through some savage rock gardens before cutting off to the right along a lung-busting fireroad before descending into another sculpted hardpack track which then erted down a horrendously muddy, freshly cut chute that was littered with roots big enough to swallow a bike wheel whole. Even walking down it was impossible.A big transition ride towards Torlundy took us to the top of stage , which was the famous Blue Crane trail running into Ridgeline. Both of these tracks are black-graded on a good day, but there is a huge dference between trying to ride these ‘for fun’ and then trying to race on them once  people have spent a whole Saturday skidding them to bits in the tipping rain! A lot of people fell foul of this stage, but we survived and we absolutely loved it.Stage  was a dferent animal altogether. We had tackled it fairly early on practice day and hadn`t had any issues with it, but the swarm of maniacs who had ridden it in the rain since our earlier visit had turned it into an absolute swamp and the ruts were so deep that I found it almost impossible to negotiate with my limited skills. Dave telling me afterwards that he had romped it didn`t help my mood one bit!The last  stages were so high up the mountain that we needed a trip on the gondola to get to them. The black graded Top Chief track is a fearsome animal that follows the best twisty bedrock line around the hill before plummeting several hundred feet straight down off it into the tree line below, where it once again becomes sanitised into a flowing, twisty and utterly hilarious serpent of a trail that had riders drting and whooping all the way to the carpark. The organisers had cleverly split the Top Chief track into two stages, as there is a long section of perched wooden boardwalk high up on the mountain that is great fun to ride but would be far too dangerous to race on. Stage  was therefore very short -taking most riders about  seconds to ride- while stage  was a  minute monster. What a way to finish a season!So how did we do David was fastest of the three of us, as he has been all season. He finished in a time of  minutes,  seconds. He races in the Senior category , so it is a tough school littered with sponsored riders and crazy kids. He finished th in seniors on the day, and th overall out of an entry of  riders. Having failed to finish the race at Laggan earlier in the year due to a mechanical breakdown, David has been constantly playing catch-up but he still managed to finish in a brilliant nd place overall in the seniors category for the season.Alex has ridden consistently all year and has managed to tread the fine line between wrecking and ruling perfectly at every round. He had one of his very few crashes on the last stage at Fort William which cost him a few seconds, but he still ed a very respectable time of : to finish nd in the Masters category. The Masters section almost always attracts the largest entry and it is full of well-heeled chargers on very expensive steeds, so for Alex to finish in th place in that championshipin his first full season is a highly respectable result.I have continually been either on par or just slower than Alex on nearly every stage of the year, and nothing changed here. I knowI`ve kept within a few seconds of him I have done just fine, and I managed my ride to achieve this perfectly right up until the last stage where a cruel puncture right on top of the hill put paid to any chances of a good result to finish the year. With  top s already in the bag for the season though , I managed to hold onto th place in the Grand Veteran`s championship which was some consolation for a day that finished with me feeling, well, a bit deflated.Competing in this series has been a brilliant experience for us. We have had some hilarious times racing our bikes through some of Scotland`s very best scenery, and we have loved camping out of the back of vans. The organisers at No Fuss Events have done an outstanding job of setting up a professionally run race series in some dficult locations and have always managed to tread the right side of a precarious line, providing us with stages that have been just barely on the rideable side of ridiculous!David Muirhead leads Alex Dickson down the rocky Top Chief track during Saturday#s practice.

A high-energy showing in Paisley saw the McFadyens-sponsored side run out convincing winners.With the match going ahead at the Kibble’s grass park despite the heavy rain overnight and during the week leading up to the game, the surface was in surprisingly good condition, allowing the Pupils to get into their attacking flow early on.Up against a home side not lacking in height and physical stature, the Pupils had to be ready to contend with some lofted early balls from back to front by the hosts, whose game plan seemed to be to get the ball to their forwards as quickly as possible, but the Pupils# defence of Fraser Wylie, Ross Souden, Ryan McConnachie and Stuart Crossan, stood up to the task well.The Feathers Inn-sponsored Pupils quick passing and inidual pace and skill in the final third caused the hosts problems early on, and Ryan Gilchrist and Gregor McFadyen, and both had almost identical attempts to score, but snatched at their shots at the vital moment.However, the Kintyre Park side would not be denied for long, and scored after  minutes through a sharp passing move that released Gregor McFayden, who buried an arrowed shot from the edge of the box to continue his excellent goalscoring form.Then, the visitors made it - after  minutes, when an enterprising move out of defence found right-back Crossan, whose ball through to Johnny McCormick allowed the right winger to cut inside onto his left foot and release a thunderous first-time drive into roof of the net for a great goal, his second of the season.After seeing their deficit doubled, Carlton for their part put their Kintyre visitors under a bit of pressure from several corners and free kicks, but the Pupils’ defensive discipline continued to win over.Into the second half, the Pupils made it - when Donald McCallum scored another great goal, in a move started by Liam Renton, whose in-swinging corner was cleared to the edge of the penalty box where the ex-Dumbarton man McCallum made space to drive a deflected shot into the top corner of the net.At this point in the match, all three subs were used, with Ellis Robertson and Michael McKinlay replacing the excellent deep-lying midfield pairing of Ryan Gilchrist and Liam Renton, and Ross Brown entering in the fray in a direct swap with winger McCormick.The youngster Brown quickly got involved to create the Pupils# fourth goal, outpacing the Carlton full-back to draw out the last defender and square the ball across for Scott Souden to cheekily chip the ball over the home keeper into the net.The rampant Pupils completed the scoring in the th minute after hesitation between a Carlton defender and his keeper allowed McFadyen to nip in, touch the ball round the keeper to score a simple but well-earned second goal, for his brace on the day, and his fourth of the season.At the other end, the Pupils were determined to get their second consecutive clean sheet in league action, and while young keeper Alistair Ferguson spilled a deflected free kick in the latter stages, he bravely ed at the feet of the striker to smother his effort. The Pupils management noted how Ferguson’s kicking and distribution was first-class throughout the match.A Pupils spokesman said: ‘It was a great team effort, with our attacking players working together to cause problems all game. At the back, we defended high balls and direct play really well.’The Pupils are in league action again tomorrowwhen they welcome Argyll rivals Lochgilphead Red Star.

George reminisced: ‘It was announced at a Town Council meeting that the Royal couple was scheduled to visit. It was all to be top secret, but that didn’t happen. The next morning the #secret# was ulged in a queue in one of the town’s shops and the news was out.’With a smile that showed how fond these memories are to him, George continued: ‘The Royal Yacht Britannia was anchored out in the loch and a small boat brought the Queen and Prince Philip to the quay where my father was delegated to catch and secure the rope. They were then driven to the Town Hall and there was a huge crowd present.‘Campbeltown Gaelic Choir, conducted by Mr M G McCallum who was also a councillor, had a lovely surprise for the Royal visitors. Prince Charles had just been made Prince of Wales, so the choir sang ‘God Bless the Prince of Wales’. This was very well received, and the Queen said that she had not heard it before.’George and Mrs McMillan were present at a reception given by the Town Council in the Town Hall. George remembers that he shook hands with the Queen and spoke with the Duke of Edinburgh. He said: ‘Only those invited could speak to the Queen, but the Duke moved among the gathering and spoke to some of the councillors. I was a coal miner at Machrihanish at that time and he asked me and some other miners about our work.’He continued: ‘The food and drinks were served on silver trays by waiters in tails and bow-ties. Afterwards, when the couple was taken on a tour of the town, the heavens opened and oh how it rained and rained.’A town councillor from May  to its disbanding in , and then a councillor on the District Council and the Strathclyde Regional Council, George was to meet the Queen and other members of the Royal Family on other occasions.

The wind had a strange mildness in its touch.His grandson was in the joy of the moment, finding shells, climbing rocks and throwing stones into the sea. His grandfather watched, wishing he too could join in the fun. But age had crept up on him. His joints tweaked with pain every time he tried to behave like his younger self, making him very cautious. So he found a rock on which to sit and watched over his grandson as he explored.His thoughts were taken away from the beach and he began to think of his we. She had dearly loved their grandson but sadly she was only an image in a photograph for her grandson now. He was too young when she died to have any real memories of her. It was at moments like this that he missed her most, for she loved the beach. And at night, of course, for he was still unused to sleeping alone after  years of sharing the night with the woman he loved.

His granddad rose from his rock and walked over to him.ldquoCome on granddad, jump the waves with me, he called out, his face beaming with joy. The boyrsquos shoes were now completely soaked, as were the lower part of his trousers. The old man knew he would be in trouble with his daughter for allowing this to happen. Common sense told him to get annoyed and tell his grandson to come out immediately andto the car.ldquoI donrsquot think your mum will ever trust me again to look after you, he said.Another wave rolled in and the young lad screamed with delight and jumped over it.ldquoCome on granddad!The old man reckoned that the boyrsquos shoes were already soaked and a few more minutes in the sea wouldnrsquot make things any worse. He couldnrsquot bend down properly to take his own shoes off, but he waded into the sea anyway. He kept himself steady with his walking stick in one hand, and took the hand of his grandson with the other.They stood together and watched as a wave rolled in. The boy yelled with delight as he jumped over it, holding fast onto his granddadrsquos hand, who made his walking stick jump over it.ldquoAgain granddad, again, the young lad called out, laughing. Wave after wave came in and they faced them together.ldquoWe need to go now and get dry and warm up, said his granddad after a while.ldquoJust one more, please!And so they had one more wave jump together and headed for the car, both equally soaked.

I donrsquot believe it, what were you thinking  And now my car will be full of sand.ldquoI was thinking of your mum, he said. ldquoShe loved the beach and jumping the waves when we were young, and so did you when you were wee.ldquoYes, but not with our shoes on! said his daughter angrily, peeling off a sock from her son and pointing to his sodden shoes.ldquoLook at your shoes, dad, yoursquore not a child, you should know better.ldquoIt was so fun, mum, said her son, asto explain the state they were in.When they got back to the house, the granddad went to a cupboard and took out a box.

What is it I always do riddles when I tell stories. I think of riddles and stories as close cousins which support each other.A good brain-teasing riddle is usually fun, and children in particular love the challenge of solving a riddle, as well as making their own ones up.Irsquom often greeted with pleas for ldquoTim, tell us one more riddle when I enter a school, and Irsquom often challenged to solve a riddle made up by one of the children.They are an ancient form of learning and entertainment.The first discovered written riddles are close to , years old. They were written in Cuneorm, the writing of the ancient Sumerians.A shortened and simplied version of one of these earliest riddles is: ldquoA house you enter blind, but come out with sight. What kind of house is it  The answer is a school, although some may raise an eyebrow at this answer.Perhaps the most famous riddle from antiquity is the Riddle of the Sphinx to Oedipus, recorded in ancient Greek around the fth century BC: ldquoWhat is the creature that walks on four legs in the morning, two legs at noon, and three legs in the evening The answer is a human being. When a baby we crawl on four legs, as an adult we walk on two legs, in old age we need a third leg .With my now continuous painful knee, this riddle has particular relevance for me, although Irsquom stubbornly resisting the stick!I use riddles as ice breakers in storytelling sessions and as an engagement technique because they quickly hook an audiencersquos attention since they are, by their nature, interactive.But they are also great fun to use with the children in your family.I use them to help distract and calm my younger ones when they are fractious. I use them in the morning when the kids are getting ready for school so they concentrate on them while they are getting ready.We make the riddles about the things we can see and the things we are doing, for example: ldquoTherersquos a big one and a wee one and three in between, we are two families of five, we are all going to nursery, but we are usually not seen. Who are we  The answer, of course, is my sonrsquos toes!For younger kids, itrsquos important to repeat riddles they already know the answer to. It helps them learn the riddle and how wordplay works. It also teaches them the rhythm of how they are told.My four-year-old is getting pretty good at this, although the answers to his own made-up riddles donrsquot always make sense.That doesnrsquot matter at this stage, whatrsquos important is hersquos developing an understanding of how they work and it encourages him to look for things to make riddles about.His nearly six-year-old sister likes to challenge him too.Her riddle ldquoI am short when I sit, I am long when I jump, what am I  had me thinking for some time before I got the answer: a frog.To make a riddle, think of the answer first. Then work the riddle up to the answer. It involves thinking about all the dferent qualities, uses of and parts of the answer and how they can be twisted or described dferently.For example, a shoe has a tongue but canrsquot talk, a clock has a face and hands but no body, a river has a bed but doesnrsquot sleep.Once introduced to riddle-making, children can get really engaged with it. A group of seven-eight-year-olds in a P class challenged me last week with a riddle they had made up themselves: ldquoI have a brain full of teacherrsquos knowledge, I crash without moving, I freeze while staying warm, what am I  The answer is a computer.Some riddles rhyme and it can be an extra challenge to think of a rhyming riddle, but they donrsquot have to rhyme.It really is a fun and rewarding activity to make a regular habit in the car, dinner table, on a walk or even a bedtime riddle.To help you out, there are literally thousands of examples of riddles in books, on the internet, in history, films and ones you hear. But the best ones will be those made up yourself, and the more you do it, the better at it you will become.And the benefits of riddling regularly with your family can be signicant, especially for children.

It is felt at the moment that the draft in its entirety is not acceptable until this letter is lodged and any concerns we have are taken on board.ldquoNot everybody understood everything that was involved in the draft plan but time was needed to make sure not only all the community councillors were more familiar with the draft plan but we had heard from HBCP and Haddington residents.ldquoIt was felt in the past that at community council meetings not enough time had been dedicated to it, hence the reason why Tuesday night happened.When the controversial proposals were revealed, the local authority confirmed it was ldquoexploring additional options for sustainable travel improvements in and around Haddington town centre.The new lsquoedge of centrersquo car park, dubbed a park and stride or a park and ride, would encourage people to walk or be bussed from Whittingehame Drive back into the town centre.No location has been confirmed for any new car park, although there have been concerns raised as to how it would impact upon community events such as Nungate Gala and the townrsquos fireworks.The long-stay car park at the townrsquos Tesco store, which is used by many people working in the town centre, could also become a short-stay car park.Joanna Gibson, HBCP chairwoman, outlined the grouprsquos feelings about the proposed scheme before non-community councillors were asked to leave the meeting ndash a decision that, according to East Lothian Council, was entirely down to the community council.A number of businesses feared they would not be able to operate through a y construction period. There were also worries that businesses would be forced to close and, with none moving in, it would result in a poorer High Street.Mrs Gibson said: ldquoWe do not think that this design has enough merit to counter the huge disruption of even phase one of the plan.ldquoThere were at least three plans at the initial consultations, why were none of the others considered  Perhaps within these plans we might have found a non-disruptive way to actually improve the town centre.ldquoThe shared space for events we believe will rarely be used as there does not seem to be any motivation or intentions, to our knowledge, to appoint someone to manage this.ldquoWe already have excellent event space outside the Corn Exchange offering indoor and outdoor event space and at Whittingehame Drive, and round the River Tyne where very successful community events are held.ldquoWe believe that parking is an important factor in retaining businesswe are to compete with the [proposed] new retail park [at Gateside] and survive and prosper.ldquoThis has also been the conclusion of many high street and town centre survival papers and studies worldwide.A council spokesman said: ldquoWe are continuing to develop proposals to improve the attractiveness, ality and accessibility of the town in support of the community and local businesses. This includes improved pedestrian and cycle access, as well as exploring additional options for sustainable travel improvements in and around Haddington town centre.ldquoOur priorities are to protect and enhance the local environment while supporting the local economy.

Despite the objection of the Democratic Unionist Partyand anti-abortion crusaders, it was ruled that from midnight it would be legal to have an abortion in Northern Ireland, as in the Republic of Ireland, as in the rest of the UK.With the passage of this legislation, women in the first  weeks of pregnancy who wish to have a termination will no longer have to skulk out of the country, or purchase online pills, rendering them open to prosecution should these make them so unwell they require medical attention.After next April, following an interim period during which access to services on the mainland will be freely available, the situation in Northern Ireland will change radically. Those who are pregnant as a result of incest or rape those who know their foetus has an incurable disease that will allow them little quality of le for as long as they survive those who have been told they must go full term, even though the baby has died, will finally be given a degree of dignity and comfort. At last, they will be able to end a pregnancy of their own volition, in their homeland, without stigma and with the full support of the medical professionals who tend to them.It is a not a subject for wild rejoicing, as was evident in the sombre response of campaigners on learning the law had been passed. The mood was more of relief than jubilation. Nobody can feel joy at the idea of a pregnancy that, for whatever reason, is better ended.But it is possible to feel gratitude that an old and crippling injustice, a hangover of a puritanical stranglehold on womenrsquos lives, has been overturned. As of now, Northern Irish women are entitled to decide on their own welfare and that of their unborn child. It is a right that is not only legal but ethical.That these new laws are among the most liberal in Europe is remarkable, given the strength and tenacity of opposition to this issue. It must exacerbate the fury of the anti-abortion camp to watch the political mothership in London impose its will with such vigour.That this has happened under a Conservative government with which the DUP was in partnership, is an added grievance. As is the fact that even the Republic of Ireland, once a by-word for religious conservatism, last year voted to allow terminations . This volte face was salt in the wound for pro-lers and pro-choice activists alike.The measure of how historic this landmark will prove can be gauged by the opening of the padlock on the Assemblyrsquos gates. Sinn Fein did not turn up, but Arlene Forster, leader of the DUP, announced that, despite this act, her party would explore ldquoevery possible legal option to prevent the provision of abortion services within their borders.A fuming zealot was less restrained: ldquoin todayrsquos world the most dangerous place to be is actually in the womb of a woman. There could hardly be a more calculated insult to womankind, but the depth of this manrsquos misogyny highlights the intensity of prejudice and oppression with which the pro-choice lobby has had to contend.This momentous step is good news for the United Kingdom, as is impending legislation to allow same-sex marriage from next January. All this is positive. Yet it is a sad day for the Union that both decisions, which will have far-reaching social implications, are not the work of Irish politicians but of Westminster.Since the Assembly collapsed in January , its day to day business has been handled by civil servants. You might argue they are doing such a good job they are enabling Sinn Fein and the DUP to maintain their stand-off. That not even the murder of the journalist Lyra McKee could encourage these parties to put aside their quarrel indicates the bitterness and ision at the heart of Irish politics.Yet while the Assembly has been lying all these months in an induced coma, London has not been idle. Those on the pro-choice side of the debate might have mixed feelings, since their argument has been vindicated thanks to action by the English. Time was when anything that came out of Westminster was regarded in certain quarters as toxic. How ironic, then, that the Assemblyrsquos denizens have allowed their internal wrangling, their myopia and obstinacy, to allow an often loathed overlord to step into their shoes and usher voters into a more compassionate age.That must be galling for everyone. Then again, perhaps not. When Stormont reconvened for the space of roughly an hour, squabbling made any hope of constitutional challenge impossible. It was hardly edying. Rather than acting as a reminder that the Assemblyrsquos members have the power to settle the countryrsquos affairs without interference from outside, it was instead a shambles, a pantomime whose script had been lted straight from the myth of Pandorarsquos Box.I would not be surprised , following this, some are wonderingthey should dispense with the Assembly altogether, since they are better served by panjandrums across the sea. Others, meanwhile, will be looking south towards the Republic, anticipating the time when old isions are lted, and all of Ireland is united peacefully once more.What lies between now and that day, should it ever arrive, will be turbulent, to say the least. For the meantime, it is paradox enough that it has taken Westminster to unlock the chains in which Northern Irelandrsquos women have been shackled. The symbolic signicance of this long overdue act should give the refusniks at Stormont pause for thought."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/10590284.jpg?type=article-full","title":"guide-cosiest-pubs-around-scotland","story":"Cugravel Cugraveil, GlasgowYou canrsquot get much cosier than Cugravel Cugraveil - Glasgowrsquos only heated and covered City Centre winter garden.The Cugraveils cosy, intimate vibe and unique atmosphere is second to none.

studied composition at the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland, graduating in , and has since worked across a wide range of disciplines, including solo electronic music and film scoring.He has been commissioned to create a piece of work of artistic value and relevance concerning Suilven and he will be creating a sound work that draws upon the mountainrsquos ldquogeography and sonic ecology.The

which has already had a big impact on him and his work.He wrote on his mountain blog: The opportunity to come to Suilven, spend time in the area and produce new work in response to it was very attractive for a number of reasons.ldquoA big one is that for an artist making the kind of work that I make, chances to spend time and work in a relatively remote part of the country are few and far

the area a soundscape unlike anywhere , and will also guide someone exploring that soundscape to listen from new, dfering perspectives.ldquoAll these elements combining convinced me that this would be

Glasgow and Assynt to collect recordings as he interprets Suilven through the medium of sound.The peak has already captured the imaginations of many.Legendary climber Sir Chris Bonington named it as

landscape of bog and bare granite, he said.ldquoI first climbed Suilven back when I was  and it is one of the most magical days I have ever had.ldquoIt was my second holiday in Scotland, just after I

Why  Because the basic obstacle to success was not understood. It is that the EU will not allow a deal advantageous to the UK. It set out to damage us to encourage other countries to remain. It has as as good as said \"you cannot leave because we must have a hard border\", which it knows is impossible and which the DUP, which wishes to be integral in every way to the UK, would never approve or support in a Commons vote.Successive prime ministers have been in an impossible position because of the limits of what the EU will allow. Decency from the EU disappeared with the vote to leave. Aided and abetted by the fth column of MPs who then reneged on their promises to support the referendum result and have been subverting it ever since with one amendment after another, every one dishonest: holding up the process hoping for a reversal, a morally indefensible move. They even bleat \"we are acting for the good of the country. We are the democrats here . The damage will be colossal.\" The notion that only damage can result is a hysteria fomented by them. But it has not succeeded. People, the majority, want to see Brexit delivered.There was, with hindsight, only one possible move by the UK which could have led to a successful Brexit: leave with no deal. Then the UK is not subject to EU rules or courts and can carve out for itself what its arrangements will be. For sure, the EU will be arriving in droves to re-establish trade, because it will not do without it. Let it make the trade deals. We seek to trade with the wide world and refuse to be restricted.

I am, I suppose, even rarer, as a former Tory who has become a non-member, floating voter, sceptic of political parties and someone with relative openness to Scotlandrsquos constitutional future, albeit with a fixed belief in social and economic liberalism.:Guy Stenhouse: SNP does not have cast iron mandate for indyrefOn this occasion the discussion was about party election strategy, on a day which ended with a degree more certainty, courtesy of the SNP and the LibDems, that we would indeed be enjoying a December election. But I was not laughing at Kevin. For there was a third participant in this discussion - James Mills, a former adviser to Jeremy Corbyn and John McDonnell.Jamesrsquo first intervention in the discussion was to excoriate Jim Cusick, an experienced lobby journalist formerly of the Independent, the Sunday Times and the BBC. Immediately before the discussion between James, Kevin and I, Jim provided an analysis which included the internal misgivings inside Labour about Corbynrsquos fitness for office. It was a highly partisan response to a highly non-partisan analysis.Now, I should clary that I am not proud of myself for chuckling, and I did not do so out of any malice towards James. Hersquos a highly politically motivated person, which is to be admired, as well as a husband and a father, which is to be admired more. Really I was laughing ironically at myself, because Jamesrsquo intervention cemented in my head a concern I have harboured for some time: that recent referendums have served to obliterate the lines which previously existed between journalists, commentators and activists.\"@context\": \"https:schema.org\",\"@type\": \"VideoObject\",\"name\": \"Brexit: Three days until Britain is scheduled the EU\",\"description\": \"Brexit: Three days until Britain is scheduled the EU\",\"thumbnailUrl\": \"https:cdn.jwplayer v media RWzrdwAc poster.jpg width\",\"uploadDate\": \"--T::+:\",\"duration\": \"PDTHMS\",\"contentUrl\": \"https:cdn.jwplayer manests RWzrdwAc.mu\",\"embedUrl\": \"https:www.heraldscotland video  \",\"publisher\": \"@type\": \"Organization\",\"name\": \"HeraldScotland\",\"logo\": \"@type\": \"ImageObject\",\"url\": \"https:www.heraldscotland sitelogo \",\"width\": ,\"height\": Firstly, it is important to understand what should be the dference between those three types of participant. The role of the journalist is, to put it simplistically, to inform viewers, listeners and readers of what they understand to be happening. This may not always be perfectly balanced, depending on the focus of the topic. And, indeed, I do not expect the contribution of journalists to be impartial, either, because their publications are not. So we might expect the interpretation of, say, ajournalist to a piece of breaking news on Brexit to be dferent than that of, say, ajournalist. The expectation, though, would be that a journalist would happily turn their hand to any story irrespective of whom it involved Brexiter or Remainer, Unionist or Nationalist, and so on.There is a key test, here and it is this: as a consumer of the news that they produce, I should not know how a journalist votes, whether in elections or referendums. That is the crucial dference between a journalist and a commentator. As soon as it becomes clear how they vote, they have ceased to become a journalist and bled into the commentary.:Scottish independence: Indyref will be focus of SNP election campaign says Nicola SturgeonIn this, I must say, I think that Peter Obornersquos criticism of a couple of particular journalists - the BBCrsquos Laura Kuenssberg and ITVrsquos Robert Peston - was wrong. His insinuation that they effectively swallow lies from Downing Street is off-the-mark because their job as journalists is to report what they are hearing from politicians and campaigns, whether that be Downing Street or the opposition. Both of those iniduals fit my description of journalists rather well.However, not all of their colleagues fit it, with too many having morphed into being partisan commentators. Those of us observing the media in Scotland would have been able to see this coming since . Referendums, as we all now know, are destructive things. They ide families, workplaces and society. And in the highly charged political environment they produce, the integration of journalism and commentary has gone almost unnoticed.It is now commonplace in the pages of national newspapers to see print and broadcast journalists giving us their opinion, rather than simply their analysis , in a first-person column.That journey - from journalist to commentator - is often mirrored at the other end of the spectrum as commentators morph into activists. It is here where we canto the example of Saturdayrsquos radio debate. Commentators are very commonly people who have a political history. This rather goes with the territory - anyone with enough interest in the detail of politics to qualy as a commentator has probably been around a political party in their past.There is no wrongdoing in the audience knowing what a commentatorrsquos opinions and voting patterns are, but they are entitled to expect that he or she will be able to offer a semi-detached perspective on the story. They should be able to go beyond the spin and tell the audience what sits behind it, analysing its potential effects in a thoughtful and, importantly, unemotional way.But just as there is a critical dference between a journalist and a commentator, the same dference exists between a good commentator and an activist. Emotional, blinkered, one-sided interpretations which show an inability to understand another perspective are a sign that you are consuming the views of an activist rather than a commentator. On Saturday, it was clear that Kevin and I fitted into the box of commentator, whereas Jamesis clearly an activist.I know that this might not seem important. But it is, now more than ever. This blurring of the distinction between journalists, commentators and activists goes right to the heart of public trust. Now more than ever, we are dependent on the media to help the public in the navigation of the most isive issue in our collective political memories.For me, broadcast and print media get a \"must try harder\" mark. They need to understand who they are commissioning, and why. They must decide before they pick up the phone what they want their  to be - journalism, commentary, or activism. All are legitimate, but all are dferent and should not be mixed.Modern politics is corrosive enough letrsquos not make it worse in the media. The people need to know who is talking to them.Andy Maciver is Director of Message Matters"},{"url":null,"title":"labour-accuses-snp-political-grandstanding-election-push","story":"The two parties announced on Sunday they were joining forces in an attempt to push for an election on December .Lesley Laird claims the SNP have shelved their support for a second Brexit referendum, replacing it with a ldquoshady pact with the Lib Dems.:EU preparing to sign off on Brexit extension, according to leaked paperResponding to a string of tweets from the First Minister, Ms Laird said: ldquoYet again Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP are misleading the electorate about Labourrsquos position.

families under constant stress and pressure because of poverty-related issues. Aberlour has found that the best way to support families to achieve more positive outcomes for their children is to sit alongside them, in their own homes and communities, and ask the most basic questions: ldquoWhat do you think will make the biggest dferent in your le and how can we help  With , children living in poverty in Scotland, and numbers growing, Aberlour needs help to reach the families that require their support.ldquoWe commissioned a piece of research in an attempt to get closer to the impact of poverty on families, ldquo says SallAnn Kelly, chief executive. ldquoWe hear a lot about overall le expectancy in Scotland, but we wanted to get nearer to the le expectancy issues around young people and young adults. Dr Morag Treanor, professor of child and family inequalities at Edinburghrsquos Heriot-Watt University, looked at what the statistics tell us about the outcome for children and young people. She revelated that for those children born into the most deprived communities in Scotland, compared to those who are born in the most affluent, the children from the poorest communities are three times more likely to die before they reach the age of . Three-times more likely to die ndash just take a moment to think about thathellip and that is in a country which as part of the UK, is the sixth richest in the world.What is even more shocking about this statistic is it only applies to avoidable deaths. It doesnrsquot take into account losses from childhood cancer or other long-term illnesses that result in death.ldquoWe had to think about what we could do to redouble our efforts as a charity to support children and families across Scotland, adds SallyAnn. ldquowhat we know is that the earlier you get to families to support them, the more likely they are to thrive. We know that poverty in Scotland is not the sole responsibility of the Scottish Government. Therersquos a much wider societal response we need so there are other things we are looking at.SallyAnn points to the responsibilities of business in terms of creating a fairer more flexible arrangements for staff. That means providing good quality employment opportunities and secure employment in family friendly environments.ldquoThe Scottish Governmentrsquos own figures state that about % of the , children in poverty in Scotland live in families where there is a working adult. So letrsquos explode the myth about a lack of a work ethic. There is a work ethic, itrsquos just that too many people canrsquot secure the higher paid and more secure jobs. They have to make daily decisions between keeping the lights on, putting food on the table, or buying unorms for the kids to go to school.ldquoWhen it comes to zero-hours contracts, families tell us the insecurity of not knowing when they are working and how many hours they are working creates a huge amount of stress. Itrsquos stress that families are dealing with day in and day out that creates a real pressure on the relationships within the family. We know the quality of relationships children have within their families is critical to overall wellbeing.Looking at the responsibilities of the government, SallyAnn says that whether itrsquos national or local government, more needs to be done to challenge poverty and its consequences. There are restrictions about public money and how it is used. Political decisions shape these restrictions and we are challenging all decision makers to focus on child wellbeing when they make political choices. Aberlour is asking the public to think really seriously about the implications of poverty ndash especially for each one of those ,.ldquoThere is a view that the parents of children in poverty somehow have dferent aspirations for their children. The research that we have seen demonstrates clearly that is not the case. No-one gives birth to a child in the hope that they fail.ldquoWhat happens is that the opportunities that are available to my children or many other peoplersquos children are somehow closed to children living in poverty. That is not down to the families itrsquos the system that they find themselves in. Professionals can have lower expectations of children from poorer backgrounds, whether thatrsquos in education or any other setting these children find themselves. So by the time they are teenagers some of these young people feel absolutely hopeless.Without opportunities children from poor communities have little chance of escaping poverty. SallyAnn points to a girl names Morgan, who has appeared in much of Aberlourrsquos campaign materials. She grew up in a very challenging family situation in Glasgowrsquos Govan area. Having to deal with dficulties at home and a social environment that screamed lsquoyou will amount to nothing, therersquos no pointrsquo was only overcome thanks to intensive support from Aberlourrsquos Glasgow Family Support service. Today, Morgan has beaten the odds and is the first in her family to attend university ndash she is training to become a family lawyer to help others.ldquoWe want to say to the public, what would you want for your familythey were living in circumstances where opportunities were close off to your children  adds SallyAnn.ldquoIf you can, please help us with a regular gt that can go towards providing an army of support workers to help families right across Scotland. We need to be there for the long-term, standing shoulder to shoulder with the children and young people that we support and that require an ongoing financial commitment. We do this because families tell us this is what works best, but we donrsquot have the financial resources to get that support to the right places ndash you can help us to do that and offer hope and purpose to more children like Morgan!Donate at www.aberlour.org.uk start, call   , text lsquoSTARTrsquo to  to give pound a month."},{"url":null,"title":"excellent response to call for new members","story":"Dozens of folk have signed up to become Bailies of Bennachie during the first half of October.The conservation group is having a push on membership this month with all new members being entered into a prize draw for a voucher for afternoon tea for two at Pittodrie House Hotel.The group’s outreach officer, Fiona Cormack, explained: “It is wonderful to have had such apositive response so far.“A social media campaign is featuring inidual Bailies saying why they are members.

These bus services are described as “commercial”.Local authorities such as Aberdeenshire Council have a duty to identy travel needs within their area which are not otherwise met, and secure what public transport is appropriate taking into account the funds available. These bus services are described as “supported”.In addition to funding fixed route bus services, the council supports community transport, for example dial-a-bus and voluntary car schemes operated by the voluntary sector, provides door-to-door dial-a-bus services and also provides a TaxiCard Scheme which offers a discount on taxi fares, usually £ per journey, for older and disabled residents.Chair of the council’s Infrastructure Services Committee, Councillor Peter Argyle, said: “It was agreed earlier this year that the network should be reassessed by means of a ‘clean-sheet’ approach, in order to identy a more sustainable network in the longer term that will more effectively cater for otherwise unmet travel needs, assist in addressing patronage decline and provide better value for money.“I would encourage all those who currently use bus services or may require them in the future to complete this quick survey which will provide vital information for our wider consultation.”Vice-chair Councillor John Cox added: “In addition to getting the views of residents, our survey is being issued to a wide range of organisations including community councils, rural partnerships, schools and social care facilities.“That feedback will assist us in developing cost-effective, fit-for-purpose services for Aberdeenshire communities in the years to come.”data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Here are  of the strangest UK parking laws to be aware of to ensure you avoid being fined by authorities\"   of the strangest UK parking laws viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Further information on the council’s strategy and associated current policies for the support of passenger transport including local bus services, can be found in the Passenger Transport Strategy https:www.aberdeenshire.gov.uk media  passengertransportstrategy.pdfThe questionnaire will be available online from Monday, October  to Monday, December  at https:www.aberdeenshire.gov.uk roads-and-travel public-transport policies-strategies-and-contracts Printed copies being available in local libraries, Aberdeenshire Council offices, Ellon Park  Ride, and Peterhead Interchange, with effect from November ."},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"October ,  at : pmThe UK Government are set to spend £ billion in a scheme to bring better mobile internet coverage to rural areas, it was announced, this week.

The new agreement has been criticised by commentators for undermining the links between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.Speaking in the house yesterday, Mr Carmichael asked: “The creation of a customs border down the Irish Sea and the necessary declarations as a consequence of that is something about which Ruth Davidson and the former Secretary of State for Scotland warned last year.#They said then, and it’s true now, that it will undermine the Union. Why is the Secretary of State disregarding his Rt Hon Friend’s advice ”Responding in the house, the secretary of state said: “This is a deal that protects the border, this was a key priority for me as Secretary of State. It protects the peace process. The economy of Northern Ireland, I think, will benefit from this deal . . . and I would work over the implementation period to minimise any problems for Northern Ireland businesses in exporting and selling into Great Britain.”Responding after the exchange, Mr Carmichael said: “The Secretary of State’s response was muddled and confused. It shows once again that the Conservative Party is now so fixated with Brexit that it is blind to the damage that they risk doing to the constitutional integrity of the United Kingdom. The lack of concern shown by the Government about this issue is deeply concerning.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The research discovered that almost universally, those asked thought that the ‘deal’ being examined at Westminster represented not just the terms of our withdrawal from the European Union but the entirety our future trading and political relationship with the bloc.When told that this was just the beginning and that Brexit itself would trigger years of detailed, high-stakes negotiations and trade talks– the response was a “horried silence”.It demonstrates the mistaken, yet widely held belief that “getting Brexit done” will conclude with the passage of a withdrawal agreement. Yet in reality, the wrangling, the double-dealing and the persistent threat of crashing out without a deal after the transition period are set to go on and on and on.: Brexit: Boris Johnson is learning same lessons as Theresa May – Ian Swanson: Brexit: England seems to be declaring independence from UK – Angus RobertsonPart of the cause of this confusion is that very few political parties are being straight with the public right now, either about what is going on in the Brexit endgame, or how they feel about it.Take the Prime Minister. In , Theresa May proposed what was, effectively, the same withdrawal agreement as the one on the table right now. She was derided for it by both Boris Johnson and the Brexiteer wing of the Conservative Party. DoublethinkNow he is at the helm, Johnson has discovered the unassailable boundaries of Brexit and has reheated the same solution to the Irish border problem. Northern Ireland will be both simultaneously inside and outside of the EU customs union, depending on your point of view – “Schrödinger’s Ulster” as the commentator Alex Massie recently put it.Scottish Tories have rushed to embrace this policy and with it the doublethink of their new leader. When Theresa May first proposed special treatment for Northern Ireland in its relationship with the EU, Ruth Davidson and David Mundell threatened to resign their positions in response to the threat they believed it represented to the Union.But a poll of Tory members earlier this year suggested that delivering Brexit was more important to them than preventing Scottish independence. The self-proclaimed s of the Union are now pedalling a policy that dramatically heightens the risk of another Scottish border poll and all that comes with it.The mask is beginning to slip for the SNP as well. For three years, Nicola Sturgeon has sought to court Remain voters who voted No in . She’s been desperate to point to independence as a leboat back to the EU . But the First Minister’s ‘stop Brexit’ credentials are starting to ring rather hollow.It emerged last week that her party spent considerably more money chasing , votes in the Shetland by-election than they did campaigning for . million votes in the EU referendum. And people have forgotten that it took them nearly two years to join the campaign for a referendum on the final terms of Brexit. Now that a second referendum might just make it into the Withdrawal Billthey have gone strangely quiet on that front. Instead they appeared to have opted for a swashbuckling push for a snap General Election out of what appears to be a narrow self-interest.No wonder people find politics infuriating right now. They just want political parties to be straight with them about the seismic choices we face as a nation. That starts by reminding them in no uncertain terms that the best deal we could ever hope to strike with the EU is the one we currently enjoy as a full and active member and that the best way to “get Brexit done” is to do away with Brexit completely.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"contenders for scotland s most prestigious literary prize revealed","story":"Books about a missionary who died at Auschwitz after refusing to abandon Jewish children in her care, a th century murderer who went on to become a world-leading economist and the Highland Clearances are in the running to win Scotland#s most prestigious literary prize.Other contenders for the Saltire Scottish Book of the Year title will include an Australian author’s debut novel, which is set both in the near future and in th century Scotland and an exploration of serial killers written by a former prison guard turned criminologist.A guide to bikepacking around Scotland, a history book about space rockets and a celebration of seabirds could also win the £ prize at Scotland’s national book awards event.The National Museum of Scotland will be hosting the biggest ever ceremony in the history of the competition, which will be expanding to include a prestigious new letime achievement award to recognise a leading figure in Scottish literature, which will come with a £ prize, and a best book cover award, to recognise the latest innovations in production and design.The Saltire Sociey, a cultural charity which has been staging the awards since , selects the book of the year title from the winners of ious inidual categories, including best “first book,” the fiction and non-fiction books of the year, and best history title.Previous winners of the Scottish Book of the Year title include Neil Gunn, Alasdair Gray, Edwin Morgan, Muriel Spark, Liz Lochhead, Janice Galloway, Kelman and James Robertson.The Scottish Book of the Year title and the inidual categories are open to authors who were either born in Scotland, are currently living and working in Scotland, or are writing about the country.Debut authors in the running include Melbourne-based Angela Meyer, for her science-fiction time-travel novel A Superior Spectre, Fraser MacDonald’s “Secret History of the Space Rocket,” Overlander, Alan Brown’s bikepacking odyssey across the Highlands, Stephen Rutt’s birdle book The Seafarers.The best fiction book prize will be decided between Lucy Ellmann’s Ducks, Newburyport, Ruairidh MacIlleathain’s Còig Duilleagan na Seamraig , Leila Aboulela’s Bird Summons, Ewan Morrison’s Nina X, Polly Clark’s Tiger and Damian Barr’s You Will Be Safe Here.Scottish Journalist Melanie Reid’s memoir about being paralysed from the chest down after a horse-riding accident and A Le of Love and Courage, Mary Miller’s book on Jane Haining, the Galloway woman who gave her le to help protect Jewis schoolgirls in Hungary during the Second World War, are in the running for the non-fiction title.Also shortlisted in the same category are with Dr David Wilson’s My Le With Murderers, Kate Clanchy’s book reflecting on  years in teaching, Kerry Hudson’s portrait of poverty in modern-day Britain and Donald E.

It also lets her choose a signicant date –two days after Boris Johnson’s failure to “do or die”. : Outrage as Scottish Tory MSP accuses Nicola Sturgeon of being anti-EnglishWith support for the SNP and independence slowly rising, that’s an ideal moment for the SNP leader to seize the initiative, and name her preferred day, week or month for indyref in  – eventhere’s very little chance of a Section  order from any Conservative-led UK government.The dance has begun – and the moves must continue.But there’s another reason Nicola Sturgeon will finally speak at an independence rally: the Yes movement has brought her there. No political leader could continue to ignore the unparalleled levels of street activism from her own side without looking detached, disapproving or a wee bit lofty. All Under One Banner, despite internal wrangles, no big cash and no media coverage, have provided a physical focus for half of Scotland’s population inclined towards independence. And there’s plenty more self-starting, vigorous, independence-supporting groups around.So many, they are starting to put pressure on a party leadership that’s proved almost impervious to everything and everyone .Consider. The traditional model of liberal democracy suggests opposition parties put pressure on governments, and members influence party leaders. But just as the SNP “broke the system” when it won an outright majority in Holyrood – designed to produce minority administrations, coalition and consensus – the party hasproved pretty adept at breaking the unwritten rules of political engagement too.Do the Tories provide effective opposition  Not really – and certainly not any more. With his blunderbuss progress towards a hard Brexit, Boris Johnson has kicked one leg from the leaky vessel containing Scotland’s  Tory MP and MSPs. With one flourish of a signature accepting her new lobbying job, Ruth Davidson has kicked away the other. : Nicola Sturgeon: EU citizens will always be welcome in ScotlandThe Tories can land blows on inidual domestic policy failures – which are rarely as serious as those occurring weekly south of the border – but have failed to offer a coherent, alternative direction for Scotland, or stop Holyrood from being airbrushed out of Brexit proceedings. Scottish Labour is political weakness personied. Every week, Richard Leonard pointlessly weighs in over issues actually reserved to Westminster yet fails to pin the SNP down on the impact of lobbyists, procurement processes which favour a few big consultancy “players”,target-driven strategies that fail to tackle underlying power imbalances and country-sized units of “local” governance.Even though these issues are on the policy agenda of the Scottish Lib Dems and Greens, their rare moments in the spotlight are generally devoted to issues closer to the hearts of core supporters, more topical and easier to deliver in a First Minister’s Question soundbite. Meanwhile, SNP members and even elected representatives have gey little influence on their party leadership. SNP conference is an exercise instage management, but agenda-setting is tightly controlled – as it is in most mainstream parties.But where do new ideas come from  Who is looking over the brow of the constitutional dilemmas ahead and starting to visualise and debate the shape of a new Scotland  Who really influences the SNP – is it the much-feared, unionist-leaning, hypercritical mainstream media  Or might it also be the myriad parts of the Yes movement who refuse to go away, pipe down or be co-opted, refuse to follow the patterns of organisation that bestow “credibility,” and dare to hold conferences – like this weekend’s Radical Independence Conference in Glasgow – to discuss policies and strategies well above their formal pay grade SNP delegates were unable to debate the best strategy to adopta Section  order is rejected. Radical Independence activists spent a full day on that very subject.It’s easy to be cynical about the real import of  lefties debating strategy, but even easier to overlook the start of something big because it doesn’t resemble any part of political business as usual.Common Weal is publishing its own, alternative blueprints for a decentralised, non-market-driven society. Business for Scotland is devising its own persuasive campaign. Radical Independence is debating strategies to keep the pressure up for an official referendum, including an examination of other legal options open to the Scottish Government and the option of tightly-controlled, civil disobedience. Local Yes Groups have formed regional groups – I’d encourage them to consider establishing a National Federation of Yes Groups to ensure the voice of working-class Scotland is heard loud and clear too – and Independence Live is continuing to livestream events that are independence-oriented or simply important to our civic society ignored by mainstream broadcasters. Most of these groups operate without a bean – but all are expanding their numbers, ambition and reach.All Under One Banner too. Some marchers are a bit resentful that it’s taken the First Minister so long to address the wider movement in the time-honoured fashion. Directly. On the streets. But actually, the Yes movement has benefited from the absence of SNP hands on the tiller. A string of marches organised by the SNP would have been dismissed by critics as gatherings of the “party faithful.” Instead, the dogged, well-stewarded marches have become one wing of a distributed Yes movement – a grassroots network like no other, without formal leaders, central offices, membership forms or media coverage.That’s powerful, and in many ways, a collective and unofficial opposition to the Scottish Government – despite the lack of publicity.So, when the cameras and crowds gather to hear Nicola Sturgeon in George Square this weekend, it’ll be no slap in the face to the unacknowledged foot-soldiers of the Yes movement, but the biggest imaginable back-handed compliment.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"poll scottish independence voters switching to support the union","story":"The Progress Scotland survey found  per cent of voters ldquocompletely support Scotland staying part of the UK, compared with  per cent who ldquocompletely support Scotland becoming independent.Read more: Poll: Nicola Sturgeonrsquos push for election out of step with ScotsThe Survation poll was commissioned by Progress Scotland, headed by former SNP Westminster leader Angus Robertson, and surveyed , Scots at the start of the month.It sought answers on a spectrum of - to identy strength of opinion on the issue, with  marking ldquocomplete support for staying in the UK, while  ldquocomplete support for independence.A narrow majoritywere more supportive of the Union, with  per cent in the middle and  per cent more supportive of independence.

That is a vital part of our parliamentary democracy. The desperate-for-some-name-recognition, game-playing Tory MSP, Jamie Halcro Johnson, knows this fine well.As far as I can see, Brexit is nothing more than to distance ourselves from the EU, and to have a trade dealwith the USA. This will, in turn, justy the privatisation of most government responsibilties and duties of care going to US companies where the Tories will benefit as shareholders of such companies. It does not make economic sense to withdraw our markets in the EU, for the sake of other markets within the USA. It is not only this, but the tax payer will foot the bill for negotiating trade with the USA, where, as mentioned, it will be under the USA#s control, terms and conditions. The tax payer will also foot the bill for any trade deal arrangement where the USA will benefit immensely with a # forced to take it or leave it # scenario for the UK citizen.

Realistically, however, I think that Johnson has the unenviable task of uniting Brexit Party supporters, hard-brexit ERG supporters and moderate Conservatives who do not entirely trust him.

The proposal was supported by the two SNP councillors in the Barra and South Uist Ward and the five SNP councillors from Lewis and Harris.”In his statement, Councillor MacMillan also accused Labour Highlands and Islands MSP Rhoda Grant of calling for a government inquiry into the issue as a means of “taking the focus” off of comhairle convenor Councillor Norman A MacDonald # whom he described as a “Labour party colleague” to Rhoda Grant # and who has voted, according to Councillor MacMillan, to back the Uist dental plan.Councillor MacMillan added: “Rhoda Grant#s proposal for an inquiry is a politically motivated ersionary tactic designed to prevent the truth about Labour Party councillors voting to close the medical provision at Uist Hospital.“Rhoda Grant should instead call for the Western Isles NHS to start telling the truth, to publish the voting record of the [Integration Joint Board]meeting and explain the real reason for centralising the dental provision into the Uist Hospital which is to close the Operating Theatre and Resuscitation Room to remove the surgical capacity from the hospital.”Responding to the claims, Norman A MacDonald stated that he wasn#t present at the last IJB meeting, and said that “assurances had been given” that the relocation of the dental service in Uist would have “no detrimental impact on the Uist and Barra hospital whatsoever.The convenor added: “After the original vote at the IJB on this matter resulted in a split vote, from then on it was up to the chief executives to decide what would take place.“I have no idea what kind of influence Councillor MacMillan might think I have, as both Uist and Barra hospital and the Western Isles Hospital hospital are solely the responsibility of the health board and it is not for councillors to make any decisions on their future.“I have never discussed in any shape or form either the dental service in Uist or her call for an inquiry with Rhoda Grant.“As to the colour of my politics, Councillor MacMillan#s claims are equally questionable. I have registered for the last fteen years as an independent councillor.”Mrs Grant said: “Councillor MacMillan#s assertion would be laughable were it not such a serious issue in question.“I have, from the outset in , listened to the concerns being raised by constituents, by the Uist Locality Planning Group, by the Association of Community Councils, by a stakeholder event held in Lochboisdale, and by all local elected members serving when this proposal to centralise dental services was first aired.“I have repeatedly made representation to the IJB, to NHS Western Isles, to the comhairle, to the previous Health Secretary, and to the First Minister.“Health boards and local authorities throughout Scotland are having to make incredibly dficult decisions to fit with the reducing budgets they are being given and perhaps Councillor MacMillan, instead of throwing meaningless insults around, would do better focusing on bringing this to the attention of his colleagues in the Scottish Government, opposing jobs and services being taken out of local communities.“This is an appalling decision, which flies in the face of local democracy, and constituents in Uist deserve to have their concerns heard, and heeded.”Officially, it was something called the Integration Joint Board that made the announcement at the end of last month: all roads will soon lead to Balivanich. But the IJB began le as a creature of the big boys it is staffed by officials from both public agencies. Is its independence nominal  It#s hard to be sure.Whatever the limits of its power, it is a useful fig leaf to hide behind. The barrage of flak directed at this rotten decision to centralise a vital health service can be dodged by the likes of NHS Western Isles chief executive Gordon Jamieson. The plan to close three dental surgeries came from the IJB. At least that#s how it was sold to the public.Before too long, everyone in the Uists will have to go to hospital in Balivanichthey need a filling or a tooth extracted. So much for the “professional concerns” comhairle chief executive Malcolm Burr has supposedly spent that last six months mulling over. At the end of September, he fell into line. Unanimity was required in order to proceed, and he delivered it.One particular paragraph from the IJB decision paper is worth quoting in full: “Given his familiarity with the subject matter, the chief executive of NHS Western Isles was able to come to an early view about the best arrangements for the provision of dental services in Uist but the chief executive of the comhairle, having no previous experience of these services, required more time to familiarise himself with the detail.”This admission is revealing. Completely out of his depth, it took Mr Burr six months to swot up on the intricacies of closing three dental surgeries before wielding the axe. In doing so, he perhaps exposed the limits of integrating health and social care, which is the IJB#s raison d#etre. Put simply, it should not be the responsibility of someone with no background in health care to make a decision like this. The IJB say there will be an “outreach” service aimed primarily at South Uist and Eriskay, the latter  miles away from Balivanich along single-track roads. What this pledge means, in dental terms, is still to be decided. Perhaps teeth can be extracted safely in the back of a van.If the fruits of integration — a much-hyped national paradigm — are vandalism on this scale, then we suggest a rethink is in order. The hybrid organisations driving the agenda don#t seem to be accountable to anyone, least of all the voters.Speaking of which, we are glad to see that Western Isles MSP Alasdair Allan has had a quiet word with Public Health Minister Joe Fitzpatrick about referring the matter to the Scottish Government. Ultimately, it is Health Secretary Jeane Freeman who has the power to stop this. Hopefully, she#ll use it before Stornoway wrecks a system that has worked well for decades."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/MOD-GLW-19-GOLD-MEDAL-1.jpg","title":"both of this years gold medals are won by glasgow","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineAfter  years living in the city, Claire and family were due to move back to her native Ness in Lewis on Monday.The -year-old teacher had previously won the Traditional Gold when the mòd was in Stornoway in .

If Edinburgh and Skye do suffer from overtourism, what can we do about it  In a free country, we cannot stop people from coming here, evenwe wanted to.It should also be recognised that folk visit those two places for dferent reasons. Edinburgh is an architectural jewel which is at its most crowded during the annual festival. People come to Skye for the scenery — most notably in recent years to the Trotternish Ridge and the Fairy Pools, two undeniably beautul spots in an island which is full of other undeniably beautul spots.Edinburgh cannot be expected to cancel its festival, any more than we want to drain the Fairy Pools or blow up the Old Man of Storr.And we do not want to stop them coming. They bring money, which provides jobs and kickstarts enterprises and improves the island#s economic wellbeing even outside the realm of the local tourist industry.Professor John Lennonof Glasgow Caledonian University#s Moffat Centre is presently commissioned by another independent body, SkyeConnect, to carry out a major survey of the impact of tourism on Skye.Professor Lennon and his colleagues are not due to deliver their report until next spring. But he will offer a taste of its findings so far to the autumn conference of SkyeConnect next month.We look forward to both the sample and the full report. We can hazard a guess at some of its content.Skye has been #discovered# by the rest of the world, like a Caledonian Machu Picchu.Unlike the Peruvian Inca site, however, Skye is a very big island. Unlike Machu Picchu, it is not yet collapsing under the weight of its visitors# feet.Skye can — and Mark Crothall congratulated the Skyetime campaign for pointing this out — accommodate half a million visitors, and continue to benefit hugely from their spending, particularlycertain adjustments are made to the tourist itinerary.More people should be encouraged to spend a quiet and infinitely rewarding week in Elgol or Waternish, in all four seasons, than take a whistle-stop, bucket list summer tour of the Storr, the Fairy Pools and back to the bridge.And of course, local and national government should do much more to improve the basic infrastructure of the island, from roads and parking areas to public transport and public toilets.Skye has bucked the trend of the rest of the north-western Highlands and Islands by growing its population and its economy in recent years.That has chiefly been because of the tourist industry. After  years of steady and apparently irreversible decline, the growth quite naturally took everybody by surprise. We should now learn to adapt to it, rather than call it #overtourism# and hope that it goes away."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/001WH2510NCA-web.jpg","title":"west highland free press audio files friday 25th","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineEvery week, Skye  Lochalsh Council for Voluntary Organisations http:www.slcvo.org.uk  produces an abridged audio version of the West Highland Free Press.

Founded on a cross-community basis, the idea was for people to work together where they lived and beyond, focusing on local drama at affordable prices as a ersion from – and a reaction to – rising unemployment and violence.This week, close friend and fellow North Belfast playwright Martin Lynch revealed Kate’s final play, ‘Betrothed’, will be posthumously produced at the Baby Grand, Grand Opera House, on November  and  for three performances only – with two on Saturday, November .Set against the backdrop of the  Irish rebellion, Betrothed tells the tale of one of the most remarkable love stories in Irish history.Whilst the dynamic Emmet was rallying his forces to strike a blow against the English, a remarkable young woman, Sarah Curran, was anxiously waiting his safe . Having secretly agreed to marry once the rebellion was safely out of the way, the young couple’s plans were dashed when Emmet was arrested, tried and hanged, drawn and quartered.Sarah’s story takes a further unexpected turn when she chooses to marry an officer in the British army. Caught between two worlds, can she ever forget the promises of her past Martin Lynch explained: “Kate was the main writer for Tongue ‘n’ Cheek Community Theatre company and wrote many of their plays before she passed away at Christmas before last.“When we worked together at the Community Arts Forum, she would occasionally go on about a woman called Sarah Curran. Sarah was the girlfriend of Irish rebel, Robert Emmet, he of the failed  rebellion. Later, Sarah married a British army captain, Henry Sturgenor, thus beginning one of the most remarkable love triangles in Irish history.“With Betrothed, Kate last left us a great legacy. I hope all those who were active in the community theatre movement in the s and the general public too can come along to the Baby Grand and bear witness to Kate#s final play.”Betrothed will perform at the Grand Opera House on Friday, November  at .pm and Saturday, November  at pm and .pm.Tickets are priced between £. and £. and are available from the Grand Opera House box office or, alternatively online at www.goh."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"mchawk eyed gulls give big macs a miss","story":"THERE’S something strange flying high above McDonald’s at Westwoods. Is it a bird  Is it a plane  No, it’s a hawk-shaped kite designed to scare away seagulls and other sky-borne nuisances. Graciously circling overhead like birds of prey on the hunt, two faux hawks are simply attached to a line and pole, which is mounted to the roof of the fast food restaurant, rising and falling with every change in the wind. Passers-by could be forgiven for being startled when the kite is whipped into action by a gentle breeze that helps keep the seagulls at bay . Historically, seagulls have lived near the sea or sometimes beside rivers and reservoirs, but they have increasingly been found in inland towns and cities where they are often viewed as pests by the urban population.The problem is made worse by the fact that the main culprit is the herring gull – one of the largest and most aggressive members of the gull family on the island of Ireland.One reason for the growth in the number of gulls is the relative safety for the birds of perches atop man-made structures, where gulls commonly build their nests out of the reach of predators.Another reasons that gulls have moved inland is the abundant supply of food waste, which helps sustain them. No surprise, then, that they might flock to supermarkets, shops and food outlets like McDonald’s.While retailers, local government authorities, and restaurants have been keen to limit the birds’ access to food waste by using lidded bins and encouraging proper disposal, the urban gull perseveres. The daring and intelligent birds have been known to swoop down on humans to snatch food from their hands – an obvious danger when you’re trying to eat a Big Mac. While the law makes it illegal to recklessly injure or kill any gull or damage or destroy an active nest or its contents, it does, in the interest of health and safety, make allowances for certain control measures, and there are few more clever – or more humane – than the kite hawk. The urban gulls have been the subject of human concern leading, in some cases, to lethal methods of control. However, given that they are a red-list threatened species, the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds questions the use of lethal control as a means of dealing with the issue.A less aggressive method of control – like that employed by McDonald’s at Westwoods – is just one solution that may help our co-habitation. At the very least, your McNuggets are somewhat safer."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"pipe bomb detonated in west belfast garden","story":"WEST Belfast MP Paul Maskey has condemned a “reckless attack” on a house in West Belfast.A pipe bomb-type device detonated in the front garden of a house at Aitnamona Crescent around .pm on Saturday night.The occupant of the house reported hearing what they believed to be a firework going off.

Since I became First Minister, in December last year, we have an International Relations Minister in our Cabinet – an idea completely unthinkeable at the start of devolution. We have a highly regarded International Strategy, which is being discussed and debated across Wales.”Mr Drakeford stressed the importance of forging links between people on “dferent sides of the Irish Sea”, particularly those from “Celtic nations”.“Amongst us all are links of language, of history, of culture, of economic identity and, in many instances of progressive political outlook,” he said.“We all share the presence of a powerful neighbour, with a global and dominant language and a well-developed sense of its own signicance. In the Brexit context – and beyond it too – we have had the best results, I believe, when we have been able to work together, in an informal Celtic alliance, to provide a more powerful counterweight to hard line leave propositions than we could have mobilised working on our own.“And in the dficult days ahead, I think the effort to identy common interests, to act with a sense of solidarity in their pursuit, and to create outcomes which work for us all – that effort will be needed as never before.”"},{"url":null,"title":"editors viewpoint all credit to tj for turning life around","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Youre in your th anniversary year which you marked by planting bulbs. Tell us about that.A. The girls wanted to leave a legacy so every child from four-year-olds in Prepto my -year-old girls planted a bulb in our anniversary walkway at the front of the school. Beds were dug for every single year group, so in the springtime all of those bulbs will come out. They planted a tree too. We also decided we would have  acts of kindness.Rather than just contribute money, we asked all the girls, by inidual or class, to do an act of kindness. Weve had people out doing beach cleans, weeding gardens and a Christmas lunch for the community.

Now everything is at the flick of a switch, weve access to online videos and it has become much more visual. Every room here is equipped with an electronic whiteboard. Children are registered in the morning on computers. Gone is the letter home to parents in the schoolbag now its parentmail. Although social media gets a negative name it can work very positively because we can reach out very directly and quickly to parents. Pupils now are more aware of the world around them, and social media means theyre more exposed to dferent environments.Nicola Connery, principal of Strathearn SchoolQ.

European Council President Donald Tusk has confirmed the move following discussions with the EUs  member states. Ambassadors for the other EU nations approved a draft declaration on the Article  process - the portion of the EU treaty that deals with a countrys application to withdraw from the EU.    EU ambassadors have agreed to accept the UKs request for a Brexit extensionuntil  January, European Council President Donald Tuskhas said. Following discussions over the weekend, the EU  ambassadorsapproved a draft declaration on extending the Article  process. googletag.cmd.push EU member states hadbeen mulling over British Prime Minister Boris Johnsons request for an extension to Article  ever since he grudgingly applied for one via an unsigned letter on  October. While member states had been waiting for clarity on , or when, the UK might provide a clear reason for the extension, such as an election, Mr Johnson hadin turn said he would wait to see what the EU said about the extension before pushing for an election. In a Tweet posted a short time ago, Mr Tusk wrote: The EU has agreed that it will accept the UKs request for a #Brexit flextension until  January . The decision is expected to be formalised through a written procedure. The UK could still leave the EU earlier than the new deadlinethe House of Commons manages finally to raty the Withdrwal Agreement which has failed at every attempt to date. It also includes potential dates for the Withdrawal Agreement to come into force on  December ,  January  or  February  - which could mean the UKs departure possibly taking place on either  November,  December or  January. However, the UK will be obliged to appoint an EU commissioner in the meantime with a warning from the EU that the extension cannot be used to try to reopen the Withdrawal Agreement. Meanwhile, the British Government is set to continue with another attempt to trigger a General Election. A motion calling for an election is expected to be tabled at Westminster later this afternoon with an unlikely two-thirds majority of MPs required for it to succeed. The desired election date for the government is December  meaning that the British Parliament would need to dissolve by November . But, a bill resulting from an alliance between the Liberal Democrats and the Scottish National Party is seeking to amend the  Fixed Parliament Act to include December  as the date for a general election. This now comes into play as the EUs agreement to a Brexit extension cuts off on January . This also means that simple majority in the House of Commons would suffice to see it through and not a two-thirds majority of MPs. The amendment would also kill any immediate prospect of a no deal Brexit. However, with the SNP and Liberal Democrat presence in the House of Commons amounting to a total of  seats, the success of that bill will need heavy cross-party backing.

Therefore, John decided that any money raised would go to the same charity.Between both the coffee morning and John’s sponsored silence over pound, was raised and a few late donations have been filtering in.Speaking to the Derry News at the weekend John said of the challenge: “I didn’t speak until I came out of the school at  o’clock. It was tough enough. My wee girls were saying, ‘try not to break it’, but it was hard because I’m used to rambling on.“The principal was taunting away at me, saying ‘John, ye haven’t seen the caretaker ’ and I would shake my head, then he’d go, ‘do ye know where he is ’ and I would just shake my head again.“And someone of the kids, the primary  pupils, would say ‘gone speak to me’, so they were doing a bit of taunting too. But they couldn’t break me.”John has his sights set on another charity fundraiser after Christmas when he plans on walking from Derry to Buncrana and back again - he says Macmillan will most likely be the beneficiary again.Sadly, a number of John’s close family have had cancer and he appreciates the emotional, physical and financial support the charity offers.“They’re known as the ‘little angels’ and they do a great job. If you have somebody belonging to you suffering with cancer then they put them at ease.“The work they do is amazing,you ever have any issues you’re able to phone them and they come straight away.“I’m happy to see this money go to them because it will go towards helping more families in Derry.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Final touches are now being added to the packed programme of events lined up for the coming days, featuring an extravaganza of family friendly activities to suit all ages. When the final firework illuminates the Foyle and brings to a close the traditional ghoulish goings on, tranquillity s with a magical and meditative experience marking the AllHallowtide celebration First Light. Taking place on Friday November st and Saturday November nd, First Light will bring people of all faiths together in the spirit of remembrance and reflection to mark the all Saints and All Souls Feast Days. A series of services, installations, musical and choral experiences will run throughout the two days aimed at offering opportunities to reflect, offer prayers and thanks. googletag.cmd.push Events coordinator with Derry City and Strabane District Council, Helena Hasson, said that after such a busy week for the city it would be an opportunity to slow the pace and remember the spiritual origins of the All Hallows celebration. “First Light is a relatively new element to our Halloween programme and one that we continue to grow and develop in partnership with the local churches and community organisations. It’s very unique and quite special. “After being caught up in the excitement and energy of Halloween, First Light immerses us once again in calmness and serenity. It really is a beautul programme of thought provoking events aimed at bringing people together and engaging them in restorative and enlightening activities.” Leave behind the noise and indulgence of the night before with some Blissology by the Light of the Moon in the Guildhall, withmeditative yoga sessions taking place throughout Friday. The sessions are free and are open to everyone, no experience required. The Guildhall Main Hall will remain open from .am – .pm for anyone who wants to come and spend some time under Luke Jerram’s ethereal Museum of the Moon installation. Candle bags will be available for visitors to write a message of remembrance for a loved one, which will then be placed on the Main Hall stage. The Guildhall Square main stage will host a musical showcase to remember as choirs from across the city display their talents on Friday afternoon at the Voices of Light event. If you’re seeking some spiritual fulfilment then the Windows to the Soul Reflective Walking Tour will take you on a contemplative journey around some of the city’s most signicant places of reflection and worship on Friday and Saturday. Beginning at Aras Colmcille, the tour will take in St Columba’s Long Tower, before moving to St Augustine’s, then First Derry Presbyterian Church, and finishing at St Columb’s Cathedral. Organizer Kieran Grfiths explained the idea behind the tour. “It was inspired from a poem by local poet Daniel Ferguson. His poem talks about each religion as a window looking at Christ, and each window has a dferent architecture, but is looking at the same Christ. “Volunteers and Church leaders from each venue were interviewed during the project as to how they pray, what is special about their place and what they would want a visitor to know about the Church. From this process a tour outlining the atmosphere, history, people, song and prayer of each place has been written. The tour will give a look into the soul of that church. “The process of interviewing and writing this simple walking tour was a very moving experience. It moved the inertia of routine, it moved perceptions of others and it was emotionally moving on many occasions meeting the wonderfully dedicated human beings keeping these beautul building and the message alive.” Enjoy specially composed music and share a common prayer at each of the churches as part of this reverent look into the presentation of faith marking the feast of All Saints and All Souls. Candle bags will again be available at each of the churches so that people can write an intention for a loved one they have lost and place the lit lantern bag at that church. This event is free and everyone is welcome. The First Light programme will conclude with a peaceful choral performance at Eugene’s Cathedral, as people gather to remember departed family and friends at pm, followed by a special mass of remembrance awww.derryhalloween stlightt .pm. Intentions can be offered up during the mass and the cathedral will be bathed in golden light to commemorate All Souls and First Light.

Having attended the meeting, Councillor Bateson voiced his concerns with the current play provisions, particularly in Larchfield, Kilrea and urged for much needed improvements. He said: “Outdoor play areas must be attractive, safe and welcoming for all children. The current facilities on offer within these areas have been noted in recent reports by Causeway Coast and Glens Council for much needed improvements and maintenance. Some of these play parks such as Larchfield, have been left in a serious state of disrepair. googletag.cmd.push This has been raised to me by a number of local residents. I have voiced their concerns and made the case that the current facilities are unacceptable.

I will continue to make clear to the council that it is vital improvements are made to these sites”.

In , O’Kane had fallen  feet from the masthead of a ship in Belfast docks. He sustained multiple injuries, primarily to the spine and hips. Despite six months’ treatment in hospital, his mobility was restricted and he could barely walk. At the beginning of , doctors advised him that only by amputating his right leg could his le be spared. “I would rather die with two legs than live with one,” he said. He refused the operation, deciding to seek a cure in Lourdes. “I knew thatI reached Lourdes I would be made fit and well,” he remarked.Immediately after his arrival, he noticed an improvement in his mobility. “I thought I felt slightly better,” he said. The following day – a Sunday – he felt even stronger. “I walked from my bed to the dressing table on Sunday morning – the first time I had walked unaided from the date of the accident,” he reflected. On that day, he also walked to the grotto. He did so without using his stick. He brought it with him, however, but only to discard it. After adding his stick to the pile of crutches – and having offered thanks to Our Lady – he then walked away unaided. “The pilgrims who saw him on the outward journey are astonished at his present condition,” one news report commented.O’Kane’s we was overjoyed to see her husband on his . She had gone to the railway station to meet him. “I was looking into the carriage windows to see where he was and help him out and get his bags,” Mrs. O’Kane remarked. “When he went away he was on sticks, and could only walk with dficulty. “Imagine my feelings when I saw a smiling man walking fit and well towards me. I could hardly believe it was my husband. “I could hardly keep from crying with joy.” Not long after his , O’Kane said: “I hope to visit Lourdes next Easter, in thanksgiving to Our Lady of Lourdes, andpossible each succeeding year.” He was also clear about where, and to whom, his gratitude was due – “Lourdes and the intervention of Our Lady.” Co-author Keane has published  books, including eight No. bestsellers, among them “The Little Flower: St. Theacuteregravese of Lisieux and Padre Pio: Irish Encounters with the Saint.” Una O’Hagan is a number one bestselling author and former newsreader with Radio Telefiacutes Eacuteireann.

They issued some pointers on how to keep your animals safe: Microchipping The ISPCA strongly recommend that all dog owners have their pet’s microchipped in case they are taken or go missing over Halloween. This is a legal requirement for all dogs and puppies once they are  weeks old and failure to do so is an offence under the Animal Health  Welfare Act  . Dog owners need to be in possession of a microchipping certicate also so it is important your contact details are kept up-to-date. It is the pet owner’s responsibility to inform the database operator of any change of contact details so once your dog has been microchipped, check the database to ensure your details are correct. googletag.cmd.push If your pet becomes lost, having them microchipped is the best way to ensure they will be reunited with you as it’s the first thing a veterinary practice, rescue centre or dog warden do is to scan your pet for a microchip. Lost animals puts a lot of extra pressure on animal rescue centres, dog pounds and veterinary practices but it also causes more upset for pets and their owners so don’t delay and get your dog microchipped today – it’s the law!. While microchipping is recommended for all cat owners as well as dogs, there are no current plans to make microchipping compulsory for cats. Help your pets during Halloween Pet owners can help train their dogs and cats to become accustomed to the sounds of Halloween fireworks by playing similar sounds at low volumes. As dficult as it may be, try not to react to your pet showing signs of fear as it may be the best way you can help them. Licking objects such as toys filled with treats may help ease your pet’s stress. If they are up for it, playing with them may also be a welcome distraction, but don’t force ityour pet is too upset to play. Walk your dog in the morning and earlier evening away from any fireworks. If you are concerned that your pet is unmanageably terried of the noise of fireworks, you should consult your vet to discuss ways for managing your pet’s stress. Outdoor pets including small mammals or birds should also be brought indoors into a secure garage or shed where they can be secure from any loud noise or fireworks. You can also cover hutches or cages with blankets to act as sound-proofing. Horses, ponies and donkeys should also be microchipped, and those that live in areas with a considerable amount of Halloween-related noise should be securely stabled to prevent them from escaping or hurting themselves. Keep sweets and decorations out of reach Dogs and cats should be kept away from sweets and Halloween decorations. Chocolate and raisins are highly toxic to pets, as are any sweets containing the sugar substitute xylitol. Ingesting foil or plastic wrappers can also lead to digestive problems and may require surgery. If your pet does ingest something toxic, contact your vet immediately. Beware of costumes Not all pets will tolerate wearing costumes and it may cause them undue stress. Only dress up your pet for Halloweenyou know they enjoy it. Halloween themed bandanas can be less restrictive soyou do choose to put your pet in a costume, make sure it does not limit the animal’s movement, vision, ability to breathe or behave normally. Also ensure any costume doesn’t have any small, chewable pieces or toxic paints or dyes. People wearing Halloween costumes can be equally as scary to pets. Masks or other costume accessories may trigger their territorial instincts. While people might enjoy being spooked during the Halloween festivities, it’s not fun for pets. If your pet is scared, ensure they are in a separate room and safe place. Look out for wildle Hedgehogs go into hibernation this time of year and will sleep in woodpiles or heavy scrub and leaves. It is important you check under all woodpiles before lighting any bonfires to ensure there is no wildle hibernating. Some outdoor decorations such a fake spider webs or string lights can snare wild animals, so be careful about hanging them and remove them after the festivities. Report animal cruelty Unfortunately, stray animals can fall victim to abuse or cruel Halloween pranks. If you witness animal cruelty, contact your local Garda station immediately and the ISPCA National Animal Cruelty Helpline on  orreport online. ISPCA Public Relations Manager Carmel Murray said:“While we all enjoy the festivities of Halloween, many pets and wildle will find this time of year terrying. It is important that they have a secure place to hide indoorsthey are frightened by the noises of fireworks and trick-or-treaters calling to the door. Leaving the lights low, and playing the radio or television can help drown out some of the sounds as it can be a stressful time for them. It is also important our pets are kept safe in a secure room where they cannot dart out an open door. If your pet manages to escape, it is important they are wearing an ID tag plus they should be microchipped, which is a legal requirement for all dogs and puppies once they are  weeks old. Pets that have been found will be scanned for a microchip which holds the pet owners contact details so it is important this information is kept up to date. Carmel added: Halloween can also be a dangerous time for our wildle so it is important to check under wood, scrub and leaves for hibernating hedgehogs before lighting any bonfires. Sadly stray animals can fall victim to abuse or cruel Halloween pranks soyou witness any animal cruelty, contact your local Garda station immediately and report it to the ISPCA National Animal Cruelty Helpline on   .”   If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

They issued some pointers on how to keep your animals safe: Microchipping The ISPCA strongly recommend that all dog owners have their pet’s microchipped in case they are taken or go missing over Halloween. This is a legal requirement for all dogs and puppies once they are  weeks old and failure to do so is an offence under the Animal Health  Welfare Act  . Dog owners need to be in possession of a microchipping certicate also so it is important your contact details are kept up-to-date. It is the pet owner’s responsibility to inform the database operator of any change of contact details so once your dog has been microchipped, check the database to ensure your details are correct. googletag.cmd.push If your pet becomes lost, having them microchipped is the best way to ensure they will be reunited with you as it’s the first thing a veterinary practice, rescue centre or dog warden do is to scan your pet for a microchip. Lost animals puts a lot of extra pressure on animal rescue centres, dog pounds and veterinary practices but it also causes more upset for pets and their owners so don’t delay and get your dog microchipped today – it’s the law!. While microchipping is recommended for all cat owners as well as dogs, there are no current plans to make microchipping compulsory for cats. Help your pets during Halloween Pet owners can help train their dogs and cats to become accustomed to the sounds of Halloween fireworks by playing similar sounds at low volumes. As dficult as it may be, try not to react to your pet showing signs of fear as it may be the best way you can help them. Licking objects such as toys filled with treats may help ease your pet’s stress. If they are up for it, playing with them may also be a welcome distraction, but don’t force ityour pet is too upset to play. Walk your dog in the morning and earlier evening away from any fireworks. If you are concerned that your pet is unmanageably terried of the noise of fireworks, you should consult your vet to discuss ways for managing your pet’s stress. Outdoor pets including small mammals or birds should also be brought indoors into a secure garage or shed where they can be secure from any loud noise or fireworks. You can also cover hutches or cages with blankets to act as sound-proofing. Horses, ponies and donkeys should also be microchipped, and those that live in areas with a considerable amount of Halloween-related noise should be securely stabled to prevent them from escaping or hurting themselves. Keep sweets and decorations out of reach Dogs and cats should be kept away from sweets and Halloween decorations. Chocolate and raisins are highly toxic to pets, as are any sweets containing the sugar substitute xylitol. Ingesting foil or plastic wrappers can also lead to digestive problems and may require surgery. If your pet does ingest something toxic, contact your vet immediately. Beware of costumes Not all pets will tolerate wearing costumes and it may cause them undue stress. Only dress up your pet for Halloweenyou know they enjoy it. Halloween themed bandanas can be less restrictive soyou do choose to put your pet in a costume, make sure it does not limit the animal’s movement, vision, ability to breathe or behave normally. Also ensure any costume doesn’t have any small, chewable pieces or toxic paints or dyes. People wearing Halloween costumes can be equally as scary to pets. Masks or other costume accessories may trigger their territorial instincts. While people might enjoy being spooked during the Halloween festivities, it’s not fun for pets. If your pet is scared, ensure they are in a separate room and safe place. Look out for wildle Hedgehogs go into hibernation this time of year and will sleep in woodpiles or heavy scrub and leaves. It is important you check under all woodpiles before lighting any bonfires to ensure there is no wildle hibernating. Some outdoor decorations such a fake spider webs or string lights can snare wild animals, so be careful about hanging them and remove them after the festivities. Report animal cruelty Unfortunately, stray animals can fall victim to abuse or cruel Halloween pranks. If you witness animal cruelty, contact your local Garda station immediately and the ISPCA National Animal Cruelty Helpline on  orreport online. ISPCA Public Relations Manager Carmel Murray said:“While we all enjoy the festivities of Halloween, many pets and wildle will find this time of year terrying. It is important that they have a secure place to hide indoorsthey are frightened by the noises of fireworks and trick-or-treaters calling to the door. Leaving the lights low, and playing the radio or television can help drown out some of the sounds as it can be a stressful time for them. It is also important our pets are kept safe in a secure room where they cannot dart out an open door. If your pet manages to escape, it is important they are wearing an ID tag plus they should be microchipped, which is a legal requirement for all dogs and puppies once they are  weeks old. Pets that have been found will be scanned for a microchip which holds the pet owners contact details so it is important this information is kept up to date. Carmel added: Halloween can also be a dangerous time for our wildle so it is important to check under wood, scrub and leaves for hibernating hedgehogs before lighting any bonfires. Sadly stray animals can fall victim to abuse or cruel Halloween pranks soyou witness any animal cruelty, contact your local Garda station immediately and report it to the ISPCA National Animal Cruelty Helpline on   .”   If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

It must also take into account “funding and planning” considerations before any Foyle Street build can take place.It comes after it was revealed that City Deal funding will not be released for at least another year with project builds expected to commence a number of years down the line.Ulster University’s preferred site for the development of its Medical School and associated innovation facilities is along the Riverfront.It is envisaged that the site adjacent to the Council on the Strand Road will be part of that development with the potential to also include the Council Civic Offices building.A Derry City  Strabane District Council spokesperson said that should this development come to fruition, then the Council’s preferred relocation would be to a site adjacent to the Guildhall “at Foyle Street car park”. “These proposals are dependent on a number of factors, including funding and are all at an early stage of development with no decision having yet been made.”Council has advised that, “subject to affordability and commitment”, the contribution from Council to the Government’s City Deal Future Fund investment relates to “the relocation and development of civic commercial offices at Foyle Street to facilitate the objectives of the riverfront development of Ulster University.” If this is approved, money will be allocated to the continued regeneration of Derry’s city centre and the leisure element of the integrated Strabane Town Centre regeneration project.The combined value of these projects is estimated to be in the region of pound-m and will be dependent on “affordability and the economic and regeneration leverage benefits of such an investment as a catalyst for the advancement and development of the other projects,” a Council spokesperson concluded. googletag.cmd.push Talent drain Ulster University will receive poundm of the pound committed by the UK Government through its City Deal and Inclusive Future Funds. Official Council documents suggest it may be given additional fundsit’s included as part of the poundm set aside for Queen’s Quay Riverfront projects.UU’s poundm will be invested in centres of innovation and excellence in data analyticsand robotics and automation , the Graduate Entry Medical Schooland Personalised Medicine Centre of Excellence .When match funding is added from the NI government, Council, private investors and possibly the Irish government, the total is anticipated to be around poundm.The Derry University Group which is lobbying for an independent university in the North West said Council needs as an “urgent priority” to reopen the City Deal to allow the inclusion of new third-level education providers. “It must also establish a Higher Education Development and Scrutiny committee entirely independent of UU.“The North West handing over poundm-plus of its City Deal to an institution that has neglected it and bled it dry is nothing less than Stockholm Syndrome. “Council is putting the entire future in this region in an organisation whose main purpose has been to drain talent and money out of this region and east of the Bann.“Derry has been waiting for Phase  Magee expansion since Belfast civil servants first refused it in . We cannot wait another  years, or even  months.“If they are unable to deliver immediately they must move aside and allow another institution to deliver.”UU said the proposed riverfront innovation hub will build upon the expertise of its first data analytics Institute, opened in  and headquartered at Magee campus. “A continued collaborative approach between all partners is essential as we prepare to take forward the projects through planning and design and development of the outline business cases.”Asked about plans for the former Foyle College lands, which were acquired by UU at the beginning of this year, the university said it is exploring options in line with its “wider estates strategy and our plans for growth of the Magee campus.”The Derry News also questioned the Norther Ireland Officeabout a timeline for City Deal funding and whether the NI government is likely to provide match funding.A spokesperson refused to comment on match funding, and simply said: The Derry  Strabane City Deal is progressing well. The UK Government continues to assist the Council as with all City and Growth Deal partners, to advance progress as quickly as possible, whilst ensuring that each proposed project has a robust business case. “We are currently working with NI Departments and the Council to deliver this at the earliest opportunity.

Last season Academy vied with Limavady and Clogher Valley for top spot in the league all year so Limavady expected a dficult encounter.Limavady got off to a bright start which resulted in Ben Riley scoring from a fine inidual effort when he broke clear from the half way line to touch down under the posts Luke Faulkner converted. For most of the first half the game was tightly fought until the th minute when Stewart Roddy ran in a score following good work from Luke Montgomery. Luke Faulkner again converted. Just before half time Limavady scored two further tries which effectively killed the game off. Following a good break from Peter Wilson at scrum half Ben Riley was on his shoulder to take the try scoring pass. The bonus point try came when captain Jody McMurray spotted that the home defence had gone to sleep when he coolly strolled in under the posts. Luke again converted to take the half time score to . in Limavady’s favour.The second half continued in much the same vein. Limavady scored first when Peter Wilson broke from the ten metre line to outpace the home defence and score in the corner. Luke Faulkner, in excellent form with the boot this year, once again stepped up with the conversion.Academy managed to hit back with a try of their own, however it was only a matter of time until Limavady would score again. Gavin Martin, now playing in the out half position, managed to make a break and fed Stewart Roddy for his second try of the game. Try number seven came as a result of a long clearance kick from Luke Faulkner which was brilliantly chased down by Stewart Roddy. Putting pressure on Academy’s last line of defence Roddy managed to secure ball and fed inside to Stuart Morrow following up in support. Jody McMurray converted.The only other score was a late consolation effort by Academy when they again crossed in the corner.To top off an excellent day Limavady nds also won convincingly . with tries from Jason Kerr , JamieMillar , Aaron Reilly , John Purcell, Jack Elliott, and Harry McAleese. Harry converted nine of these ten tries.No fixtures for either side next week. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Sean Bell started the ball rolling for the Downpatrick side with a great opening point. However, Bryansfordrsquos sharpshooter Danny Savage, who was to score a spectacular - for his side, levelled the scoring.The RGU then played some scintillating football to take a - to - lead with points from Gerdy Collins , Connor McCarron and Johnnie Bell, who was having a superb game at midfield.Damian Turley, Collins and Tom Smyth were dominating the game and it was dficult to see how Bryansford were going to compete with them.But Savage, a former Down player, kept the lsquoFord in touch with four unanswered points to bring his side within one of the visitors.Another former county player, Packie Downey, was coming more into the game and he levelled the scores with a stunning point from play.Downpatrickrsquos Conor McGrady, another to wear the famous red and black colours, was brought into the game when defender Damian Branf was black carded, putting the RGU in front with a point.Smyth put the Hoops two in front, but the RGU were left stunned when Chris Clarke ended the half with an explosive shot that beat Deeny in the RGU goal to give Bryansford the half-time lead.If the RGU was stunned going into the break, after dominating for long periods in the first half, then after the opening  minutes of the second period, the thought of relegation to Division  was beginning to look a real possibility.Savage scored with with two frees, a  and a rsquo, but then the lsquoFord sharpshooter, with a real opportunist goal, put his side unbelievably six in front.Tim Prenter was then introduced into the game in place of McCarron and with the RGU management urging their players on, they duly responded with points from Branaganand a brace from Conor Doherty to put only one in the game.Conail McNabb was brought on in place of Ruari Quinn and unfortunately only lasted five minutes with a hamstring injury to be replaced by Tommy Loudon.However, with time ticking away, Savage again was the thorn in the RGU side with a  yard free to extend the lead to two.Damian Turley, with a breathtaking score, put the Hoops tantalising only one behind, but Davy McKibben, with a  yard free, put the lsquoFord two ahead again.Try as they could, the Hoops could not mount one last challenge and they were doomed to Division  for next year.Bryansford: M Reid, J Harbinson, S Toner, A Ward, D McDonald, T McAreavey, N OrsquoHiggins, P Downey , D McKibben , C Maginn, K Kavanagh, T Hanna, R OrsquoHiggins, C Clark , D Savage .Downpatrick: J Deeny, P Smyth, D Branf, E Rooney, R Murphy, S Bell , T Smyth , J Bell , D Turley , C McCarron , G Collins , C Doherty , J Branagan , P Turley, R Quinn.

We aim to meet these demands by providing a first-class experience in every aspect of their visit.Ardglass captain, Macartan Bryce, said the club is ldquohonoured to have received the award.He added: ldquoArdglass Golf Club is often praised on social media for the friendliness of its welcome and I believe this is down to not only the staff, but to the friendly reception that visitors receive from our members.Local councillor, Dermot Curran, has extended his congratulations to club officials in charge of the course in his home village.ldquoArdglass Golf Club is widely regarded as one of the best in Ireland and consistently attracts golfers from across the globe, he said.ldquoIt plays a key role in helping boost the local economy and I hope that additional visitor accommodation can been provided locally..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/23rd October 2019 Baroness.jpg","title":"Baroness Ritchie of Downpatrick ready to embrace House of Lords  ","story":"FORMER South Down MP Margaret Ritchie will formally take her place in the House of Lords on November .Several weeks ago she was appointed as a Member of the House, something that she regards as a ldquotremendous opportunity for her to re-engage with mainstream politics at a critical time.Her new title will be Baroness Ritchie of Downpatrick, with the former MP explaining that she has chosen her title as it reflects the area where she was born, baptised, educated and spent most of her working le.Elected as a member of the former Down Council in , Miss Ritchie went on to become an MLA, Stormont Social Development Minister, SDLP leader and MP.Her appointment to the House of Lord opens a new chapter for her, one that she plans to embrace on behalf of all of the people of Northern Ireland.Baroness Ritchie firmly believes that where political chambers exist, people should be members of them to reflect the needs of communities across Northern Ireland. She insists that she intends to deliver the authentic voice of moderate, progressive Irish nationalism in a place where it needs to be heard.And she has vowed to be a hard working Peer, lobbying and building alliances with other peers and parties across the chamber that will bring benefit to people in Northern Ireland.And while the former MP regrets no longer being a member of the SDLP, she said her political views have not altered and will reflect the partyrsquos central social democratic messages focused on the needs of people and the principles of equality, fairness and social justice for all in the House of Lords.With her new title now confirmed, Baroness Ritchie described Downpatrick as a ldquohistoric place on the island of Ireland, where St Patrick began and ended his ministry.ldquoThe town is a place of immense heritage and has a longstanding history. It is uniquely associated on the island with the patron saint and is also associated with the Normans and the Vikings, she continued.ldquoDownpatrick is also place of inclusion and a shared society. The area was one of the first to share power at local government level and in the days of the old Urban Council, it had responsibility for allocating housing and did so very much on the basis of need.The Baroness said the Downpatrick area was very much at the vanguard of political inclusion in terms of ensuring that people belonged, explaining that she plans to use her new title to promote the town.Her House of Lords induction takes place on November  with her formal introduction taking place the following day when she will be introduced by her two sponsors on the floor of the chamber.Baroness Ritchiersquos sponsors will be former Northern Ireland Secretary of State, Lord Paul Murphy and Baroness Angela Smith, who is the shadow leader of the Lords.She is also former NIO minister who was responsible for the the health, economy and environment portfolios during her time at Stormont.Lord Murphy was also Minister of State and led the British Government in the talks process that led to the Good Friday Agreement.Baroness Ritchie continued: ldquoI have picked my two sponsors on the basis that while I am going into the House of Lords as non-aligned and independent, my two sponsors understand the mechanics of the Good Friday Agreement and understand inclusion and power-sharing.ldquoMy maiden speech will hopefully take place sometime before the end of the year, although that could be subject to changea general election is called.Looking to the future, the Baroness said she has been using the past few weeks to get briefed on key issues which are important to her, including Brexit and its impact on the agri-food economy and local economy.ldquoTo me, there is no such thing as a good Brexit. The best deal for me is one where we will remain in the EU. What we have been presented with is one that is a bita curatersquos egg in many ways. There will ne no hard border which means no economic border and no veto in terms of the Assembly. Having said that, I am going to have to examine the Brexit deal in greater depth, she continued.ldquoThere are other issues that I want to focus on including the contaminated bloods issue, tourism VAT and what can be done to help our economy and ensure that we can grow and develop. The vaginal mess issue is something I have been associated with as is the importance of the Co Down fishing industry.Baroness Ritchie said while she does not have constituents, she will be speaking in a general Northern Ireland-wide context.ldquoI will be highlighting the importance of reflecting our political ersity and respect for political dference, ensuring that our institutions are up and running and that they respect the relationships between Ireland and Britain and Northern Ireland and the South. Sadly these have been down for nearly three years, she said.The Baroness added: ldquoMy appointment to the House of Lords is an evolution. I was elected to Down Council in , was the organisationrsquos first female chairman, worked as MP Eddie McGradyrsquos parliamentary secretary, became an MLA and MP for South Down and a Minister in the Stormont administration.ldquoIt is now the House of Lords which represents a new challenge and an opportunity which I fully intend to grasp and embrace..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/23rd October 2019 Bid.jpg","title":"Bid for community centre in Crossgar  ","story":"A CALL has been made for Newry, Mourne and Down Council to keep the pressure on the Department for Communities to fund a new community centre in Crossgar.The village will be left without a building used to host a number community events when the Downpatrick Street property is sold.

The three of them were regularly checking the weather in the last few weeks leading up to race day as the temperatures were well up in the high s.Far too hot to be running a marathon, but thankfully in the final week it took a dramaticdown to nine degrees. Flying over on Friday with no time to waste, it was straight to the hotel and then immediately to the Expo to pick up their race numbers and buy some of the many race souvenirs that were on sale.In the Expo there was a wall of fame for all the runners who had completed the six majors. Murlough ACrsquos very own Paula McKibbin and Ann McAlarneyrsquos names were spotted on the wall for all to see.There was no time to get over the six-hours jet lag as they were all up at five in the morning and headed downtown to the start of the km friendship run.This was a bit of fun and involved a quick lap of the city centre finishing in Grant park. The rest of the day was spent in true MAC style with a boat cruise along the Chicago river before dinner in an Italian restaurant.The evening got better as needing a taxi for six people to take them back to the hotel, they managed to acquire the use of a party limousine at a very good rate.Another early start on Sunday as the marathon began at .am in the neighbouring Grant Park. Thankfully, it was only a  minute walk from the hotel. Theyrsquod only just made it into the corrals and the race started.A field of , runners, heading off north through the city, with defending champion Mo Farah expected to retain his title.As the route wound through the city it passed through many dferent districts, all with a party atmosphere and lined with people cheering and screaming encouragement.The noise during a major marathon in the USA is beyond belief, the bands playing, spectators lsquohigh fivingrsquo and the streets lined with people three or four thick is an experience like no other. We passed through the Mexican Quarter with bands playing and guys dancing, wearing sombreros and then on to Chinatownrsquo with the streets lined with drummers.It was then onto the Gay Quarter with drag queens performing on stage. It was a celebration for both runners and spectators.As with all marathons, the last five miles were a real test of mental determination as fatigue kicked in and Carol, unfortunately, was suffering from a knee injury that she picked up during training which ed at mile .They all pushed on with Hugh crossing the line first and recording a new personal best by one and a half minutes. Orla was next home followed by Charisse who recorded a huge personal best of  minutes.Carol was next home and managed to finish in a respectable time as she battled through the final  miles with knee problems. As the runners walked down the street after finishing they were greeted by four lines of local school kids applauding and congratulating all the runners. After the kids there were long tables either side of the street where one of the local sponsors, which happened to be a brewery, handing out free beer. Then onto the next table where they were given food and water.It makes you wonder what is not to like about this marathon  In the ladiesrsquo race a new world record was set as Brigid Kosgei beat Paula Radclfersquos record of  years. Ironically, as Carol finished her race and walked down to collect her medal she was presented with it from no other than Paula herself.It was back to the hotel to get ready for dinner that evening. As Hugh and Charisse walked back they talked about getting a pint of milk each for recovery.As the shop was a ten-minute walk away, Charisse said that even though she knew it would be a bit more expensive she was happy to buy milk for them both in the hotel bar.Being content with the two half pints that the bar served it was only when the bill was produced that they both discovered that they must have drunk the most expensive two glasses of milk ever, with a bill of  dollars. Anything to save tired feet.That evening they continued in MAC style, celebrating with a meal on Cindyrsquos roof top restaurant followed by a few beers in Buddy Guyrsquos Blues bar where we were treated in style with a table in the VIP area.

But this reprieve was short-lived as the same man got in behind again, but this time finishing well to bring the scores level.Both teams had openings, where a better pass or better cross could have led to a winner, but the game went to extra-time at -.The heavy ground seemed to have taken its toll on both teams as an uneventful  minutes meant the game went to penalties.The hosts scored their first three spot kicks and Saintfield missed their second and third.The Saints scored their fourth and Harper made a save to give the visitors some hope, but the Saints hit the bar with their final penalty to go out of the cup at the first hurdle.Seagoe FC Saintfield United INTERMEDIATE CUP ND ROUND.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/23rd October 2019 Saul.jpg","title":"Saul pre school praised in inspection report  ","story":"SAUL community pre-school playgroup is celebrating after receiving an encouraging inspection report from the Education and Training Inspectorate.The St Patrickrsquos Road playgroup received the second highest rating of good for quality of learning provision, leadership and management and outcomes for children.Playgroup leader, Delia McLaughlin, took over in September last year only to learn that the school was to have an inspection at the end of her first six months.She explained that staff joined with her working tirelessly over the months, often staying late at night to prepare for the inspection.ldquoWe also had support from our Early Years advisor Megan McConaghy and management committee,Delia explained. ldquoWe are all delighted to have received the second highest rating and are committed to maintaining this standard of the years to come.Accredited by Early Years, the Organisation for Young Children, the playgroup aims to provide quality pre-school care to children aged from two years and  months to four years.Mrs McLoughlin leads a team of play assistants mdash Rita Magorrian, Maureen Fitzsimons, Pauline Carlin and volunteer Niamh Kearney mdash to look after the  children who attend the morning an afternoon sessions.The inspectors noted that the playgrouprsquos provision for The World Around Us and early mathematical experiences were ldquoparticular strengths.The report also noted: ldquoThe quality of interactions between staff and the children is very good.

Leading a presentation on Agriculture and Agri-food, Craig Humes highlighted how dairy farmers will be one of the main farming groups to be ldquostruck by Brexit.ldquo. billion litres of milk are collected from across Northern Irish farms each year.  per cent of this milk produced is then exported south to be processed.ldquoThis could make le extremely dficult for farmersexport tarfs are to be introduced, Craig shared, adding that Dr. Mike Johnston, Chief Executive of the Dairy Council Northern Ireland believes that milk prices could drop by  pence per litre should a no-deal Brexit proceed with such excessive tarfs announced.ldquoIn my opinion, to put it quite simply, dairy farmers will not survive in Fermanagh unless there is a deal, commented Craig.In her presentation on Tourism and Hospitality Rebekah Starrett noted how Fermanagh had over , visitors last year who spent an average of pound. million.ldquoThis is a massive amount of money being spent in this local economy. The tourism and hospitality industry here supports , jobs ndash one of the biggest employment sectors in the county.ldquoIf Brexit happens it could mean some businesses may need to let some staff go and leave people without a job, said Rebekah.Stating that in her opinion Brexit offers the tourism and hospitality sector many innovative opportunities to potentially grow and expand, Rebekah shared some examples.ldquoThere has been a rise in lsquostaycationrsquo ndash the number of UK residents that have been staying and holidaying at homehas shown a three per cent rise in  and is continuing to grow something which would be good for Fermanagh Tourism, explained Rebekah, who also highlighted how Fermanagh is renowned for its celebrity chefs, award-winning restaurants and local produce which will continue to attract visitors to the County.Presenting facts on Business and Cross Border Trade, Nicole McFarlane and Oran OrsquoLoughlin shared how Enniskillen has the lsquotop performing ASDA store in the UKrsquo which was the th best store in Walmart Worldwide Group in  and that an average shopping trip spend by Republic of Ireland shoppers to Enniskillen is euro to euro.ldquoCross Border trade stands at pound. billion for  and Northern Ireland makes up between  to  per cent of total exports from Ireland to the UK and accounts for seven to eight per cent of imports, stated Nicole and Oran, adding that the flow of trade between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland will depend on what kind of agreement replaces the current one which is free market trade within the EU. Sharing a positive outlook on how Brexit could impact business trade, the studentsrsquo stated: ldquoBrexit could actually result in more opportunities in more vibrant markets across the world becoming available. Some argue that Brexit could liberate the UK government to sign fresh trade deals with more dynamic markets outside the EU and therefore bolster trade.Whilst presenting his research on how Brexit could impact Student Le, Jordan McClure shared: ldquoStudent le is a vital part of growing up where we learn many things. Brexit has taught me the importance of ensuring that my opinion and voice is heard, especially, when I wasnrsquot the age to vote in the  referendum.ldquoWhilst much of what happens around Brexit is beyond our control one thing for sure is that the potential impact will affect all of our lives. Whatever that may be, it is important that we as students embrace it and make the most of it, he added.Will Greenaway closed the conference by reiterating the potential benefits that could come from Brexit and potential concerns that leaving the EU could have on us in Northern Ireland and especially in Fermanagh.ldquoOur generation of students represent the future of Northern Ireland we are potentially the next generation of business leaders, health care workers and entrepreneurs.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

After three years supporting a ravaged Conservative government, the DUP were thrown to the EU wolves . Boris Johnson in the House of Commons on Saturday in the debate on his Brexit plan. He slapped down the concerns of Mr Dodds, and even expressed regret that anyone would seek to use a vetoNext time they invite a Tory conference speaker they should insist on him taking a lie detector test .The wilful ruthless and vicious resolve of Boris Johnson to devalue the Union was clear. The level of chicanery the Tories are prepared to stoop to knows no bounds..ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget .photo-article-notier-default .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p @media.photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p #jp .main-content .ev-widget#sticky-footer .sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner p @media@media#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_text,#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_button #sticky-footer .fluid-container #sticky-footer .mobile-sticky-footer_button The intention to damage and weaken the Union and in particular our constitutional status was exposed for all to see.When it came to capitulation to the EU bully boys demands on behalf of the Irish, the Boris Brexit betrayal of unionists was completed without resistance. Letter to the editorAs Ben Lowry asserted in his column ‘Middle England chose Brexit over NI fully in UK,’ October , Boris Johnson’s loyalty is first and foremost to the Conservative party and its English electorate. It was always going to be the case and therein lies the harsh lesson for unionism to learn . It is imperative that unionists consolidate and ensure that maintaining the Union remains in our own hands. That is the battle line drawn for the next election when unionists bite the bullet andthe maximum number of MPs possible to hold firm for the unionist cause .We have been here before with shyster prime ministers and survived. This time we now know in advance where we all stand in terms of having our unionism undermined. What unionism requires are cool heads, sharp minds and positive leadership as never before . Solidarity tied into a unity of defence and purpose in upholding the integrity of the Union and reasserting our right to self determination is the number one unionist priority.David McNarry, Comber©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings  Terms and Conditions  Privacy policy    d.onerror  d.onload  d.src  [\"secure-uk.imrworldwide cgi-bin m ciuk-hcgccsi\", escape, \"rp\", escape, \"tscompactrnd\", .getTime].join"},{"url":null,"title":"people","story":" getRequiredClientIdforjpiconsole.log requiredClientIdcatch]EV.Core.updateUserProfile]EV.Core.updateUserProfile....... , , , , Would you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast News Letter via email \"Newsletters\"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia, publisher of Belfast News Letter, via occasional emails keeping you informed about new features, relevant offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"By clicking on register, you will be creating an account with Belfast News Letter and agreeing to JPIMedia Ltd#s Standard Terms and ConditionsWould you like to receive any of the following newsletters from Belfast News Letter, via email Daily news, news features and service updates\"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia, publisher of Belfast News Letter, via occasional emails keeping you informed about new features, relevant offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \" addCustomTextToCreateAccountTemplateNewslettersWould you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast News Letter via email \"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia, publisher of Belfast News Letter, via occasional emails keeping you informed about new features, relevant offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"  \". s .  \". ss+s+  \". s  \".after+text+ .+text+ .before+text+ .after+text+]]]]]]]]]]]]]] initInArticleOnlySiteText, initArticleSiteText, isInArticleOnlyTemplateReady. s isArticleTemplateReady. s addCustomTextToSiteTemplate addSiteName.html  -- -- People   Jobs Cars Homes  Directory  Announcements  Advertise My Business Subscribe#jp #login-widget #login-flip.flip RegisterLoginEdit Account\"Sign Out\" --\"    --       News People Traffic and Travel Crime Weather Politics Business Education Health Opinion Read This News Traffic and Travel Crime Weather Politics Business Education Health Opinion Read This Sport Football Rugby Union Motorcycling More Sport Sport Opinion Whats On Arts  Entertainment Things To Do Nightle Lestyle Retro Cars Homes Must Read           People      Prayer and reflection service being held in NI school after horric crashPast or present pupils affected by the tragic events in Kilcoo which left an -year-old man dead and three others in hospital are invited to a reflection event in St Marks High school.

This compares to five per cent of the population in , when  per cent of adults smoked.However, there has also been an increase in the numbers of ex-smokers who now vape.:The National Survey for Wales shows that, in ,  per cent of e-cigarettes users also smoked cigarettes. This fell to  per cent in  .Across the UK the number of vapers who are ex-smokers reached . per cent in  with the main reason given for using e-cigarettes being to help them quit.Of those surveyed by ASH Wales,  per cent of e-cigarette users cited health as their main reason for vaping.Suzanne Cass, chief executive of ASH Wales said: ldquoThe rise in the numbers of ex-smokers who now vape in Wales shows that many smokers are using e-cigarettes to quit.ldquoIndeed, when coupled with behavioural support e-cigarettes have been shown to be one of the most effective ways to give up smoking, enabling thousands of smokers in Wales to break a habit that destroys lives.ldquoHowever, with more than double the amount of people in Wales smoking compared to vaping, we still face a major challenge when it comes to changing peoplersquos behaviour and de-normalising what has become an entrenched habit in many of our most deprived communities.Despite the increase in the number of people vaping, the survey also revealed perceptions of the relative harm of e-cigarettes compared to tobacco cigarettes have worsened.Now almost a third of people in Wales believe e-cigarettes are equally or more harmful than tobacco cigarettes.Suzanne Cass said: ldquoThere is work to be done when it comes to raising awareness of the relative harm of e-cigarettes compared to tobacco cigarettes and addressing concerns about the safety of vaping.Since the survey was carried out, reports of a possible link between e-cigarette use and deaths from lung disease in America have led some medical experts to warn of the dangers of vaping.According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention many of those vapers affected had used products with liquids containing cannabinoid products.E-cigarettes are regulated in the UK in line with a set of European-wide rules by the medicines regulator, the MHRA. The MHRA also monitors adverse reactions through its yellow card system, which to date has not identied serious respiratory problems similar to that found in the US.Meanwhile vapers in the UK are urged by ASH to only ever purchase e-cigarettes from reputable suppliers. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We were a mix of young people, parents and other concerned citizens of Penarth, and met outside Grfin Books.ldquoWe joined the young people who have been striking from school. In a year this movement has grown from Greta Thunberg by herself to millions worldwide.ldquoThe evidence on climate change is clear. Our actions through burning fossil fuels and demands for continued economic growth cause global warming and climate change. People are already suffering and nature, upon which we all depend, is collapsing. Governments need to be honest about this and act upon the crisis.ldquoWe were over the moon with the response from Penarth residents, who walked with us or cheered us on, the day really gave us hope that the message is seeping in and change can happen. Myself and others had been feeling quite down because climate change is scary, we are worried about our childrenrsquos futures. Lets hope this walk leads to more local action on climate change.The young people on the march also spoke about their concerns.ldquoI went on strike because people cut down rainforests just to be able to eat meat, said seven-year-old Mylo Kitchiner. ldquoIf we keep cutting down trees we wonrsquot have oxygen to breath. I want the government to stop people cutting down trees. I liked the chanting, lsquoclimate justice nowrsquo but this is not just fun to shout, itrsquos actually really important.Sister Lily-Rose Kitchiner, , said: ldquoPeople in places like Africa suffer because of how we live here and it needs to stop.

This was a day for politicians to listen and take real, meaningful action to tackle the climate emergency.\"Business as usual is no longer an option.\"The Welsh Government has declared a ldquoclimate emergency and set a target to cut carbon emission by  per cent by .Millions of people across the globe have joined the strikes, with major cities brought to a stand-still.Greta Thunberg, the -year-old who sparked the movement with a solitary protest outside Swedish parliament in August  tweeted: ldquoChange is coming. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He has no mandate, no majority and no morals. He should resign.I immediately ed to Parliament to hold this appalling PM and Government to account, not only on Brexit but also on all the things that people care about ndash like pensions, benefits, sanctions, health, police, refugees, climate change, international trade, EU citizens, the middle east, fracking, Northern Ireland, sexual violence, child poverty ndash all the things that Johnson saw fit to put on hold to suit his own political ends.As I said in the emergency debate on Prorogation prior to the unlawful suspension of Parliament: ldquoMany constituents have told me they are not interested in the procedures and the chicanery they are interested in their lives, and what dference the proceedings here makes to them.My colleagues and I promised that despite the unlawful and unconstitutional delay to business, we would not be silenced ndash we have not been, and we WILL speak up for our constituents against this undemocratic government.As a Welsh Labour MP I will campaign for Remain in all circumstances.I will not support a Brexit that makes people poorer, less safe, takes away opportunities for our young people, or puts peace in Ireland and Northern Ireland at risk ndash and itrsquos only by co-operation that we can tackle the climate emergency.On that subject, it was wonderful to meet so many passionate young constituents from Penarth and Cardf at the Climate Strike rally outside the Senedd on Friday.They have my complete support! article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentOrder byOldest firstNewest firstHighest scoredLowest scoredLoading comments...

Children seem genuinely excited to learn, smiling, waving and saying hello to Mr Rees.Evenlode Primary School itself has an interesting history.It was opened in  as the first open plan primary school in South East Wales.The population of the school has risen dramatically over the last  years, from  on roll in  to the present .The building itself, a maze of classrooms and corridors plastered in colours, has also changed to accommodate more pupils.Much of the semi-open plan design has disappeared, making way for more conventional classrooms.The school benefits from having a superb site with two playgrounds as well as a large playing field, a designated play area for Reception children, a wildle area, open access to the local tennis club facilities, a newly constructed lsquooutside classroomrsquo and adventure trail.One of the first stops was a hall used by its lsquoSaplingsrsquo Out of School Care, the pre and after-school club for children.Saplings provides childcare for around  children from all year groups, providing breakfast in the morning and looking after children from .am to pm when needed.There, the children can access a wide range of activities, switched up on a regular basis.These have included cooking, gardening, art, crafts, sporting activities, outdoor play and plenty more.A couple of pupils, part of the Saplings, are called through. They happily talk about their favourite part of the clubs. One says arts and crafts another, going outside and playing sport four more say the food.Saplings isnrsquot the only place the students can indulge in a little food.Pupils have set up a fruit tuck shop in the school yard, a group endeavour that students control all aspects of - from placing orders for snacks, selecting the products, handling finances and, of course, selling to their friends.A small group of budding merchants were excited to show me their wares, selling oranges and bananas at break time.There was plenty more to do outside, as well.Mr Rees himself taught fire-making lessons in their fire pit, while the school also made use of rope courses, and a newly refurbished gazebo.Bike racks could be found at the front and back of the site, with students encouraged to cycle to school.Sport is very high on the schoolrsquos agenda.ldquoWe have kids from the school representing us in cricket, rugby and tennis at a county level, said Mr Rees. ldquoWersquore also fielding regular football, rugby and netball teams, and we are pushing plenty of other outdoor activities - like our new ropes and outdoor assault course.ldquoWersquore lucky to have parents in this area who are incredibly supportive of sports, and we have some shining examples of sporting prowess in our children.ldquoWe think itrsquos a very important part of being a rounded and healthy inidual.The school doesnrsquot just focus on sport - they aim to nurture minds and souls too.ldquoExpressive arts is a major area of focus at the moment, said Mr Rees. ldquoWersquore lucky enough to have a drama specialist supporting us, helping coach the children through both acting and production.ldquoWe are even working with the Welsh Government on a production of H.G. Wellrsquos The Time Machine, to be held in our school hall.The hall had been built with money raised from selling off surplus land, with a further loan from the Vale council.It is tidy, modern, and neatly decorated, with a sophisticated looking lighting system - built with help from parents.ldquoWersquore very proud of the relationship we have with parents here, said Mr Rees. ldquoThey have been enormously helpful with our budgetary concerns.Evenlode is a school with a cheerful outlook, a happy student body and a strong working relationship between staff, students and parent alike.It deserves to go far. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This must be investigated.ldquoThis is a deliberate attempt to present a  equivalence between genuine political canvassing and those who would wish to scam vulnerable people.ldquoMany people will be deeply unsettled by this behaviour from Cairns at the same time as the Tories are attempting to suppress votes by making it a requirement to show ID at polling stations- a move that will disproportionately affect working class, ethnic minority and young voters.ldquoThis is not how politics should be done.

However he is recognised as one of the greatest ever British rugby league players.Elizabeth lsquoBettyrsquo Campbell, also born in  in Butetown, was the first black head teacher in Wales.Following a public vote on hidden heroines Cardf Council confirmed earlier this year that a statue of Betty will be built in Cardf - the first woman to feature in our capital city.On the weekend I will be on a question and answer  about institutionalised racism in Wales, across sport, the media, politics, and the world of work.I look forward to sitting on the  with Cllr Saeed Ebrahim, lawyer Hilary Brown, and Chisomo Phiri from EYST.As more and more Black History Month events take place across Wales, I cannot help but feel a sense of pride in how far we have come as a nation.I hope that these events continue to inspire the next generation of young black leaders as we still have so much more to change.To all my constituents, to everyone across Wales, I hope you all join in with the celebrations and festivities of this historic month, attend the events, learn about those that have trailblazed for us and make this a Black History Month to remember. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It would require the removal of seven of the  ancient trees in the Conservation Area.Many of the trees had been assessed in September  as deserving of a Tree Protection Order, which would prevent them from being cut down, though the Vale council has said they are in the process of securing the protection orders.Residents say one ndash Ash Tree , crucial to development ndash has already been removed. John Lean, a resident of Kymin Terrace, said: ldquoAround a week ago, the first ash tree was sawn down. It was painted as a routine tidying up of their grounds, that it was sick, and was carried out not by the architects who made the main application, but by the warden. We do not believe there was anything wrong with that tree.ldquoAn application was made under Section  of the Planning Acts for the removal of Ash Tree , another tree not in the wood but next to the house, and the removal of a fallen tree. No notice was given to local residents the Vale council did not inspect the site before permission was given, and the first we knew of it was when we heard the chainsaws.Ash Tree  would have to be removed for any development to take place, to allow construction traffic to pass.David Burnett, a resident, said: ldquoThis creates a dangerous precedent for further development here.ldquoWhen the construction of Homeside House was permitted on appeal in , the inspector at the time made it clear that it should not impinge on the woodland. The woodland was described as lsquoinviolatersquo ndash itrsquos at least  years old. What was true then is true now. Other residents had further complaints about the proposed development, and the methodology used to carry out inspections.The large footprint of the dwelling occupies over half the site. The access road would also have to be able to take construction traffic, which residents fear would further damage the site and could limit parking.One resident described a bat survey as lsquocompletely inadequatersquo, as the resident said the survey carried out on behalf of the applicant noted observation was made on two occasions only.William and Karen Stonehouse said: ldquoThe development would involve the destruction of a valuable natural habitat without any benefit to the community whatsoever.ldquoPenarth is not short of expensive properties. It is affordable housing that is desperately needed to prevent the continuing drain of its young people who can no longer afford to buy any property here.ldquoThis proposal does nothing to address that.Joanna Masters said: ldquoI am very concerned about the proposed plan to fell the wood.ldquoI thought the world was becoming more environmentally aware, particularly regarding the value of trees, but it seems the Vale council is, in its own way, as irresponsible as Brazilrsquos Bolsonaro.A spokesman for the Vale council said: ldquoThis planning application has yet to be determined and will be considered in exactly the same way as any other, with the views of all interested parties taken into account.ldquoThat will involve reviewing all letters of representation and consultation responses on the matter. IldquoIt has been resubmitted after a previous one for a similar development was withdrawn as it failed to provide full details of the impact on nearby trees.ldquoWe are in the process of arranging Tree Preservation Orders for trees there that meet the criteria for that protection.ldquoThe council did approve an application to fell an ash tree from Homeside House as, after inspection by an officer, it was deemed to have a fungal bracket, which can structurally weaken trees to the point of breakage. That being the case, it was decided a TPO was not appropriate.The freehold for the woodland was purchased by Proxima GR Properties in  from McCarthy  Stone, who had built an unsheltered accommodation around the site.The Penarth Times has attempted to reach Proxima GR Properties for a comment. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Before starting as a trainee solicitor in a City of London firm, I initially worked as a paralegal for three months in a law firm in Perth, enjoying the lestyle and dferent culture of le in Australia, and then spent a further three months travelling in Australia, New Zealand and Asia. After ing to London, I qualied as a solicitor and then spent eight years working in the real estate department of a London law firm. With two young children, we decided to move back to Northern Ireland in  when I joined Cleaver Fulton Rankin as an assistant solicitor. I have been here ever since and was made a director in . What have you found the most challenging during your years of business, so far  As we will all be aware, the real estate market can be a bit of a rollercoaster. Having been involved in some fantastic deals here in Northern Ireland, largely courtesy of the peace idend, this all came crashing to a halt in . For real estate lawyers in particular, this presented a fresh challenge in terms of expanding client base and ensuring that our teams were kept busy. For a number of years I spent more time advising clients on restructuring, acting for administrators or receivers in selling off assets and working on refinancing transactions. This proved to be a huge contrast to the positive and very visible growth in the economy seen in the previous years. Thankfully, the real estate sector again currently seems to be enjoying good growth with high rates offor investors. However, it has to be said that the lack of political leadership here does still give cause for concern. How would you describe your management style  The most important resource that we have is our young people, so I hopefully lead by example and seek to encourage them. In my view the carrot is always better than the stick. What would you changeyou could go back and do it all again  I have spent over  years now practising law, butI could go back to university again, rather than doing a law degree, I would have studied history. It would have meant an extra year spent in training, but I think it may have kept my interest slightly more than lectures on tort and equity. Have you done it all on your own  No, absolutely not. One of the main reasons for coming back to Northern Ireland was, with a young family, we had the benefit here of family support. My parents in particular, played a key role in helping with child care at a time when I was trying to establish my career. I never underestimate the dficulties facing working parents with young children who deserve all the credit and support that they can get. A strong support network is also very important in the office and I am lucky to have the benefit of some great lawyers around me to whom I can turn to for help when needed. How would you like your business to be remembered  As a leading commercial law firm in Northern Ireland that is independent and innovative provides high quality legal advice to its clients conducts business in a socially responsible and ethical matter has a strong commercial awareness and specialist legal professionals.

The Top  Northern Ireland Companies  dinner, with AL Goodbody, brought together some of top business chiefs making the list, to the grand backdrop of Queen’s University’s Great Hall. The event heard renewed calls for securing a deal on Brexit, and the restoration of Stormont, as we approach , days without a devolved government here. John Mulgrew, editor of Ulster Business, told those gathered: “On the precipice of Brexit, the voice of business has never been stronger or more important – further enforcing the need for a deal. Avoiding a hard exit. And retaining a strong trading relationship across the island. “But we should also take this opportunity to clearly note, that we are approaching , days since having a devolved government – up and running. “It affects you and your businesses, and it’s cited as the key reason putting off investment from overseas, and our own local companies, from making key investment decisions.” The Top  edition is an annual showcase of the leading and largest companies, located right across Northern Ireland. This year sales rose by almost %, approaching a combined figure of £bn. And for the eighth year in a row, poultry processing giant Moy Park has come in at the number one spot, with turnover of £.bn. Michael Neill, head of Belfast office at AL Goodbody, said: “What the Top  companies have achieved in the past  months in what can only be described as capricious circumstances is truly remarkable – but imagine what could have been achieved had we some semblance of ‘normality’. “My hope is that we find ourselves doing so in a Northern Ireland that is embarking on a new and positive era of opportunity, rather than picking up the shattered pieces of a ‘no deal’ Brexit for many years to come.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"firms must prepare for no deal as economic forecast revised down","story":"Posted on Tuesday October  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland firms must prepare for a ‘no deal’ Brexit – a bank chief economist has warned – as it downgraded its forecast for the economy to .%.  Danske Bank’s Conor Lambe said there were still a number of possibilities for what might happen over the next  days, with the UK due to leave the EU on October . Possibilities included a no-deal exit, a withdrawal agreement being reached, an extension of Article  period or a general election. But predictions were \"incredibly dficult\", he said. \"Businesses should behave prudently and use this time to ensure they are as prepared as they can be for a worst-case scenario, no-deal Brexit, in case it occurs at the end of this month,\" he said. The .% is down from the bank’s previous forecasts, delivered in June, that growth would hit % in  and .% in . In its latest Northern Ireland Quarterly Sectoral Forecasts report, Danske Bank said that the Northern Ireland economy likely expanded in the second quarter of the year, but the rate of growth over the first half of the year remained modest. “We have revised our forecast for economic growth in Northern Ireland downwards for both  and ,” he said. “This largely reflects the modest data for the first half of the year, increased Brexit-related uncertainty and the weaker global economic environment. “Assuming that a no-deal Brexit is avoided, we expect the Northern Ireland economy to grow by .% in  and .% in , below the .% we expect UK GDP to grow by in both years. “A combination of strong wage growth and more stable inflation is likely to lead to solid growth in consumer spending, but the lack of clarity around the UK’s future relationship with the EU is expected to continue holding back business investment.” It says the information and communication, and professional, scientic  technical services sectors are expected to be the fastest growing parts of the economy over the next two years.

Ulster Business speaks to Northern Ireland managing director Ian Sheppard, and learns more about how colleagues are being empowered to play an active role in the local communities where they live and work Bank of Ireland UK sees developing its colleagues and helping customers and communities to thrive as part of its DNA, according to Ian Sheppard, managing director in Northern Ireland.From key charity partnerships, to fundraising, volunteering, sponsorship and more, Ian says the desire for Bank of Ireland UK is to make a positive impact by empowering colleagues to make a dference.“When I speak to my colleagues, I hear how really active and involved they are in their own community,” Ian says. “There are so many examples and I never cease to be amazed by their passion and commitment.An important partnership for the bank is with Alzheimer’s Society, its flagship charity for the last two years. In that time around £, has been raised in Northern Ireland, but as Ian explains it’s about more than fundraising.“We realised that not only can we help them financially, but there are resources we can share and opportunities we can offer which can help to signicantly raise the charity’s profile and raise much needed funds.”One example in which the bank has supported Alzheimer’s Society in this way is through its own long-running partnership with Ulster Rugby.“We donated our advertising and promotion activity for a televised game at the Kingspan Stadium making the charity ‘Sponsor for a Day’. This included using their logo on the back of the Ulster Rugby jerseys, taking over the pitch side boards and inviting a group of people living with dementia, their family and carers to the game – helping to get their brand message out to not only a stadium with capacity of , people but to a much wider TV audience.”Alzheimer’s Society sees some fantastic people giving their time to help others. That’s no clearer than its Side by Side programme, which Bank of Ireland UK helps to fund.The photograph on the front of this edition of the magazine taken at the Grand Opera House in Belfast features Mary Dalzell a Side by Side volunteer, alongside Hazel Whiteside, who has been living with dementia for two years.They share a love of music, theatre and cinema and the Side by Side programme, which re-connects people with dementia to their communities by doing the things they love, has not only put a smile on both their faces but has had a positive impact on their lives.There are so many people impacted by dementia and Alzheimers in our local communities, and its touching so many people’s lives, taking this as our motivation, the bank now has almost , staff trained as Dementia Friends.The bank’s ‘Give Together’ programme means staff can take one day a year to spend the time working with a charity or community organisation of their choice. “This day can involve anything from gardening work to painting a youth centre,” Ian says“Beyond Alzheimer’s Society, colleagues are helping many other organisations such as Macmillan Cancer Support, Cancer Research UK through its Relay for Le Legenderry, the Wooden Spoon children’s rugby charity, and Space NI, which offers support services in health and social care sectors to the local community.” You canabout some of the good work colleagues have done further on in this feature.“We are also committed to reflecting the community by developing a erse and modern workforce – which is part-and-parcel of a progressive company,” Ian says. “It’s something that current and future employees expect in their employer. For us its part of our DNA, something that’s always been there but we are now putting a clear and visible structure around it,” Ian says.This has included being a founding member of FuSIoN – the Financial Services Inclusion Network which drives to support and promote LGBT+ professionals across the sector, becoming JAM Card members – allowing staff to knowcustomers with a communication barrier need ‘just a minute’, as well as recently being awarded the Diversity Charter Mark.“Our community involvement is something we are very clear about - something I’m passionate about and it’s an easy ask to get staff engaged. It’s very natural, and it has always been developed from the ground up,” Ian says.He believes this contributes to the huge numbers of staff doing their bit – enabling their own local communities to thrive.  ALISON MITCHELLA customer service manager for Bank of Ireland UK in Londonderry, Alison has worked for the bank for  years, but her motivation for fundraising and support for Alzheimer’s Society began in , following her mother-in-law’s diagnosis with dementia. Alison trained at her local hospital to become a dementia volunteer and learned so much she asked Alzheimer’s Society to run similar sessions in her own branch to enable staff to better assist customers with dementia.Sadly, Alison’s mother-in-law passed away in May of this year but to mark her passing and to raise vital funds in her memory, Alison took part in Alzheimer’s Society Cupcake Day. Initial plans to simply sell cupcakes within her own branch changed rapidly as colleagues from nearby branches heard of the event and wanted to support both Alison and the charity.  Faced with orders for more than  cupcakes, Alison requested a Give Together day, which is time given by the bank to both iniduals and teams to give back to their communities. Alison says: “I was in the kitchen from am to pm baking and icing but it was worth it. The event raised £, which Bank of Ireland UK matched doubling the amount raised to £,. “I could not have achieved that without the support of family, colleagues and the wider business. I was proud to raise the funds in my mother-in-law’s memory and I am proud to work for an organisation that not only values our role in the wider community but supports it too.” CHRISTINE GRAHAMChristine Graham has helped to raise funds for Cancer Research UK through the Relay for Le “Legenderry” event held in St. Columb’s Park, Londonderry.The Derry-based senior business manager for Bank of Ireland UK has personally been touched by cancer as she lost two close family members to the disease. Her young great niece was also diagnosed with a rare form of cancer in  and is now doing well, but seeing the impact a cancer diagnosis has on a family inspired Christine to get involved with the Relay for Le event.“Our event truly is ‘legenderry’,” she says. It is a -hour relay race that brings the whole community together to celebrate the lives of cancer survivors, to remember those lost to the disease, to fight back by increasing our knowledge of cancer and by raising money to fund le-saving cancer research.”In just three years the event has raised over £, for Cancer Research UK with Christine helping to raise £, in  – not only the most successful Relay for Le event in the UK this year but all funds raised in Northern Ireland stays here.  Christine values the support she has had from the bank who promote the event to the wider community and from her colleagues who enter teams.“Relay for Le is for all ages and stages, all shapes and sizes,” she says. It’s cross community and intergenerational and the atmosphere every year is electric.”Plans are already underway for Relay for Le  which promises to be another massive event. PAUL MAGEEPaul Magee, associate director of the corporate banking team, became involved with the Ulster Region Committee for Wooden Spoon, the Children’s Charity of Rugby, five years ago after he successfully completed the charity’s Four Peaks Challenge, reaching the summits of the UK and Ireland’s highest peaks. He is now an active committee member for Wooden Spoon, helping to raise funds to provide le-enhancing experiences for disadvantaged and disabled children. “All funds raised in Ulster stay in the region and benefit the children here,” Paul says. “For instance, we provided £, to the Mae Murray Foundation to buy specialist equipment for the first fully accessible beach in Ulster at Benone Strand. When we created the access to the beach, one parent was very emotional as he watched his teenage daughter in the sea for the first time. It’s those occasions where we’re responding to a need within the community that makes the effort worthwhile.”Wooden Spoon has funded numerous charity projects, most recently £, for a new multi-sensory room at Parkview Special School in Lisburn and purchasing a horse for Riding for the Disabled Association in Coleraine, a charity that enhances children’s lives every day.  With his passion for and involvement in Wooden Spoon, Paul is grateful for the support Bank of Ireland has given him in his role with the organisation, specically the corporate banking team who value his dedication to making a dference. He says: “The bank has been fantastic – I appreciate the flexibility the team offers in the lead up to events and my colleagues often attend Wooden Spoon fundraisers. I’ve also benefited from the bank’s Give Together initiative, which offers days of paid leave that employees can use for volunteering. The bank’s support has helped facilitate my commitment to Wooden Spoon, where I can really see and be a part of the impact the charity has on the local community.” SALLY IRVINEOver the last  years Sally Irvine’s coffee mornings have become a highlight in the office calendar, in turn raising more than £, for MacMillan Cancer Support and funding  days of specialist nursing care for cancer patients across Northern Ireland.Sally, a business lending and credit governance manager at Bank of Ireland UK, arranged her first Macmillan Coffee Morning in  following a colleague’s cancer diagnosis. She found herself wanting to do something to help people living with cancer and so took the plunge and decided to be a host as part of Macmillan’s biggest coffee morning fundraising event. From the outset, Sally had tremendous support from her team members and the wider business, and this has contributed to the ongoing success of the event.The bank plays a huge part in ensuring Sally can deliver the event each year by giving her support through their Give Together scheme.Sally says: “The coffee morning has become a very special occasion and a great day of fun where people from across the bank come together to have a wee cuppa and a cake and take time to catch up while raising money for a really important cause. One in two of us will face cancer at some time in our lives and I am passionate about continuing to fundraise to provide the specialist nursing care that’s so vital for those living with cancer.”Plans are already underway for this year’s Macmillan Coffee Morning and Sally is hopeful the annual fundraiser will continue to hold a special place in the office calendar. PAUL SLEVINBranch manager at Bank of Ireland UK in Newry, Paul Slevin is someone who embodies the bank’s ethos of community involvement through his role with the charity Space NI.  Space NI offers support services in health and social care sectors to the local community. Through its service Home to Hospital, the organisation has helped  elderly people travel to crucial hospital appointments, while its Family Support Hub offers vital assistance to families in distress. Paul joined the charity in  and has just completed five years as chairman of the Board of Directors. He is proud that his background in finance has enabled him to support the charity through its repositioning process to ensure that its activities best serve the community.  Since Paul’s involvement with the charity began, Space NI has won the ‘One to Watch’ award at NI Social Enterprise Awards and the ‘Community Wellbeing Initiative’ at the All Ireland Pride of Place Awards. The organisation has also grown and opened a third premises in Newry and launched a range of volunteer made soy wax candles to raise crucial funds. “Bank of Ireland UK encourage all staff to give back,” Paul says. “Every manager I’ve had was very active in their community, so they were both great role models and great motivators. I think it’s really important to give our time, our expertise, and to do whatever we can to help and support the communities we live and work in.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/12312323.jpg","title":"novosco sold to global services giant for m","story":"Posted on Monday  October  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland IT services firm Novosco has been bought by a German-based global industry giant for around £m, it has emerged.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: \"We’ve got a great new deal that takes back control — now Parliament should get Brexit done on Saturday so we can move on to other priorities like the cost of living, the NHS, violent crime and our environment.\" Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European Commission, said: “This agreement is a fair compromise between the EU and the UK. It is testament to the commitment and willingness of both sides to do what is best for EU and UK citizens. We now have a newly agreed Protocol that protects peace and stability on the island of Ireland and fully protects our Single Market. I hope that we can now bring this over the line and provide the certainty our citizens and businesses so deserve.” Michel Barnier, the European Commissions chief negotiator, said: “We had dficult discussions over the past days. We have managed to find solutions that fully respect the integrity of the Single Market. We created a new and legally operative solution to avoid a hard border, and protect peace and stability on the island of Ireland. It is a solution that works for the EU, for the UK and for people and businesses in Northern Ireland.” The DUP has said it could not support the deal brokered by Mr Johnson. So, what deal was agreed  A statement from the European Commission says: “In terms of regulations, Northern Ireland will remain aligned to a limited set of rules related to the EUs Single Market in order to avoid a hard border: legislation on goods, sanitary rules for veterinary controls , rules on agricultural production marketing, VAT and excise in respect of goods, and state aid rules. “In terms of customs, the EU-UK Single Customs Territory, as agreed in November , has been removed from the Protocol on Ireland   Northern Ireland, at the request of the current UK government. EU and UK negotiators have now found a new way to achieve the goal of avoiding a customs border on the island of Ireland, while at the same time ensuring Northern Ireland remains part of the UKs customs territory. This agreement fully protects the integrity of the EUs Single Market and Customs Union, and avoids any regulatory and customs checks at the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland. “Finally, the EU and the UK have agreed to create a new mechanism on ‘consent, which will give the Members of the Northern Ireland Assembly a decisive voice on the long-term application of relevant EU law in Northern Ireland. The Commission has been in close contact with the Irish government on this point.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/redbus.jpg","title":"wrightbus deal struck to buy ballymena bus maker","story":"Posted on Tuesday  October  by John Mulgrew A deal has been struck to buy the business and assets of Ballymena bus maker Wrightbus after it entered administration with the loss of , jobs.

We hear about the firm’s plans for growth hereBelfast City is changing and its transportation network and parking strategy have a key role to play in supporting its growth. Innovative use of technology to make parking ‘smarter’ and promoting better use of city centre space will contribute to creating the right environment for business investment and the lestyle of residents, commuters and visitors. The need for effective parking planning reaches beyond Belfast city though as parking issues are common in towns across the country. Parking planning is not just about the provision and management of spaces – the majority of parking acts require some sort of enforcement system to ensure effectiveness. As an experienced parking operator, APCOA can work with the public and private sectors to contribute knowledge and expertise to the planning and implementation of effective parking strategies. An on-going investment in developing parking technology also offers new ways of improving services to clients and the public.In August, APCOA acquired the business of Nationwide Controlled Parking Systemsin Ireland, including subsidiaries Parking Enforcement Solutionsand Mobile Research Solutions.The combined operation resulting from the acquisition sees APCOA’s business in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland double in size to cover more than , site locations and it will enable them to service all counties in both countries.APCOA’s existing business in Northern Ireland operated a number of sites including two city centre multi storey car parks in Belfast city centre. The NCPS subsidiary PEA brings a further c. locations, primarily in the greater Belfast area with key sites such as the Titanic Quarter, numerous NHS hospitals and trusts and the Odyssey. APCOA sees this investment as strengthening their position in Northern Ireland and providing a  for increased growth.Combining the existing APCOA expertise and customer base across both countries, this acquisition now makes APCOA a leading mobile parking operator in cashless parking providing convenient, cashless and cost-effective payment options to nearly , parking customers.Both APCOA and NCPS see this as a real opportunity to broaden the strength of services to clients and to improve capabilities by bringing together the best knowledge, systems and operational practice. Kim Challis, regional managing director for APCOA UK  Ireland, said: “The businesses complement each other well across dferent geographies and business sectors and both have strong management and operational teams.  “There are opportunities to share innovation and technology solutions from both companies across the whole business, and also to benefit from the on-going investment and business experience that comes from APCOA UK  Ireland being part of a larger European group. We’re really excited about the opportunities ahead.”Neil Cunningham, managing director of APCOA in Ireland, explains why he sees the acquisition as a positive move for the business in Northern Ireland.“This investment strengthens APCOA’s ability to offer countrywide services and gives us a stronger base for future growth. Colleagues in both companies have a keen focus on customer service and we’ve brought together two experienced management teams.“I’m also delighted that Jason Ballard, founder and chief executive of NCPS and PEA, will continue to work with us for the next six months to support the smooth integration of the business. Combine those factors with the wide range of services and innovative technology we can offer, the possibilities for further growth in Northern Ireland look very strong indeed.”  Philippe Op de Beeck, chief executive of APCOA Parking Group, says the company “profited from healthy organic growth last year”. “In addition, we are currently strengthening our focus on strategic acquisitions.“The group recently acquired Onepark A S in Denmark, after having bought another smaller Swiss company early last year. With every acquisition, we have pursued a clear strategy: not to become a property owner. Thanks to its consistent ‘asset light’ business model, APCOA has established itself as a reliable partner, maximising the value of both private and public property owners’ assets. “At the same time, APCOA offers consumers a range of products and services that are increasingly digital and that span the entire market.” These acquisitions have enabled APCOA to expand its presence in each market and position itself for further profitable growth.
