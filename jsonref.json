Hannah Rothschild, who originated the project, said the Thames was London’s beating heart and the bridges connecting arteries.“But at night these extraordinary structures, each with a unique history and style, evanesce into darkness and obscurity,” she added.Rothschild added that the idea was to “transform a snake of darkness into a ribbon of light, threading art through the heart of the city”.The project was announced in December 2016 and has been much trickier and taken longer to realise than anticipated.“We had to do 30 planning applications, 18 listed building consents, deal with five bridge owners and seven local authorities,” said the project’s director, Sarah Gaventa. “It has been quite a protracted process.“The worst place you can ever install anything is over a working river. We needed abseilers with electrical engineering degrees and we ran out of them … we had to get more from Germany.”Then there were bats, birds and fish to worry about, all the subject of lengthy studies and meetings to discuss the possible impact.On fish, Gaventa said the project would be better for the 135 different species in the Thames because it would not spill light directly on to the water. “Fish don’t like having sex with the lights on.”The team also took great pride from the security camera it set up under Cannon Street Bridge to ensure a nesting Egyptian goose and its subsequent offspring were undisturbed by contractors.Villareal is best known for lighting up San Francisco Bay Bridge and has worked on the project with the British architectural practice Lifschutz Davidson Sandilands. He said he had spent three years, “a fantastic experience”, studying the river and the history of London and was inspired by artists who have painted famous Thames scenes including Monet, Whistler and Turner.Backers say the illuminated bridge project is not a light show. “The light plays across the bridges,” said Gaventa. “It is slightly kinetic, slightly moving, but not fast, this is not disco lights. At the end of the day we want people to pause, have a moment.”The lights, which replace schemes mostly designed by highways engineers, will be switched off at 2am to allay concerns about light pollution.The main money for the project has come from the Rothschild Foundation, the Blavatnik Foundation and Arcadia Fund, the charitable fund of Lisbet Rausing and Peter Baldwin. Seed funding for the initial competition came from the mayor of London and money to replace light fittings on London Bridge came from the City of London corporation.Each bridge will also have pieces of its own music, commissioned from the Guildhall school of musicIt will cost roughly £3m for each bridge and the Illuminated River project team will fund and maintain it for 10 years. “The lighting kit can last for 20 years and then I think it’s up to the public and the media to decide what next,” said Gaventa."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1855599d5fb28e92dff4691809142d6abd70ab75/0_449_2251_1350/master/2251.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9c9b31bebf6260388949885576bf40f6","title":"soon youll be able to buy frida kahlo inspired makeup","story":"The Frida Kahlo Foundation is partnering with the US cosmetics retailer Ultra Beauty to launch a line of makeup inspired by the Mexican artist.The line includes an “eyebrow palette” that could be used to reproduce the well-known unibrow that Kahlo herself confidently showed in self-portraits.The foundation said on Wednesday it wants to encourage women “to embrace their own unique beauty”, adding “Kahlo was well-known for highlighting and embracing what made her unique – inside and out.”Kahlo’s fame has grown in recent decades and now may surpass that of her famed husband, the mural painter Diego Rivera.

I love the stark nature of the Icelandic landscape and its contrasts. Deltas form from glacial meltwater running down towards the shoreline, picking up silt and different materials along the way to create these ribbon patterns. There’s all sorts of wildlife too – birds, beautiful wild horses, seals.So a few years ago after a lot of research, cross-referencing Google Earth with books and photography by others, I took a red eye from New York to Reykjavik. It was kind of funny to take a jumbo jet, have three hours upon landing to rent a car, check into my hotel and nap for 20 minutes and then turn around to meet a pilot and spend the day up in the air again in his homemade plane.You can do all the research you want for these projects, but nothing compares to actually seeing things in person. Being in an airplane above that landscape was really magical. Emotional, even.At first, when you’re flying around in a tiny plane, opening the door and hanging out to take pictures, it’s a little nerve-wracking. You see your life flash before your eyes. But I’ve become quite comfortable doing it and am able to be extremely focused.We were looking for the birds – they are Arctic tern, or sea swallows. They are small and quite difficult to spot. But we found this flock circling very fast. We were flying above them at a safe distance. I’ve come to realise animals are actually not that intimidated by planes. There have been countless times we have been flying over flamingos or buck, seals, turtles, 100 feet above them – which is really quite low – and they just could not have cared less. .I knew exactly which terrain I wanted to capture the tern flying over: that patterning of white pebbles against the black sand. We circled several times until finally they lined up as perfectly as I could have asked for and I was able to get several shots.I started working in this way in 2009. I had just finished a two-week commercial job in Botswana and had a couple of extra days to kick around the area. Somebody knew a bush pilot who had his own plane and said: “This guy wants something to do.” On a whim, I said, “Sure, that’d be fun.” I had seen the world from 30,000 feet up, but this was completely different – we were in this ultra light aircraft, flying low over a vast mud flat. When it rained, the water would pick up dirt and silt. And when it dried it created really interesting patterns, things I wouldn’t have been able to see if we’d been flying even just a couple of thousand feet higher. It was an incredible experience and set me off on this path.What attracts me to aerial photography is that point, at a certain elevation, where the line between abstraction and reality blurs. I never show the horizon because it’s an obvious giveaway, a point of reference. I want to create an image that works on multiple levels and at multiple distances. Some aerial photography looks like it could be a landscape, or something that you’re seeing under a microscope. I want you to know this was taken from the air.Animals are a good focal point. They’re recognisable, although I’m often showing them from a point of view people aren’t familiar with. Here, it’s a bit like a layer cake, you have the flat earth, the birds flying above it, and you’re above it all. I like playing with the way the lens flattens this multi-level, three-dimensional space – the sense of scale, the textures, the distance.The fact that I’m moving through the same space as the birds is one part of the story that the image doesn’t tell,. But it is important for me. Everything is at play, the movement of the ocean, the implied movement of the birds. There’s a connectedness between the living and the moving, to make a beautiful, harmonious image.Training: Photojournalism at the SI Newhouse School of Public Communications, Syracuse University.Influences: Jackson Pollock and Joan Miró.High point: “The shoot I did in South Africa in 2016: we covered about 2000 miles of ground, 45 hours of flying, in a week, never knowing where we would eat that day or sleep that night, landing on remote airstrips, following wildlife from tips from people we would meet along the way. It was a real adventure.”Low point: “Any time I’m not working.”Top tip: “Work your ass off. To be successful you have to put in a tremendous amount of hard work and not give up.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eb05c5d0b02056558d5a675055c0770e64e894df/0_189_4961_2977/master/4961.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=203688fc87108fb59123acbf00fdd9fe","title":"stirling prize 2019 riba shortlist cork building social housing","story":"Energy efficiency is a priority this year as a railway station, visitor centre, social housing project and opera house vie for the RIBA award for British building of the yearA house made of cork will go up against a whisky distillery and one of the busiest stations in the UK to be named building of the year in the most interesting and varied Stirling prize shortlist for some time. They are joined on the list, which celebrates innovation in British architecture, by a new visitor centre for the Yorkshire Sculpture Park, an opera house inserted into a 17th-century stable block in Leicestershire and an exemplary development of low-energy council housing in Norwich.Energy efficiency rightfully looms large on this years’s list, following the recent launch of Architects Declare, a call to arms from a large group of previous Stirling prize winners for an urgent “paradigm shift” to ditch carbon-hungry practices. The Cork House in Berkshire, designed by Matthew Barnett Howland with Dido Milne and Oliver Wilton, offers one such alternative. Built from expanded cork blocks, made using waste from the cork stopper industry, the structure is carbon negative and will emit next to zero carbon over its life it is also designed for disassembly and reuse. The exposed cork walls and engineered timber create a cosy interior space that feels burrowed from the ground, lit from above by a row of funnel-shaped roof lights. It was described by RIBA judges as “a noble, momentous model to aspire to”, and its innovations could be scaled up.The house has a raw material beauty shared by the Weston, an earthy jewel of a visitor centre for the Yorkshire Sculpture Park, designed by the young practice Feilden Fowles. Presenting a rugged monolithic wall that looks as if it was sliced out of the soil, the defensive enclosure houses an expansive light-washed building, hosting a new gallery, restaurant and shop in a carefully judged sequence of spaces. A long, slightly inward-curving glass wall frames a stunning view of the park from the cafe, while the gallery is topped with board-marked concrete roof lights that plunge down from the ceiling. Once again, there is clever environmental innovation: temperature and humidity are regulated by a hidden labyrinth of 10,000 unfired bricks, avoiding the need for air conditioning while still allowing the gallery to display precious loans.The Weston’s quiet restrain is shared by the Nevill Holt Opera, a project that offers further proof of Witherford Watson Mann’s talent for inserting new things inside old shells, following their Stirling prize win for the transformation of the ruined Astley Castle into a Landmark Trust house in 2013. This time they have applied their meticulous skills to a former stable block in the grounds of Nevill Holt Hall near Market Harborough in Leicestershire, erecting an elegant 400-seat venue that preserves the rough-and-ready exterior quality of the space. A horseshoe-shaped balcony is raised on slender steel columns above a rugged concrete floor, while douglas fir panelling creates a sense of continuity between stage and seats. “The modesty, craftsmanship, care and attention that have been applied here are exceptional,” said the judges.A more high-octane kind of drama can be found further north, in the form of Rogers Stirk Harbour + Partners’ billowing distillery and visitor experience for the Macallan whisky empire in Moray, on the northern coast of Scotland. The undisputed masters of exposed pipes have conjured a theatrical spectacle from the seething network of tubes, mash tuns, condensers and copper stills that go into making the amber liquor. With their usual hi-tech precision, the architects have transformed the prosaic production process into a series of set-piece stage sets with the glamour of scenes that Ken Adam might have dreamed up for James Bond or Dr Strangelove. It is all swept beneath a roof of grassy mounds that looks like the Teletubbies went hard on the scotch. It is an appropriately outre temple for a brand that produced the world’s most expensive bottle of whisky, which sold last year for £848,000.While RSH+P have made an elaborate spectacle out of the simple process of distilling grain, Grimshaw architects have succeeded in unravelling the fiendishly complex knot of London Bridge station into something remarkably clear and straightforward. By scooping out the underbelly of Victorian railway vaults, they have created an airy open concourse, where the tracks bridge the space overhead, allowing natural light to flood down in between them. It is a refreshingly legible space, with pairs of long escalators rising to the platforms, while a new arcade of concrete vaults leads through to the Underground station. From the outside it is less successful, resorting to a weird kind of flattened Victorian pastiche, topped with the practice’s trademark swoopy metal canopies, but with edges and junctions that don’t quite glide as gracefully as they should.In its 23-year history, the Stirling prize has never been awarded to social housing – in part, because there hasn’t been any to celebrate. But now, as local authorities across the country are busy building their own homes again for the first time in a generation, there couldn’t be a better time to recognise the value of thoughtful design for those that need it most, and the bravery of councils that are leading the way."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/912a1c98812e84cff30ac1138e3d726a0eff48dc/0_0_5100_3060/master/5100.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eda5ec2239c3871076850d04d303499d","title":"search for british author of 50 year old message in a bottle washed up in australia","story":"South Australian man and his son found the bottle, which was dropped from an ocean liner by 13-year-old Paul Gilmore in 1969The British author of a message in a bottle that recently washed up on the South Australian coast after more than half a century has been found – and he is currently out to sea, his sister says.South Australian man Paul Elliot and his son Jyah told ABC radio they found the bottle on the Eyre Peninsula’s west coast recently while fishing.Elliot said he was looking for the author, Paul Gilmore, who described himself in the note as a 13-year-old English boy travelling on a ship along the southern Australian coast from Fremantle to Melbourne.The note is handwritten on paper with Sitmar Line’s company name at the top and is dated 17 November 1969.In it the teenager says he is travelling on board the Fairstar, a ship that brought many British migrants to Australia during the 1960s under the assisted passage scheme.The boy urges whoever finds the note to reply to him and gives an address in Melbourne.On Thursday, the ABC reported that it had tracked down Gilmore’s sister, Annie Crossland.“It’s amazing, absolutely incredible,” she told the ABC. “He’ll be chuffed to bits.”In another twist, Crossland told the ABC from the UK that he was currently on a cruise in the Baltic Sea.“The last time he was on a ship was probably going to Australia. Cruises aren’t his thing,” she said.Crossland, who was on board, recalled seeing her brother writing letters and dropping them into bottles. He had dropped about six into the ocean, he said.The ABC said it was believed the bottle was dropped on the final leg of the journey between Fremantle and Melbourne.Shown the letter by the ABC, Paul Gilmore’s brother, David said he was amazed. “I’m looking at the message now and yeah, I can see it’s my brother’s writing — he’s obviously a bit younger then,” he said.The family lived in Australia until 1973, before returning to the UK.Oceanographer David Griffin said the bottle could not have remained afloat for 50 years off the south coast because “the ocean never stays still”.Griffin suspected that the bottle had been buried on a beach for years, then refloated by a storm.“If it had been dropped in anywhere in the ocean somewhere south of Australia, then there’s no way it’s going to stay actually at sea moving around for more than a year or two,” he told the ABC.The author gave his position as “1,000 miles east of Fremantle”.However, it is not clear whether the author actually meant 1,600 kilometres out of Fremantle, which would have included a journey south along the west coast before turning east.Last year, a West Australian woman found what is thought to be the world’s oldest message in a bottle.Tonya Illman found the 132-year-old gin bottle in the dunes near Wedge Island. Inside, she found a roll of paper printed in German and dated to 12 June 1886, which was authenticated by the Western Australian Museum."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/082c4e59fefa11cbf22cc80c8d2e35e7933e088d/0_115_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2fa09152c4bcb5a229fca286d2472864","title":"city watchdog admits investment rules too complex for staff","story":"Angry investors at public meeting demand answers from FCA over financial scandals that have lost their moneyThe City watchdog has admitted that its rules are so complex that even its staff may not understand which investment products come under its jurisdiction.The chairman of the Financial Conduct Authority made the concession during a tempestuous annual public meeting in London on Wednesday, where consumers criticised the regulator for failing to protect them from a growing list of scandals.Attendees demanded answers over the collapse of London Capital \u0026amp Finance, which is now at the centre of a mounting £236m financial scandal in which more than 11,000 investors lost money. The FCA’s enforcement team was warned three years ago about the company, but failed to act.One victim claimed FCA staff assured her that dealings with LC\u0026ampF were protected by the regulator. But complex regulation meant that while LC\u0026ampF was authorised by the regulator, the mini-bond products it sold were not. It left investors unable to recover their cash through the Financial Services Compensation Scheme once the firm went under.One attendee challenged the FCA to be more proactive in training staff and explaining which products and services are protected – referred to as the “regulatory perimeter”.But the FCA’s chairman, Charles Randell, said that rules governing the regulatory perimeter are hard to understand, given how much they have changed over time. “It’s actually almost impossible to explain. There’s tremendous risk of confusion, either on the part of consumers, or … on the part of our staff. So it’s not a good situation and I’ll be the first to acknowledge that,” he added.“For many people in this country … unregulated investment, particularly high-risk investments, have absolutely no place in their savings and retirement planning. They’re not suitable products for people, and they should go in to those products with their eyes much wider open than the perimeter enables them to be at the moment.”Some of the nearly 350 people present turned angry when the FCA failed to extend the meeting, which lasted two hours, inciting a shout of “you’re running away” from one.Last month the FCA confirmed it would not punish either RBS or any current or former RBS managers, despite finding evidence of “systemic and widespread” mistreatment of small and medium-sized business customers between 2008 and 2013. The regulator said its powers were limited as business lending is not regulated in the UK.When asked what would constitute “criminal behaviour” in the GRG case, Bailey said the FCA introduced the senior managers’ regime in 2016, which aims to hold iniduals at the bank responsible when things go wrong. He stopped short of confirming whether any crimes would have been committed under the new rules, and stressed that the regulation could not applied retroactively."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/44b7a425308b59aac34428a90ef987b1bc09f37c/0_167_3304_1982/master/3304.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1678645e6ccc80f4d4bb1fa671e2c869","title":"saga looks horribly exposed as hedge fund elliott buys 5 stake","story":"Over-50s specialist vulnerable to having its insurance arm split away from its cruise operationElliott will be more concerned with pressing the break-up question. Do Saga’s two activities, selling car and home insurance and offering holidays, belong under the same roof?It’s fair to ask. General insurance is a commodity product and the rise of price comparison websites, which all demand commissions, has made it more so. As a specialist insurance brand, Saga might enjoy more success in recruiting customers directly if it were owned by one of the industry’s big beasts. But no insurer is going to buy a rival that comes with £600m worth of cruise ships attached. A split would solve the problem.Such thinking will sound like heresy to Saga’s board, and the directors are entitled to make the counter-argument that a membership model breeds loyalty and creates opportunities for cross-selling. It’s a reasonable view. But to give it clout, Saga desperately needs a credible boss.Chief executive Lance Batchelor is on his way out, which was inevitable after two profit warnings and the disappearance of the idend on his watch. But he’s not due to go until next January, a leisurely departure that plays into Elliott’s hands if it decides to lobby for instant action.Saga chairman Patrick O’Sullivan needs to hurry up. If he’s committed to the self-help “heritage” strategy, he needs to find a chief executive who will deliver it. Until that happens, Saga looks horribly exposed.Andrew Bailey, chief executive of the Financial Conduct Authority, has his line about Neil Woodford and he’s sticking to it: the fallen fund manager appeared to be “following the letter of the rules, but not the spirit”. It’s what Bailey told the Treasury select committee last month, and he volunteered the same analysis at the regulator’s annual public meeting on Wednesday.The latest airing came with the garnish that if firms prioritise being within the rules over doing the right thing, then maybe the rules themselves require improvement. The UK’s exit from the European Union provides “important context”, suggested Bailey. “It is fair to say that there are aspects of our regulatory approach that may have developed differently had they done so unilaterally,” he said.Yet it’s too easy for Bailey to point at shortcomings in the rules and firms’ clever tactics. Even on the FCA’s account, the strain on Woodford’s empire was visible long before withdrawals from the £3.7bn flagship fund were blocked at the start of June. Whatever the EU’s formal requirements say, a UK financial regulator is still allowed to prod, cajole and throw its weight around if it perceives a problem.The still unanswered question is whether the FCA was too slow to act. Clarity on that score would be more useful than the same sermon again.The Northern railway franchise, operated by Arriva and an asset of the German state-owned firm Deutsche Bahn, could be terminated if its performance does not improve, says transport secretary Chris Grayling.Since Grayling himself may be shunted into the sidings by the next prime minister, the decision may be made by his successor, which could just mean more delay and frustration for the mayors of Greater Manchester and Liverpool, who support termination.In fact, everything on the railways seems to be on hold until Keith Williams, the expert leading a review for government, completes his report in the autumn. Williams is entitled to take his time, but if Brexit wasn’t happening, the paralysis in decision-making on the railways would be a scandal."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/94038b0495efa3321ac9bdd2e80d70116232d004/0_253_5230_3139/master/5230.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0f79b746671562017662b34a323817de","title":"real fans cricket world cup final freeloaders adrian chiles","story":"Long-suffering cricket fanatics would have given their right stumps for a ticket – but instead Lord’s was full of corporate clients on a jollyOn Sunday I received texts from various friends who were at Lord’s for the Cricket World Cup final. One thing they had in common was that, in all the years I’ve known them, never have they betrayed the remotest interest in the sport. In fact, I’m not sure I’ve ever heard any of them so much as utter the word “cricket”. Yet they were there and I wasn’t. I couldn’t get a ticket. I’m not bitter on my account, but I am gutted on behalf of so many long-suffering, hard-travelling cricket fans who would have given their right stumps to have been there.Even if I had been offered a ticket I would have had to refuse it, or at least not accept it until I’d called at least three people I know who would have been more deserving cases. I’ve watched plenty of county cricket, and fought for Test match tickets tooth and nail. It was even my privilege once to travel to Cape Town to watch England lose a test match at Newlands in less than three days. I’ve done my time. And yet, relative to my cricket-fanatic friends, I wouldn’t have felt worthy of a ticket for Sunday’s final. The guilt of being there while they weren’t would have been too much.I get the need for the organisers to generate revenue by courting the corporate shilling. And yes, I’ve been on the receiving end of lavish corporate hospitality myself more than once. But a balance has to be struck. If the passion of too many genuine fans is being discharged yelling at televisions instead of at the field of play, the game will be the poorer for it.Football is no better. I took my girls to see One Direction at Manchester City’s Etihad Stadium. Full disclosure: we were there as guests of Liam Payne’s parents (who I happen to know). Accordingly, we were in some corporate entertainment area with the family and friends of the band. A testimonial on the wall caught my eye, from someone described as a chartered financial adviser. “The experience in the platinum boxes is pretty much unforgettable. Even when our guests have no great interest in football, you can guarantee they’ll be blown away.” Eh? If you have “no great interest in football”, what on earth are you doing there? As good a spread as they put on at the Etihad, you’ll get better in a restaurant somewhere and won’t have to trouble yourself watching all that running about chasing a ball.Anyway, back to the cricket. One of my friends there was a lawyer. I asked them how they got their ticket. “Corporate box – invited by a generous client – amazing view and champagne all day.” I know not what the answer is here, but if I was in charge, as well as frisking punters on the way in I’d quiz them on their cricket knowledge. Nothing too difficult: “Who is England captain?” or even just “Who are England playing?” would have probably weeded out a couple of thousand, at least. Their confiscated tickets could then be passed to accredited cricket stalwarts queueing at the Grace Gates. That should sort it.Well done England, by the way. Brilliant.

Students living in England are eligible for maintenance loans that vary depending on their parents’ income – with higher-earning parents expected to make up the difference.Students from households in England earning a maximum of £25,000 will next year receive maintenance loans worth nearly £9,000 to study away from home outside of London. But the loan falls to less than £6,400 a year if their parents’ income is above £45,000 a year.The Welsh government’s more generous package of support includes a £1,000 grant for all students, and combined loans and grants up to as much as £11,500 for students living in London.A recent review of post-18 education in England recommended that the government reinstate grants rather than loans to support students from poorer backgrounds.

They were also spotted in East Sussex and Kent.“It’s all about mating,” insect expert Prof Adam Hart of the University of Gloucestershire said. “The ant colonies in the ground are busy rearing the potential new queens and males. When the weather conditions are right, they go into the air.”The weather in the south of England has triggered what is known as the “nuptial flight” phase of the ant’s reproductive cycle – commonly referred to as a “flying ant day”.But Prof Hart argues that the term is misleading as the mating ritual can last for several weeks throughout July and August, depending on the weather conditions in different parts of the country, ultimately involving billions of ants.The ants typically take to the skies when rainfall is followed by hot, humid weather. The queen emits pheromones as she takes flight, encouraging the males to pursue her. But only the strongest are able to mate with her.As the queen flees their advances, birds swoop in and prey upon them. The chase is intended to ensure that the queen’s offspring are as fit as they can be.“The ones that don’t get eaten by birds fall to the ground and lose their wings,” Prof Hart said. “The queen then digs a little hole and tries to start a new colony … It is one of nature’s spectacles. It is fantastic to see the exuberance of nature.”A Met Office spokesperson said the ants showed up on their image as showers of rain because “the radar thinks the beams are hitting raindrops, not ants”.Flying ants are harmless to humans, but it has been reported that they can have a strange effect on seagulls, who can appear drunk after eating a few. “Some think it’s to do with the formic acid in the ants,” said Hart. “But the jury is still out on that one.”He suspects the satellite sighting of the swarms is more likely attributable to increasingly sophisticated technology than to an increase in the ant population. “If it is increasing, I think it is a potentially a good thing,” he said. “But I would be cautious to interpret that.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c1ff02b1a29f108a59035f299cb8b8bb7c504dc6/0_0_6673_4004/master/6673.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ce7937919ee4b927ddb034665d422de6","title":"flapping about swan upping on the thames","story":"Annual counting ceremony dates back to the 12th century when the crown claimed ownership of all mute swans"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/30029e7ec74fadf5a17e3469c62816fad41a0cc9/0_232_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e427662abeaefaf433c3705859a75f5a","title":"chimps bond quicker watching films together research","story":"New research shows chimpanzees bond quicker after watching films together. Time for Hollywood moguls to fetch the popcorn and head for the zoo – for everyone’s sakeFour years ago, while excavating the rainforest floor of Ivory Coast, archaeologists from Leipzig’s Max Planck Institute of Evolutionary Anthropology made a startling discovery. From a metre deep in the earth, the archaeologists began to uncover a series crude tools that chimpanzees had passed down from generation to generation in order to enhance their food-gathering abilities. In short, they discovered that we are living through the chimpanzee stone age.At the time, this was huge news. But new research has just blown this discovery out of the water. Because now we know that chimpanzees would probably quite enjoy Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2.Researchers from Duke University in North Carolina have discovered that chimpanzees become more sociable after watching films. The chimps were placed in pairs and subjected to a short video, before the researchers measured how long it took them to approach their partners, and how much time they spent together. The chimps who had watched the video together approached their partner faster and spent longer in proximity to them.This ultimately means that humans are not the only species able to gain greater social bonding from shared experience. It also means that when you paid £15 a ticket to sit through Men in Black: International with your friends, you were probably demonstrating evolutionary behaviour millions of years in the making. Lastly, it means that your average chimpanzee is more evolutionarily advanced than former England striker Michael Owen.But what to do with this information? It’s reassuring to know that other animals can take the same pleasure from shared experiences as we do. Yet this may mean chimpanzees are catching up with us, and it will only be a matter of time before they out-evolve us and begin to wreak a terrible revenge on mankind.The only answer is more research. Watching films together can bond chimps, but is the bonding affected by the type of film they’re shown? For example, how would they react if shown Avengers: Endgame? Would the procession of context-free story beats and interdimensional time travel baffle them, or would they find themselves instinctively rooting against Thanos? Would their attention begin to dwindle during its three-hour runtime, or would they be as invested as the biggest Marvel fanboys? Once it had finished, how keenly would they anticipate Spider-Man: Far From Home?More importantly, can the chimps hate-watch? If you gather a number of chimpanzees together and make them watch, say, Transformers 2, would they become more bonded by how terrible it is, or less? Do chimps have the capacity for film snobbery? Will some of them even exaggerate their own fondness for difficult foreign-language arthouse fare as a dismal attempt to cover for their screaming lack of personality? How do chimps feel about all-female remakes of beloved classics? Is there some way to measure their likelihood of downvoting YouTube trailers for the 2016 Ghostbusters movie or Ocean’s 8? Because that seems quite important.We cannot afford to rest until we know exactly how into film these chimpanzees are. The repercussions of this research could be enormous. At the very least, we’d know to include a scene of them all watching Freddy Got Fingered the next time anyone decides to remake Planet of the Apes."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4acedb4d29cf3606d537577a8fdf4fd0db04a69e/863_65_1468_881/master/1468.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6f3967a8f0ae35c2c574a0378deca8e9","title":"crazy credits how the lion king nostalgia consultant is simply following a trend","story":"From roach wrangler to orgy adviser, here are six surreal jobs you didn’t know the movies requiredChance the Rapper was brought on board The Lion King by Donald Glover as a “nostalgia consultant” – mostly, it seems, because he has been obsessed with the original cartoon since he was a kid.

His habit of taking his insect chums with him on TV talk shows led to an appearance on The Larry Sanders Show when his tarantulas “escaped”.Oh, those Zuckers, David and Jerry (and Jim Abrahams). As students of film credits know, the best boy is the assistant to the head electrician (gaffer) or head rigger (key grip). Well, those funny guys had themselves a time with the credits on Airplane!, their 1979 debut: there’s no best boy credit but there is one for “worst boy” … Adolf Hitler. The Coen brothers also get creative with their credits, and producer Drew Houpt, who was head of operations at the Coens’ production company for several years, gets some interesting job descriptions. On True Grit he was credited as “the new duke” on Burn After Reading as “the walrus” and on No Country for Old Men “the one right tool”. His credit on A Serious Man is best: The last of the just. This is the title of a novel by André Schwarz-Bart about victimisation of Jews across the centuries.No such credit exists on the 1959 biblical epic Solomon and Sheba (“Behold! The love story of the ages!”), but a scene with Gina Lollobrigida leading a pagan love fest did get everyone hot under the collar. An orgy sequence adviser was named in Michael and Harry Medved’s 1980 book The Golden Turkey Awards as one Granville Heathway – who, strangely, has not been heard of before or since.Although not an especially rare credit, one in particular has gone down in infamy. The 1929 version of The Taming of the Shrew, starring Mary Pickford and Douglas Fairbanks, was reportedly adorned with the ludicrous: “By William Shakespeare, with additional dialogue by Sam Taylor.” But, like orgy sequence adviser, this may only be an industry urban myth as popularised (again) by The Golden Turkey Awards: existing copies of the film credit Taylor for “adaptation and direction”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/00df6328b1d8177f5aebfe35b9147a856237a538/0_3172_6861_4115/master/6861.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7e0e07fff122afccc08f4022e24e2ff8","title":"felicity cloake masterclass salade nicoise recipe","story":"Outside the French Riviera, inauthentic versions of salade niçoise abound, much to the chagrin of purists. Here’s the classic French salad as it is meant to be madeIf salade niçoise were sentient, rather than a salad, it would sue for defamation of character, such are the abuses heaped upon it in the name of culinary innovation. Indeed, one of Nice’s most notorious sons, former mayor Jacques Médecin, wrote of the trauma of seeing ‘the remains of other people’s meals being served under the name salade niçoise’. I think he’d approve of this one, though.2 eggs500g broad bean pods, or 50g french beans4 ripe tomatoes¼ cucumber2 spring onions½ red pepper50g small black olives1 tbsp capers4 anchoviesA few basil leavesFor the dressing1 small garlic clove1 pinch coarse salt2 anchovy fillets, drained and finely chopped1 small handful basil leaves, torn4 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil½ tbsp red-wine vinegarGround black pepperPut the eggs into a pan just large enough to hold them comfortably and cover with cold water. Bring slowly to a boil over a medium heat, then turn down the heat slightly and simmer gently for seven and a half minutes. Drain the water from the eggs and put them in cold water to stop them cooking further.Pop the broad beans from their pods, then peel off their papery skins (unless they’re very young, in which case you can leave them on). If you’d prefer to use French beans instead, bring a pan of salted water to a boil, simmer them for a couple of minutes until just tender, then decant into a sink of cold water to stop them cooking. Dry before use.Put the tomatoes in a pan of boiling water for 30 seconds, then scoop out and, once cool enough to handle, gently peel off their skins – if they haven’t split in the heat, use your fingernail or the tip of a small, sharp knife to help tease off enough to get started. Cut in half, scoop out and discard the seeds, then cut the flesh into thick slices.Peel the cucumber (I like to do this in stripes, but then I like stripes on everything), cut it in half lengthways, then scoop out and discard the seeds. Cut the cucumber into chunky half-moons. Finely chop the spring onions. Deseed the pepper and cut it into fairly thin strips.Put the peeled garlic clove into a mortar with a pinch of coarse salt, then mash to a paste. Add the anchovies – if they’ve been packed in salt, rather than oil, you’ll need to give them a quick rinse first – and mash them, followed by the basil. Finally, incorporate the vinegar and then the olive oil until well emulsified. Season to taste.Toss the beans, sliced tomatoes, cucumber, spring onion and red pepper in a large bowl with two-thirds of the dressing, until everything is thoroughly coated. Using your hands, lift out the dressed salad and arrange on a serving plate.Gently knock the blunt end of each egg against a hard surface until it cracks, then peel. Cut the eggs into quarters and season lightly. Arrange these on top of the salad. Pit the olives, if you like, and rinse the salt off the capers and anchovies, if need be. Cut the anchovies into slivers. Scatter the olives, capers and anchovies all over the salad.Spoon the rest of the dressing on top of the salad, then strew the basil leaves on top just before serving. Eat with some good baguette to mop up all of those delicious juices. Note: the salad itself can be made a few hours in advance, and left to let the ingredients mingle, but don’t add the basil until the last minute.If you’d like to add tuna, as is often used in Provence, leave out the anchovies from the salad itself, if not the dressing (though you can eschew them altogether, if you prefer) – a small tin, drained and flaked over the top, is quite sufficient. Boiled waxy potatoes, a popular addition in the UK, are not authentic, nor required, but if you must, I won’t tell."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4cdaafc01595b7d4810b993a4a635ad2599d4f0a/0_307_4928_2957/master/4928.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fee88b4192d35af9202e8cab46bb6fd0","title":"the rules of holday eating","story":"Dining out while away can lead to meltdowns. From setting a budget to finding a place to eat, here’s how to make the most of your mealtimes away from homeEating out on holiday is considered a treat. And on one level, it is. You have enough cash to blow on a plate of pasta puttanesca that tastes the same as the one you make at home, but is slightly superior because you are eating it while wearing perfume in an artfully dilapidated alleyway. That’s not something to sniff at.Ultimately, however, while there may be a small number of eerily well-adjusted weirdos who disagree, for the rest of us dining out while away spells meltdown: skipping sightseeing to obsess over TripAdvisor reviews arguing with holiday companions over whose dietary preferences should take priority wasting hours trying to locate a joint that suits both your pescatarian girlfriend and your raging carnivore of a dad.Difficulties are compounded by the modern world. Thanks to the internet, we have never had so much access to information about restaurants ahead of booking. As a fussy vegetarian with an Instagram dependency and a perfectionist streak, the perils of eating out on holiday are my speciality. So here’s how to navigate them so you don’t wreck your summer or anyone else’s.It is understandable. You want your break to be perfect you have been grafting for it all year. And no one wants to end up in a tourist trap. But there comes a point when researching cool restaurants so you don’t ruin your holiday tips into, well … ruining your holiday by researching cool restaurants.Are you several posts deep in the Instagram profile of a schoolfriend you haven’t seen for 20 years, frowning at a geotagged shot of a San Sebastian pintxos bar? This is not the holiday spirit. Nor is forcing your partner on a city-wide march to locate an “off-the-radar” gelateria that may or may not have closed in 2017.Such behaviour is familiar to clinical psychologist Linda Blair. “We work so hard nowadays, and we tend to get a skewed impression of how things are meant to be because of social media only showing the good stuff,” she says. “The combination is lethal.” To combat fretting over insignificant choices, she recommends doing a real-life recce. And being spontaneous. “If you just walk in, there’ll be a more accurate match between what you expect and what you get.”There is spontaneity. And then there is refusing to even contemplate dinner until 9pm, at which point – suddenly and intensely mad with hunger – you leap off your sunbed, force your mates to sprint into town and collapse in the first place that appears to have an oven. Someone in your party has been saving up for a special dinner. Put a smidgeon of thought into it.Burger lukewarm? Moussaka underseasoned? Celebrate it, says Blair. “Success and perfection is a little bit tedious. It’s the ones that go wrong that make the great stories.”You have decided on a seafood joint in Bordeaux. But, hang on: TripAdvisor relays the unhappy tidings that Jane from Newton Abbott deemed the mussels overpriced. Back to square one. Food critic Jimi Famurewa advises taking a step back from the site if you are prone to such dithering. “It’s a weird Rorschach test where people see what they want to see.” He recommends alternative guides such as Eater and The Infatuation. “They champion smaller, humbler places that are beyond the overhyped ones with queues.”Congratulations! You have finally found a restaurant. Do not spoil this evening by bullying companions into planning how you will spend the next.You are on the hunt for a lunchtime picnic spot. A-ha, that doorway up ahead with a spotless front step looks charming. Unfortunately, it is also the vestibule of a bakery – and, crucially, not the one where you bought your food. This means you cannot, under any circumstances, camp out there with your flaky akopita. Find somewhere else. In Florence last year tourists clogging up the area around panini favourite All’Antico Vinaio became such a problem, the city’s council outlawed eating nearby.Snacking in the street is appealingly cost-savvy, but Georgette Jupe, who blogs as Girl in Florence, points out that a bit of Googling will throw up “cheap eats with seats”. Researching parks with picnic tables and squares with benches also doesn’t hurt, she says. “It might not be as easy as just standing outside the place you bought your sandwich, but having respect for the destination goes a long way with residents.”Three times! That’s the number of occasions already you have awkwardly bumped into your holiday doppelgangers. (She has your skirt your boyfriends sport similar glasses they too are fiercely gripping their Lonely Planet guides). First: on the 7.10am flight from Gatwick. Second: in Bologna’s most zeitgeisty restaurant (seriously, what were the chances?). And now they are enjoying an identical aperitivo order to yours (2 x Aperol Spritz and some crisps – niche, right?) at the adjacent table. It is tempting to shun them. Not only do they out you as unoriginal. (Without them, no one would have clocked a thing!) They also remind you of home and work and Boris Johnson. But smile. Make small talk. At the very least, you can coordinate itineraries so you never run into each other again.It is fine to take a few snaps of the dishes as they arrive, or of loved ones tipsily enjoying the meal. But rearranging tables, fretting over lighting and separating someone from their Riesling so it can be used to “add balance” to the shot are all unacceptable.“It truly is the best way,” says food writer Martha de Lacey. “Not only do you get to spend as long as you like shifting plates about, but you also get to order whatever you like. Win, win.”It is an injustice of the highest level to order a selection of goodies to the value of about five times what the person next to you can afford, ruin their meal with your expansive photoshoot of the spread, and then piss off without taking more than a few bites. They will be consumed by food envy – and then shame as they weigh up the etiquette of scarfing the leftovers. To the duo who did this to me in Sicily last year: the cannoli weren’t as nice as they looked.Unless you have a serious allergy or intolerance, do not expect small local restaurants to cater for your dietary preferences, says De Lacey. So, if butter freaks you out, or anchovies conjure harrowing childhood memories … hard luck. “Sure, ask what a dish contains,” she says. “But remember that many Spanish restaurants don’t consider ‘jamon’ to be meat, and many places in Japan use fish products in absolutely everything.” Solidarity, fellow vegetarians.On group holidays, the person with the lowest budget gets final veto. Only a sociopath would object. Obviously, don’t stage whisper “Is that all right with you?” to your hard-up friend every time your posse drifts towards a potential spot. Just don’t explode when it emerges that not everyone fancies spending 18 euros on a single prawn.Without appropriate planning, summer cheer can abruptly curdle into hunger-induced fury. Sure, join that massive queue for a trendy new opening. But – and I cannot stress this enough – take provisions. A sack of Haribo, say. Or a crate of cereal bars. After all, eating on holiday may be a joy, but it is also an endurance test."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4afaf568eb7afdc378c1d1f43571aa28e6d97265/1108_281_3256_1953/master/3256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5938c92e961d3c8b49e3e6be30a06f8b","title":"gym eat repeat the shocking rise of muscle dysmorphia","story":"The idealised male body has become bigger, bulkier and harder to achieve. So what drives a generation of young men to the all-consuming, often dangerous pursuit of perfection?It is difficult for Miles to pinpoint the moment his muscle dysmorphia started. It was just always there, a background hum. “As far back as I can remember, I wanted a better-looking body,” says the 35-year-old US soldier, now stationed in Mons, Belgium. When he was 13, Miles spent a summer cutting grass to save up for a secondhand Soloflex exercise machine. The machine cost $1,000 (£800), but as Miles was too young to join a gym, it was worth the expense. With the help of the Soloflex, Miles started weight training and never looked back.When he returned from a posting to Afghanistan at 24, things spiralled. He began obsessively working out and regimenting his meals. “I went all in ... it was full, hardcore dedication to the lifestyle.” Miles set his watch to beep every three hours, to remind him to eat. If it beeped when he was driving, he would pull over. Slowly, he whittled his body into shape. His muscles became striated, every fibre visible. Not big enough. At 95kg (210lbs) and 1.8 metres (6ft 2in), Miles wanted to be more muscular leaner. He lost 22kg and started competing in amateur bodybuilding competitions. There was virtually no fat on him. “You pinch your skin and it just stays pinched.” His girlfriend left him. “She began to realise that my body dysmorphia was like dating another person.” The pursuit of muscularity took over his life. “I just thought, I am so lean, and shredded, and veiny, and masculine – I don’t ever want to go back to how I was before.”Yet by 33, single again – the dysmorphia had claimed yet another relationship – it had all become too much and he was in a dark place. “I did not enjoy life in any way, shape or form.” All day long, he would starve himself, struggle through punishing workouts, go home and binge-eat before throwing it all up. One evening, waiting in line at the burger chain In-N-Out for more food to purge, Miles finally decided enough was enough. “I woke up so happy the next day, knowing it was over.”What drives a generation of young men to slavishly pursue this physical ideal? “Over the past decades, the idealised male body image has got bigger and bulkier,” says Nagata.This body type even pressed its way into our children’s bedrooms: studies show that action figures have become brawnier over the past 25 years.This wasn’t always the case. “In the 70s, we saw very slim, almost androgynous men, like Mick Jagger and David Bowie ... to be muscular was to be defined as to be militaristic, at a time when, in the US, there were protests against the Vietnam war,” says Dr Roberto Olivardia of Harvard Medical School, an expert in male body image. “So that build was really frowned on and rejected by youth culture.“But then the 80s came about, with figures like Ronald Reagan, who was pro-military, and men like Arnold Schwarzenegger and Sylvester Stallone.” This ideal male – hyper-masculine, militaristic, strong above all else – was exported globally through films such as First Blood (1982), Predator (1987) and The Terminator (1984). WWE wrestling was founded in 1980, and the likes of Hulk Hogan became celebrities. In the late 90s, a leaner but still very muscular aesthetic – popularised by Brad Pitt in the movie Fight Club – became fashionable.Today’s muscle men stare down at us from the billboards of superhero films featuring stars such as Chris Hemsworth or Jason Momoa, the latter only last week body-shamed online after photographs emerged of him enjoying himself on holiday in fractionally less-than-superhero condition. On the small screen, the current crop of Love Island contestants mug for the cameras in tiny swimming trunks, all the better to display their perfect six-packs.However, just as fashion magazines don’t cause anorexia, but contribute to a toxic environment in which extreme thinness is celebrated, Hulk Hogan, Dwayne ‘the Rock’ Johnson and Chris Hemsworth are not to be blamed for the disordered behaviours sweeping our gyms. According to the NHS, we do not yet know what causes body dysmorphia disorders but genetics, a chemical imbalance in the brain or a traumatic experience in your past may play a part. You are also more likely to develop it if you were bullied or abused as a child, something student Nathaniel Shaw knows well. The 28-year-old was bullied at secondary school – they called him a Borrower, on account of his slender frame.“I was always the small kid in the corner that no one wanted to speak to.” Social acceptance came one squat press at a time. “From where I’m from in Nottingham, because it’s a very rough place, you’re training to protect yourself. The bigger guys are the serious people that no one wants to mess with. That was the main thing at the start – get big and be taken seriously.”When Shaw went to college at age 17, he had a plan: work out all winter and reveal his buff body come summer. But when he took off his T-shirt playing football one afternoon, a girl said that Shaw “had no chest”. He instantly put his top back on. “I still wasn’t good enough.” The unkind comment laid waste to Shaw’s fragile self-esteem he walked away from the wreckage determined to become even more shredded.Shaw’s life became: the gym, home to eat enormous portions of tuna, pasta and cheese, move as little as possible to conserve energy and repeat. Shaw detached from the contours of normal life. He stayed in bed longer, later and missed exams. He was depressed. “The pursuit of this muscular ideal takes over people’s lives,” explains Nagata. “They become obsessed with it. They can’t function in their daily life outside of pursuing this ideal and it can lead to depression, missing school or work, and losing their ability to do basic living tasks.”To an observer, Shaw – who weighed 80kg at 1.7 metres – was tank-like. But that wasn’t how he saw himself. “I would be in the gym and say: ‘I look like shit.’ Everyone would be like: ‘No you don’t, you’re huge, I wish I could look like that.’” Muscle dysmorphia is a disease of perception. Although its sufferers live in the material world – a place of grunting exertion and weighted bags and scoopable protein powders – they spend most of their time in an imagined reality, where they are incalculably huge. Their biceps are swollen watermelons each muscle as finely striated as the delicate contours of a seashell.But even if they eventually achieve that physique, it is not enough. As soon as one muscular ideal is achieved, a new goal appears. “There’s a saying: ‘Once you step into a gym, you’re forever small,’” says 27-year-old Rich Selby, an amateur bodybuilder from Cardiff. Miles agrees. “Every muscle could be bigger. I could be leaner. You look at yourself and feel like everything is small and weak. I have no chest muscles I have no arm muscles ... you’re judging yourself against an impossible standard.”Social media reflects this standard back at you. “You’re being sold a false reality,” says Miles. “I can get into really good shape, right before I’m doing a bodybuilding competition, and use lighting and angles and filters to make my physique look even crazier than it already is, and save a bunch of pictures and upload them to make it seem that I always look like that, all year round.”Some turn to illegal substances to attain this ideal. Tony, 23, works for a pharmaceutical distributor in Dallas. He started taking illegal performance-enhancing drugs, including testosterone, equipoise and nandrolone, two years ago. The drugs created a dangerous feedback loop: the more he injected, the more his body changed and the more he took. “People are like: ‘Wow, that guy’s a tank.’ They have more respect for you ... I thought, heck yeah, I’m going to take more so I can get even bigger.”It is a common experience: muscle dysmorphia can be fuelled by the positive reinforcement men receive from other men in the gym. “When you’re large, you get a lot of respect,” Selby confirms. Men come up to him and ask how much he can bench. Sometimes they try to start fights. “That’s why people become addicted. They’re insecure, so they need confirmation from other people.” Selby self-identifies as having muscle dysmorphia, but believes that he has it under control, because he has good self-esteem.Up close, you can see the havoc muscle dysmorphia wreaks. “Your interpersonal relationships fall apart – but you are so caught up in the endorphin rush of affirmation from your gym buddies, you barely notice,” says Miles. “You’re kind of an asshole. You don’t realise it ... you just become this all-around grouch. It consumes not only all of your time and focus, but also the human part of you.” It’s also a lonely existence. All your time is spent preparing protein-rich food, but because you are over-exercising, you are often “hungry, and cranky, and don’t sleep well”.Tony was one young man who used drugs to bulk up. He knew what he was doing was dangerous: he would even donate blood to get his blood pressure down. “I just genuinely didn’t care.” As he cycled on and off drugs, he experienced dramatic mood swings. He got fired from his job at a hardware store for screaming at a coworker in the break room. Eventually, his mental health deteriorated so much that he came off all the drugs in May last year.What makes someone play Russian roulette with a steroid-filled syringe? Selby thinks people are driven to desperate measures because they cannot disassociate who they are from how they look.It’s an obsession that can prove fatal. Freddie Dibben, 28, died in March 2017 after his heart became enlarged by the stimulant Clenbuterol. His father Clifford, 69, found him. “The hardest part was going back through to the kitchen and telling his mum what I found. It’ll never go away.” Like Tony, Freddie experienced mood swings. “He would snap at you,” Clifford says, recalling an incident where Freddie was “stroppy” with him as they tinkered with his car. He put the moodiness down to work stress – Freddie had been pulling a lot of night shifts at Wilton carpet factory, where colleagues referred to him as a “forklift”, on account of how much he could carry.But Clifford felt blessed to have a health-conscious son he didn’t see anything to be alarmed about. A keen gym-goer, Freddie even gave up smoking at his parents’ request. “He used to cook all his own food! He’d cook a meal before he went to work ... he had two sets of scales, and he weighed all his vegetables, everything. He even kept notes of what he was eating and what he was doing.” Clifford laughs, bitterly. “Except for the bloody drugs.”And that is one of the issues of muscle dysmorphia – you can hide in plain sight. A pair of weighing scales in the kitchen tupperware boxes of chicken and broccoli in your backpack. Most people view these as harmless, if idiosyncratic, behaviours. And when you look like you are hewn out of marble, it is hard to consider anything is amiss. It is only when you step past the facade that you realise these statue-like men are slowly destroying themselves.•Some of the names in the piece have been changedComments on this piece are premoderated to ensure discussion remains on topics raised by the writer.

Employees experiencing impostor syndrome suffer from emotional exhaustion, which leads to a conflict between work and family life and dissatisfaction with the latter. While the idea that an issue at work can affect you at home may sound unsurprising, researchers hope that the results will finally add “legitimacy to discussing impostor phenomenon as an important talent-development issue”. And I hope it will add legitimacy to the conversation about impostor syndrome more generally.Impostor syndrome is increasingly framed as something that must be remedied by the women who experience it. We are told to pull ourselves up by our bra straps and that we simply have to realise the power that has been within us all along, as though we are the protagonists of a Disney film. Impostor syndrome is taken even less seriously when it is discussed in reference to women of colour, whom it affects more. The feelings of inadequacy that women of colour may harbour are twice as hard to escape because it is so often implied their achievements are down to “positive discrimination” – although, compared with other women, they often have to overcome more and greater hurdles in their careers.For women in general, life is a never-ending juggling act of sky-high societal expectations, impossibly high expectations set by oneself and the unshakeable feeling you are falling behind in both. The best many of us manage is a convincing-looking but faked balance, performed with precision until exactly 5.30pm. But the frustration of this simply follows you home. We are held to these standards in all areas of life, so it is unsurprising that impostor syndrome bleeds into the home, where we are often undervalued, too. Just last week, Meghan, Duchess of Sussex was chastised for holding her baby in a way some people deemed incorrect – with criticism such as this, it is no wonder women constantly feel like they are underperforming.It is crucial to remember that women are not born feeling less-than. But if you are continually treated as though you are, you eventually internalise it. And this is not merely a synonym for low confidence – impostor syndrome is the logical outcome of a world that was never designed for women to be successful. It is time we stopped seeing the problem as being women’s refusal to believe in themselves and rather a world that actively refuses to believe in women."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0b8f430070fb3334847c3f3bad2798fe4132ed02/0_0_2048_1229/master/2048.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1c64911b2031fa7ad78e329b8a5018db","title":"give free tv licences to d day veterans bbc told","story":"Labour MP says BBC should create opt-out for anyone who took part in Normandy invasionBBC bosses have been told they should give free TV licences to all veterans of the D-Day landings, as the row over the withdrawal of the benefit for most over-75s continues.Labour MP Ian Lucas said the corporation should create a special opt-out for anyone who took part in the Normandy invasion to ensure they do not have to pay the £154.50 a year fee to watch television.“There are two Normandy veterans in Wrexham and they will not be eligible to retain the TV licence,” said Lucas, who represents the town, at a House of Commons select committee hearing. “I think you should give a concession to Normandy veterans. We’re talking about a small amount of money.”Last month the BBC announced it would scrap the free TV licences for most over-75s from next summer in order to fix a £750m-a-year hole in its finances, with only iniduals who are eligible for the government’s pension credit continuing to receive television for free.The benefit used to be subsidised by the government out of the welfare budget. But in 2015, the then chancellor, George Osborne, pushed the cost onto the BBC as part of his austerity measures, ensuring the broadcaster became the focus of public ire after it made the decision to cut the benefit.Lucas highlighted the case of iniduals in his constituency who will have to pay for television: “I’ve got a constituent whose name is Ted Edwards, who’s 93 years of age, who’s a Normandy veteran. He’s spoken to me about this issue of Normandy veterans having this benefit removed. Ted is a wonderful community activist, he is someone who contributes hugely to his community ... It doesn’t sit right with me that we’re withdrawing benefits from such people.”The BBC director general, Tony Hall, said he had the “deepest respect” for the D-Day veteran who has “been through things I hope I never have to go through”.However, he said it was about intergenerational fairness and that channels would close if the BBC picked up the cost: “The board have come to the decision to balance two fairnesses – the fairness to people over-75, while also being fair to the majority of licence fee payers who would have to fund the £750m if the concession was to carry on.”The BBC has repeatedly pointed out that over-75s today are wealthier than previous generations, although charities point out that this is not the case across the board and television often provides a lifeline for the lonely.Iniduals who refuse to pay the licence fee will be committing a criminal offence, raising the prospect of elderly Britons appearing in court over their refusal to pay for the BBC. Women are also disproportionately prosecuted for non-payment of the licence fee.Hall said the BBC was forced to pick up the cost of providing free TV licences in the immediate aftermath of the 2015 general election, following the decision made by Osborne, with no opportunity to make any counter arguments.“I had a call from the then secretary of state, John Whittingdale, saying ‘I’ve lost the argument over the weekend and they’re going to impose the over-75s concession on you’.”“I said, ‘that’s nuclear’, and I laid out the consequences of that decision.”Hall was also baffled by the Conservatives’ pledge in their 2017 election manifesto to ensure TV licences remained free for over-75s, since the responsibility for the decision had already been transferred to the BBC.Tory party sources have previously suggested the pledge was included in error by copying and pasting lines from the 2015 manifesto in a rush to produce a manifesto to fit the deadline of Theresa May’s snap election."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e59e50977069728d6155d217c88e141aa2501ce0/0_18_4904_2944/master/4904.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bc1052292384ee91932455652a219d97","title":"has brexit saved the lib dems","story":"The Lib Dems have made an extraordinary comeback in 2019 because of their anti-Brexit stance.

Fears have been growing that Johnson could prorogue or dissolve parliament in order to allow the deadline to pass without MPs interfering.Thirteen Tory peers rebelled against the government to vote for the amendment from the crossbench peer David Anderson, a former independent reviewer of terror legislation, with support from Labour and the Lib Dems.The amendment to the Northern Ireland (executive formation) bill builds on an amendment  passed in the Commons last week, when MPs backed a proposal from the pro-European Tory Dominic Grieve calling for fortnightly reports from the government on the efforts to restore the power-sharing executive.The new Lords amendment would ensure these have to be debated in the weeks before the Brexit deadline. The bill could theoretically make it illegal for the government to prorogue parliament in the autumn if the power-sharing executive in Northern Ireland has not been restored.The Commons vote is likely to be extremely tight on Thursday. Grieve’s amendment passed by a single vote last week, after a government whip forgot to vote. Grieve lost votes on other related amendments.The shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, said Labour would fight hard to try to ensure the bill’s progress on Thursday. “This is another important step to prevent the suspension of parliament. We will do everything to support this measure in the Commons tomorrow,” he said.The former Commons leader Andrea Leadsom earlier hinted that Johnson could use the timing of his first Queen’s speech to lock out MPs and prevent them from blocking no deal.The former Conservative minister Guto Bebb told Sky News he believed Johnson was “quite seriously contemplating” using a Queen’s speech to suspend parliament, by scheduling it for early November. Parliament traditionally does not sit for around a fortnight leading up to the speech.Leadsom said she was not in favour of prorogation in principle. “I do not think that prorogation is a tactic that any prime minister would employ,” she told LBC. “But there are different aspects to this. Prorogation can take place in the event a general election is called, or a decision to prorogue at the end of a session. All of these things are very well established parliamentary procedures.“Boris is quite clear we are going to leave the EU, we’re going to reunite the country, then we’re going to defeat Jeremy Corbyn. In that order. We need to get on with it.”"},{"url":null,"title":"labour shadow brexit minister sacked over corbyn comments","story":"Lady Hayter loses job after comparing those around Labour leader to film about Hitler’s last days Labour’s shadow Brexit ­minister, Dianne Hayter, has been sacked after she likened the “bunker mentality” around Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership to the “last days of Hitler”.Lady Hayter, Labour’s deputy leader in the Lords, was stripped of her shadow cabinet position after she attacked Corbyn’s inner circle and its critical response to a BBC Panorama programme investigating antisemitism complaints within the party. “To compare the Labour leader and Labour party staff working to elect a Labour government to the Nazi regime is truly contemptible, and grossly insensitive to Jewish staff in particular,” a Labour party spokesman said. He added that Hayter had been sacked “with immediate effect” for her “deeply offensive remarks about Jeremy Corbyn and his office”.Those around Corbyn had a “bunker mentality”, she said, accusing them of refusing to give key information to the party’s ruling National Executive Committee (NEC) as well as the Equality and Human Rights Commission.The row came after Theresa May called on ­Corbyn to apologise for his “failure to deal with racism” in his party. Corbyn hit back, saying Labour was totally opposed to racism. He called on May to deal with Islamophobia in the Conservative party.The Ilford North Labour MP, Wes Streeting, said Hayter’s sacking was a “gross over-reaction to a comment that was actually about Jeremy Corbyn’s bunker mentality”.He added: “This sacking only reinforces her point. The speed of this sacking shows that Labour’s leader is quick to act to protect his feelings, but slow to act against racists. The double standards are extraordinary.“Dianne Hayter remains the elected deputy leader of the Labour group in the House of Lords, regardless of ­Jeremy Corbyn’s purge.”The longstanding Labour critic Luke Akehurst was also among the attendees of Tuesday’s Labour First meeting, the Huffington Post reported. “It isn’t a bunker, it is the last days of Saigon,” he said. “It’s like they are trying to get on the helicopters trying to kick off the incumbents in these parliamentary seats, because they know their days of control are numbered.”Hayter was among four senior peers who on Monday wrote to Corbyn with an offer of establishing a panel to review the allegations of former party staffers made on Panorama and to “provide advice and support on how a properly independent complaints process could be set up and run”. The others were Angela Smith the party’s leader in the Lords, Toby ­Harris and chief whip Tommy McAvoy. In it they set out their view amid consternation about the Panorama allegations that the leader’s office interfered in complaints about antisemitism. Eight former employees appeared on the programme to discuss the handling of complaints. The party denies the allegations and complained to the BBC about the programme.After the documentary aired last Monday, a Labour party spokesman insisted the whistleblowers featured are “disaffected former officials including those who have always opposed Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership.” He added: “Labour is taking decisive action against antisemitism, doubling the number of staff dedicated to dealing with complaints and cases. And since Jennie Formby became general secretary, the rate at which antisemitism cases have been dealt with has increased fourfold.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d6fb6d0880f4199cbc0eccd7a526ccb7a5c23b49/0_185_5454_3272/master/5454.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=520d3d6bc9236d822cc943b52f3f4210","title":"prime minister now embarrassing party guest outstayed her welcome","story":"Theresa May’s lack of self-awareness comes to the fore as she makes her final speech as PMAll that remains for Theresa May is her legacy. Such as it is. Being regarded as one of the worst ever prime ministers is something of a hollow crown, and for the past few weeks she has been visibly vanishing before our eyes. A flickering hologram at best. Now she enters rooms almost unnoticed, the embarrassing guest who has outstayed her welcome at a party that was over before it had even really begun. But still she rages against the dying of the light, determined to give one more speech to remind us all why she would so soon be completely forgotten.For her latest final valediction – no one can rule out further acts of self-destruction with final, final speeches – May had chosen a basement room of the international affairs thinktank Chatham House. She had also asked for five seats to be removed from the room, so that no sketch writers could witness her humiliation. Unfortunately no one had warned her it was to be televised. There’s going to be hell to pay when she finds out, for what followed was – even by her own standards – a complete car crash.Here was a speech of such staggering lack of self-awareness that the prime minister could only have been auditioning for a post-Downing Street job as her own Maybot tribute act. A secondhand toy of such limited artificial intelligence, its code wasn’t even written in binary. Just a babble of thoughts in noughts. She would have been more convincing if she had just remained silent for the entire 25 minutes.May began by taking us through some of the greatest hits of the last 30 years, pointing out that in many ways the world was a far better place now than it had ever been. It was just a shame that she hadn’t been able to resist the temptation of trying to make it a whole lot worse. An endeavour in which she had been almost wholly successful.She deplored the rise in populism, apparently oblivious to the fact that she had played a leading role in it. Demonising foreigners with Go Home vans in Operation Hostile Environment, pandering to the right wing of her own party and playing dumb when it suited her as judges were branded “enemies of the people” and remainer MPs were marked out as saboteurs.What was required was compromise, she added. This from the woman whose whole career had been characterised by an inability to compromise on anything. Whose negotiating red lines and determination to put her party first had brought the country to its knees. Who couldn’t even reach a compromise when her own deal had been voted down three times, because by then the battle lines were too well set. Who was so secretive she wouldn’t even let her shadow know what she was doing.Halfway through, many in the audience were beginning to wonder if this was all some kind of bad joke. That this was May’s belated attempt to prove she had a sense of humour.But it wasn’t. She actually believed every word, when all she had done was written a letter to her younger self about how she should have behaved if only she could have given herself another chance. A sliding doors moment. An unwitting piece of catharsis that should have been shared only with her therapist. An apologia for her real legacy of leaving the country in the hands of someone even more unfit to be prime minister than herself. A liar and a conman.May’s tragedy is that her unconscious self is only too aware of her failure and can’t help letting it leak out on every occasion. She’s desperate to be if not loved then at least respected, but everything she now touches turns to dust. An obsolete 1980s Amstrad computer incapable of even communicating with itself. A woman with the reverse Midas touch, who in trying to remind people of how right she was, only reinforces their knowledge of her limitations.As she had demonstrated earlier in the day when, with more than a little help from Jeremy Corbyn – whose own incompetence grows by the day – her failings had been given their now traditional airing at prime minister’s questions. “You’re an antisemite,” she had said. “And you’re an Islamophobe,” the Labour leader had countered. And this was it. Two people passing themselves off as leaders, refusing to take any responsibility for the racism in their own party because the other was just as bad.It was a moment of national shame. The only positive was that there was almost no one in the Commons to watch it. May’s airbrushing out of history is almost complete. If it weren’t for the imminent arrival of Boris Johnson, it can’t come quickly enough."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fec7b07a7575c33e2bc28cd1fb6d913695c4ad44/0_0_2419_1451/master/2419.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a5c8ae63d3b252ce40203edec4d1474b","title":"cricket world cup 10 fans countries review action","story":"Readers from around the world reflect on seven weeks of cricket and one astounding finalEngland’s run to the semi-finals, and indeed final, could not have been more quintessentially English. The team came into the tournament on a great run and hope was lifted to even greater heights with a few high-quality performances, only to be met with a crash back to traditional English cynicism when we almost inevitably lost to two tournament underdogs. From this point on though, they were exceptional, rising to the challenge of what essentially became four consecutive knockout games.What else can be said about the final? It was the best game of cricket I’ve witnessed and quite possibly the best of all time. The match had it all and England finally proved that they can stand up in those pressure moments in a knockout tournament. They had no small degree of luck and there was plenty of tension, but how else would you want to win your first Cricket World Cup?Let’s hope this group stays together for one more World Cup under the cool head of Eoin Morgan and a coach who will further develop this exciting brand of cricket. It would be easy to see this as the pinnacle, but how incredible would it be to push for an Australia-esque World Cup dynasty? Matt LeechWe delivered the greatest of World Cup finals. No other countries would have produced such a game. New Zealand always get stuck into games and regularly deliver some of the greatest cricketing spectacles. It’s such a shame we remain financially uninteresting for cricketing schedulers. Winning the World Cup might have changed that, but we are worthy runners-up.Jimmy Neesham was my player of the tournament. He plays hard and fearless, keeps going and has a mental toughness and mature outlook on life. He will have plenty of big moments in his career. Malcolm EddingtonIndia were like a critically acclaimed television show. After power-packed leading performances from neo-noir legend Rohit Sharma and the experimental yet highly engaging directorship from Jasprit Bumrah, most expected that pair, along with a strong supporting cast, to help India execute a stunning finale. But, despite bringing in the biggest viewing figures, the show was cancelled at the last moment by the executives at the World Cup – the notorious Kiwis.MS Dhoni was a fan favourite, but his personal style did not suit the overall tone of the crew. Rishabh Pant, a cult hero on the local soap opera, Indian Premier League, wasn’t ready for the biggest stage just yet. Surely, by the time the next big show comes around, he will be in the spotlight. Scriptwriter Virat Kohli was excellent but still did not meet his lofty standards and fluffed the ending. Cameos from Sir Ravindra Jadeja grabbed bits and pieces of the public imagination and an unexpected starring role during India’s final moments justified calls for his regular introduction to the set-up in the future. Abhijato SensarmaDespite the horrible thrashing in the semi-final, we performed above expectations. Six months ago I didn’t think we’d make it to the last four in some respects we got through because other sides failed to deliver.Mitchell Starc was our best performer. It was a shame he went AWOL in the last two matches. Alex Carey looked a class above most in his ball-striking and attitude. He was a real find. To play a great knock after being cleaned up by Jofra Archer really showed he has what it takes. The performances of Glenn Maxwell and Marcus Stoinis were really disappointing. The one innings where Maxwell looked really like to kick into gear was the one where Usman Khawaja ran him out horribly.The semi-final revealed all our weaknesses at once, which was a shame. Unfortunately our domestic one-day competition is now contained in a short period at the start of our season. It’s not enough for players to improve their skills in this format on the biggest international stage. Scott MeehanPakistan did well. Our performance would be viewed much more positively had we reached the semi-finals, but that’s how fine the margins are. The game against West Indies was very costly and some fans think the Sri Lanka washout was a missed opportunity. Although we have no one to blame but ourselves for not reaching the last four.After beating both the finalists in the group stage, it’s a shame we weren’t consistent enough elsewhere. We have a few special players coming through and they will surely help. Although fielding remains a problem. Awais AhmedWe were hot favourites to finish in the bottom two, yet finished sixth and may have qualified for the semis had we won our two washed-out matches. We have a bright talent in Avishka Fernando. In fact, we could have a fearsome batting unit in 2023. The bowling will be the real concern. We have to search hard for the next Malingas and Muralis. Malinga still has a role to play in four years’ time. We need his personality and experience in the team. And our former cricketers need to take part in building cricket from scratch. The current administration is useless. Akesh SamudithaIt took us four games to get a point on the board and we had to thank the English summer weather for that. South Africa paid the price for a terribly slow start, and highlights were few and far between. The AB De Villiers debate before the tournament obviously didn’t help.I’m hugely disappointed that we were so poor early on. The late wins against Sri Lanka and and Australia, were spoiled by the fact that there was so very little to play for. Wasting a successful 300+ run chase against Australia in a dead rubber hurts. Nils LouwAfter a great start to the tournament – beating South Africa and almost forcing a win against the Kiwis – the Tigers threatened to be the story of the World Cup, but it never quite happened. Instead the campaign ended in a whimper with damaging losses against both south Asian neighbours. The defeat to Pakistan was particularly disappointing given the historical context and the fact they were playing in front of a packed house at Lord’s. It was easily their worst performance of the tournament.In contrast, the stunning run chase against the Windies on the postage stamp-sized Taunton ground was the tournament highlight, reaching the target of 322 with such ease and with so many overs to spare. It gave fans genuine hope for a top-four finish. Had fine margins gone their way, a semi-final place would have been a reality.The team didn’t quite live up to its billing for the emotional Tiger fans. A feeling of the wheels coming off was compounded by the swift dismissal of coach Steve Rhodes long before England lifted the trophy.Giving player of the tournament to Kane Williamson was obviously a sympathy vote. Shakib Al Hasan was the true star of the World Cup. After spending a decade being the most underrated international cricketer in the most underrated international team, Shakib finally became a household name – for those households with Sky TV anyway. His consistency batting at No 3, often arriving at the crease early in the innings, and scoring at nearly a run a ball was staggering. Add to that tidy reliable off-spin and you have the complete package. Tawhid QureshiWe were terrible for most of it. Bowling Pakistan out for 105 in the first game got our hopes up, but there wasn’t enough thought into anything after that and we played out the tournament as a Chris Gayle testimonial tour. At least we beat a plucky Afghanistan side.The authorities must begin planning for the next World Cup immediately by investing in players who will be available solely for the longer version of the game. We have become champions of the T20 game, but the same players struggle in longer formats. T20 is hurting the quality of players in the longer versions. The problem remains that we have a very small pool of players. Glen DucreayIt was always going to be tough. Always. I’m disappointed we didn’t take any points but there were some competitive performances. Falling 11 runs short of beating India, and two balls from shocking Pakistan, were the best memories.Captain Mohammad Nabi had plenty to say before the tournament, but his inexperience showed in the field. I’ll be happy if we can progress tactically and learn from the experience of playing against the very best.

In the second quarter of England’s game against Trinidad and Tobago their starting goal shooter still managed to get the ball in the net even though a knock to her elbow had left her with a mostly numb hand.The sight of Dunn holding a wrist and shaking her fingers provided the only truly anxious moment as England returned from their day off to rack up a 72-46 win against Trinidad and Tobago that gold-plated their place in Saturday’s semi-finals – even if it was not their most sparkling performance here in Liverpool.“I knew we were going to come out a little bit flat today,” said the manager, Tracey Neville. “Some players got to play in positions they didn’t expect but I said before the tournament it’s about contributing in every position. I’m glad we came out with 70-odd goals and, although the performance wasn’t as clinical as we wanted, I didn’t expect that today.”Helen Housby was rested from the starting line-up but came on for Dunn six minutes into the second quarter, just as Trinidad and Tobago’s attack had begun to give England some trouble.Finishing the first quarter 20-12 down, the Calypso Girls scored five unanswered goals at the start of the second, as Housby took the unusual position of goal attack to Jo Harten’s goal shooter. With England’s lead reduced to three. their shooting pair then switched bibs to resume their usual combination and in the remaining period before half-time scored 15 goals to two.With the semi-finalists decided a full four days before they meet each other, the World Cup has entered a peculiar limbo. Dead rubbers decide final placings for the unsuccessful teams and England, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa use their games as chalkboard experiments while trying not to pick up injuries or lose momentum.But even as the results have lost meaning, the atmosphere in the arena is ratcheting up. Games begin with a dramatic light show and the teams now disappear at the end of their 15-minute warm-up – running out of one exit in order to reappear in the tunnel where they can be announced one at a time. The double-court set-up that ided the arena into two halves is gone and, with Escher-like impossibility, the single court that now runs lengthways across the floor now looks almost twice the size.Some deadly shooting gave Scotland a strong start against Jamaica, even if an upset was never on the cards. When they finished the first 15 minutes a goal up, it was the first time in history they had won a quarter against the world’s No 2 ranked team.Lynsey Gallagher did not miss a goal all game and worked the Jamaican defenders, including the brilliant Shamera Sterling, hard. Emma Barrie continued her excellent start to international netball, scoring 19 from 22.But with the injection of Adean Thomas at centre, Jamaica upped the pace and the return of Romelda Aiken alongside Jhaniele Fowler-Reid – both women at least half a head taller than their Scottish defenders – proved irresistible, as they scored 37 goals in the middle quarters.“We were hoping we might be able to surprise them a bit,” said the Scotland coach Gail Perata after Jamaica’s 67-36 win. “We couldn’t keep pace with them. The Jamaican team we know, the flair, the speed that they have, came out in the second and third quarters.” There was cause to be pleased with Scotland’s strong finish, and the final scoreline of 67-36 was their smallest-ever margin of defeat against Jamaica."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a656c3e1469fd01dae541c4792ead2bfb0ff2091/0_0_3027_1816/master/3027.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=637b03e089f59d73f13c46910089b7d3","title":"f1 regulations 2021 racing wow factor","story":"Formula One has revealed details on its proposed plans to improve the racing with new regulations for 2021 that are set to be officially confirmed in October. Ross Brawn, F1’s sporting director, has been leading the investigation of ways to reinvent the sport. The most detailed version of their vision, including an intent to bring back the “wow” factor, was unveiled on Wednesday.F1 revealed four categories on which it has been working: more raceable cars more competitive grids ensuring cars that are attractive and a financially viable championship. Of most interest to fans and drivers has long been the pursuit of cars that can follow one another more closely, enabling more overtaking, potentially without the artificial aid of DRS. Lewis Hamilton is among those to have called on F1 and the FIA to impose their proposals without allowing the teams to have a say.Recognising that fans wanted to see aesthetically pleasing cars racing, the FIA and F1 will work with an automotive stylist to attempt to ensure an attractive design is reflected in the regulations. Nicholas Tombazis, the FIA’s head of single-seater technical matters, said they wanted “a car that promotes a certain amount of passion and a ‘wow factor’”.After the last two rounds at the Red Bull Ring and Silverstone delivered superb racing, with drivers emphasising that it was the track layouts that promoted the competition, there has also been a commitment to analysing circuits to pursue a new philosophy of what F1 should do in track terms in future.In pursuing a more competitive grid, Brawn said the aerodynamic regulations would be more prescriptive, with the intent of preventing a team discovering a silver bullet that would give them a major advantage. They were also investigating putting more emphasis on the driver, with the removal of some driver aids, a reduction of telemetry and proposing that the drivers manage tyre wear and heating rather than relying on instruction from engineers.F1 has already agreed to impose a cost cap of $175m for 2021 but now also proposes the imposition of some standardised parts to further cut costs. They include wheel rims, brakes, radiators and pit equipment, alongside a ban on hydraulic suspension systems."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/200e8469ba0c25427484a9cd750b08ca3e8e4e36/0_121_5020_3013/master/5020.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f009e0e9f7017ffff8c71c548d960fe6","title":"hossein ensan world series of poker champion 2019","story":"Germany’s Hossein Ensan outlasted Italy’s Dario Sammartino and Canada’s Alex Livingston to claim the $10m title early on Wednesday at the 50th World Series of Poker Main Event in Las Vegas.The 55-year-old, who was born in Iran but moved to Germany 30 years ago, became the oldest world poker champion in 20 years when he finished off Sammartino after nearly eight hours of play at the final table.

If that claim appears to ignore the worldwide reverberations as Woods won this year’s Masters, the size of that epic achievement appears to have temporarily blunted the 15-times major winner’s edge. Woods’s Open buildup has been silent, an apparent consequence of realising that scaling mountains for a second time comes at psychological cost. It would be a shock were Woods to win a fourth Claret Jug at a course he remains so unfamiliar with.The notion that Koepka cannot perform at the seaside is scoffed at by those closest to him. In Ricky Elliott, a Portrush native, the American has a caddie more akin to the site’s vagaries than most. However unsatisfactory it may be, there is a huge element of luck with regards to the draw even before erratic links bounces are considered. Predictions are a fools errand.It may seem unfairly trivial to point out the importance of birdies and bogeys replacing bullets and bomb scares in the local vernacular. Yet Northern Ireland’s fractious history is intrinsically linked to why this event is so momentous. Even 20 years ago any concept of the oldest major crossing the Irish Sea would have been laughed out of court. The Good Friday Agreement of 1998 proved a line in the sand after decades of bloodshed but elements of trepidation from outsiders remained.It is wholly appropriate that golf will deliver the grandest sporting spectacle the island of Ireland has ever staged. The sport was never defined by north or south. This Open will return the second-biggest attendance in its history, at more than 237,000. More pertinently a huge global television audience is anticipated. The normalisation of Northern Ireland as a tourist venue and sporting stage is worthy of celebration.The top-level victories of McIlroy, Graeme McDowell, Darren Clarke and Padraig Harrington precipitated pro-Portrush lobbying towards the R\u0026ampA – then headed by Peter Dawson – which proved impossible to ignore.“It started off as a joke – why can’t we go back to Portrush?” McDowell said. “Myself and Darren and Rory, especially. And the reasons were: infrastructure, this and that and the other.“When the ball really started to get rolling was when Padraig won his three majors. Then I won and Rory and Darren picked up a major each, as well. The jokes turned kind of serious.“At the Irish Open in 2012 we broke the European Tour attendance record. The R\u0026ampA couldn’t ignore the fact that this could be a commercial success. The jokes became very serious. It was like: ‘We can do this, we can pull it off.’”To the immense credit of those involved, including the now-retired Dawson, here we are.To insist new beginnings have completely eradicated deep isions would be gross exaggeration but then, there has been quite a bit of that. Irish ability to self-promote is recurring as it is admirable. The Dunluce links is a fantastic piece of land on a stunning coastline. This also applies to Turnberry. Muirfield, St Andrews, Royal Birkdale, Carnoustie and Royal Lytham \u0026amp St Annes can lay legitimate claim to be superior courses. Portrush does not tend to rate as the finest course in Northern Ireland, with Royal County Down afforded higher status.“Coleraine Supports Soldier F,” booms a banner adjacent to the railway station in the town six miles from here, backing the paratrooper facing murder charges over Bloody Sunday. The horrendous tragedy that befell Lyra McKee in Derry occurred as the golf world was still giddy from Woods’s heroics at Augusta National. Any spirit of widespread cooperation, as is necessary when fluttering eyelids towards the R\u0026ampA, is rather undermined by the fact the Northern Ireland Assembly has been suspended since early 2017.Portrush has definite potential to prove one of the Open’s more exciting backdrops. Risk-reward features heavily, especially on the closing stretch. The ease with which two new holes – the 7th and 8th – fit into the landscape is an architectural phenomenon.Max Faulkner collected £300 for his 1951 triumph here. There will not be much change out of that from a day at the Open now. To Portrush and its people, however, the entire scene is priceless."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/88d3251cb182a33e9c259f270b134dd65b44953d/0_76_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d4c93436d8e159baefc1c9ab5d71f92b","title":"portrush march open championship martin slumbers golf","story":"• Martin Slumbers: ‘Our job is to respect fact that we are guests’• Tourist firm owner says march an ‘unnecessary provocation’The R\u0026ampA has refused to condemn a “celebration of marching bands” which is staging a three-hour show in Portrush on Saturday before marching to an Orange hall.Much has been made of the inclusive nature of this Open championship, which is the first to be held in Northern Ireland since 1951 because of the political and religious troubles. But when the  asked Martin Slumbers, the chief executive of the R\u0026ampA, whether he felt uneasy that a parade of marching bands including the Sons of Ulster would send the wrong message, he sidestepped the question – and pointed out that there were always things going on around the tournament that were “wonderful”.“We are very conscious that the Open comes to town once every X years,” said Slumbers. “We are very conscious that we are guests here. We’re guests every year at the place we go. As guests we are very conscious that we want to be part of the community. But we will be gone in a couple of weeks. And so we want to live with the community. And every year since I’ve been here, there’s always things on around the golf. And that’s wonderful. And the community carries on. Our job is to put on the Open Championship and to respect the fact that we are guests.”However, the march was criticised by Conn Connolly, owner of the tourist firm Real Irish Golf, who called it an “unnecessary provocation”. He said: “Broadly my view would be that the Open coming to Portrush is a celebration of the fact that Northern Ireland has changed in ways we all know over 20 years.“In many ways it is coming because sectarianism on both sides has wilted and we have moved on. For me it’s an unnecessary provocation to have an Orange parade right in the middle of this. 12 July was last week. This is sticking a finger in the eye of the people who had brought this to Portrush.”Meanwhile Slumbers has hinted the R\u0026ampA may rename the Women’s British Open the Women’s Open Championship when it takes full control of the event next year. “That’s something we are considering very carefully,” he said. “We’ll be announcing something in due course.”However he was less forthcoming when asked whether he could foresee a time where there will be equal prize money between men and women. “To build the economics of the Women’s British Open, to be able to keep raising the prize money, we need to do it as a sustainable business model,” he added."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b6e0e47d20e9e6715d71531090ed198744860f24/0_195_2921_1752/master/2921.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=036fb4b95579f71cd375a3464c7d176a","title":"england cricket world cup pinnacle politics","story":"“I’m not sure anyone at the moment has a steady heart … Seven weeks of cricket, 48 games, one ball. Here’s Boult, they’re going to push, are we in for a super over? They’ve got to go quick, they’ve got to go quick. OUT! I’m sure he’s OUT! We’re going for a super over!”The ICC montage of the last moments of the Cricket World Cup final has almost four million views – which isn’t that impressive considering three million of them are mine. Ian Smith’s commentary, in that gravelly Kiwi drawl, is spine tingling to the last second.“This is the moment. It’s Archer to Guptill. Two to win. Guptill’s going to push for two. They’ve got to go … The throw’s got to go to the keeper’s end … he’s got it! England have won the World Cup! By the barest of margins … BY THE BAREST OF ALL MARGINS … absolute ecstasy for England. Agony, agony for New Zealand.”And there is sport. Right there. The reason you turn to these back pages before the boring but important stuff at the front. I literally cannot stop thinking about that final ball. It’s almost too much for those of us who don’t play elite sport to comprehend. Everyone on that pitch at that moment is at the pinnacle of their sport. They have trained for years for this moment.Jofra Archer is in the game. Martin Guptill is in the game. Jos Buttler is in the game. Jimmy Neesham knows he has to run as fast as he can for 44 yards. Everyone else is just waiting. Will any of what transpires be in their control? I can’t stop thinking about Jason Roy. The ball is hurtling towards him off Guptill’s bat, two balls after a misfield which probably cost a run out. Every time I watch it I worry he might not gather the ball cleanly, or fall over, or get cramp in both legs and just collapse – it happened to me once clean through in the last minute of a Sunday League football match.Then I worry about the throw. It could be wild, high, to the wrong end, right on the bounce or just straight through the square. I asked Darren Gough on TalkSport this week if he would have wanted the ball to come to him at that moment – the chance to be one of the heroes, to be part of a clip to be repeated on loop until the end of cricket. A beaming grin crossed Goughie’s face, as it often does. “I said to my kids as Archer was running up to bowl: ‘Whatever you do don’t hit that ball at me’ – every other fielder, every single one, would have been delighted when that ball went to Roy.” Even then I can’t relax – I check the montage again – what if Jos Buttler doesn’t take it cleanly, or treads on the stumps? I know he’s practised this. I know it’s regulation. And more pertinently, I know it’s already happened – it’s been set to music. Even still I’d like to check Guptill definitely hasn’t made his ground.There was nothing that could take away from this moment. But then there was. Jacob Rees-Mogg. I was enraged by his attempt to politicise England’s victory with an idiotic nonsensical tweet about not needing Europe to win. At a time when a ided nation comes together for one tiny moment, why try to score political points?I had my say on the radio – basically repeating many other more eloquent critiques. It was brave because he wasn’t there. You can see the two minutes online – where I play the role of a poor man’s James O’Brien – listing the reasons why it’s stupid, before explaining that I love this team precisely because they represent the England I know – erse, different, interesting – as Moeen Ali articulated so well Monday.The below the line comments were, in the main, surprisingly positive – plenty of “well said” and “spot on” to the equally supportive if slightly less helpful “imagine the absolute lake of gammon and white van man piss he’d have boiled when he said this on air”.At the same time I was told to “give it a rest mate. Making a mountain out of a molehill just to show how PC you are is very boring”, while of course receiving many “Don’t mix politics and sport” and the mandatory “Max Rushden is a left-wing nonce though”.The conflict of politics and sport is a frustrating one. We want it to be pure. It felt pure on Sunday. We don’t want them to overlap, even if we know they do. Of course the players had to be invited to Downing Street. There’s precedent. What if they hadn’t been? Although I do wonder if Theresa May quickly hid the Windrush file in a pot plant as Archer walked in to the drawing room. And perhaps I’m as guilty as Rees-Mogg. I criticised him for politicising a moment none of us wanted to be political. Yet my response was and still is politically charged. Another response was slightly more provocative: “You guys creamed your pants when Meghan or whatever her name is politicised sport but now don’t like it when Moggy talks about it. Have a consistent standard you cunts.”At this point I turned off my notifications because I want to put my head in the sand, just for a little while, to enjoy an incredible contest that neither side deserved to lose. New Zealand certainly didn’t. And though winning matters because sport needs someone to hold the trophy, it also doesn’t matter at all. That’s why it’s in the sports pages, and not the boring but important bit at the front of the paper. The Kiwis’ humility and humour in defeat, led by Kane Williamson, was maybe the most impressive part of all of this.Nasser Hussain’s assessment of the New Zealand skipper nails it. “You end careers with wins and statistics and what you won but you also end your career with what sort of bloke were you, how did you play that game, and the way Kane Williamson carried himself – there are so many things that went against the Kiwis, and yet their skipper stood there at the end and did not make any excuses, what a man he is.”If there is a conclusion to any of this, it’s that I’d rather be Kane Williamson than Jacob Rees-Mogg."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0366fc0dbe0b0f5532b3b1d6bf1ccd55c0258b31/0_0_4400_2933/master/4400.jpg?width=720\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=6cd4f68ec6b973abf99f8177c5d0268d 1440w","title":"faceapp denies storing users photographs without permission","story":"App was launched by Russian developer in 2017 and uses AI to change people’s featuresThe developer of a popular app which transforms users’ faces to predict how they will look as older people has insisted they are not accessing users’ photographs without permission.FaceApp, which was launched by a Russian developer in 2017, uses artificial intelligence allowing people to see how they would look with different hair colour, eye colour or as a different gender.The app has topped download charts again this week, after users homed in on its ageing filter, which has since been used by dozens of celebrities and prominent figures to picture how they will supposedly look in several decades’ time.This surge of interest has in turn created concerns that FaceApp is systematically harvesting users’ images. People who upload their image to the app transfer the picture to a server controlled by the developer, with the photograph processing done remotely, rather than on their phone.These concerns have been heightened by growing awareness of online privacy issues in recent years and the fact that the developer is based in Russia, where many high-profile online misinformation campaigns have been based, in addition to a loosely-phrased privacy policy.The FaceApp CEO, Yaroslav Goncharov, said only a single picture specifically chosen by the user would be uploaded from a phone and the app did not harvest a user’s entire photo library, a claim backed by security researchers.He said the data was never transferred to Russia and was instead stored on US-controlled cloud computing services provided by Amazon and Google. “FaceApp performs most of the photo processing in the cloud. We only upload a photo selected by a user for editing. We never transfer any other images from the phone to the cloud.”The developer insisted that users had the right to request for their photographs to be removed from the server. “We might store an uploaded picture in the cloud. The main reason for that is performance and traffic: we want to make sure that the user doesn’t upload the photo repeatedly for every edit operation. Most images are deleted from our servers within 48 hours from the upload date.”Goncharov said his company did not sell or share any user data with any third parties, and that most features were available without logging in – meaning the app does not have a large amount of data it can sell on inidual users.However, users ultimately have to rely on the word of the developer that the images are being removed from the system.FaceApp’s has previously received attention for the ethics of some of its filters. In April 2017 the app’s makers apologised for a feature that whitened people’s faces when they selected the “hot” filter, leading to accusations that it considered lighter skin to be synonymous with attractiveness. The developers said this was due to a flaw in the underlying neural network, which was skewed towards Caucasian faces.Later that year the app pulled a different filter which allowed users to see how they would look if they were a different race, after it was accused of promoting “digital blackface”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a2344b3bad466f6e661ba120040e9929406309c4/0_32_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=964ec158c5844655effc765ca7eae5a5","title":"facebook libra cryptocurrency congress","story":"House members challenge company over its plans to protect data and question its goals in latest clash on Capitol HillFacebook once again faced intense questioning from US lawmakers over the future launch of its cryptocurrency project Libra, in a combative hearing that highlighted deep skepticism over the tech firm’s possibly entering the banking world following a slew of privacy scandals.Members of the US House financial services committee grilled the Facebook executive David Marcus for more than five hours on Wednesday, asking him how the company plans to protect user data, challenging its purported goals of bringing banking services to underserved populations, and demanding more accountability to regulatory bodies.The hearing came after senators questioned Facebook on Tuesday about similar matters. Though some members praised the company for taking steps to innovate, the tone of the hearing was overwhelmingly hostile, and it was clear Facebook does not yet have a clear path to Libra’s launch.“I don’t think you should launch Libra at all,” the Democratic representative Carolyn Maloney told Marcus, arguing that the creation of a currency was a core government function that should be left to democratically accountable institutions. Representative Brad Sherman of California said that if successful, Libra could be “one of the biggest things this committee will deal with this decade” and questioned why Marcus appeared in Congress in place of the chief executive officer, Mark Zuckerberg, given the potential magnitude of the project.Lawmakers zeroed in on privacy and other concerns surrounding the project on Wednesday, questioning why Facebook would base the body overseeing the cryptocurrency in Switzerland, out of reach of US legislators.Facebook repeatedly stressed it would work with regulators to ensure users’ privacy, but as of Tuesday, the Swiss regulatory body responsible for its regulation had not heard from the company, it said.Other lawmakers challenged the characterizing of the Libra Association, a collective of dozens of companies that contributed millions of dollars to Libra ahead of its launch, as a not-for-profit organization.Multiple members asked how Facebook and the companies in the association, which include Uber, Lyft, MasterCard and Paypal, would profit from the currency. The New York Democrat Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said Libra constitutes “a currency controlled by an undemocratically selected coalition of largely massive corporations”.Marcus said the companies joined the association because the “status quo is not working for too many people, and that people deserve better”.“People deserve lower cost, and they deserve a lower barrier of entry to digital money,” he said, adding that ultimately, Facebook would profit from an increase in activity linked to small businesses on the platform.The Missouri representative Ann Wagner asked how Facebook would launch a global currency without undermining the power of the US dollar, or destabilizing the global economy.“I’m concerned that a 2020 launch date demonstrates deep insensitivities around how Libra could impact our national security, the global financial system, the privacy of people across the globe, criminal activity and international human rights,” she said.Marcus repeatedly said “we do not want to compete with the dollar” but also said “we want Libra to be a digital global currency” and “one unit of digital currency for the whole world”.He suggested that because the coin would initially be backed by financial holdings, more than half of which would be US dollars, the currency was less at risk of affecting existing currency values.Some lawmakers could not resist the opportunity to bring up conservatives’ longstanding claims of bias on the platforms. Representative Steve Stivers of Ohio asked if the Libra Association would exclude companies or users with conservative social views.Others pressed Marcus on Facebook’s past privacy violations and wondered whether the company would bar hate groups from using the currency. “Personally, I believe that we shouldn’t be in the business of ... deciding what people can do with their money or not,” Marcus said. “But that being said, this is an important question, and we need to be thoughtful about the policy.In one exchange, Sherman connected Libra’s launch to the terrorist attacks of 911.“We have been told by some that innovation is always good,” Sherman said. “The most innovative thing that happened this century is when Osama Bin Laden came up with the innovative idea of flying two airplanes into towers.”The hearing on Wednesday came days after the Federal Trade Commission handed Facebook the largest fine ever levied against a technology company, ordering the company to pay $5bn for privacy violations in the Cambridge Analytica scandal.Critics say the fine will hardly make a dent for Facebook, which had more than $15bn in revenue in the first three months of 2019.As Facebook attempts to launch Libra, the House financial services committee is considering legislation called the Keep Big Tech Out Of Finance Act, which would prohibit tech companies with at least $25bn in revenue, such as Facebook, from issuing digital currencies."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4f237ebad83038a6bad5935f35a776a8028da3c4/0_109_3300_1980/master/3300.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c109570b99853b96241bb64772302847","title":"send tip off the tourist trail europe twin 200 pound hotel voucher","story":"You might know a hidden-but-wonderful village, town, historic site, landscape or beach.

If there is one quality the European commission’s first female president shares with her mentor Angela Merkel, it is that her political persuasions can be difficult to classify. Unlike Germany’s consensus-seeking chancellor, however, she is not afraid to raise hackles and ide opinion to drive through the policies she believes are right.Born in October 1958, Ursula Gertrud von der Leyen spent her first 13 years in Brussels, where her father was one of the first pan-European civil servants. She attended the European School in Uccle, graduating two years before a certain Alexander Boris de Pfeffel Johnson joined the same establishment.One of seven children, she was raised in a Christian household that adhered to the traditional model of the West German nuclear family. As state premier of Lower Saxony, her father, Ernst Albrecht, became a leading figure of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and a bete noire for the burgeoning Green movement, with whom he clashed over the opening of a nuclear waste depository.Her mother, Heidi, took a supporting role, at times leading a family choir that serenaded its patriarch on German TV shows, and stating: “The best way for me to gain the respect of the public is through the role of motherliness.”But if her father’s career enabled her international upbringing, it also allowed Von der Leyen to step out from his shadow.When she was studying economics at the University of Göttingen in the late 1970s, her father was informed that his family could be a potential target for the Red Army Faction, a terrorist group also known as the Baader-Meinhof gang, and that his daughter should consider moving to another university.Von der Leyen adopted the pseudonym Rose Ladson – a combination of her family nickname and the surname of her American great-grandmother – and enrolled at the London School of Economics.“I lived much more than I studied,” she told the weekly Zeit. “No details, please. Only this: in 1978 I immersed myself for one year in this seething, international, colourful city. For me, coming from the rather monotonous, white Germany, that was fascinating.“For me, London was the epitome of modernity: freedom, the joy of life, trying everything. This gave me an inner freedom that I have kept until today. And another thing I have kept: the realisation that different cultures can get on together very well.”Switching to study medicine, she later worked as an assistant physician at a women’s clinic in Hanover and graduated as a doctor of medicine in 1991.After she joined the CDU in 1990, on the same day her father stepped down from his job as state premier, her inner freedom made its mark on the posts she held, first as a regional and national delegate and then at the family, work and defence ministries.“She has an incredible amount of energy”, said Daniel Goffart, a political correspondent for the news magazine Focus who co-wrote her biography in 2015. “You especially saw that in her bitter and protracted battle to modernise her party’s view on the role of the family.”Under her watch, Germany introduced a law guaranteeing every child over 12 months of age a place at a daycare facility, and a paid parental leave scheme that includes at least two months of paid leave for fathers. She forced Merkel to drop her opposition to boardroom quotas for women, even though the policy was later defeated in the Bundestag.Married since 1986 to a physician, Heiko, and mother to seven children, Von der Leyen has juggled a prolific career with family life – at the cost of popularity within her own party, some say. Instead of attending CDU summer fetes in rural Lower Saxony, said her biographer Goffart, she preferred to spend weekends at the family home in Beinhorn near Hanover when her children were still young.Among her critics, the 60-year-old Von der Leyen has a reputation as an Einzelgängerin, a lone wolf with an instinct for front page-grabbing interviews and photo ops, but lacking the gift to pass the inner freedom driving her career down to the teams she works with.If Von der Leyen’s approval ratings have recently plummeted, making her the least popular minister in Merkel’s cabinet, it is because her handling of Germany’s notoriously under-funded military at times displayed those same deficiencies.When she diagnosed the troops with an “attitude problem” after the emergence of stories about rightwing extremist activities and hazing of new recruits, she was accused – and not only by members of the Bundeswehr – of choosing a good write-up over loyalty to her staff. “If she has a weakness, it is her tendency to excessive stage management,” said Goffart.More recently, Von der Leyen grabbed negative headlines over the accusation that her defence ministry had allocated over-inflated contracts worth hundreds of millions of euros to external consultants. A parliamentary committee is investigating the ministry for accusations of nepotism, and Von der Leyen is expected to be invited as a witness in December. In Brussels and Berlin, she will have two stages to manage.• This article was amended on 17 July 2019. An earlier version said Ursula von der Leyen is not afraid to raise heckles, rather than hackles."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d9dec6c6c078851091df573748524c5351c67113/0_0_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d6d3aeefc05ba010d645f0d9ce247605","title":"drc ebola epidemic is international emergency says who","story":"Organisation calls for more funds as 2,512 cases are confirmed in the regionThe Ebola epidemic in the Democratic Republic of the Congo is a public health emergency of international concern, the World Health Organization has declared, calling for more funds and support to close it down.The second biggest Ebola outbreak ever, after the 2014-16 epidemic in west Africa, has reached a critical point with the diagnosis of a case in Goma, a city of 2 million people, which is a transport hub on the border with Rwanda. That follows the case last week of a women who crossed into Uganda to buy fish – and the arrival of a family harbouring the virus, three of whom died, in Uganda last month.Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the WHO director general, appealed on Wednesday for the international community to help with funds. WHO is working on a new plan to control the epidemic, he said, which would cost “hundred of millions” of dollars.“It is time for the world to take notice and redouble our efforts. We need to work together in solidarity with the DRC to end this outbreak and build a better health system,” said Tedros.“Extraordinary work has been done for almost a year under the most difficult circumstances. We all owe it to these responders – coming from not just WHO but also government, partners and communities – to shoulder more of the burden.”He has made previous appeals for donors to provide the money they have promised. So far, only about half the pledges have come in. The WHO was not aware of any donor who has withheld funding because an emergency had not been declared, he said, “but if that was the excuse, it can no longer be used”.Tedros appealed for countries not to seal their borders or close down travel to the DRC, arguing that it would only harm the attempts to end the epidemic.One year on from the start of the epidemic in North Kivu, there have been 2,512 cases of the disease and 676 deaths, most of which have been confirmed.This is the second biggest Ebola outbreak, after the west Africa epidemic, where 28,616 cases of disease and 11,310 deaths were reported in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone between 2014 and 2016.The WHO is not only alarmed about the arrival of the virus in Uganda and on the Rwandan border, but also by the flare-up again in Beni. “The geographical expansion is now 500km,” said Prof Robert Steffen, chair of the IHR emergency committee on Ebola in DRC, as he announced their advice to Tedros.The WHO’s declaration was widely applauded by Ebola experts and the aid organisations struggling with the epidemic on the ground.“This is perhaps the most complicated epidemic the world has ever had to face, yet still the response in the DRC remains overstretched and underfunded,” said Dr Josie Golding, epidemics lead at Wellcome. “A step-up in the response, led by the DRC and with full international support, is critical if we are to bring the epidemic to an end. This must include enhanced diplomatic, public health, security and logistic efforts as well as releasing much needed financial resources.”Larry Gostin, the director of the O’Neill Institute in Washington DC and an expert on global health law, said the announcement gave the clearest possible signal that the WHO needs more financial and human resources. “Without a surge response, it will be impossible to bring the DRC Ebola epidemic under control.”He called for bold action. “Standard strategies like case identification, vaccination and treatment can’t succeed in a complex humanitarian crisis like the situation in the DRC. Responders in the field are facing intense violence along with deep community mistrust. They often can’t get into the hot zone due to escalating violence and they can’t find cases to vaccinate and treat because families are hiding the sick. There has been no clear strategy to break the vicious cycle of disease, violence and distrust.”The status quo is no longer tenable, Gostin said. “The complacency in the international community, including the United States, is crippling the response.”The British Red Cross, Mercy Corps and World Vision, all of which are working on the ground, said they hoped the declaration would lead to a significant scale-up in the response. “A huge push and significant funding across the region are now required to contain this outbreak and bring it to an end. Otherwise, there is a real risk we will see a catastrophic spread of this deadly virus,” said Sarah Clayton-Fisher of the British Red Cross.The possible arrival of the virus in Goma has long been feared by the agencies responding to the outbreak, because of its density and the movement of people through it to Rwanda.“Ring” vaccination of the contacts of those who fall ill and their contacts has not succeeded in limiting the spread of the virus. There is mistrust of the vaccine. Some people falsely believe that the vaccine is what is making people sick, in part because it cannot protect anyone who is already infected when they have the shot. It is also very hard to track and trace the friends and relatives of the sick in areas where violent conflict is taking place.“If we cannot contain Ebola at the epicentre, we will continue to see cases spread to metropolitan areas and across borders,” said Bob Kitchen, International Rescue Committee’s vice-president for emergencies.“The inability to build community trust has proven a major barrier to stopping the spread of this disease. Local communities are perplexed and frustrated by continued increase in the number of people dying juxtaposed with a massive influx of international organisations into the region during the past year.”There have been four declarations of public health emergencies since 2005, when the WHO’s new regulations were introduced: swine flu in 2009, polio in 2014, when there was a resurgence after near-eradication, Ebola in west Africa in 2014 and the Zika virus in Brazil in 2016."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9f7ae870ee6b47663973c5b30ed7231fa7580d27/0_0_4399_2640/master/4399.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=03f498b48170c9272a18bb7571e11c5d","title":"eu nations to be vetted on their adherence to the rule of law","story":"Policy comes as incoming president seeks to tackle claims she would be beholden to Poland and HungaryEU nations are to be vetted annually on their adherence to the rule of law, in a renewed attempt from Brussels to stop governments from firing independent judges and packing courts with pliable supporters.In an effort to stop democratic backsliding, all EU countries will be subject to annual monitoring on the rule of law, the European commission announced on Wednesday, one day after its incoming president, Ursula von der Leyen, sought to assuage critics of her appointment with a pledge to uphold democratic values.Elected with a wafer-thin majority, Von der Leyen, said she fully supported an “EU-wide rule-of-law mechanism”, as she sought to tackle accusations she would be beholden to nationalist governments in Poland and Hungary that supported her surprise elevation to the top job.Hungary is also facing the EU’s most serious disciplinary procedure since the European parliament declared a “systematic threat” to the rule of law in 2018, although the process has languished in the EU’s council of ministers.Timmermans announced the commission would publish an annual rule-of-law report, which would cover all member states to help detect “emerging rule-of-law problems wherever they appear”.Germany and Belgium made a similar proposal in March, in order to counter the accusation that central and eastern European countries were being unfairly targeted. “The EU’s role in this area must be objective and treat all member states alike,” says the paper that will be discussed by EU ministers on Thursday.The commission is embroiled in an unprecedented legal battle with Poland over the integrity of Polish courts, which led to last month’s landmark European court of justice ruling that Warsaw’s decision to lower the retirement age of judges was unlawful.Since coming to power in 2015, Law and Justice has argued that far-reaching changes to the judiciary are required to remove judges who served during the communist era.In a separate move, the commission announced the next step in another legal case against Poland on a law that allows judges to be subject to disciplinary charges over their rulings, a measure denounced as having a “chilling” effect on judicial independence.The commission said on Wednesday it would take the Polish government to court if Warsaw did not act to change the disciplinary regime within two months.That deadline falls before the arrival of Von der Leyen, who is scheduled to take office on 1 November.The first-ever female commission president was criticised by some Socialists and Greens, who claimed she would be a weak defender of the rule of law.Law and Justice’s backing of Von der Leyen’s nomination fanned that idea, with the party’s official Twitter account quoting the Polish prime minster, Mateusz Morawiecki, describing her as a good candidate to work out compromises.An EU source said the strengthened approach had been embraced by Von der Leyen, adding: “If anything we are trying to tighten the net, not make it looser.”Von der Leyen told MEPs that the commission would “always be an independent  of the treaties. Lady Justice is blind – she will defend the rule of law wherever it is attacked.”She emerged as a compromise candidate after Poland and Hungary led opposition to Timmermans, a Dutch socialist, who ran in a pan-European campaign to replace Jean-Claude Juncker.In a statement Timmermans said the rule of law had “come under attack in several ways” in the past five years, without naming specific countries. “The European commission has been fighting hard to resist these attacks with the tools available to us, and will continue to do so. Today we have decided to further strengthen our toolbox, to promote, protect and enforce the rule of law.”Von der Leyen has revealed little of how she intends to handle upcoming negotiations on the EU’s seven-year budget, with some member states wanting to tie EU funding to the rule of law, a measure that could hit Poland, a net beneficiary of European money."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/01354784c6b62aa195db3a4ec31d7c125d9769fb/708_449_4908_2945/master/4908.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=91e5e7a5da0b5caebbcf6c7570dc74e6","title":"g7 leaders to back tech revolution for african women","story":"Leaders to back Gates Foundation call to help rural poor and women access mobile bankingWorld leaders are to pledge to shape the technological revolution sweeping through Africa by acting to lift the threat of 400 million predominantly rural women being excluded from digital financial services.G7 finance ministers meeting in France are to endorse a paper from the Gates Foundation saying there is a serious risk that digital technology and mobile banking will bypass millions of women in Africa, leaving them disempowered for a generation.The initiative, requiring $255m (£205m) in initial funding and regulatory action across Africa,is designed to prevent “the inequalities of the past being insinuated into the future” as cultural and market barriers lead to women being excluded from mobile banking, e-commerce and smartphone technology.Speaking to the  before addressing finance ministers on Thursday, Melinda Gates, co-founder of the world’s largest private charitable organisation, argued that the G7 should not see digital inclusion as a small step but comparable with its past efforts to address malaria or debt.“Digital financial services is not a lever we had 15 years ago. We have it now. Yet the mobile phone operators are going to pick off the low-hanging fruit, the middle class,” she said. “They are not going to go the extra mile to help the poor or women. We are already seeing these gaps that are going to set back women’s empowerment.“We know from good research that when a woman has her own digital financial bank account, she often moves from the informal farming sector to the formal entrepreneurial sector. When they have assets in their hands, women often invest differently from their husbands. They invest in health and their kids’ education. When women are empowered, economies are lifted out of poverty.“Yet too many women are stuck in the era of the moneylender and the forced chicken sale.”The Gates Foundation argues that as the technology revolution is only just taking root in Africa, the opportunity still exists to shape a modern financial system from its foundations to include and empower everyone.“The old financial system was built to exclude. It excluded the poor, whose transactions were too small to matter. It excluded the rural, who lived too far away from bank branches. It excluded women, whose husbands were supposed to make the decisions,” Gates wrote in the paper to the G7. “It is very hard to retrofit an exclusive system to be inclusive.”Barriers that need addressing include the extent of mobile phone coverage, the inter-operability of technology, proof of identity, regulation and laws that exclude women.Bruno Le Maire, the French finance minister and host of the G7, said all these reforms needed backing. “Giving women access to a bank account is key to faster growth in the poorest countries. Our theme at the G7 is addressing inequalities, and this helps,” he said.Although by the end of 2018 nearly 250 million Africans subscribe to the mobile internet, more than three-quarters – 750 million – were still offline, including more than 400 million people for whom there is no mobile broadband.One of the key historic barriers to financial inclusion identified in the report is the relatively primitive type of mobile banking system that only allows money to be transferred between users of the same mobile service.As a result, the majority of digital transactions are still peer-to-peer money transfers within the same network.This means, the report says, “a healthcare worker who receives her wages in a closed-loop mobile money account is likely to withdraw funds in cash – often travelling long distances and incurring fees – to buy food for her family, pay her bills, and send money to her son who lives in a neighbouring country”.The report also suggests difficulties need to be overcome to ensure secure proof of identification, an issue the UK chancellor, Philip Hammond, will highlight at the G7 by offering £15m to help fund a World Bank initiative on secure ID systems.Cultural or religious resistance to women’s financial independence is a further barrier, the report says. In Cameroon, Chad, Gabon and Niger formal regulations exist that prevent women from opening a bank account in the same way as men. “All countries have reasons culturally or historically to hold women back,” Gates said. “It takes forward-thinking people at the top and at the grassroots to lead change.”The Gates team believes the digital revolution is not so advanced in Africa that the emerging inequalities are irreversible. Nearly half of people in sub-Saharan Africa who are paid a salary receive their wages in cash, and less than a third pay utility bills through an account.The potential future scale of the transformation is startling. The consultants McKinsey estimate that by 2025 digital financial services could allow 1.6 billion people worldwide to enter the formal economy and could add $3.7tn to the annual GDP of emerging markets.Digital financial inclusion could create nearly 95m new jobs and provide up to $2.1tn in loans for iniduals to start businesses."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Fianna F\u0026aacuteil leader says next British prime minister must deal with existing Brexit dealSenator Mark Daly says Government must establish second New Ireland ForumAdoption Authority has identified 160 potential locations where files are being heldLegislation paving way for abortion will have \u0026lsquodevastating impact\u0026rsquo on rights of unbornThames Water\u0026rsquos plant is one renewable but costly model for \u0026lsquowater-stressed\u0026rsquo regionsUtility will notify customers who appear to be consuming water services excessivelyEnactment of Varadkar pledge likely to be very complex, tax strategy group saysGovernment urged to postpone poll and focus on Britain\u0026rsquos impending exit from EUChanges by councillors to allow developments on Valentia and Cahersiveen criticisedAt Explorium, Dublin\u0026rsquos marvellous sports and science centre, children can\u0026rsquot avoid learning \u0026ndash try as they mightSr Berchmans awarded Benedict Medal for her education efforts in PakistanUS lawyers representing Irishman make last-ditch plea for leniency to US authoritiesOwen O\u0026rsquoRourke \u0026lsquoone of the main suppliers of cannabis to the town of Killarney\u0026rsquo, judge saidMan in his early 30s recovering following suicide attempt in Cork courthouse toiletPractices uncovered in RT\u0026Eacute Investigates amounted to \u0026lsquosubsidised cruelty\u0026rsquoDetails of case \u0026lsquoso gross\u0026rsquo that public were excluded from courtroom by judgeMinister says there are no plans for a redundancy scheme in the HSEWalkway at Dunquin Pier mistaken for road and not for the first time"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3959531.1563383252!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"how israel used desalination to address its water shortage","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tGranot desalination plant: The process works by pushing saltwater into membranes containing microscopic pores. Photograph:  Mekorot water companyWater scarcity, heightened by periods of prolonged drought, fuels tensions across the Middle East.Access to water is a major concern throughout the region, where arid conditions combine with population growth and poor infrastructure to make water the Middle East’s most precious asset, periodically sparking internal unrest and conflicts between countries.But Israel has emerged as a world leader in water technology after solving its own acute water crisis.Just a few years ago, in the middle of its worst drought in 100 years, Israel’s water reserves were approaching the red line. Now it has a surplus.The country’s water revolution was accomplished through a combination of a national campaign to conserve and reuse dwindling water resources and a new wave of state-of-the art desalination plants.In 2007, low-flow toilets and showerheads were installed nationwide and the national water authority built innovative water treatment systems that recapture 86 per cent of the water that goes down the drain for irrigation use.Hard-hitting television ads featuring well-known personalities hammered home the message “Israel is drying up” as the skin on actors began to crack up.Water conservation became fashionable and parents urged their kids to take quick showers, saying the Kinneret, the Sea of Galilee, Israel’s main source of fresh water, was “running out of water”.Domestic water consumption fell by 18 per cent after the campaign but that was not enough.Brackish waterThe next big decision was to reduce the amount of water used by Israel’s farmers. Israel was already a leader in drip irrigation technology and, to reduce the amount of fresh water used for agriculture, the cost of water for farmers was increased, forcing farmers to turn increasingly to brackish water.About one-third of irrigation water in Israel now originates from wastewater treated at more than 150 plants.The major breakthrough came with desalination, the process of removing salt from seawater.Desalination works by pushing saltwater into membranes containing microscopic pores. The water gets through, while the larger salt molecules are left behind.Israel’s first desalination plant was built in Ashkelon in 2005.Today, up to 80 per cent of water for domestic use flows from large coastal desalination plants in Sorek, Ashkelon, Ashdod, Palmachim and Hadera and more are under construction, including Sorek B, planned to be the world’s largest, with a capacity of 200 million cubic metres of water a year.By 2025, Israel aims to be producing 1.1 billion cubic metres of desalinated water annually.“Desalination has created a new and reliable source of water, and reduces dependency on the amount of rainwater,” Hila Gil, director of the desalination ision in the Water Authority, told the Ha’aretz newspaper. “It allows us to allocate water for farmers for a much longer period, and also for rehabilitating natural parks.”Sea of GalileeDesalination used to be a very expensive endeavour but, by incorporating advanced technologies, Israel has brought the price of desalinated water down to just a third of what it cost in the 1990s.The increasing use of desalinated water enabled Israel to stop pumping water from the Sea of Galilee – actually a lake – in the north to Israel’s more arid regions in the south, preventing the level of the lake from falling further, even though it remains significantly below the optimal level.Tackling leakage is also a crucial element in water conservation. Israel’s 7-8 per cent leakage rate is the lowest in the world, compared to up to 30 per cent in many other countries.However, the push towards desalination has created a number of health and environmental challenges.One issue is the cumulative effect of large quantities of salt being dumped back into the sea as a byproduct of the desalination, along with chemicals used in the process.Health experts also note the lack of some key minerals found in regular water, particularly magnesium, potentially increasing the risk of heart disease.There is also the question of the high-energy consumption of desalination plants. Each plant has a different energy source and some have their own power stations."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3959496.1563381663!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"national water supply has world leader potential says irish water","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSean Laffey, head of asset management in Irish Water: “Ireland is not a water-stressed country. However, while we enjoy relatively high average rainfall, it is unevenly distributed.” Irish Water has strongly defended its plan to extract water from the Shannon to serve much of the east coast, including Dublin. It has also rejected suggestions groundwater sources could solve the region’s supply problems. When assessing options for Dublin, two studies were undertaken, in 2008 and 2015, to investigate the potential of groundwater to meet the identified need, according to Sean Laffey, Irish Water’s head of asset management. “The reviews concluded that there are limits to what quantity of groundwater is available over and above what is already being used locally. “In essence, groundwater is not available at the scale required for future water supply needs. Furthermore, any large-scale groundwater development would require extensive well fields and water mains network which would entail an excessive cost for a limited yield,” Mr Laffey said. However, he confirmed Irish Water was working with Geological Survey Ireland on a regional study to assess groundwater availability in the eastern region. Desalination was considered at each stage for the Shannon project – known as the Water Supply Project (WSP) Eastern and Midlands Region – but a final options appraisal report “did not identify desalination as the preferred option”. The UK has proposed ersifying sources to include desalination due to climate change and population growth, but the Irish utility rejected any suggestion Ireland was facing a “jaws of death” scenario similar to that of England, where water demand from rising population is set to surpass falling supply resulting from climate change.Natural advantage“Ireland is not a water-stressed country,” Mr Laffey said. “However, while we enjoy relatively high average rainfall, it is unevenly distributed, with more in the west than the east of the country where there is a higher population density. Any challenges with our water supply are not reflective of Ireland’s unique natural advantage of having an abundance of fresh, clean water sources in our rivers, lakes and groundwater.” Managed properly, with new assets developed to take best advantage of these conditions, “our public water supply has the potential to be a world-leader in terms of long-term sustainability and reliability”, Mr Laffey insisted.It is anticipated construction will be carried out over a four-year period commencing in 20232024, subject to successful and timely outcomes to the associated planning applications. The estimated cost is €1.2-€1.3 billion. “Detailed costs estimates for this project will be prepared at tender stage once planning is secured and design of the final scheme is complete.” On risks the cost could rise substantially, Mr Laffey said: “Irish Water has a robust investment governance process in place and a full project budget is not committed to until the tendering process has been completed, reviewed and approved.”Governance processesThe estimate will be subject to review as it proceeds through the planning process and detailed design. “All Irish Water projects have extensive governance processes in place. Additional internal governance structures have been put in place for this project to ensure that scope and costs are controlled.” Funding is subject to approval by the Commission for Regulation of Utilities (CRU) which is currently examining the WSP and consulting parties which are for and against the development.A spokeswoman for the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government said extraction legislation was currently under preparation and it is intended it will be enacted by the end of 2019.It is already obligatory to register all abstractions of water of 25 cubic metres (25,000 litres) or more per day. As of May 2019, 1,460 abstractions were registered with the EPA, associated with 2,366 inidual abstraction points.The Joint Committee on the Future Funding of Domestic Water Services recommended an approach based on incentives, levies and other measures be used to address excess use of water to dissuade wastage, the spokeswoman added. Usage chargeOnce administrative arrangements and charges are approved by the CRU, Irish Water will notify relevant customers who appear to be consuming water services excessively and are therefore potentially liable for excessive usage charges. In many cases it is expected excess use will be as a result of a leak in a customer’s property so Irish Water will be offering “a first-fix free service” to assist customers in addressing these leaks. “The overall aim of the regime is to encourage water conservation rather than to generate revenue,”the spokeswoman stressed.On climate disruption, increased risk of droughts and rising population, the spokeswoman said it was essential that “key risks and vulnerabilities of our water sector and aquatic environment to climate change are thoroughly assessed and that climate adaptation measures are mainstreamed into all national, regional and local policymaking”.

He said at the time he envisaged the election taking place in spring 2020.He claimed the Government has not adequately prepared for the fallout of a no-deal Brexit but claimed there is a “lot of huffing and puffing” in public.“I am told the ports are not ready. Dublin Port is not ready for a no-deal Brexit, despite what you hear. I am told by people who know the port... that mayhem will ensue.“It’s important that if a no-deal Brexit is to occur – it may not – but if it’s to occur all hands need to be on deck to make sure that the people are looked after out there, that jobs are looked after, that livelihoods are looked after and protected insofar as we possibly can. That has to be the essential prerequisite of any political party in the country.”‘Boris agenda’The two candidates to succeed Theresa May as prime minister and Tory leader, Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt, have both said the backstop should be removed from the Brexit withdrawal agreement, which the EU says will not be renegotiated. The winner of the leadership contest will be announced next week.Mr Martin said he “supports the withdrawal agreement”, noting that “no one has come up with an alternative” to the backstop.“There should be no premature reaction to the British Tory election and I think there has been to date. People are playing into the hands of the Boris agenda. The British government put forward this idea of a UK-wide backstop and that was accepted and negotiated.”Mr Martin also called for the creation of a department of higher education and research that would be separate from the Department of Education. His party in government would seek a “broader reconfiguration” of the departments."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3959464.1563379965!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"should ireland look to desalination to solve its water shortage","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThames Water Desalination Plant can provide 150 million litres of drinking water each day, enough for one million people. Photograph: Ian WaldieBloombergThe £250 million Thames Water Desalination Plant was the first of its kind in the UK. It came into operation in 2010 and can provide up to 150 million litres of drinking water each day, which is enough for nearly one million people.Much of Thames Water’s supply area is classed by the UK Environment Agency as “seriously water-stressed”, with customers in London, Swindon and Oxford particularly at risk of water restrictions during extended periods of dry weather. The plant treats brackish waters – mixed fresh water and salt water – from the river Thames estuary, turning them into clean drinking water. Its prime purpose is to reduce the risk of water restrictions and to ensure severe water rationing is never required during periods of drought or low rainfall.It runs on 100 per cent renewable energy. It takes water from the tidal Thames during the last three hours of the ebb tide and removes salt using a “reverse osmosis” process. The treated water is then transferred from Beckton in east London via an eight-mile-long pipeline.Solar-powered infrastructureThe cost of desalination means many countries in northwest Europe deem it prohibitive. The case for solar-powered desalination infrastructure in drought-prone countries is a different matter. Former London mayor Ken Livingstone dismissed the London plant as a “misguided and a retrograde step in UK environmental policy”. He argued it was expensive and unnecessary. Thames Water should instead focus on reducing waste caused by leakage and people should be encouraged “to use less water, not more,” he said. But the Environment Agency now believes desalination has to be part of a range of options in light of increased impacts of climate disruption and population growth.Extreme droughtsRecent research by the Crowther Lab in Switzerland backs the agency view. It found London will in the future have the same climate Barcelona has today, and experience more extreme droughts.Yvette de Garis, head of environmental regulation at Thames Water, stressed recently that desalination was still “very costly both in financial and carbon terms” but necessary for “emergency use”.Irish climatologist Dr Conor Murphy of Maynooth University says a range of supply options must be considered if the Irish water supply is to be made climate-resilient. But factoring in costs, energy requirements, “brackish outputs” and high carbon emissions, he did not favour pursuing the option in the Irish context."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3959627.1563391347!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"spirit of political compromise urged by may in chatham house","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTheresa May: “Our politics retreated back into its binary pre-referendum positions – a winner-takes-all approach to leaving or remaining.” Photograph: Simon DawsonBloombergTheresa May has warned of a coarsening of the political discourse in Britain and around the world, calling on politicians to rediscover the value of compromise. In her last major speech as British prime minister, she made thinly veiled swipes at Boris Johnson and Donald Trump, although she did not mention either by name.Speaking at the foreign policy think tank Chatham House, Mrs May said a coarser political discourse did not simply create an unpleasant atmosphere but changed the basis on which politics is conducted.“Words have consequences – and ill words that go unchallenged are the first step on a continuum towards ill deeds – towards a much darker place where hatred and prejudice drive not only what people say but also what they do,” she said.She said that “getting things done rather than simply getting them said” required a willingness to compromise and she expressed frustration at her failure to win parliamentary approval. But she said the alternative to a politics of compromise is “a politics of winners and losers, of absolutes and of perpetual strife – and that threatens us all”.Johnson and backstopMrs May was speaking two days after Mr Johnson said the Northern Ireland backstop must be removed from the withdrawal agreement in its entirety, rejecting changes such as a time limit or a unilateral exit mechanism as inadequate.\u0026nbspMr Johnson has declined to rule out suspending parliament to force through a no-deal Brexit but the House of Lords on Wednesday approved an amendment designed to block such a move. MPs will on Thursday debate the amendment to a Northern Ireland Bill that would require the government to come to parliament every two weeks in September and October to update MPs on progress towards restoring the Stormont institutions.The Alternative Arrangements Commission, a non-governmental group dominated by Conservative Brexiteers, will publish its final report on Thursday. It will propose alternatives to the backstop to keep the Border open and will include a draft protocol to replace or sit alongside the Irish protocol in the withdrawal agreement.Pre-referendum positionsMrs May defended the backstop as a means of guaranteeing the Belfast Agreement after Brexit and she insisted that her Brexit deal represented a sensible way of delivering on the 2016 referendum result.“Most people across our country had a preference for getting it done with a deal. And I believe the strength of the deal I negotiated was that it delivered on the vote of the referendum to leave the European Union, while also responding to the concerns of those who had voted to remain.\u0026nbspThe problem was that when it came time for parliament to ratify the deal, our politics retreated back into its binary pre-referendum positions – a winner-takes-all approach to leaving or remaining,” she said.The prime minister displayed a flash of bitterness over the fact that her decision to sacrifice her own position had not been enough to get the withdrawal agreement through parliament.“I was told if I stand down, the votes would come,” she said.\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"revealed really goes recycling rubbish behind scenes","story":"The chaos of Britain’s recycling system is exposed today with hundreds of thousands of tons of waste being redirected to landfill or incinerators.Despite residents sorting their household waste into separate bins, up to half of “recyclable” material is not being recycled in some areas of England, government data shows.It comes as an undercover investigation by The  and Unearthed reveals staff at a recycling centre in London are sending recyclable plastic and paper to be incinerated.Today, The  launches a Zero Waste campaign calling on the Government, local councils and private companies to do more to boost the country’s lacklustre recycling rates.It is backed by Boris Johnson...To continue reading this articleAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekRegister for freeRegister or subscribe to continue readingAlready a subscriber?Newsletters and daily briefings30 days free, then £2 per weekUnlimited access to Premium articlesExclusive subscriber events and rewardsThe daily newspaper on your smartphone or tabletAlready a subscriber?Trump rally crowd chants “send her back” as president attacks congresswoman Ilhan OmarHouse votes to hold Attorney General Barr and commerce chief in criminal contempt of CongressHouse votes to block impeachment resolution against Donald Trump over \u0026#39racist\u0026#39 tweets - for nowDowning Street feared John Major may accidentally win the first National Lottery draw, previously secret correspondence showsBritish ambassador to US called Bill Clinton\u0026#39s White House \u0026#39chaotic\u0026#39 and media-obsessed in confidential 1994 cable Skin cancer rates have soared by 45 per cent in a decade as legacy of package holidays hitsTeenagers more irritable and prone to procrastination due to using social media earlier in life, new study findsSoaring obesity rates fuel doubling in the number of organs which cannot be transplanted Sir Paul McCartney announces musical version of It\u0026#39s A Wonderful LifeObesity should be classed as a disease to remove the stigma it is \u0026#39self-inflicted\u0026#39 medics sayCambridge University in spotlight as rape and sexual assault reports by students rise tenfoldKevin Spacey sexual assault case dropped by prosecutorsElderly face visit from TV licence fee police: MPs warn of \u0026#39trauma\u0026#39 for vulnerableTory leadership - final hustings: Boris Johnson promises \u0026#39comeback\u0026#39 for party as Jeremy Hunt asks members to \u0026#39vote with your heads and your hearts\u0026#39Comment: Britain faces only two possible futures – Brexit with Boris or Corbyn as PMRAF to develop hypersonic planes which could top speeds of more than 3,000mph to dodge missilesUS kicks Nato ally Turkey out of F-35 fighter jet programmeSuzy Lamplugh search ends with \u0026#39no evidence\u0026#39, say policeHome Office trials thermal imaging cameras capable of seeing migrants on beaches in FranceExtinction Rebellion leaders accused of seeking overthrow of capitalism and permanent recessionComment: Theresa May\u0026#39s final speech as Prime Minister secured her legacy as patron saint of the the soggy centreWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"music photographer denis oregancaptures glamour rock n roll","story":"As one of Britain’s top rock photographers over the past 45 years, Denis O’Regan has collaborated with legendary artists including David Bowie, Queen and the Rolling Stones, creating iconic images and capturing both the grit and the glamour of rock star life.

He was persuaded by Bill Kenwright, the theatre producer who has acquired the rights to the film and who, by happy coincidence, went to school with Sir Paul.Lee Hall, who wrote Billy Elliot and the recent Sir Elton John biopic, Rocketman, is writing the book of the musical, while Sir Paul will supply the music and lyrics.Sir Paul said: “Like many of these things, this all started with an email. Bill had asked if it was something I might be up for. Writing a musical is not something that had ever really appealed to me but Bill and I met up with Lee Hall and had a chat and I found myself thinking this could be interesting and fun. It’s A Wonderful Life is a universal story we can all relate to.”He has previously said that the 1946 classic is his favourite Christmas film.Sir Paul McCartney performs live on stage at the O2 Arena Sir Bill said that working with the former Beatle “is a dream realised”. He said of the songs, which Sir Paul is still working on: “To be honest, I was hooked on first hearing him say, ‘One, two, three, four’ on the demo of the opening number.“But since then it’s been an extraordinary journey - on every song I experience Paul’s unique gift of melody and composition. It’s musical theatre - but it’s always McCartney.”He said the three would “cherish” Frank Capra’s creation. The musical will launch in late 2020.Lee Hall said: “It’s A Wonderful Life is my favourite film. It has absolutely everything: comedy, pathos and a rare humanity which has touched generation after generation. Yet it just couldn’t be more relevant.“To give it a life on the stage is an immense privilege in itself but to do it with Paul McCartney is off the scale.”The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

The figure is almost double the 460 such cases in 200910.  Health officials warned that rates of obesity among deceased donors rose from 24 per cent to 29 per cent in less than a decade. Experts said the disclosures reflected a tragic worsening of Britain’s lifestyles, with many of those willing to donate organs after their death unaware their weight problem could make this impossible. Britain has the highest rates of obesity in Western Europe, with rates rising even more quickly than those of the  United States. Obesity is on the rise in the UKThe report from NHS Blood and Transplant also show an increasing reliance on older donors, whose organs are less likely to be suitable, with 15 per cent of donors aged 70 and over - a rise from eight per cent in 20089.The total number of transplants fell to 3,951, down from 4,038 in 201718 - the first drop for five years. Meanwhile, the number of eligible donors saw the first significant fall in a decade, with 5,815 cases, down from 6,038 the previous year. Despite the fact the number of donors reached a record high, with 1,600 such cases, up from 1,574 in a year, the worsening quality of organs meant the number of transplantable organs slumped. The number of lung or heart and lung transplants fell by a fifth in a year, with just 344 carried out in 201718, while 646 people were on the transplant list.  Tam Fry, from the National Obesity Forum, said the figures reflected a spiralling health crisis in Britain. He said: There may well be many thousands of people wishing to donate their organs on death who are oblivious to the fact that their obesity renders that impossible. “Most people think of fat as being visible but it\u0027s the invisible viscous fat that envelopes and crushes vital internal organs that does the damage and renders transplant improbable. “The greater tragedy is that, as morbid obesity increases, so, too will successful donorship reduce.”Organs retrieved but not transplanted, 2009 to 2019In total there were 5,147 usable organs, down from 5,260 the year before. This equates to around 27 organs for every 10 donors, down from 28 in 201718 . It comes as England and Scotland prepare to follow Wales in introducing a system of presumed consent, requiring those who do not wish to donate to opt out.The changes, to be introduced next spring, aim to boost rates of organ donation, and encourage more public debate about the issue. The report warns that the rising proportion of older and obese donors, who are more likely to suffer from medical problems which affect their organ quality  is likely to be affecting the numbers of successful transplants. It warns: “All of these changes may have an adverse impact on the quality and utilisation of the organs, and the subsequent transplant outcome for the recipient.” Prof John Forsythe, NHSBT medical director of organ donation and transplant, said: “Every potential donor is very precious to us. But what we are seeing reflects the changing demographics of the population”.“It isn’t surprising that someone with obesity is more likely to have heart disease, which would affect heart transplants. But it has an impact on other organs too - so if the liver is affected by obesity fat is laid around it and it becomes more vulnerable to the process of transplantation bigger and more fragile. Similarly the capacity of the pancreas is affected if fat is laid around it.”“In addition, when you have got older or obese donors, there is a higher risk of other conditions - for example diabetes.”Trump rally crowd chants “send her back” as president attacks congresswoman Ilhan OmarHouse votes to hold Attorney General Barr and commerce chief in criminal contempt of CongressHouse votes to block impeachment resolution against Donald Trump over \u0026#39racist\u0026#39 tweets - for nowDowning Street feared John Major may accidentally win the first National Lottery draw, previously secret correspondence showsBritish ambassador to US called Bill Clinton\u0026#39s White House \u0026#39chaotic\u0026#39 and media-obsessed in confidential 1994 cable Skin cancer rates have soared by 45 per cent in a decade as legacy of package holidays hitsTeenagers more irritable and prone to procrastination due to using social media earlier in life, new study findsSir Paul McCartney announces musical version of It\u0026#39s A Wonderful LifeObesity should be classed as a disease to remove the stigma it is \u0026#39self-inflicted\u0026#39 medics sayCambridge University in spotlight as rape and sexual assault reports by students rise tenfoldKevin Spacey sexual assault case dropped by prosecutorsElderly face visit from TV licence fee police: MPs warn of \u0026#39trauma\u0026#39 for vulnerableTory leadership - final hustings: Boris Johnson promises \u0026#39comeback\u0026#39 for party as Jeremy Hunt asks members to \u0026#39vote with your heads and your hearts\u0026#39Comment: Britain faces only two possible futures – Brexit with Boris or Corbyn as PMRAF to develop hypersonic planes which could top speeds of more than 3,000mph to dodge missilesUS kicks Nato ally Turkey out of F-35 fighter jet programmeSuzy Lamplugh search ends with \u0026#39no evidence\u0026#39, say policeHome Office trials thermal imaging cameras capable of seeing migrants on beaches in FranceExtinction Rebellion leaders accused of seeking overthrow of capitalism and permanent recessionComment: Theresa May\u0026#39s final speech as Prime Minister secured her legacy as patron saint of the the soggy centreVideo emerges showing Trump and Jeffrey Epstein partying with cheerleaders in 1992We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/07/17/TELEMMGLPICT000086692826_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqVLa3QPVTMHf7Wtw837j9bT_ZHd_GpdvVEr1Uqt6ZitU.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"teenagers irritable prone procrastination due using social media","story":"Bupa released the results of its first index of teenagers\u0026#39 mental healthTeenagers are becoming more irritable and prone to procrastination because they are using social media earlier in life, a new study has found.A survey of 2,000 13 to 19-year-olds revealed those who started using social media the earliest showed stronger signs of ten mental health symptoms, including anxiety, feeling overwhelmed and insomnia.The symptoms most commonly felt by teenagers who used social media from a young age were ‘irritability’ and ‘low self-esteem’. In contrast, teenagers who did not use social media at all reported lower instances of all ten symptoms. The study, carried out by Opinium for the health care provider Bupa, showed that almost a fifth of teenagers had started using social media at age 10 or younger. Social media companies have a minimum age of 13, but the process is easily circumvented as there is currently no watertight age verification.More than a quarter of teenagers (27 percent) admitted that they had a social media account their parents didn’t know about.The research also found that social media is making teenagers more stressed as more than half (53 percent) said it distracted them from schoolwork, which in turn led to them becoming more concerned about their academic performance.Bupa said the results are the first in what will become an annual index of the state of young people’s mental health, which the company has committed to carrying out after seeing claims for mental health issues double in the last ten years.Dr. Pablo Vandenabeele, Clinical Director for Mental Health at Bupa UK, says: “It’s really tough for parents these days to protect their child from things that could harm their mental health.“Even restricting ‘screen time’ or specific social media might not be enough, and our findings suggest some social platforms can significantly drive up anxiety and stress, especially if the child starts on them at a young age.“Despite the stereotype, teens really judge themselves on their academic performance, but social can promote procrastination, which amplifies this stress and worries around grades.” The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

The event on Tuesday evening coincided with the 50th anniversary of Apollo 11 launching its moon mission.Clear skies across much of the country gave people a stunning view of the phenomenon, including in London, Yorkshire and at Jodrell Bank Observatory in Cheshire.The partial eclipse was also visible as far afield as Australia, Africa and much of Asia.A lunar eclipse occurs when the Earth, sun, and moon are almost exactly in line and the moon is on the opposite side of the Earth from the sun.The moon is full, moves into the shadow of the Earth and dims dramatically but usually remains visible, lit by sunlight that passes through the Earth\u0027s atmosphere.A partial lunar eclipse is seen above Stoodley Pike, near Todmorden in YorkshireThe eclipse was seen in the UK from moon rise, from approximately 9.07pm until around 1.17am.People shared their pictures and video on social media and also celebrated the fact it came 50 years to the day after Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin and Michael Collins blasted off into space for a mission like no other on July 16, 1969.One Twitter user said: Watching a partial lunar eclipse on 50th anniversary of Apollo 11 launch is really quite magical.Another wrote: So 50 years since the best achievement for spacefaring that man has achieved thus far, Apollo 11\u0027s launch 50 years today, is celebrated with a partial lunar eclipse. Just brilliant. Absolutely fantastic.The 1969 mission marked one of humanity\u0027s biggest moments in space exploration.A few days after the launch, on July 21, people across the globe watched in amazement as Armstrong and Aldrin walked across the lunar surface, taking photos, collecting samples, planting a US flag and taking a call from then-president Richard Nixon.The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

The landing happened four days later, on 20 July.Between those days were a strange and eerie silence, filled with activities that would be humdrum were they not happening inside of the most ambitious activity ever launched by humankind.As the three astronauts – Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin and Michael Collins –\u0026nbspfloated serenely through space, they began to think about what would happen at Earth. They were travelling at immense speed which meant that they had left the Earth quicker than many of those who had come along to watch would be able to get out of the parking lots they\u0027d viewed it from.Created with Sketch.

Collins was assisted by his two colleagues to separate the command module from the third stage of the Saturn rocket, and then spin it around and connect with the lunar module known as Eagle that would be used to descend to the service.Apollo 11 launch video shows immense power of Saturn V rocketThis of course was a critical maneuver in the flight plan, Aldrin later said.\u0026nbspIf the separation and docking did not work, we would return to Earth.There was also the possibility of an in-space collision and the subsequent decompression of our cabin, so we were still in our spacesuits as Mike separated us from the Saturn third stage. Critical as the maneuver is, I felt no apprehension about it, and if there was the slightest inkling of concern it disappeared quickly as the entire separation and docking proceeded perfectly to completion.The nose of Columbia was now connected to the top of the Eagle and heading for the Moon as we watched the Saturn third stage venting, a propulsive maneuver causing it to move slowly away from us.After that was completed, the really stressful work was over. The astronauts could get to sitting out the journey, waiting until they reached their distant target.By the next day, the astronauts were able to darken the windows with covers that served as curtains, and try and get some sleep as the command module slowly rotated them through space. They\u0027d spend the following days doing chores and talking with Earth.During those intermediate days, there was considerably less activity on board the craft. Nasa\u0027s official timeline – which gives detailed information on absolutely everything the crew did – lists only a few activities over the course of the 17th and 18th, as the three astronauts floated through space.On 17 July, for instance, the crew simply conducted three TV transmissions and did one small burn of their engines to correct their course. The day after, there was another TV transmission and a quick journey into the lunar module and back so that it could be inspected ahead of the landing.But the day later, as they approached the Moon and, the atmosphere would change.Day four\u0026nbsphas a decidedly different feel to it, Collins later said.\u0026nbspInstead of nine hours\u0027 sleep, I get seven –\u0026nbspand fitful ones at that.Despite our concentrated effort to conserve our energy on the way to the Moon, the pressure is overtaking us (or me at least), and I feel that all of us are aware that the honeymoon is over and we are about to lay our little pink bodies on the line.At this point, everything became much more real: for one, the astronauts could once again see the Moon properly for the first time in nearly a day. They were now in orbit around the Moon, and it was vividly clear.The Moon I have known all my life, that two-dimensional small yellow disk in the sky, has gone away somewhere, to be replaced by the most awesome sphere I have ever seen, said Collins later.To begin with it is huge, completely filling our window. Second, it is three-dimensional. The belly of it bulges out\u0026nbsptoward\u0026nbspus in such a pronounced fashion that I almost feel I can reach out and touch it. To add to the dramatic effect, we can see the stars again. We are in the shadow of the Moon now, and the elusive stars have reappeared.At this point, the work to get ready to touch the lunar surface begins. The astronauts each carry out the checks that would try and ensure that the descent was as safe as possible, and that the lander that would carry them down was as secure as it could possibly be.Collins would spent yet more time on his own, waiting, as Aldrin and Armstrong jumped around the lunar surface. As they did, he waited, floating above the Moon – occasionally disappearing behind it and being plunged into the all-consuming quiet of the far side of the Moon –\u0026nbspand waiting for his two colleagues to make their return, before heading back to Earth.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It must scale up to meet demandClick to followThe IndependentEmma Back has spent three years developing her idea for the\u0026nbspsocial care platform the Equal Care Co-op (or eccoo) and growing the business to a size where it can attract major funding. But unlike other startups vying for the attention of venture capitalists, Back and her co-founders are raising money through community shares on Ethex, which calls itself an ethical crowdfunding platform, and shunning venture capital that would force them to grow as fast as possible to generate returns.“There’s definitely such a thing as having too much money,” Back says. Rather than raising money to employ salespeople, the Equal Care Co-op is raising money to train and employ people within communities to organise and manage care.\u0026nbsp“Other care platforms have massive advertising budgets, so instead of community relationships it’s all about customer conversion,” Back says. “It gives people a transactional perception of their work in the world. We’re not going to be employing salespeople, we will be employing carers and people who understand their community from the ground up. That will make us resilient, not sitting there with a VP of marketing for our community campaign.”Startups are increasingly looking for alternatives to venture capital funding that leads them to choose between selling up, going public\u0026nbspor going bust. Stefano Bernardi, a founder and investor working as an angel scout for Atomico, says there has been some experimentation in alternative models, but nowhere near the scale needed to meet demand from startups. \u0026nbspHow to protect your freedom in the stupid game of capitalismVenture capitalists invested more than £1.19bn in UK startups in the first three months of 2019, according to\u0026nbspKPMG. The money was invested across 161 deals, including £150m for iwoca, a financial technology company, and £58m for\u0026nbspGoCardless, a direct-debit payment company, to expand the company overseas. “Late stage” companies like these two find it much easier to attract investment because they are generally considered to be beyond their startup-phase and have a better-established business model.This means that entrepreneurs who want to grow a business fast and then exit at a profit have a harder time attracting early investment. It can put greater pressure on founders to squeeze margins at the expense of wages, company culture and even the vision that they set out with. The ultimate goal for many – just like Facebook,\u0026nbspUber\u0026nbspand Google before them – is to grow to a size that when they sell or go public, early investors cash out with huge profits.\u0026nbspBut if a company realises it does not have this kind of potential, it cannot back out of a venture capital deal,\u0026nbspBernardi\u0026nbspsays: “If they find that they have a good business but not monopoly-like, they can either close shop or try to scale anyway and then go bust. Not really a great situation.”In June 2018, Guy Singh-Watson, the founder of vegetable box producer Riverford,\u0026nbspsold 74\u0026nbspper cent of his company to employees. The transition\u0026nbspmeans that idends will be\u0026nbsppassed on to staff rather than to external shareholders, giving them an incentive to make the company more productive.\u0026nbspBut it also makes Riverford practically impossible to sell, because it has so many owners – a fact that many young entrepreneurs, eager for venture capitalist funding to grow fast and then cash out, might find shocking.“When I go to London to meet the bright young food brands of the future, before they have even sold their first smoothie or whatever, they are thinking about how they will exit,” Singh-Watson says. “It makes me really depressed and angry. They are just going to build it and sell it. When I started my business, I did it because I wanted to make something worthwhile.”Lisa Ashford, chief executive of\u0026nbspEthex, says younger founders, in particular, are interested in doing business differently. “They want to access capital that can support them in their mission and many of them are shunning the traditional models of raising finance in favour of models where everyone benefits,” Ashford says.Ethex works with organisations that have a social mission. The platform gives them access to 15,000 investors and several investment structures including ISAs, charity bonds and equity. Ashford says: “Venture capital funding can often be about financial performance and short term returns and exit strategies, sometimes to the detriment of the other impact aspirations of an organisation. That’s not what our investors are about.”In the US, Indie.vc is offering startups a route to profitability without venture capital funding. The platform gives entrepreneurs access to revenue-based loans with the option to start buying back shares out of a percentage of their monthly sales after one to three years. Bryce Roberts\u0026nbspsaid that when he founded Indie.vc three years ago, it received two or three applications a week, mostly from venture capital rejects. Now it can get as many as 10 applications a week from companies that have decided not to go down the venture capital route.\u0026nbspRobots are taking over farming faster than expected“We think there is going to be a tsunami of entrepreneurs who have experienced the one-size-fits-all venture model and want to cherry-pick the pieces of it that work for them,” Roberts said in an\u0026nbspinterview\u0026nbspwith\u0026nbspThe New York Times.Forty per cent of millennial consumers polled by Deloitte in 2018 said the goal of business should be to “improve society”. Singh-Watson believes that it’s going to take businesses embracing alternatives to put a stop to the overconsumption associated with capitalism.“Capitalism is destroying our world,” he says. “It’s 25 years since I did my first conference on corporate social responsibility and I don’t think much has happened since. We need something different and we need it fast.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Fine attention to detail has also meant that many of Sheeran’s tattoos have been replicated on his plastic doppelganger, too.Sheeran statue currently located in Gorky Park, Moscow (Yandex Music)On Twitter, one fan expressed their joy over the statue, writing: “Just in case Ed feels lonely in Russia, someone made this in the biggest park in Moscow.”Sheeran is performing in Moscow’s Otkritie Arena this Friday.Created with Sketch.The best albums of 2019 (so far) Show all 43Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.It’s not uncommon for an artist to be influenced by the place they grew up in. Yet few are likely to have as much inspiration to draw on as India-born, Zimbabwe-raised and now Peckham-based artist Rina Mushonga.On Deerhunter’s eighth album, frontman Bradford Cox takes on the role of war poet, documenting the things he observes with a cool matter-of-factness, and heart-wrenching detail. Death is everywhere on Why Hasn’t Everything Already Disappeared?, as much as others may refuse to see it.After a period of tumult, Sharon Van Etten’s fifth album is a reinvention. But beneath its hazy synths and electronics are songs of endurance and inner peace, of settling after a flurry of activity. 443 Bring Me the Horizon  – AmoBMTH frontman Oli Sykes wants to assert the fragility of the boundary between love and hate. Amo is a way of exploring that, even down to the title itself.543 Nina Nesbitt – The Sun Will Come Up, the Seasons Will ChangeNesbitt is back with her second LP, switching to a brand of soul and R\u0026ampB-fused pop that feels bang on time, and suits her far better. The Sun Will Come Up, the Seasons Will Change has slick, polished production from Fraser T Smith (Adele), Lostboy (Anne-Marie), Jordan Riley (Zara Larsson), and Nesbitt herself.This self-titled record, a loose but beautifully crafted collection of folk-rock songs, explores the kinds of anxieties intrinsic to the modern age – the longing to be at once noticed and invisible the paralysing effects of limitless information, and the desire to do good versus the desire to be seen doing good.The album is packed with personal confessions for the fans – “Arianators” – to pick over. It lacks a centrepiece to match the arresting depth and space of Sweetener’s “God Is A Woman”, but Grande handles its shifting moods and cast of producers (including pop machines Max Martin and Tommy Brown) with engaging class and momentum. One minute you’re skanking along to the party brass of “Bloodline” the next floating into the semi-detached, heartbreak of “Ghostin’”, which appears to address Grande’s guilt at being with Davidson while pining for Miller. She sings of the late rapper as a “wingless angel” with featherlight high notes that will drop the sternest jaw. (Helen Brown)The perma-brilliant James Blake has flooded his fourth album – Assume Form – with euphoric sepia soul and loved-up doo-wop. His trademark intelligence, honesty and pin-drop production remain intact. But the detached chorister vocals of a decade in which he battled depression have thawed to reveal a millennial Sam Cooke crooning: “Can’t believe the way we flow, way we flow, way we flow...”While he recognises his roots and includes plenty of nods to grime, AJ Tracey\u0027s magpie’s eye for a good melody or hook extends far beyond that. With the help of stellar producers like Cadenza (Kiko Bun), Swifta Beater (Kano, Giggs), and Nyge (Section Boyz, Yxng Bane), Tracey incorporates electronic music, rock, garage and even country on his most cohesive work to date.The album title of the year gives us an image of Brexit Britain trashed by Old Etonians David Cameron, Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg, but the fifth studio work from the punk duo has more than social commentary to offer. There’s some of that, as vocalist Jason Williamson skewers documentary-makers who take advantage of the poor in “Kebab Spider” – “the skint get used in loo roll shoes” – but elsewhere this is a record that expands the idea of what Sleaford Mods could be.“Do you still have that photograph? Would you use it to hurt me?” asks Australian indie rocker Julia Jacklin, against the menacing throb of “Body”. The tension is stormy: imagine a mid-period Fleetwood Mac song, covered by Cat Power. It’s a masterclass in narrative songwriting.With praise from Kendrick Lamar, five EPs released by the time she was 21, tours with Lauryn Hill, collaborations with Gorillaz and two critically praised albums – including 2017’s excellent concept album Stillness in Wonderland – fans and critics alike wondered what else Little Simz could do to find the kind of mainstream success enjoyed by so many of her male peers.1343 Solange – When I Get HomeSolange Knowles has never been coy about the intent behind her music. Beautiful arrangements and seamless production notwithstanding, you get the sense, each time she drop a project, that it serves a distinct, zeitgeist-shifting purpose.1443 Foals – Everything Not Saved Will be Lost (Part 1)FoalsMerging their asymmetrical early math pop with the deep space atmospherics of Total Life Forever and Holy Fire, plus added innovations – ambient rainforest throbs on “Moonlight”, deadpan EDM on “In Degrees”, Afro-glitch Radiohead on “Café D’Athens” – they’ve created an inspired album of scorched earth new music that, in all likelihood, will only really be challenged for album of the year by Part 2. (Mark Beaumont)Tracks are at once astute and deeply personal in how they capture vignettes of everyday life and spin them into important lessons. “Black”, the most recent single from the record, considers what that word means to different people around the world, as well as to Dave. “Voices” has him singing over an old-school garage beat, fighting off personal demons.At her best, Sigrid throws out precision-tooled high notes like icicle javelins into vast, blue Scandi-produced skies. Then she growls like an Icelandic volcano preparing to disrupt western civilisation until we sort ourselves out.1743 Karen O and Danger Mouse – Lux PrimaLux Prima was born just over a decade ago from a drunken phone call from Karen O to Danger Mouse – real name Brian Joseph Burton – during which the pair vowed they would work on something together. It wasn’t until after O had given birth to her son, though, that recording finally began, and there is a beatific sense of contentment on songs like “Drown”, with its Kamasi Washington-like choirs and stately horns.This is an ambitious creation, meticulously crafted and assembled. For a start, the range of guest performers is a cornucopia of contemporary soul and hip-hop collaborators: vocalists Moses Sumney, Roots Manuva, Heidi Vogel, Grey Reverend and Tawiah strings player Miguel Atwood-Ferguson, and keyboardist Dennis Hamm – both of whom have worked with Flying Lotus and Thundercat.Rose – who found fame in the UK’s indie-folk scene as an unofficial member of Bombay Bicycle Club in 2010, only to walk away amid the band’s growing hype – is darkly compelling on No Words Left. Assisted by producer Tim Bidwell, who worked on Rose’s last record Something’s Changing, she sounds braver than she ever has before. There are moments that recall her Communion labelmate Ben Howard, on his latest album, Noonday Dream, and others that nod to the quiet stoicism of Joni Mitchell and Neil Young. (Roisin O\u0027Connor)The record is loosely conceptual insomuch as it’s punctuated with mock adverts for “WWAY HEALTH, our 247 care programme”. But don’t be put off: Miss Universe is a brilliant collection of songs, an expansive melange of indie, jazz, pop and trip-hop that flits between a lo-fi sparseness and something The Strokes would play. Yanya – who is of Turkish-Irish-Bajan heritage – grew up in London on a mix of Pixies, Nina Simone, The Libertines and Amy Winehouse, and this unlikely combination is certainly reflected in the sound. (Patrick Smith)2143 Jenny Lewis – On the LineHere, Lewis does what she does best: adds the glossy sparkle of Hollywood and a sunny Californian sheen to melancholy and nostalgia, with her most luxuriantly orchestrated album yet. Even when she’s singing, “I’ve wasted my youth”, it’s in that sweet voice, with carefree “doo doo doo doo doo doos”, and at a pace that’s so upbeat that it masks the sentiment. It’s a bittersweet mourning of her past. (Elisa Bray)Comprising songs from Segall’s eclectic (that’s putting it lightly) catalogue and performed by him and the Freedom Band (Mikal Cronin, Charles Moothart, Emmett Kelly, and Ben Boye), the album is delightfully short and sweet. It is certainly a drastic switch-up from Freedom’s Goblin (2018), which had 19 tracks and ran for 75 minutes.If you want to know how hard it is to categorise Titanic Rising – the enthralling fourth album from Weyes Blood – look no further than the American musician’s own attempt to do so. It is, she says, “The Kinks meet the Second World War, or Bob Seger meets Enya.”Tension aside, there’s a great sense of fun here. The title track is pure euphoria, as restless synths of a Utah Saints or Orbital rave break into swelling bass and melody. And they create the full club experience with “Got to Keep On”, on which the four-to-the-floor beat, funky rhythm guitar, sweet backing vocals and chiming bells make way for the simple sounds of happy party-goers just as the anticipation builds, so does the instrumentation into a hypnotic crescendo. It’s masterful production. (Elisa Bray)Six months after the release of Oxnard, Anderson .Paak returns with another Dr Dre-produced record, Ventura. Where the former was overflowing with choppy, experimental sounds, guest appearances and clumsy attempts at Gil Scott Heron-esque revolutionary lyrics, the sequel – recorded around the same time – streamlines .Paak’s sound, making for a tightly packaged, melodic and danceable album.Two years after the release of his Mercury Prize-nominated debut Yesterday’s Gone, the south London hip-hop artist unveils its follow-up, Not Waving, But Drowning. And if any two records could portray how quickly someone can grow from a boy to a man, it’s these.2743 Lizzo – Cuz I Love YouNo one could accuse Lizzo of holding back. Not when it comes to her voice – which is raw and rowdy, so laden with personality even the vulnerable moments are a joy to listen to –  and certainly not when it comes to her message of unabashed self-love. That’s the predominant theme of the singer  rapper  flautist-extraordinaire’s hugely likeable third album, Cuz I Love You.It seems as likely as Old Man Steptoe dining with the Rees-Mogg, but this new tactic of burying their confrontational gruesomeness beneath a veneer of alt-rock respectability for album three works well for Fat White Family. Drenched in chamber strings and celestial harmonies, the plush yet sinister “Oh Sebastian” could be Pet Sounds selling its soul to the devil. “Fringe Runner” is so sleek and funksome it could be a New Romantic “White Lines (Don’t Don’t Do It)” “Kim’s Sunsets” is a piece of refined cosmic reggae resembling a blissed-out “Bankrobber”.2943 Cage the Elephant – Social CuesOn Cage the Elephant’s fifth album, Social Cues, frontman Matt Shultz reacts to the breakdown of his marriage and the loss of three close friends. He undergoes a kind of Jekyll and Hyde transition through the 13 tracks, the result of which is the band’s best work to date.SOAK reaches to outsiders once again on her new album. 3143 The Cranberries – In the EndThere’s a cruel irony that the release of The Cranberries’ final album should come just a week after journalist Lyra McKee was shot dead by the New IRA during a riot in Londonderry. “Zombie” was a protest song written by the band’s late frontwoman Dolores O’Riordan after two children were killed by IRA bombs – was released. She was deeply affected by the deaths, and would no doubt have been devastated by recent events in Northern Ireland as well.On her third record, Aldous Harding combines the gothic folk of her self-titled 2014 debut with the dramatically intimate tones of her follow-up album Party.Big Thief’s frontwoman Adrianne Lenker has an uncanny ability to make you feel like you’re in on a secret. Her whispering, spectral delivery and deeply personal lyrics are the key to this. Even on the band’s third album UFOF, with an audience that has grown exponentially in the past few years, the songs are still immensely intimate affairs.On his debut album, the 24-year-old Collard mixes sultry jams that recall the electronic funk of MGMT with nods to the greats: Prince, James Brown, Led Zeppelin and Marvin Gaye. Throughout, Collard exhibits his extraordinary voice, which swoops to a devilishly low murmur or soars to an ecstatic falsetto.   Dedicated covers the full, but generic, spectrum of relationships: dizzying love, lust, and break-ups. But whether she’s pining for the return of a former love in the funky disco banger “Julien”, or singing about masturbating post-break-up in lead single “Party For One” (“I’ll be the one If you don’t care about me Making love to myself Back on my beat”), the vibe remains positively jubilant.Getty Images for Spotify3643 Tyler, the Creator - IGOR“I don’t know where I’m going,” Tyler, the Creator begins on the song “I THINK”. “But I know what I’m showing.” The US artist’s words ring true throughout his fifth studio album, IGOR, where he adopts the dark and twisted mutterings of the Frankenstein character from which the record gets its name. It’s been a long wait for Flying Lotus’s new album. In fact, the LA producer has been masterminding Flamagra for the past five years – snatching moments between collaborating with Kendrick Lamar on To Pimp a Butterfly, directing and writing the comic horror movie Kuso, producing much of Thundercat’s Drunk and growing his Brainfeeder label.A heftier sound is never at the cost of melody, which shines through in Thomson’s vocals, the rest of the band’s backing falsetto, and the searing blues grooves stamped all over Future Dust. Those qualities are captured nowhere more satisfyingly than on “25”. “All Over Town” is their singalong anthem, neatly positioned in the middle to ease the pace.In keeping with the relatively restrained guest spots, it’s heartening just how much Skepta has rejected overloading Ignorance is Bliss with high-profile producers, preferring instead to burrow into his own aesthetic. There’s no attempt to chase someone else’s wave here no token drill, afroswing or trap beats to satisfy playlist algorithms. Instead, his cold grime sonics are rendered down to their no-frills essentials – brutalist blocks of sad angular melodies and hard, spacious drums.Bruce Springsteen seems to have told almost every tale in the grand old storybook of American mythologies, except perhaps one: a wide-eyed Californian dreamer finds the Golden State turns sour and flees back east, to some romantic speck of a town, to pine and rehabilitate. It’s the classic pop plotline of Bacharach and David’s “Do You Know the Way to San Jose?”, and it’s a tale Springsteen taps repeatedly here, on his sumptuous, cinematic 19th album, which is nothing short of a late-period masterpiece.A revolving door of female vocalists (A-listers, indie darlings like Angel Olsen and unsung songwriters) deliver heartbroken lines over big, shiny beats and synths. The emotional cohesion the record loses in its shifting cast of singerssongwritersgenres it makes up in DJ-savvy textural variety. Help Us Stranger reaches all corners of guitar rock: funky Detroit garage (“What’s Yours Is Mine”) country soul (“Somedays (I Don’t Feel Like Trying)”) psych (a cover of Donovan’s “Hey Gyp (Dig the Slowness)”) blues and bluegrass (“Thoughts and Prayers”). A cornucopia of instrumentation is woven into its brisk 42-minute yarn.4343 Hot Chip - A Bath Full of EcstasyWhen Hot Chip achieved chart success with their second album, 2006’s The Warning, it seemed more like a happy coincidence than a sign they were conforming to current pop trends. Since then, they\u0027ve released a string of consistently great albums, from 2008’s Made in the Dark (featuring their only Top 10 single to date, “Ready for the Floor”) to this, their seventh and best record, A Bath Full of Ecstasy. It’s not uncommon for an artist to be influenced by the place they grew up in. Yet few are likely to have as much inspiration to draw on as India-born, Zimbabwe-raised and now Peckham-based artist Rina Mushonga.On Deerhunter’s eighth album, frontman Bradford Cox takes on the role of war poet, documenting the things he observes with a cool matter-of-factness, and heart-wrenching detail.

A cornucopia of instrumentation is woven into its brisk 42-minute yarn.4343 Hot Chip - A Bath Full of EcstasyWhen Hot Chip achieved chart success with their second album, 2006’s The Warning, it seemed more like a happy coincidence than a sign they were conforming to current pop trends. Since then, they\u0027ve released a string of consistently great albums, from 2008’s Made in the Dark (featuring their only Top 10 single to date, “Ready for the Floor”) to this, their seventh and best record, A Bath Full of Ecstasy. Ed Sheeran’s new album is bland, sincere and hygienically preparedWhy do celebrities find it so hard to play themselves?Intriguingly, the Moscow statue is not the first time Sheeran has served as inspiration for a statue. In 2016, a Sheeran-inspired pig statue wearing a plaid shirt and sporting messy red hair was planted in Ipswich, near Sheeran’s hometown of Framlingham. Named “Ed Sheer-Ham”, the statue was met with support from Sheeran himself.“I’m really excited to have a pig sculpture made in my honour,” he said in a statement.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But humanity has been bewitched by our nearest neighbour for far longer than that. David Barnett delves into lunar myth, legend and folkloreClick to followThe IndependentEven a man who is pure in heart and says his prayers by night, may become a wolf when the wolfbane blooms and the autumn moon is bright.”\u0026nbspSo long have we been fascinated by the moon, that bright, progressively changing, ever-present fixture of our night sky, that we could easily believe those lines are some ancient folkish portent, their origins lost in the mists of time.In actual fact they were written by Curt Siodmak, the screenwriter of the 1941 movie The Wolf Man, which terrified audiences as Lon Chaney Jr, attacked by a wolf in darkest Wales, transforms in the silvery light of the full moon into a half-human, half-lupine beast.Even by the time that movie came out, almost three decades before man would walk on the moon, our fascination with Earth’s satellite was already deep-rooted. And why wouldn’t it be? Even to the earliest people, the moon must have been a troubling thing, hanging there in the sky, its face pocked by craters and ridged with mountains, mirroring and echoing the earth, impossibly distant yet close enough to make out its contoured surface. Of the Earth, and yet beyond it, further than mankind could dream of travelling.And yet, if you have no concept of the Earth on which you’re standing, the moon must have seemed stranger still. It’s little wonder that people have always conjured stories about the moon, deified it, given it the characteristics of a living thing.In Romania, they believed that the sun and the moon were siblings, but despite this, the sun desired his sister. To avoid her brother, the moon decided she would only go out at night, when the sun could not bother her.To some of the indigenous peoples of the Arctic circle, the moon was male, and the sun a woman, and they were lovers. Among some Inuit peoples, the moon was a benevolent spirit who welcomed the souls of the dead to other tribes, he was a vengeful being whose wrath was terrible to behold.Created with Sketch.Super snow moon: pictures of 2019\u0027s largest full moon around the world Show all 25Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A plane flies past the snow moon in Nuremberg, GermanyThe moon lights up the sky behind One World Trade Center in New YorkThe moon setting over Burrow Mump at Burrowbridge in Somerset this morning The snow moon rises over the Plaza Hotel and Casino in downtown Las VegasThe moon sets behind Les Jumelles in the Swiss AlpsThe snow moon rises over the banks of the River Loire at Lavau-sur-LoireEmirates Air Line cable cars are silhouetted against the backdrop of a snow moon in Greenwich, LondonThe snow moon rises between columns of the Floesser Bridge in Frankfurt, GermanyThe snow moon in MilanBuddhist monks carry lit candles as the moon rises over the Wat Phra Dhammakaya temple, near BangkokThe snow moon rises over Marina Beach in Chennai, India The snow moon is pictured against street lights of Piazza del Duomo in MilanThe snow moon rises above a construction site in IndiaA ferris wheel is in the foreground as the snow moon rises above Malaga, SpainThe snow moon rises between statues of Alexander the Great and Diogenes of Sinope in Corinth, GreeceThe snow moon rises in Skopje, North MacedoniaThe snow moon rises behind a statue of the Virgin Maty in Skopje, North MacedoniaEmirates Air Line cable cars are silhouetted against the backdrop of a snow moon in Greenwich, LondonThe snow moon rises over the French Mediterranean island of CorsicaThe snow moon rises by the Parthenon in AthensA plane flies in front of the snow moon above LondonThe snow moon rises above the Camlica Mosque in IstanbulThe Madonnina statue of the Virgin Mary atop Milan\u0027s Cathedral is pictured against the snow moon A plane flies past the snow moon in Nuremberg, GermanyThe moon lights up the sky behind One World Trade Center in New YorkThe moon setting over Burrow Mump at Burrowbridge in Somerset this morning The snow moon rises over the Plaza Hotel and Casino in downtown Las VegasThe moon sets behind Les Jumelles in the Swiss AlpsThe snow moon rises over the banks of the River Loire at Lavau-sur-LoireEmirates Air Line cable cars are silhouetted against the backdrop of a snow moon in Greenwich, LondonThe snow moon rises between columns of the Floesser Bridge in Frankfurt, GermanyThe snow moon in MilanBuddhist monks carry lit candles as the moon rises over the Wat Phra Dhammakaya temple, near BangkokThe snow moon rises over Marina Beach in Chennai, India The snow moon is pictured against street lights of Piazza del Duomo in MilanThe snow moon rises above a construction site in IndiaA ferris wheel is in the foreground as the snow moon rises above Malaga, SpainThe snow moon rises between statues of Alexander the Great and Diogenes of Sinope in Corinth, GreeceThe snow moon rises in Skopje, North MacedoniaThe snow moon rises behind a statue of the Virgin Maty in Skopje, North MacedoniaEmirates Air Line cable cars are silhouetted against the backdrop of a snow moon in Greenwich, LondonThe snow moon rises over the French Mediterranean island of CorsicaThe snow moon rises by the Parthenon in AthensA plane flies in front of the snow moon above LondonThe snow moon rises above the Camlica Mosque in IstanbulThe Madonnina statue of the Virgin Mary atop Milan\u0027s Cathedral is pictured against the snow moon One time, a Japanese fisherman found a robe made of white feathers on the beach. It belonged to a beautiful woman swimming in the sea. She said she would sing him a song if he returned her robe, for without it she could not go home. He did so and she sang him a hymn to the moon, where she lived, and as she sang her feathered robe became vast white wings, which carried her to her lunar palace.The moon is often considered female, as are the gods who represented it in ancient times. According to the astrologer and occultist Bruce King, who was born in Chicago in 1897 and wrote under the name Zolar:\u0026nbsp“In mythologies worldwide, rulers of the moon are female deities.”Huge, unexplained ‘mass’ spotted under the MoonIn his Encyclopedia of Signs, Omens and Superstitions he lists many of them: “For the Canaanites, the name of the moon goddess was Jerah (for who the city of Jericho was named). For Egyptians, Isis and Hathor were associated with the moon. For the Babylonians, the goddess Ishtar was given similar honours.For the Greeks, Artemis\u0026nbspand Diana\u0026nbsp(hunting goddesses), were both\u0026nbspconnected with the moon as well. Hence, it was not surprising that in medieval Europe, Diana became the patroness of witches, since she already ruled “horned”\u0026nbspanimals such as the stag and goat.Witches, of course, meet by moonlight. Shakespeare’s three witches, or weird sisters, in Macbeth, when cooking up their cooking up their “toil and trouble” in their boiling cauldron, throw in “slips of yew silver’d in the moon’s eclipse”. They are visited by Hecate, the goddess of witchcraft, associated with the moon.Brewer’s Book of Myth and Legend, edited by JC Cooper, tells us that Hecate was the name the Greeks gave to the moon before she had fully risen and after she had set hidden, occult. A crescent moon was identified as Astarte, as Diana or Cynthia when full. The\u0026nbspancients personified the moon as Selene, who fell in love with Endymion, a shepherd, who was put into an immortal sleep by a jealous Zeus.The moon is for lovers, immortalised as such in song:\u0026nbsp“Blue Moon”\u0026nbsp“Give Me The Moonlight”\u0026nbspBeethoven’s Moonlight Sonata. The moon has illuminated lovers’ trysts and in Brazil they say you are only truly in love if you can easily make out the rabbit in the moon, a piece of Chinese-originated folklore that identifies the markings on the face of the full moon as a rabbit.Just as the moon controls the tides of the sea, so it is connected to the bodies of women. In many folk legends, says Zolar:\u0026nbsp“Girls are warned not to stare at the moon or lay in moonlight, or they will be impregnated by the moon and give birth to some kind of monster.”Is there any truth in the old stories that women’s menstrual cycles are linked directly to the moon? The Uaupe tribe of the Amazon refer to a girl’s first menstruation as “defloration by the moon”. The word menstruation is derived from the Latin word menses, meaning “monthly”, and the Greek “mene”, referring to the moon. Science perhaps doesn’t back that up, other than through coincidence the average menstrual cycle is 29 days, the lunar cycle is 29.5 days.Nasa to send spacecraft to Saturn’s moon TitanNasa to open moon rock samples sealed since Apollo missionsElon Musk tweets ‘Occupy Mars’ alongside photo of the MoonAliens could be living on other moons, scientists sayThe moon, of course, only comes out at night...\u0026nbspexcept when it doesn’t. Sometimes we see the pale ghost of the moon in the bright blue sky, because of the passage of the moon around the Earth and, as it gets closer to being a new moon, and at its nearest relative point to the sun, we sometimes see the solar reflection off\u0026nbspthe moon’s surface in broad daylight.But it is generally the dark velvet of the night sky the moon inhabits, which gives it its associations with the occult, and secret things. Charles Walker, in his Encyclopedia of Secret Knowledge, says:\u0026nbsp“The moon is the symbol of the imaginative, reflective, interiorising power in our world. In astrology and alchemy, the moon is an index of the withdrawal principle, and of the subconscious or hidden side of life.”Moonlight is for lovers, but dark deeds are carried out by the silvery glow, as well. The term moonraker is from an old Wiltshire folk tale, about locals who were dredging a pond for kegs of smuggled alcohol. When confronted by the excise men, they played the dumb yokels and said they were trying to rake out the moon’s reflection in the water.\u0026nbspIf you are planning a robbery, then don’t do it on the third day of a new moon, or the enterprise will end in disaster, according to an old proverb. If you fall ill on the eighth day of a new moon, it’s likely death will follow. Should someone die at the time of a new moon, three more deaths are said to be on the horizon. And sleeping with the moon shining on your face will result in distortion of your features, or insanity.Ah, the moon and the mind. The insane were called called “lunatics” for a reason...\u0026nbsptheir state of mind was said to be directly influenced by the phases of the moon. The Lunacy Act of 1845 defined a lunatic as a person who exhibited lucidity in the first two phases of the moon but grew demented during the full moon phase. In 1940 a soldier, charged with murder, pleaded “moon madness” in mitigation in court.Lunacy, and the changes it wrought in humans, brings us back to the man who is pure of heart, and says his prayers by night, yet becomes a wolf. The ditty might have been penned by Curt Siodmak for The Wolf Man, but he was building on a dark tradition that has its roots in classical mythology.Zolar has little truck with the modern portrayal of lycanthropy, commenting somewhat huffily:\u0026nbsp“Just like vampires, the werewolf has been glorified by Hollywood and the motion pictures. For the ancients, a werewolf was a person transformed into a wolf by magical means. It is said that werewolves roamed the country at night and would attack babies and humans.”Murder case where man ‘thought victim was werewolf’ ends in mistrialThere are defences, of course, and ways to spot a werewolf in human form. They have flat fingers, so they used to say, and hair covering the palms of their\u0026nbsphands. And, of course, though werewolves were said to be immune to normal ordnance, a silver bullet, especially if blessed by a priest, would kill one. If that seems extreme –\u0026nbspfor example if the werewolf is a loved one –\u0026nbspsaying their Christian name three times would effect a transformation back into human form.It is said that the first man-to-wolf transformation was at the hands of Zeus, who was somewhat appalled that Lycaon of Arcadia\u0026nbspsacrificed his own child to the ruler of Olympus. Zeus turned Lycaon into a wolf for his crime, which is where we get the term lycanthrope from to denote a werewolf.According to John and Caitlin Matthews’\u0026nbspElement Encyclopedia of Magical Creatures, there was a wolf-cult built around Zeus after this, which survived until at least the first century AD. They write:\u0026nbsp“A member of the Antaeus family told Pliny the Elder that he had been a lycanthrope for nine years, having drawn lots with the rest of his clan to partake in these secret rites.”A werewolf could be created through being cursed, perhaps by a Hecate-worshipping witch, or sleeping in the light of the moon, or being conceived under a new moon. Or, as in the movies, from The Wolf Man to An American Werewolf in London (in which bluff rural Yorkshireman Brian Glover exhorts a couple of naive American tourists to “Beware the moon!”, to no avail), being bitten by another werewolf.Werewolf mania perhaps reached its height in 16th-century France, when dozens of people were tried and executed for being werewolves in a frenzy that spread across Europe, a full\u0026nbspcentury before the Salem witch trials in the United States.Michel Verdun is thought to be the first man to be tried for lycanthropy, in Poligny in 1521. Authorities investigating a wolf attack followed a trail of evidence and supposition that led them to Verdun’s home. He was arrested and under torture confessed to being a werewolf, pointing the finger at two other men, Pierre Bourgot and Philibert Montot.Bourgot told the authorities that he had been approached by three men dressed in black who urged him to reject God, and in return he was promised protection for his flock of sheep and given an ointment which, when applied, allowed him to transform into a wolf by the light of the moon. All three men were executed. Similar trials were carried out across Germany, the Netherlands and Estonia.We now know, of course, that the moon is not imbued with any magical powers, nor can exert any kind of influence over us. It is a lump of rock, about 2,000 miles in diameter.\u0026nbspIt is about\u0026nbsp4.5 billion years old, and is 250,000 miles away from the Earth. It has little atmosphere, and no weather no erosion means that the footprints left by the crew of Apollo 11 half a century ago will endure, untouched, for millions of years.And yet… the moon fascinates us beyond the fact of us actually getting there in 1969. The full moon carries with it far more weight than a mere satellite reflecting the light of the sun, it shoulders mythology, legend and folklore that dates back almost as far as mankind itself.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Show all 61Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.161 Lucie trying - and failing - to make ‘bev’ happenLove Island is known for adding new slang to the British lexicon, but 21-year-old Lucie’s firm insistence that ‘bev’ means a hot man failed to catch on.261 Amber’s anti-chemistry with Callum Straight-talking Amber quickly made mincemeat of Callum, the first boy she coupled up with. After correcting him when he said he looked younger than his 28 years, she confirmed it was his wrinkles which were aging him. She would go on to diss his sunglasses before ditching him for Anton during the next coupling.Sensitive boxer Tommy has been vocal about his love for Miley Cyrus’ teen sitcom since day one. His fandom reached new heights when he serenaded Curtis with a rendition of her hit song ‘The Climb’ to illustrate his path to winning Lucie’s heart. Aww.Blonde surfer Lucie was an instant hit in the villa, with almost every boy trying a cheeky graft. She seemed torn between Tommy and Joe, who each went nuclear in their attempt to woo her. Tommy pledged that he would crawl to the moon and back for her after knowing her for around 24 hours. Despite this, Joe’s jealous moping eventually won out. The confident Scotsman’s seduction skills manage to be both slippery smooth yet wildly erratic. His mile-a-minute chat has failed to land with any of the Love Island ladies, leading his to receive a cold shoulder from from Lucie, Anna and Mollie Mae. The raunchy challenge saw the boys strip down to chaps and speedos before hopping on a bucking bronco and getting covered in paint splatter. Performances ranged from smooth (Michael and Sherif) to deeply awkward (Callum and Joe).Amy had a minor wobble when newcomer Mollie Mae picked her man Curtis to join her for a date in the hot tub. She shouldn’t have worried: Curtis firmly friendzoned Mollie Mae and settled in for a gossip about his fellow housemates instead.Anton seemed confident at the first recoupling that pharmacist Anna would choose him. His confident smile on hearing Anna compliment her mystery love’s body quickly turned into disappointment when he realised she had been talking about Sherif.961 Calum leaves the villaThe aircraft engineer barely seemed to grace our screens before he was ejected after Mollie Mae chose to couple up with Tommy. 1061 Tommy makes his first cup of tea Tommy shocked the nation when he revealed he didn’t know how to make a cup of peppermint tea. With a lot of coaching from Sherif, the boxer managed to impress Mollie Mae without her realising the truth.1161 Tommy convinces himself he made an omeletteEncouraged by his success, Tommy tried to step up his culinary game by impressing Mollie Mae with a breakfast omelette (with Curtis doing the actual cooking.) Tommy even seemed to convince himself that he cooked the omelette, although he was rumbled after Sherif let slip who really made it.1261 Yewande’s quest for love Gorgeous scientist Yewande had been unlucky in love in the villa – until she was picked for a date by newcomer Danny. The rest of the Islanders encouraged her fledgling romance, from putting in a good word with Danny to criticising Mollie Mae’s attempt to woo the new boy for herself. Nine days into the series Love Island bosses confirmed that Sherif had been suddenly ejected from the show after “breaking the villa rules.” The 20-year-old confirmed his departure was due to his “poor judgement”, but it remains unknown which rule he broke. 1461 Curtis and Amy become a half-couple Amy may have never had a boyfriend before, but she was the first girl to make it official in the villa – sort of. During a date in the hideaway, Curtis asked her to become exclusive, which ended up with her getting the very high school label of ‘half-girlfriend.’1561 Amber opens up Amber gained a reputation for withering looks and cutting putdowns, but one man was able to get past her icy exterior. Firefighter Michael proved he could take her self-proclaimed a attitude, and was rewarded – on the second try – with a kiss.With Sherif out the villa, Anton resumed his moves on Anna. This time, it went even worse than before, with the Scotsman inadvertently comparing her with Mollie Mae, calling Anna beautiful ‘on the inside’. He thought the chat went well a dressing down from Amber and Michael soon put him in his place. Tommy was tasked with making a starter for his date with new girl Maura. “I’ve never put so much effort into cheese in my life,” he said, as he carved out lovehearts from limp sliced cheddar. The result, two slices of ketchup and mayo-smeared white bread, proved that Maura’s continuing lust for the 20-year-old boxer is made of powerful stuff. 1861 The girls freak out over Maura and Elma Amber, Yewande and Mollie Mae watched their respective partners meet the new girls from the balcony. “Confident sh*ts,” fumed Amber, while Mollie made fun of their flirty laughter.Michael brands Amber\u0027s behaviour as childish after the beauty therapist heckled his date with Maura.2061 Tommy and Mollie Mae fightMollie Mae wasn\u0027t happy when Tommy seemed interested in new girl Maura, and wasn\u0027t afraid to let the boxer know how she felt.2161 Amy and Lucie fall outLucie tearfully stood up for herself after Amy accused her of not spending enough time with the girls. Is Lucie just not a girl’s girl, or did Amy drive her away?2261 Maura gets a rise out of TommyMaura had her sights set on the 20-year-old boxer from the start, and things got steamy when she got him into bed. Her straight-up seduction techniques proved a bit too exciting for Tommy, who got a little hot and bothered under the covers. Just wait until he sees her eat an ice lolly…Maura went full factor 50 on Tommy when she ambushed him on the sofa. Tommy put his boxing training into practice as he dodged her kisses, while a jealous Mollie Mae watched on from behind a potted plant.2461 Jordan and Tom enter the villaAfter being the only two girls not picked for recoupling, Anna and Maura got to go on a date with the new boys: 29-year-old Tom and 24-year-old Jordan.2561 Joe and Elma leave the villaThe islanders voted for the couple they thought was least compatible, leaving the Joe-Lucie and Anton-Elma couples vulnerable. The public voted off Joe and Elma, ending the tumultuous relationship between the surfer and the sandwich maker (and leaving Anton single once again).2661 Anna and Jordan take it up a notchAnna and Jordan sealed the deal with a sensuous kiss, with Anna later rating the model as a 1010 kisser.2761 Arabella arrives – and immediately shakes things upAfter swearing to Yewande that a new girl wouldn’t turn his head, Danny was immediately smitten with fellow model Arabella after their flirty first date.2861 Yewande lays it on with DannySensing danger, Yewande made an effort to be more affectionate with Danny, kissing him in front of the rest of the islanders.During a challenge, a blindfolded Curtis accidentally rated Arabella a 1010 kisser, while giving his half-girlfriend Amy a measly seven. Amy was not happy, storming off followed by an apologetic Curtis.Arabella stirred the pot when she accused Yewande of being overly-possessive of Danny, telling her a few uncomplimentary remarks Danny had made about her to boot. A devastated Yewande soon realised that her fledgling romance was in serious jeopardy.3161 Maura is livid at TomMaura’s carrot-swallowing skills won her first place during the gym bunny challenge, giving her a night in the hideaway as a prize. Maura chose Tom to join her, but things quickly went south after she overheard him brag to the boys about finding out whether or not the Irish beauty was “all mouth.” Tom got a scathing dressing down, and a night in the hideaway was firmly off the cards.3261 Yewande leaves the islandDanny chose Arabella during a recoupling, leaving Yewande as the eliminated singleton. She was devastated to leave best mates Amber and Anna, but Danny was left with a scathing parting shot: “What goes around comes around.” Ouch.3361 Danny faces the wrath of AmberAmber was furious after watching Danny kiss Arabella the same night that Yewande left the villa. She had some choice words for the model, although Danny stayed calm and collected during the confrontation.3461 Curtis and Tommy share an intimate momentAfter declaring how much their friendship meant to each other, Tommy and Curtis shared the season’s first bromance kiss. Perhaps if they ditched their girlfriends, Turtis could go all the way to the £50k?During a challenge which saw the islanders read the public’s tweets, some couples were left seriously shaken. Amy was called out for making Curtis feel “in the wrong,” Lucie and Tommy were named as a good potential couple and Mollie Mae was accused of faking her relationship with Tommy for the prize money.3661 Mollie Mae worries about LucieThe Twitter challenge made Mollie Mae re-examine Tommy’s close friendship with Lucie. After a chat with Mollie Mae, the boxer told Lucie they should stop being so affectionate with each other. A disgruntled Lucie complained about the new “rules” imposed on her, while also refusing to rule out a potential relationship with Tommy during a chat with the girls.Maura wasn’t happy to hear that Tom had called her “attention-seeking” and “cringey” behind her back. She stormed over and confronted him, later making it clear he had blown his second chance.3861 Arabella and Tom get dumped from the islandAfter four couples were left vulnerable following a public vote, the three safe couples decided that Arabella and Tom should be the pair to leave the villa. Maura comforted a devastated Danny, but didn’t appear to be that heartbroken about losing Tom.3961 Lucie confesses her feelings for Tommy Encouraged by Anton, Lucie revealed to Tommy that she would be interested in rekindling their romance. Tommy told her he was happy with Mollie Mae, and later told Mollie about Lucie’s confession, leading Mollie to brand the Cornish surfer “muggy” for not coming to her first.4061 The girls take a holiday to Casa AmorSix new boys entered the game when the girls took a trip to Casa Amor. A thrilled Maura took an instant liking to Dennon, while 6ft 7in basketball player Ovie immediately cracked on with Anna, leaving her relationship with Jordan in jeopardy. 4161 Six new girls cause the boys to have doubtsBack at the villa, heads were also turning at the arrival of six new girls. Jordan flirted with Jourdan, Anton shared a bed with Belle and Danny seemed ready to move on from his Arabella heartbreak. Michael and Curtis began to question their own seemingly-solid partnerships, thanks to pretty newcomer Joanna. Anton remained hopeful about his odds of finally finding love: “I’ve got six new chances to not get pied.”4261 Curtis tells Jourdan he wants to recouple with herCurtis took a risk and laid it all out to Jourdan, telling her he would choose to recouple with her over Amy. Smitten with Danny, Jourdan politely brushed him off: “Stay loyal to the situation you’re in now, because I need you as a friend,” she said.Michael and Amber’s romance appeared dead in the water as Michael finally made his move on new girl Joanna.4461 Amy confesses she has fallen in love with Curtis4561 There were some awkward recouplings after Casa Amor…Amy was thrilled that Curtis had chosen to recouple with her – although she was soon to find out that he had made a move on another girl and told everyone that their relationship needs work. Michael recoupled with Joanna, leaving Amber single – and absolutely fuming. Poor Jordan saw Anna return with basketball player Ovie, although she was more apologetic about it than Michael. Mollie Mae collapsed into relieved tears when she saw Tommy waiting for her, holding her favourite stuffed elephant toy Ellie-Belly. Anton finally found himself in a romantic couple with Belle, Lucie coupled with new blonde bombshell George and Maura seemed keen on sensitive Marvin.4761 Michael and Curtis catch some serious heatAfter seeing Amber in tears, Anna went straight for Michael’s jugular, accusing him of leading Amber on by not communicating his doubts about their relationship earlier. Michael went on the defensive, calling Anna and Amber “childish.” Meanwhile a tearful Amy gave Curtis a dressing down for making moves on Jourdan: “Do you know how worthless this makes me feel?”4861 Maura serves some cold, hard truthWhile Amy was discussing her drama with Curtis to Maura and Lucie, she seemed on the verge of forgiveness: “I love him,” she said. A doubtful Lucie interjected: “But does he love you?” A furious Maura took a less subtle approach: “Why are you asking her that? He doesn’t!” 4961 Lucie tells Tommy she has feelings for him – againAfter Tommy took Lucie aside to check they were still friends, she confessed she’s still attracted to him, wishes she had chosen him over Joe and was thinking about him the whole time she was in Casa Amor. Once again, Tommy brushed her off saying he was still smitten with Mollie Mae – perhaps third time lucky, Lucie?5061 Tommy and Mollie Mae get seriousAfter the latest declaration from Lucie, Tommy reassured Mollie Mae by telling her how much he liked her. Mollie Mae confessed she could see herself falling in love with him, before Tommy admitted he was already falling.5161 Anna and Jordan rekindle their romanceWhen Anna returned to the villa and saw Jordan was still single, she seemed to question her new romance with Ovie. After a few flirtations conversations with her old flame, she told Ovie that she and Jordan might not be over after all…5261 Curtis and Amy break upAmy was so determined to work out what had happened to suddenly derail her perfect half-relationship that she made a checklist to get to the bottom of it. But after a heartfelt chat, Curtis effectively ended things by telling Amy he couldn’t guarantee he would stay loyal to her. 5361 Maura reveals this years’ biggest plot twistIn a characteristically unpredictable move, Maura revealed to Lucie she had a crush – on the newly-single Curtis. “I want him to teach me how to dance,” she said, calling him “gorgeous”.Villa BFFs Maura and Lucie both grew tired of their Casa Amor romances, so agreed to tell the lads – as a group. George and Marvin were sat down and pied together, with Marvin reacting with outrage and George barely keeping a straight face. Ovie may have seemed like her perfect man in Casa Amor, but Jordan caught Anna’s eye once again when she returned to the villa. Anna sat down for a chat with the laid-back basketball player, but things got heated quickly. Ovie stormed off before Anna headed up for a sneaky balcony snog with Jordan. 5661 Tommy pulls off the perfect proposalTommy decided it was time to ask Mollie Mae to be his girlfriend. As with cooking, writing isn’t Tommy’s strong point, so he enlisted Curtis to write him a love note in eyeliner (who knew there were no pens in the villa?) Mollie Mae found the note tied to her toy Elly Belly, and happily agreed to making things official with Tommy.Not long after Danny coupled up with Yewande and Arabella the two girls were sent packing, leading presenter Iain Sterling to nickname Danny ‘the travel agent’ for his talent in sending girls to the airport. New partner Jourdan was the final girl to fall under Danny’s curse as the pair received the least votes, although this time Danny was booted from the villa too.5861 Amy leaves on heartbreaking noteAs she prepared to leave the villa, Amy took her ex Curtis aside for a chat. Days after Curtis had ended their relationship, she told him: You turned my whole world around and turned it into some kind of craziness. All I\u0027ve ever wanted is for you to be happy. And you\u0027re not going to be able to be happy if I\u0027m still here. As Curtis broke down in tears, she continued: I want us to be best friends and I want us to both find someone... I\u0027m not going to be ready in the next three weeks to meet someone else.He might be coupled up with Joanna, but it was Michael’s ex Amber who got his pulse racing fastest during the dirty dancing challenge. Amber was glad to hear it, saying: “So now I\u0027ve at least got something, I can\u0027t just sit and mope around because I know I raised his heart rate the most!6061 Anton and Belle hit the rocksShe may have shaved his bum, but Belle reached breaking point after a series of slip-ups from Anton. She wasn’t happy that he kissed Anna in the Snog, Marry, Pie challenge, and a confrontation ended in a heated exchange at the nightclub6161 Joanna and Michael say an awkward goodbyeAfter it was revealed that Joanna and Michael couldn’t stay in the villa together, their fellow Islanders chose to send Joanna packing. She was less than impressed with Michael after it became clear he wouldn’t follow her out of the door, refusing a hug and labelling him a “snake” for staying. 161 Lucie trying - and failing - to make ‘bev’ happenLove Island is known for adding new slang to the British lexicon, but 21-year-old Lucie’s firm insistence that ‘bev’ means a hot man failed to catch on.261 Amber’s anti-chemistry with Callum Straight-talking Amber quickly made mincemeat of Callum, the first boy she coupled up with. After correcting him when he said he looked younger than his 28 years, she confirmed it was his wrinkles which were aging him. She would go on to diss his sunglasses before ditching him for Anton during the next coupling.Sensitive boxer Tommy has been vocal about his love for Miley Cyrus’ teen sitcom since day one. His fandom reached new heights when he serenaded Curtis with a rendition of her hit song ‘The Climb’ to illustrate his path to winning Lucie’s heart. Aww.Blonde surfer Lucie was an instant hit in the villa, with almost every boy trying a cheeky graft. She seemed torn between Tommy and Joe, who each went nuclear in their attempt to woo her. Tommy pledged that he would crawl to the moon and back for her after knowing her for around 24 hours. Despite this, Joe’s jealous moping eventually won out. The confident Scotsman’s seduction skills manage to be both slippery smooth yet wildly erratic. His mile-a-minute chat has failed to land with any of the Love Island ladies, leading his to receive a cold shoulder from from Lucie, Anna and Mollie Mae. The raunchy challenge saw the boys strip down to chaps and speedos before hopping on a bucking bronco and getting covered in paint splatter. Performances ranged from smooth (Michael and Sherif) to deeply awkward (Callum and Joe).Amy had a minor wobble when newcomer Mollie Mae picked her man Curtis to join her for a date in the hot tub. She shouldn’t have worried: Curtis firmly friendzoned Mollie Mae and settled in for a gossip about his fellow housemates instead.Anton seemed confident at the first recoupling that pharmacist Anna would choose him. His confident smile on hearing Anna compliment her mystery love’s body quickly turned into disappointment when he realised she had been talking about Sherif.961 Calum leaves the villaThe aircraft engineer barely seemed to grace our screens before he was ejected after Mollie Mae chose to couple up with Tommy. 1061 Tommy makes his first cup of tea Tommy shocked the nation when he revealed he didn’t know how to make a cup of peppermint tea. With a lot of coaching from Sherif, the boxer managed to impress Mollie Mae without her realising the truth.1161 Tommy convinces himself he made an omeletteEncouraged by his success, Tommy tried to step up his culinary game by impressing Mollie Mae with a breakfast omelette (with Curtis doing the actual cooking.) Tommy even seemed to convince himself that he cooked the omelette, although he was rumbled after Sherif let slip who really made it.1261 Yewande’s quest for love Gorgeous scientist Yewande had been unlucky in love in the villa – until she was picked for a date by newcomer Danny. The rest of the Islanders encouraged her fledgling romance, from putting in a good word with Danny to criticising Mollie Mae’s attempt to woo the new boy for herself. Nine days into the series Love Island bosses confirmed that Sherif had been suddenly ejected from the show after “breaking the villa rules.” The 20-year-old confirmed his departure was due to his “poor judgement”, but it remains unknown which rule he broke. 1461 Curtis and Amy become a half-couple Amy may have never had a boyfriend before, but she was the first girl to make it official in the villa – sort of. During a date in the hideaway, Curtis asked her to become exclusive, which ended up with her getting the very high school label of ‘half-girlfriend.’1561 Amber opens up Amber gained a reputation for withering looks and cutting putdowns, but one man was able to get past her icy exterior. Firefighter Michael proved he could take her self-proclaimed a attitude, and was rewarded – on the second try – with a kiss.With Sherif out the villa, Anton resumed his moves on Anna. This time, it went even worse than before, with the Scotsman inadvertently comparing her with Mollie Mae, calling Anna beautiful ‘on the inside’. He thought the chat went well a dressing down from Amber and Michael soon put him in his place. Tommy was tasked with making a starter for his date with new girl Maura. “I’ve never put so much effort into cheese in my life,” he said, as he carved out lovehearts from limp sliced cheddar. The result, two slices of ketchup and mayo-smeared white bread, proved that Maura’s continuing lust for the 20-year-old boxer is made of powerful stuff. 1861 The girls freak out over Maura and Elma Amber, Yewande and Mollie Mae watched their respective partners meet the new girls from the balcony. “Confident sh*ts,” fumed Amber, while Mollie made fun of their flirty laughter.Michael brands Amber\u0027s behaviour as childish after the beauty therapist heckled his date with Maura.2061 Tommy and Mollie Mae fightMollie Mae wasn\u0027t happy when Tommy seemed interested in new girl Maura, and wasn\u0027t afraid to let the boxer know how she felt.2161 Amy and Lucie fall outLucie tearfully stood up for herself after Amy accused her of not spending enough time with the girls. Is Lucie just not a girl’s girl, or did Amy drive her away?2261 Maura gets a rise out of TommyMaura had her sights set on the 20-year-old boxer from the start, and things got steamy when she got him into bed. Her straight-up seduction techniques proved a bit too exciting for Tommy, who got a little hot and bothered under the covers. Just wait until he sees her eat an ice lolly…Maura went full factor 50 on Tommy when she ambushed him on the sofa. Tommy put his boxing training into practice as he dodged her kisses, while a jealous Mollie Mae watched on from behind a potted plant.2461 Jordan and Tom enter the villaAfter being the only two girls not picked for recoupling, Anna and Maura got to go on a date with the new boys: 29-year-old Tom and 24-year-old Jordan.2561 Joe and Elma leave the villaThe islanders voted for the couple they thought was least compatible, leaving the Joe-Lucie and Anton-Elma couples vulnerable. The public voted off Joe and Elma, ending the tumultuous relationship between the surfer and the sandwich maker (and leaving Anton single once again).2661 Anna and Jordan take it up a notchAnna and Jordan sealed the deal with a sensuous kiss, with Anna later rating the model as a 1010 kisser.2761 Arabella arrives – and immediately shakes things upAfter swearing to Yewande that a new girl wouldn’t turn his head, Danny was immediately smitten with fellow model Arabella after their flirty first date.2861 Yewande lays it on with DannySensing danger, Yewande made an effort to be more affectionate with Danny, kissing him in front of the rest of the islanders.During a challenge, a blindfolded Curtis accidentally rated Arabella a 1010 kisser, while giving his half-girlfriend Amy a measly seven. Amy was not happy, storming off followed by an apologetic Curtis.Arabella stirred the pot when she accused Yewande of being overly-possessive of Danny, telling her a few uncomplimentary remarks Danny had made about her to boot. A devastated Yewande soon realised that her fledgling romance was in serious jeopardy.3161 Maura is livid at TomMaura’s carrot-swallowing skills won her first place during the gym bunny challenge, giving her a night in the hideaway as a prize. Maura chose Tom to join her, but things quickly went south after she overheard him brag to the boys about finding out whether or not the Irish beauty was “all mouth.” Tom got a scathing dressing down, and a night in the hideaway was firmly off the cards.3261 Yewande leaves the islandDanny chose Arabella during a recoupling, leaving Yewande as the eliminated singleton. She was devastated to leave best mates Amber and Anna, but Danny was left with a scathing parting shot: “What goes around comes around.” Ouch.3361 Danny faces the wrath of AmberAmber was furious after watching Danny kiss Arabella the same night that Yewande left the villa. She had some choice words for the model, although Danny stayed calm and collected during the confrontation.3461 Curtis and Tommy share an intimate momentAfter declaring how much their friendship meant to each other, Tommy and Curtis shared the season’s first bromance kiss. Perhaps if they ditched their girlfriends, Turtis could go all the way to the £50k?During a challenge which saw the islanders read the public’s tweets, some couples were left seriously shaken. Amy was called out for making Curtis feel “in the wrong,” Lucie and Tommy were named as a good potential couple and Mollie Mae was accused of faking her relationship with Tommy for the prize money.3661 Mollie Mae worries about LucieThe Twitter challenge made Mollie Mae re-examine Tommy’s close friendship with Lucie. After a chat with Mollie Mae, the boxer told Lucie they should stop being so affectionate with each other. A disgruntled Lucie complained about the new “rules” imposed on her, while also refusing to rule out a potential relationship with Tommy during a chat with the girls.Maura wasn’t happy to hear that Tom had called her “attention-seeking” and “cringey” behind her back. She stormed over and confronted him, later making it clear he had blown his second chance.3861 Arabella and Tom get dumped from the islandAfter four couples were left vulnerable following a public vote, the three safe couples decided that Arabella and Tom should be the pair to leave the villa. Maura comforted a devastated Danny, but didn’t appear to be that heartbroken about losing Tom.3961 Lucie confesses her feelings for Tommy Encouraged by Anton, Lucie revealed to Tommy that she would be interested in rekindling their romance. Tommy told her he was happy with Mollie Mae, and later told Mollie about Lucie’s confession, leading Mollie to brand the Cornish surfer “muggy” for not coming to her first.4061 The girls take a holiday to Casa AmorSix new boys entered the game when the girls took a trip to Casa Amor. A thrilled Maura took an instant liking to Dennon, while 6ft 7in basketball player Ovie immediately cracked on with Anna, leaving her relationship with Jordan in jeopardy. 4161 Six new girls cause the boys to have doubtsBack at the villa, heads were also turning at the arrival of six new girls.

Jake went down again and again and she just remained still for him.”Created with Sketch.Underwater Photographer of the Year Show all 45Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Winner: Behaviour and overall winner. I worry that this image will refuel the public\u0027s imbalanced perception of sharks but as an image capturing behaviour it has drama, adrenaline, grace, beauty and finality. That\u0027s a very rare combination in one image. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) Winner: Wide Angle. The first moment I viewed this image I knew it would be a strong contender. For me it\u0027s the symmetry of the Humpback and the balance between the er and calf. Everything about it is in perfect alignment. The shape of the tail in relation to the four corners of the frame, not to mention the position of the free er and calf. Superb imagery at its very best.  Many congratulations Francois. - Martin Edge (Judge)    Winner: Macro. Fabio’s use of long exposure and panning has turned a classic portrait of a Sepiola into an unforgettable one. The sharp and ghosted images of the bobtail squid balance pleasingly in the frame and combined with the outstretched tentacles give the feeling of the cephalopod lunging for its prey. An innovative and most deserving category winner. - Alex Mustard (Judge) It is hard to imagine what it must have been like to have experienced such a large scale natural spectacle as this but this image, perfectly composed and timed, gets close. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) Winner: British Waters Macro. A mantra of mine is \u0027It\u0027s not what it is. It\u0027s where it is\u0027 and this long clawed Squat lobster is in a perfect position to make a memorable image. The author, instead of \u0027blasting\u0027 it with light, has gone in the opposite direction by restricting the strobe into a snooted spotlight in order to illuminate just the features of the lobster and the dainty sea loch anemones. It\u0027s an example of \u0027Isolation lighting\u0027 at its very best. A great deal of uw photographers invest their time in what they want to illuminate. This is an example which in my opinion illustrates features that they do not want to illuminate, hence the punchy black background and the soft delicate hues of dark sand, facial features topped off by the sea loch anemones. - Martin Edge (Judge)Winner: Marine Conservation. The problems of plastic pollution and ghost fishing are both illustrated by this struggling loggerhead turtle. I am happy to learn this inidual was lucky enough to survive this deathtrap thanks to the photographer - Alex Mustard (Judge)What a chin, what a forehead, what a character. This picture has portrait written all over it, and such a fascinating species ideally suited to this close focus wide angle approach. - Alex Mustard (Judge) Winner: Portrait. Superb impact from the very first moment it was presented. Perfect composition within the image frame and the understated colours. To top it off the authors comments above say it all... a Smiling Happy Angel\u0027s Face. One of my favourites from the entire competition. - Martin Edge (Judge)  Winner: Up \u0026amp Coming. Beautiful split shot with both a perfect under and over split. A very strong favourite with all the judges and one of the best examples I have seen of this type of image for some time. Just Superb! - Martin Edge (Judge)Winner: Black \u0026amp White. It must be 11 out of 10 for this groundbreaking image. Conception, interpretation and perseverance coupled with black and white’s ability to concentrate on the key elements. It gets better with each viewing. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) Grey seals are a perennial favourite in UPY as one of the UK\u0027s star wildlife attractions. This upside-down portrait is quirky and cute and easily won the affections of the judging panel. Great to see an overseas photographer coming to the UK to show us how it\u0027s done! - Alex Mustard (Judge)Winner: Compact. This image was a very popular choice between the panel. Ideal for a split rendition. What makes this a winner for me, not withstanding the double exposure is the sympathetic balance of light \u0026amp colour connected  between the top half and bottom of the image frame. - Martin Edge (Judge)Winner: British Waters Compact. Does British ing get any better than a fun encounter with a grey seal pup? This youngster’s relaxed and curious face is captured perfectly by Martin, making us all want to be there too. - Alex Mustard (Judge)Winner: British Waters Living Together. Images tell stories but well thought out and executed ones speak volumes. This is such an example which feeds the eye with tales of the seaside on summer days, lively marine spectacles and excited human interaction. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)1545 Isles of Scilly, UKWinner: British Waters Wide Angle. Photographers often feel competition shots must be packed with new tricks to win. At UPY we always appreciate classic technique when it raises the bar of what has been done before. Rob\u0027s full technicolour wide angle scenic reveals the richness of UK seas with an elegant simplicity that is incredibly challenging to pull off in British conditions. - Alex Mustard (Judge) Winner: Wrecks. So simple yet so powerful the additional lighting of the turret and the main er perfectly positioned. This was a very strong category this year with a deserved winner and it\u0027s refreshing to read the acknowledgement to Leigh Bishop\u0027s pioneering work. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) The iconic silhouette of a seahorse is a graphically powerful picture. Here Zarina has raised that to another level with the addition of a red filter to her snooted strobe, reminiscent of a rim-lit animal at sunset. - Alex Mustard (Judge) All the judges found this to be probably the most distressing image to view but its uncompromising message must be seen by as many people as possible. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)As a subject we have seen our fair share of these colourful characters but this one shone through and the eggs almost look as if they have been inidually lit! - Peter Rowlands (Judge)Superb image with a perfect line across the split. Good exposure both above and below the water line and such an ideal subject to cap it all off. Excellent work. - Martin Edge (Judge)This is an excellent example for this category. It takes a tried and trusted angle but completely lifts it by using the fabric. It becomes more than an image a concept, a transition, a rebirth. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)2245 Isles of Scilly, UKThis image stood out on many levels. Composition, colour vibrancy and contrast combined with an unusual angle kept us coming back to it and helped it rise in the rankings with each viewing. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)Perfect control of angle, light and focus. This was always up there with all of the judges. A clear favourite just like Nick Park’s genius creations. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) I\u0027ve seen many images of eel and shrimp around Indonesia, however you have taken this two steps forward. 1) With your excellent idea to snoot the eye and 2) with your backlight on the shrimp. You can expect many photographers to practice your technique in the months to come. Congratulations for your vision. Very well thought out and executed. - Martin Edge (Judge)    It’s not what you’ve got, it’s what you do with it. The split may have been elusive but well worth the effort. This is a deceptively subtle excellent delivery. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)I have witnessed this behaviour from the surface with its high velocity \u0027testosterone and tonnage\u0027 and I remember thinking how happy I was to be in the boat. To have the presence of mind to time this shot whilst one\u0027s senses are being bombarded is heroic in my view. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) What an amazing moment. From the expression on the face of the unicornfish fleeing for its life, to the hunting pack of sharks, especially the leader with its mouth snapping open that fan out diagonally across this composition. And that is without considering what a great challenge it is to shoot these images of split second action, in the dead of night, underwater. - Alex Mustard (Judge)  There is so much energy in this image. If you look at it long enough you can begin to see just a hint of movement of all the fish around the coral. The colours are realistic and this top down shot works well.  - Martin Edge (Judge)A jaw-dropping wide angle scene with sharks, rays and mountains. A winning combination in the Up \u0026amp Coming category. - Alex Mustard (Judge)3045 Loch Long, Argyll and ButeThis is a subtle image with light and detail that are a delight to explore. The sunset, trees and underwater scene combine to create a wonderful feeling of the place. We particularly like how the composition allows the line of the shore to be continued underwater by the seaweeds.  - Alex Mustard (Judge)Photographing pike underwater is one thing but finding your own underwater artistic stamp is quite another matter. With this particular image the author has done just that! By using a slow shutter speed of 18th sec and a panning technique from right to left gives the impression of movement whilst the pike is pin sharp. - Martin Edge (Judge)Arthur’s image scores with both its foreground and background. The deadman’s fingers soft coral make an attractive foreground, enhanced by the crab sheltering within, and the striking sunbeams create beauty and atmosphere in the background. I also love the feeling of depth created by the legs of the jetty reaching up for the surface. - Alex Mustard (Judge)In recent UPY competitions UK macro images have lacked their overseas counterpart\u0027s flair and imagination but this magnificent shot raises the bar for everyone else to follow. World class from the UK at last. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)Memorable photographs of people underwater are deceptively difficult and require both the photographer and model to be at the top of their game. The simplicity of the composition works to highlight the delicious details in the girl\u0027s pose. - Alex Mustard (Judge) This is a timeless scene that communicates a detailed story. The cavern, the silversides sheltering, the tarpon hunting and the er kneeling reverentially, taking it all in. It is a fabulous use of black and white to tell this story of shadows and light. - Alex Mustard (Judge) Sometimes it is the small detail which contributes so much. The white of the eye and the row of teeth in what could be construed as a smile convey mischief and menace in equal measures. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) Once again Tobias you have succeeded in capturing one of the most photographed wrecks in the Red Sea and photographing it in a completely different way. You push the boundaries of wreck photography and I congratulate you for your vision and forward thinking of new ideas. - Martin Edge (Judge)  Perfect composition and framed against the stark black background. However it\u0027s the contrast of white on black which attracts the eye again and again every time this particular image popped up to greet us. The colour of the nudibranch was sufficiently bright enough to raise our senses again and again as it proceeded through the competition.  The soft delicate treatment of the snooted flash is also very well managed. - Martin Edge (Judge)    This shot puts you right in the picture and records a special encounter in a very special place. Every element contributes and the lucky or intended curve of the split creates great spatial depth. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) Symmetry, graphic simplicity and for once in UK waters a black background which contributes to a positive outer worldly delivery. A mould breaker. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) I see and judge many images of the sockeye salmon but this is one of the best. The alignment of the two salmon not to mention the composition within the frame.  The surgy peak of the action is in perfect symmetry with the window which provides the viewer with topside influences of the trees against a vivid blue sky. There is so much image depth in this example. - Martin Edge (Judge)    Such a delicate image yet so full of emotion. There are times when there are no more words needed. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)UPY loves seahorse photos! Especially when they capture a fleeting behaviour, such as this. But we hadn\u0027t realised during judging that this was a new species of seahorse, nor did with know the incredible backstory behind this picture, we just loved the moment. - Alex Mustard (Judge)  Whether or not you like fashion photography underwater you would be hard pressed to see a more beautiful combination of complimentary colours and a very elegant pose. A very well executed image. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)A portrait must leave you in no doubt. Simple lighting, illuminating all that is needed, captures this character. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)Winner: Behaviour and overall winner. I worry that this image will refuel the public\u0027s imbalanced perception of sharks but as an image capturing behaviour it has drama, adrenaline, grace, beauty and finality. That\u0027s a very rare combination in one image. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) Winner: Wide Angle. The first moment I viewed this image I knew it would be a strong contender. For me it\u0027s the symmetry of the Humpback and the balance between the er and calf. Everything about it is in perfect alignment. The shape of the tail in relation to the four corners of the frame, not to mention the position of the free er and calf. Superb imagery at its very best.  Many congratulations Francois. - Martin Edge (Judge)    Winner: Macro. Fabio’s use of long exposure and panning has turned a classic portrait of a Sepiola into an unforgettable one. The sharp and ghosted images of the bobtail squid balance pleasingly in the frame and combined with the outstretched tentacles give the feeling of the cephalopod lunging for its prey. An innovative and most deserving category winner. - Alex Mustard (Judge) It is hard to imagine what it must have been like to have experienced such a large scale natural spectacle as this but this image, perfectly composed and timed, gets close. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) Winner: British Waters Macro. A mantra of mine is \u0027It\u0027s not what it is. It\u0027s where it is\u0027 and this long clawed Squat lobster is in a perfect position to make a memorable image. The author, instead of \u0027blasting\u0027 it with light, has gone in the opposite direction by restricting the strobe into a snooted spotlight in order to illuminate just the features of the lobster and the dainty sea loch anemones. It\u0027s an example of \u0027Isolation lighting\u0027 at its very best. A great deal of uw photographers invest their time in what they want to illuminate. This is an example which in my opinion illustrates features that they do not want to illuminate, hence the punchy black background and the soft delicate hues of dark sand, facial features topped off by the sea loch anemones. - Martin Edge (Judge)Winner: Marine Conservation. The problems of plastic pollution and ghost fishing are both illustrated by this struggling loggerhead turtle.

Simple lighting, illuminating all that is needed, captures this character. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)The footage was released on Thursday by Ningaloo Marine Interactions, the tour company which Mr Wilton works for.The hero himself suggested it was all in a day’s work.First known nursery for giant manta rays discovered in Gulf of Mexico“I’m often guiding snorkellers in the area and it’s as if she recognised me and was trusting me to help her,” he said.“She got closer and closer and then started unfurling to present the eye to me. I knew we had to get the hooks out or she would have been in big trouble. I went for a few es down to see how she’d react to me being close to her.”When the animal stayed calm, he approached and took out the hooks.The manta stayed completely still in the water,” he said.“It’s pretty incredible behaviour if this is what happened,” said David Boyle, lecturer in marine biology at the University of Plymouth. “It’s not uncommon for animals – generally mammals – to interact with ers but for one in distress to seek out assistance would be novel indeed.”Manta rays are believed to be some of the most intelligent creatures in the ocean. Unlike stingrays, they don’t have an external spike and are generally harmless to humans.Experts believe the injured eye would have become infected, leading to blindness and possible death.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Aldi’s basket included its own-brand\u0026nbspVeuve Monsigny champagne.A further line stated: “Save 45 per cent”, while small text at the bottom of the page said: “Tesco may sell ‘own-brand’ products at different prices.”Tesco complained that the champagne products included in the selection unfairly skewed the price comparison in Aldi’s favour, and that the advert did not make sufficiently clear that Tesco also sold alternative\u0026nbspchampagne products that were cheaper than Moet.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The Inveraray pipe band parades through the town at the start of the Highland Games in Inverarary, ScotlandExtinction Rebellion Activists block roads near the Tron Clock tower in GlasgowSerbia\u0027s Novak Djokovic raises the winner\u0027s trophy after beating Switzerland\u0027s Roger Federer during their men\u0027s singles final on day thirteen of the 2019 Wimbledon Championships at The All England Lawn Tennis ClubThe referee counts Nathan Gorman out as Daniel Dubois looks on during the British Heavyweight Title fight between Daniel Dubois and Nathan Gorman at The O2 Arena in LondonGiant Panda, Yang Guang, exploring his new home at Edinburgh Zoo after moving in last weekEngland\u0027s captain Eoin Morgan, left, celebrates with teammate Joe Root after winning their Cricket World Cup semi-final match against Australia at Edgbaston in Birmingham.

The ruling does not impact our ongoing Swap and Save adverts, which clearly show how much shoppers can save by switching to Aldi.”Additional reporting by PAOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Anything that is hidden in such a way suggests that the person leaving it behind is most definitely aware that it is not the correct way to dispose of their rubbish.“You don’t actually see people just dropping litter these days, they all know better.\u0026nbspSome have suggested adding bins to the hills, but this does encourage folk\u0026nbspto empty their pockets, and leave even more behind.“Pistachio shells make a regular appearance on the Ben, as well as cigarette ends. All litter is bad, but has different impacts. Plastic will never go away, foodstuff\u0026nbspcan poison the wildlife, and tissuesfaeces spread bacteria.”First-time climbers\u0026nbspcan be the worst offenders, Mr Pyne said, likely through ignorance regarding how long organic material takes to break down in a mountain environment a banana skin may take between two and three years to disappear.However, following the Real3Peaks organised litter-picks and the long-term work of other volunteers, “the noticeable volume has gone down, and the place is looking much better for it”, he said.A more pressing problem is walkers going to the toilet because the desire for privacy leads them to pick the same spots over and over again, he said. “Most or all of the accessible and obvious hiding places\u0026nbspare open, unflushed toilets, smelling very bad, often draped in used tissues, a vibrant green algae present, and black coloured soil, which has been tainted by the concentrated urine.”Staying well away from water courses while doing one’s business is important, Mr Pyne said.He added: “The best thing that anyone outdoors can do, whether in the park, down by the canal, or in the mountains, is to pick up litter they see, and be considerate of where they will ‘go’.”The next Real3Peaks Challenge is due to take place on 12 October.Mountaineering Scotland runs a #TakItHame campaign designed to encourage walkers to pick up any litter they see.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The Consumer Price Inflation measure\u0026nbsptargeted by the central bank does not include the costs of owning and maintaining a home nor council tax.Clothing and footwear prices were among the very few components of the CPI that fell last month and at a much slower pace than in May.The steady course of inflation looks unlikely to last.\u0026nbspSamuel Tombs, chief UK\u0026nbspeconomist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said in a comment on Twitter that a weaker pound and a recent pick-up in wage growth point to higher inflation ahead.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThe pound fell to its lowest level against the dollar in more than two years on Tuesday after the two contenders to be Britain’s next prime minister promised\u0026nbspto scrap the Irish backstop, amplifying\u0026nbspfears of a no-deal Brexit.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Tariffs in the event of a no-deal Brexit  Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.There will be tariffs on pork in order to protect British farmersThere will be tariffs in place on some cheeses including €22.10100kg of cheddar, €19.10100kg of processed cheese and €18.60100kg on some blue cheesesThere will be no tariffs in place on milkThere will be no tariffs on car parts imported from EuropeThere will be no tariffs on alcoholic drinks - except on some rums due to ingredients used in their distilling processThere will be tariffs on beef in order to protect British farmersThere will be no tariffs on many types of fish including cod, haddock, salmon and sea bass915 Fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on almost all fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on chocolate or other cocoa productsThere will be tariffs on poultry in order to protect British farmersThere will be some tariffs in place on ceramisThere will be no tariffs on steelThere will be no tariffs on coalThere will be tariffs on the meat of sheep in order to protect British farmersThere will be tariffs on pork in order to protect British farmersThere will be tariffs in place on some cheeses including €22.10100kg of cheddar, €19.10100kg of processed cheese and €18.60100kg on some blue cheesesThere will be no tariffs in place on milkThere will be no tariffs on car parts imported from EuropeThere will be no tariffs on alcoholic drinks - except on some rums due to ingredients used in their distilling processThere will be tariffs on beef in order to protect British farmersThere will be no tariffs on many types of fish including cod, haddock, salmon and sea bass915 Fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on almost all fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on chocolate or other cocoa productsThere will be tariffs on poultry in order to protect British farmersThere will be some tariffs in place on ceramisThere will be no tariffs on steelThere will be no tariffs on coalThere will be tariffs on the meat of sheep in order to protect British farmersMeanwhile, official data showed that growth in UK wages accelerated in the three months to May compared with a year earlier.\u0026nbspBut a disorderly Brexit risks giving a much bigger boost to inflation, as Suren Thiru,\u0026nbsphead of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce, explained.“Such an outcome would probably trigger a significant decline in the value of sterling, pushing inflation materially higher and increasing the financial squeeze on businesses and households,” he said.The Brexit vote has already contributed to a bigger fall in living standards than the recession of the early 1990s, research by the Resolution Foundation has found.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspSeparate official figures also published on Wednesday showed that UK house prices climbed by 1.2 per cent in the year to May compared with a 1.5 per cent rise in the year to April.

Kopechne did not.\u0026nbspChappaquiddick island, detailing how the events unfolded (Getty)Kennedy claimed he made several attempts to save her before giving up and returning to the party on foot.Later, he said\u0026nbsphe returned\u0026nbspwith two friends for another rescue attempt but that was foiled by the strong tide.Ten hours passed before the\u0026nbspsenator reported the incident to the police, minutes before Kopechne’s body was recovered from the vehicle.\u0026nbspJohn Farrar, the er who recovered the corpse, said he believed she died from suffocation rather than drowning, trapped potentially for hours in a small air pocket inside the car.Just a week after the crash on 25 July, Kennedy pleaded guilty to a charge of leaving the scene of an accident and received a suspended two-month prison sentence, the statutory minimum for the offence.Ted Kennedy\u0027s \u0027night in a Chilean brothel\u0027 is revealed FBI filesHis attorneys had argued he should be granted a lenient sentence by the judge, due to his age, character and prior reputation.\u0026nbspThat night the senator made a speech in which he insisted he had not been driving under the influence of alcohol at the time of the crash, as well as denying “widely circulated suspicions of immoral conduct” surrounding his relationship with Kopechne.He\u0026nbspdescribed his decision not to immediately report the incident to the police as “indefensible”, stating that he was overcome by a “jumble of emotions—grief, fear, doubt, exhaustion, panic, confusion, and shock.”An inquest would later conclude there was “probable cause to believe” Kennedy had been operating the vehicle negligently.\u0026nbspKennedy’s inaction caused significant damage to his reputation.Prior to the incident, he was popular throughout the country and was seen by many to follow in the footsteps of his brothers, John and Robert, by running for the presidency.\u0026nbspFive years before the crash, Kennedy had been re-elected to the senate with 75 per cent of the vote.\u0026nbspIn an election 15 months after the crash, his margin of victory was reduced to 64 per cent.\u0026nbspHe did not run in the 1972 or 1976 presidential race, a decision likely taken as a result of Kopechne’s death.\u0026nbspKopechne’s funeral (Getty)When Kennedy decided to run in 1980, renewed interest in the Chappaquiddick incident hindered his campaign.His Democratic primary opponent, then-president Jimmy Carter, frequently called into question Kennedy’s character by alluding to the events on the resort island.\u0026nbspAfter a failed campaign, Kennedy abandoned his White House dreams. He went on to serve in the Senate for another four decades until his death.In Kennedy’s posthumous memoir, True Compass, he called the incident a “horrible tragedy that haunts me every day of life.”\u0026nbspThe Edward M Kennedy Institute for the United States Senate, a body created in honour of his 47 years of service in the Senate, has no plans to commemorate the incident and the death of Kopechne.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

She needed 374 votes to reach the threshold to be elected, meaning she scraped through by just nine votes.Ms Von der Leyen, who was nominated by EU leaders earlier this month,\u0026nbspis the first woman to hold the top job in Brussels. The European Commission is the union’s executive arm and is responsible for proposing EU law, enforcing its treaties, and representing the interests of the bloc as a whole on the world stage.\u0026nbspShe is due to take office on 1 November after a handover period during which her cabinet of commissioners, one from each member state, will be chosen and their portfolios allocated. She has pledged to achieve gender balance in the top team – but could face a showdown with member state governments, who may have other candidates in mind as their commissioners.The German politician’s appointment is controversial because she\u0026nbspwas not a lead\u0026nbspcandidate in the EU elections last month. The European parliament had previously said that the next commission president should have been on the ballot paper during the contest and campaigned across the EU, under the so-called “spitzenkandidat” system.New EU commission cabinet will be half women, says Juncker replacementUrsula von der Leyen: the German minister set to run the EUEU leaders back Ursula von der Leyen to be commission presidentBut a majority of\u0026nbspMEPs gave Ms Von der Leyen their backing anyway after national leaders called their bluff and proposed a candidate who was not available to vote for. She was opposed by MEPs from the green and left groups in the parliament, but supported by the centre-right and the liberals. The centre-left socialist group was split, with some countries’ parties such as the German SPD opposing the appointment and others such as Labour supporting it.“The trust you placed in me is the confidence you placed in Europe,” she told MEPs in her acceptance speech.\u0026nbsp“Your confidence in a united and a strong Europe, from east to west, from south to north. Your confidence in a Europe that is ready to fight for the future rather than fighting against each other. Your confidence in a Europe that will take the big challenges of our times together.

Mr Vardi\u0026nbspdescribed\u0026nbspthe complex society as the ancient equivalent of Jerusalem or Tel Aviv – “a real metropolis”.Before the discovery, it was widely believed the entire area had been uninhabited in the period, during which people were still shifting from hunting to a more sedentary lifestyle.Created with Sketch.Archaeologists uncover nearly 5,000 cave paintings in Burgos, Mexico Show all 4Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.One of 5,000 cave paintings uncovered in north MexicoMexican National Institute of Anthropology One of 5,000 cave paintings uncovered in north MexicoMexican National Institute of Anthropology One of 5,000 cave paintings uncovered in north MexicoMexican National Institute of Anthropology One of 5,000 cave paintings uncovered in north MexicoMexican National Institute of Anthropology One of 5,000 cave paintings uncovered in north MexicoMexican National Institute of Anthropology One of 5,000 cave paintings uncovered in north MexicoMexican National Institute of Anthropology One of 5,000 cave paintings uncovered in north MexicoMexican National Institute of Anthropology One of 5,000 cave paintings uncovered in north MexicoMexican National Institute of Anthropology The ruins were only uncovered during a preliminary survey conducted for the construction of a new highway in the area.A wider excavation exposed large buildings, alleyways and burial places, evidence of a relatively advanced level of planning, the antiquities authority said in a statement.“This is most probably the largest excavation of this time period in the Middle East, which will allow the research to advance leaps and bounds ahead of where we are today, just by the amount of material that we are able to save and preserve from this site,” said Lauren Davis, an archaeologist with the antiquities team.Vardi at Motza site (AFPGetty Images)The team also found storage sheds that contained large quantities of legumes, particularly lentils, whose seeds were remarkably preserved throughout the millennia.Also found were flint tools, including thousands of arrowheads, axes for chopping down trees, sickle blades and knives.“This finding is evidence of an intensive practice of agriculture,” according to the\u0026nbspIAA statement. “Animal bones found on the site show that the settlement’s residents became increasingly specialised in sheep-keeping, while the use of hunting for survival gradually decreased.”Additional reporting by ReutersOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Pundits give him an agonising  days from next Tuesday to honour that promise.In fact, we will know in an instantBrexit — and Boris — will live or die.The moment will come, perhaps on his first day, as he names the man or woman to prise the Treasury from the cold, dead hands of Chancellor Philip Hammond.If Boris picks Sajid Javid, Matt Hancock or Liz Truss — or anyone  who voted Remain — .million Brits can kiss goodbye to their dream of leaving the European Union.We will end up with a just another bodged version of Theresa May’s BRINO sell-out — Brexit in Name Only. It will be the beginning and the end of King BoJo the First.There will be no second chances. The next Chancellor of the Exchequer must be a proven Brexiteer in word and deedBoris has a chance of surviving his  days.The Treasury is the most powerful and implacable enemy of Brexit. “The new Chancellor needs three key qualities,” says a source close to Boris.“They must have a Brexit pedigree, absolute loyalty to Boris and the intellectual self-confidence to take on Whitehall and the Treasury.”Qualities such as these are scarce in the present Cabinet. The final choice is likely to surprise everyone, especially Remainers.Some names mentioned to me would, to say the least, offer a bracing challenge to pro-EU establishment fanatics who spent the past three years sabotaging the  referendum.Unless the new Chancellor takes them head-on, those forces will crush both Boris and Brexit. Observers have identied the tank traps and sniper nests facing the new PM.He is up against a Remain-dominated Parliament aided by slippery Speaker Bercow, an army of civil service mandarins skilled in the machinery of government and covering fire from BBC propagandists.In the face of such overwhelming odds, a pro-Leave PM is surely doomed to fail. Not so. Despite appearances, Boris has a plan.He will fly immediately to Brussels with a genuine bid to reopen Theresa May’s botched withdrawal agreement.He would seek a clear path out of the EU customs union, single market and European Court jurisdiction, plus a sensible solution to the Northern Ireland border issue.The alternative will be for Britain to leave the EU on October  with No Deal. Unless much has changed, Brussels will say: “Non!” Boris will announce he has no option but to call a snap “No Deal” election.Remainers are appalled at the idea, and for good reason. Poll after poll suggests No Deal Boris would win with an outright majority — at their expense.The public is sick to the back teeth with Theresa May’s dreary defeatism and Brussels’ bullying. Remain voters want this sorted, too.Elections are always risky. But a Tory Party still dithering and paralysed on the biggest issue of the age is the greatest risk of all. Right now, the omens are promising. Labour is committing ritual suicide, shedding voters in droves.Millions of Tory defectors would flock back to a party committed to a final, irreversible Brexit taking us past the October  dead-line and sucking support from Nigel Farage and his Brexit Party.In the intervening weeks, a Boris regime could recruit voters abandoned by both major parties over crime, low pay, high taxes and housing.According to the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, blue- collar voters on less than £, a year, are “up for grabs like never before”.If Boris Johnson has one proven gt, it is for winning against the odds. In fact, despite gloom-mongers, the odds could not be better.To quote Boris, there is an appetite among voters for optimism . . .  stepping off the “hamster wheel of doom”. So brace yourselves for an early general election, folks — and round two of King BoJo.In a PC world gone mad, this is surely the moment to bring in the men women gender non-specic folk in white coats.People now risk losing their livelihoods for invented “hate crimes” on transgender bullying, Islamic extremism or mass immigration.Now Theresa May is transiting into Big Brother by threatening to punish newspapers who publish embarrassing leaks.It is George Orwell’s nightmare novel  brought terryingly to le.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It has threatened journalists, too, that they face prosecutionthey dare to publish the content of the cables.Trying to justy his threats, the Met’s Assistant Commissioner, Neil Basu, said he was sure the leaks had “damaged UK international relations” and on that basis no one publishing the leaks could plead a public interest defence.What a ludicrous over-reaction to what is really no more than a diplomatic spat over the Ferrero Rochers.Sure, it doesn’t exactly help UK US relations when our Ambassador calls the President of the United States “inept” and his administration “uniquely dysal”.But I would say it is mildly less damaging than some of the things that the Leader of Opposition, the Mayor of London and Scotland’s First Minister have said about Donald Trump. I can’t see Mr Basu dangling his handcuffs in front of them — and neither should he.Obviously, Sir Kim has reason to feel aggrieved that someone — presumably in the diplomatic service or the Foreign Office, because there is no evidence of computers being hacked — has leaked information he intended to be private. But it is a matter for the Government to investigate, not the police.How ridiculous Basu has said of the leaker: “You are now also responsible for erting busy detectives from under-taking their core mission.”No, Mr Basu — it is only thanks to your decision that officers have been taken off front-line duties to undertake this investigation.You could have told officials what police officers are forever telling the rest of us when we report our houses broken into or our bikes stolen: Sorry, but we’ve got too much  to do.It would be a dferent mattersomeone had leaked material that really did harm national security.The sort of information leaked by Kim Philby and his Soviet-sympathising accomplices in the s put British lives at risk.But leaking and publishing a diplomat’s private thoughts hardly comes into that category. Mr Basu’s attack on the principles of the free Press echoes Operation Elveden, the failed attempt by the Met to criminalise journalists who had obtained information from police officers, in some cases for money.The Met switched more than  police officers from other duties and arrested  people. The police probe cost taxpayers £.million and yet of  journalists charged, only one was convicted at trial — and that was quashed on appeal. Just one journalist, Dan Evans, pleaded guilty to an Elveden offence and was given a suspended sentence.The prosecutions relied on an ancient offence, Misconduct in Public Office, which was only ever supposed to apply to public servants, not journalists.As many lawyers, including the Lord Chief Justice, pointed out, it simply isn’t a criminal offence for someone to receive or to publish most forms of state information — only for a public official to sell it.There is a very good reason for this. Leaks, and the freedom to put their contents into the public domain, are an essential ingredient of our democracy. It is what helps the Press to keep in check corrupt or over-bearing politicians and public officials.Without the freedom to publish leaked information, for example, we would never have known the extent to which MPs and Lords were abusing their expenses regime.That required a newspaper to publish information gleaned from a computer disk which had been stolen — but thankfully in that case the Met decided that the public interest over-rode a possible offence of handling stolen goods.Without the Panama Papers we would never have known the extent to which wealthy iniduals and corporations have gone into keeping their wealth out of the taxman’s grasp. Without the “climategate” leaks we would not have known how some climate scientists were prepared to manipulate past temperature records to support their theories.It took a leak, too, to establish that the Blair government knew it was unlikely that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, but that George W Bush had resolved to overthrow Saddam regardless.Then there was “Plebgate”, when a leaked police log revealed a bust-up between government chief whip Andrew Mitchell and police manning the gates at Downing Street — and led an officer to be jailed when it was revealed he had invented his witness statement.There are, of course, plenty of other countries in the world where journalists would be locked up for publishing information that has leaked from the government, but they are not countries in which most of us would want to live.By over-reacting to what is an embarrassment to the Foreign Office, the Met has taken a leaf out of the book of President Erdogan of Turkey, who has locked up dozens of journalists as he attempts to suppress all opposition to his regime.Neil Basu and other senior Met Police officers should back off and accept that the Press is quite within its rights to publish leaked information that does not threaten national security.We are, after all, one of the world’s oldest ing democracies — not a tinpot state where people get led off in chains for daring to reveal the truth. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I respect women very much.”Like Mick Jagger, who is said to have bedded around , women, the Spanish crooner joined the ranks of Warren Beatty, Errol Flynn, Jack Nicholson and the notorious lover Casanova as one of history’s great seducers.Back then, such, ahem, swordsmanship was admired.

The British boozer is in crisis.More than a quarter of all pubs have closed in the past two decades, from , in  to ,, according to the Office for National Statistics. We are losing three pubs a day. At this rate we will see the end of the British pub within our letime.So I got together with two friends who, like me, had never been in the licensed trade, to rescue this wonderful, warm, welcoming, Grade II listed building so everyone can continue to enjoy it. And I am not alone.I know of whole communities that have got together through crowd funding to save their local, with £.million being raised through internet donations for ious establishments last year.People are coming to realise that we can’t afford to lose these treasured spaces. There is no social network that can beat the pub, particularly in a world so insular where people have their noses in a mobile phone the whole time.It is so important people sit up and have a good chat, whether it is with a stranger at the bar or one of the staff. Workers come in after grafting and want to speak to the barmaid about what a hard day they’ve had, about the van breaking down or the tractor engine blowing up.Pubs often have football teams, darts, dominoes, quiz nights and are a venue where many great bands played their first gigs. In other places you will find a small shop at the local, because the village one has closed.At The Half Moon we sponsor the village cricket team, have Women’s Institute meetings with tea and cake in the morning, charity events and people come to celebrate weddings, birthdays and anniversaries.And no, nanny state meddlers, this isn’t about encouraging drinking, it’s about popping down to the local for a pint once or twice a week, which isn’t going to do any harm.The pub is now a place that families visit and I want everyone to treat it as their home.  My mum is in the garden, my dad helps out and my son Indio comes in to ask our head barman: “Can I have the usual please” — by which he means an apple juice and a packet of crisps.I had noticed pubs closing, but I hadn’t realised the reason until I became a landlady myself. Someone needs to give this industry a break. Landlords and land–ladies can only make tiny margins on the beer they sell, due to the high taxes they have to pay.That’s why I got involved with the Long Live The Local campaign last year to help pressure the Government into freezing beer duty. Everything is trying to kill this incredible part of British culture, whether it’s business rates, beer tax or sugar tax.Our rates are three times the European average and we pay almost  per cent of all beer duty across the EU, while drinking only  per cent of the beer. But the industry employs around , — many of them young people — and puts £BILLION into the economy.I can’t thank The Sun enough for its support in helping our campaign. I don’t think we would have received as many signatures without the help of you, the readers. Thankfully, the Chancellor listened to our case, agreeing in the last budget not to raise duty on beer.Sin taxes are high enough already and I hope the next Prime Minister will give us a break. It was an honour to be named  Beer Drinker Of The Year by the All-Party Parliamentary Beer Group, which promotes the unique role of the pub in our society.Certainly there is hope that this great institution can survive by changing with the times and adapting to new tastes.  It is amazing seeing all the microbreweries and gin distilleries starting up, with a new generation enthusiastic about real ingredients.The gastro pub movement also offers customers the quality food they desire. We were proud that our restaurant received two AA rosettes for culinary excellence in the first six months.But there is also a need for a pub to be a pub, where customers can come in with their wellies or work boots. At The Half Moon we have good dining on one side and an old-fashioned fireplace that drinkers can gather round on the other.For the first year I was there all the time, but now it’s wiping its own nose, so I go in two or three times a week — it’s my other jobs that pay the mortgage.

Someone who denies what they appear to be, who professes to be one of the good guys working for a better world in which there just happens to be fewer of one sort of person, is harder still, because they simply refuse to be diagnosed.  Weaposre living in a world where absolutely everyone is racist. Donald Trump is a white racist. He says his critics are black racists. Jeremy Corbyn is called an anti-Semite. His supporters say Jews are Islamophobes. The comfortable, globe-spanning civilisation we lived in about  years ago has become a place filled with tribes who tell everyone  theyaposre in the wrong tribe.Thing is, the rest of the world has always been like that. Where the white enslaved the black, where those left behind warred with neighbours, where the Chinese now fight for control with Russians, where Nigerians or Australians or Venezuelans or Hutus or Tutsis are blamed for the remainder of problems. Itaposs just that now, everyone on the planet has the same madness. The Westaposs problem is not racism. It is that its tribe has shrunk - the us is no longer NATO, the United Nations, Europe, or the special relationship. Every tie that bound us into a larger group has been severed in a funding row of some sort, and the only tribes we have left are the ones we were born into.So a Jew who found a home in the Labour Party is now just a Jew. A Muslim whose values chimed with the Tories is now talking at mosque, not the constituency association. And a white Briton, like a white American, is ing to the past.Everyoneaposs going back to where they came from, and hates it.  Racism won when Donald Trump was elected leader of the Free World, that loose tribe we used to be members of. A man who said Mexicans were all rapists, who refused to let apartments to blacks  years ago, shouted at us until we were numbed. Like a patient whoaposs had too much electro-shock therapy, weaposre dazedly asking ourselves whether racism is really that racist.Because Trump says it, the same question is asked on radio phone-ins, on TV talk shows, in newspaper columns, pubs, workplaces, family dinners. The rest of the world is awful, says a tribe that doesnapost notice its own failings. Why donapost the awful people fix their awfulness  Thataposs pretty awful too, butyouaposre offended at that theyaposll be offended right back. For once, there really ARE good people on both sides, taking offence at the suggestion their tribe is less than perfect and the other might just be right.And now all of them are asking, out loud, what your ethnicity is, and comparing it to their own.   If tribalism was a good idea, weaposd all be happier right now. Africa would have been the most cheerful place on the planet for centuries, and the Labour Party would be thriving on its splits.But tribes make us smaller. Smaller in the head, in ambition, in influence and in power. A single building block cannot build a damned thing, and reducing ourselves to a unit of our birth is like evolution in reverse.We are at the edge of the swamp, looking at a place filled with things that slither and crawl, where there are no alliances and lots of death. A place where four legal citizens of a nation are called disloyal for wanting it to be a better place, where there are more guns than there are people, and where nutjobs call themselves a well-regulated militia able to gun down any target they choose.They forget that those who were dferent were the ones who survived the swamp. They grew fins and gills, then legs and lungs, and decided to live somewhere better.   If you are asked your ethnicity, there is only one answer. We are all % African. Thereaposs not a human on the planet who is indigenous aside from those who live in the Great Rt Valley of East Africa, and thereaposs no room for us all to go back there. Yet we introduce domestic abuse legislation that does not apply to migrants, and we free victims of human trafficking and send them right back to the places where they were enslaved. Trump is not responsible for the tribalism which has infected our race. Heaposs just ridden a wave which started in the  financial crisis, a wave similar to the one which started in the Great Depression and brought us the Nazis.But his praise of Nazis, his uttering of Nazi tropes, his constant ision of humans into smaller units, has enabled the same things to be discussed and done where in the world. Get rid of him, and America will have enabled the rest of the world to straighten its tie and tell the Nazis to shut up. Trumpaposs tribalism is useful. It will, one day soon, cause the USA to question its founding principles, reinvent its dream, correct the religious fundamentalism, slavery and narrow-mindedness with which it has been cursed for  years, and rebuild. That cannot, and will not, happen without Trump to kick against - evolution requires an existential threat.    When America unites, others will follow. Perhaps because tribalism just had its day, and perhaps because of coincidental global economic growth. But itaposs a matter of when, not , because innovation and improvement is inevitable in everything, except minds of hardliners in ISIS and the Republican Party.Death will come to Trump, one day, and maybe even the taxman. The voters will probably take him first, along with the financial realities of trade wars. If you ide your enemies, all you get is more enemies. Brexit is a dead end. Corbyn has nothing to do but fail. Putin, Duterte, Salvini, all aposstrong menapos rely upon tribes that do not question them, because they cannot withstand a question.When this tribalism dies - and it will - you must make sure to kill it everywhere. It lived on in Africa, Asia and the Pacic Rim because you left them behind, last time. Progressive is not an insult. Itaposs the only way forward, and everyone needs to move. We are not racist. We are the human race, a team of billions who all want to live somewhere better. Letaposs make humanity great again. ,,],totalVotes:,votesToShow:,mentometerId:,publicationId:,callbackUrl:https:www.mirror poll-ws poll  status,voteActionUrl:https:www.mirror poll-ws poll  vote,closed:,closedMessage:This poll has been closed!,hideResults:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : # , title : Mirror Politics , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true\""},{"url":null,"title":"kevin pietersen there nothing fair","story":"NewsopinionKevin Pietersens open letter to Michael Gove: Its not a sport to shoot a lion for funThe former English cricketer has written a letter to Michael Gove calling for a ban on trophy huntingShareCommentsByKevin Pietersen:,  JUL Updated:,  JUL NewsopinionKevin Pietersensays its time we ALL hit trophy hunting for six \"Get the biggest politics stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailDear Michael Gove, In your exclusive article for the Daily Mirror yesterday, you say you find trophy hunting troubling and are planning to call for evidence about its impacts. When we met a few weeks ago, I asked you to ban imports of hunting trophies. You declined.You claimed trophy hunting could be good for conservation. This is the absurd argument peddled by the trophy hunting industry.They will doubtless now lobby you furiously following your article.Don’t listen to their lies. Trophy hunters are not conservationists.They are people who kill animals for fun. They then make up excuses to try and justy their so-called ‘sport’. If trophy hunting was good for conservation, why have lion populations fallen from , in the s to just , today  Why have elephant numbers fallen from over  million in the s to just , today  Why are rhinos, cheetahs, leopards, hippos and giraffes ALL in serious trouble     Trophy hunters kill huge numbers of endangered animals every year, and – incredibly - this government lets them. You have to get an import permit from the government before going off to Africa to shoot one of them. Britain lets its trophy hunters shoot cheetahs. Even the Trump administration doesn’t allow that. We’re one of the worst countries in the world for hunting elephants. We’re also one of the worst when it comes to ‘canned lion hunting’. This is the disgusting practice of breeding lions in factory farms so that cowards can shoot them in enclosures. British values are all about fairness. There is NOTHING fair about shooting a tame lion in a cage. But don’t just ban canned lion trophies. We need to ban ALL wildle trophies. British hunters are shooting hippos, leopards, zebras, bears, baboons, and even monkeys. And the number of animals shot is climbing. What sort of legacy are we leaving our children     Britain is a signatory to CITES, the international law that prohibits trade in endangered wildle. But CITES says its rules don’t apply to trophy hunting. Why  Because apparently trophy hunting is not a ‘commercial’ industry. How is an industry worth  million not commercial  Trophy hunters can pay up to £, for their sick expeditions! You have rightly condemned poaching. We need to condemn trophy hunting too.When you poach a rhino, you kill it and take its body parts. When you trophy hunt a rhino, you do the same.The poacher sells the horn to make money. The trophy hunter sticks the rhino head over his fireplace.   It doesn’t matter what we label the killer. The fact is the rhino is dead. Michael, you worked hard to bring in the Ivory Bill. You introduced tougher sentences for animal cruelty. You have a chance right now to leave a lasting legacy.

Damian Green was a Government adviser when he issued the claim in  during a post-mortem into why the city failed to win a bid to host the  Olympics. The Games were eventually held in Sydney. Files unveiled by the National Archives today show he said: “The reason for Manchester’s failure is the obvious of one: that no-one in their right mind would spend three weeks in Manchester rather than Sydney. “It is hard to imagine Manchester ever being successful.”    Manchester’s doomed bid to host the “greatest show on Earth” failed because of Britain’s arrogance and its reliance on former glories, Recently declassied notes of the Downing Street inquest, carried out in February , into why the International Olympic Committee picked the Australian city over Manchester offered a list of reasons why the North West was snubbed. No aide Alex Allan pulled no punches in his assessment of where the failures lay, according to files released by the National Archives. “We have had too many nice old buffers running things or representing Britain on international sporting bodies,” he said in a dispatch to Prime Minister John Major. Mr Allan highlighted examples such as Mary Glen-Haig, an Olympian at the London Games in , and sports administrator Marea Hartman, who died aged  the year after the bid failed. “We have also adopted rather an arrogant attitude, based either on past glories or on a belief that many of those now running international sporting bodies are corrupt and or power-mad,” Mr Allan added. “Some probably are - but we didn’t win any friends by saying so.” Manchester went on to successfully host the  Commonwealth Games.    The secret files also contained a previously unseen speech which would have celebrated Manchester’s victory in the  Olympic bid. Mr Major would have commended Britain’s “world-beating success”. The draft, entitled “Prime Minister’s statement: If Manchester wins”, added: “We faced some stf competition. “This success shows that when we put our minds to something in Britain, we are world-beaters. “We went for gold and got it.” "},{"url":null,"title":"theresa mays final speech prime","story":"NewsopinionTheresa Mays final speech as Prime Minister - what she said and what she meantIt was her final speech as Prime Minister.

She attacked people who are adversarial but weaposre sure she didnapost mean Doanld Trump. And she attacked people who say theyaposll do things without getting them done, but weaposre sure she didnapost mean Boris Johnson. In fact, here is a whole list of very pertinent things the Prime Minister said without referring to any one person. And, alongside, is what we think she meant.   WHAT SHE SAID: Today an inability to combine principles with pragmatism - and make a compromise when required - seems to have driven our whole political discourse down the wrong path... Persuasion, teamwork and a willingness to make mutual concessions are needed to achieve an optimal outcome. WHAT SHE MEANT: This attack comes days after Boris Johnson said heaposd refuse to compromise over Brexit. The Tory leadership frontrunner said he would not accept  a time limit or exit clause to the Northern Ireland backstop clause of Mrs Mayaposs deal. Already last night Amber Rudd, a Cabinet minister, warned that view will collide with reality. Now Theresa May seems to be joining the warnings too.On aposadversarialapos world politics   WHAT SHE SAID: This absolutism is not confined to British politics... we see it in the increasingly adversarial nature of international relations, which some view as a zero sum game where one country can only gainothers lose. And where power, unconstrained by rules, is the only currency of value. This absolutism at home and abroad is the opposite of politics at its best. It refuses to accept that other points of view are reasonable. It ascribes bad motives to those taking those dferent views. WHAT SHE MEANT: This one comes after more than two years of Donald Trump wielding his raw power through his aggressive, often rude, occasionally racist Twitter account. The President branded Mrs May foolish after she refused to take his advice to sue the EU. And he branded the UK Ambassador to the US wacky. It could of course refer to many other world leaders too, and Mrs May went on to attack Russiaaposs Vladimir Putin by name."},{"url":null,"title":"day life woman 101 who","story":"NewsDay in le of woman, , who faces having free TV licence taken by mean GovernmentElsie Allcock, , says TV keeps me in touch with le and asks why the Government want to take it awayShareCommentsByRachael Bletchly:,  JUL Updated:,  JUL Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news video pensioners-slam-plans-scrap-free-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true\"\"Get the biggest politics stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailWeaposve got a cuppa and a slice of lemon drizzle as we watch a bit of Time Team.

Kass Stone and his family have slammed holiday firm TUI, claiming they made a terrible situation worse by refusing to move them from the contaminated cabin. Footage shows ankle-deep brownish water in the cabin which the Stones claim, even after heavy cleaning, stank for the remainder of the break. Kass, from Bexley, London, paid £, for the Adriatic cruise aboard the Marella Celebration, which departed from Dubrovnik on Thursday, May . The -year-old, his we and two children were sharing the cabin when raw sewage started bubbling up through the shower.  Kass said: We had to put up with this damp, unclean water smell and you just never really felt clean, you just felt dirty the whole time and we had to sit there for a whole week. It ruined the holiday, it got to the point where we dreaded going back to the cabin. After informing staff on board the ship, the drain was fixed but the family claim nobody came to clean up the mess until Kass complained again. Eventually a large heater was brought in to speed up the drying process, but Kass says the noise and heat from the machine only made matters worse as the awful stench became overpowering in the sweltering heat. Another video from Kass shows the heater in action, the loud whirring audible in the background as he can be heard saying sarcastically: Lots of loud machinery, right next to where we sleep, for the third day going - yay. The family was also unable to use their bathroom for the remainder of the holiday, forcing them to shower in the shipaposs public spa - much to the embarrassment of Kassapos two children aged,  and six. Kass said: My children were incredibly excited about the trip, but they were both so embarrassed about having to shower in a public spa. It took the wind out of the sails really, we donapost make a fortune and we saved up and the kids were excited, but now itaposs ruined. After getting no response to his complaint from TUI, Kass took to Facebook to vent his frustrations.He wrote: Our cabin flooded with waste water, no alternative accommodation offered in spite of persistent stench, wet carpet and overall unhygienic conditions, especially for two young children. The cruise was ruined and Tui Marella have not responded to our complaint over a month later. Is this how you treat customers  Kass says the family was offered £ of on-board credit as compensation, but added that this is not enough.

She was gripped by an overwhelming fear – convinced thatshe fell asleep, she would die. “Counting my breaths was the only way I could reassure myself that I was still alive and everything was OK,” says the mum-of three, , who lives in Surrey. Rachael was suffering from a rare sleep phobia, which developed after her two young sons were diagnosed with autism. Craig, Rachael’s husband, was in the armed forces and often worked away from home. And when he wasn’t there, Rachael would spend night after night wide awake. “I was terried thatI died in my sleep no one would find me or my ­children, and they wouldn’t be able to get help. “I’d worry about whether they’d survive until their dad got home.”    Often, Rachael would lie awake until am, only nodding off for a few minutes before her children woke up. “I was exhausted. But I was too afraid to let myself go to sleep and I thought that at leastI was awake, I knew I wasn’t dead.” Rachael is mum to Christopher, now five, and Jacob, three, who are both on the autistic spectrum, and Matthew,  months. Christopher was about six months when Rachael realised something wasn’t right. He didn’t want to be cuddled and would have uncontrollable meltdowns. He also had seizures where he would stare into space for minutes at a time. Eventually Rachael sought help from her health visitor and, after many tests, Christopher was diagnosed with autism when he was two. Rachael knew early on that his brother Jacob was just like him. “Jacob was only eight weeks when I realised he was autistic because he didn’t copy me when I poked my tongue out. He didn’t even look at me and I just knew.” Determined her boys would get all the help they needed, she read every bit of research on autism she could get her hands on and arranged portage training in her home, a type of early intervention therapy that develops learning in small steps. “I was % committed,” she recalls. But when Rachael was  weeks pregnant with Matthew, everything started to get on top of her. Craig, who had transferred to the Grenadier Guards in Aldershot, was retraining as a mechanic so he could eventually spend more time with the family. But this meant he would be away for a year, leaving Rachael alone. It was then that the sleep phobia really took off and before long Rachael says she was “like a zombie”. “The tiredness made me feel I was going insane. I was a mess. I was trying to keep everything together during the day and it all came out at night. Inside I was at breaking point.”    Rachael’s anxiety ­worsened and she became convinced she was ill. “If I had discomfort in my stomach, I was sure it was cancer. If I was anxious, it was a heart attack. Leg cramps were blood clots. “I lost weight when I was supposed to be gaining because I was pregnant. I was torturing myself, I was so desperate to stay alive. Sometimes I’d think ‘ anything is wrong with me, let it happen quickly as I can’t cope with this any more’. “I made sure everyone  was OK but I got lost and forgot about me. The doctor’s receptionist recognised my voice because I was calling the surgery so often.” Eventually, Rachael realised she had to get help and she booked an ­appointment with her doctor “I said, ‘I know it sounds crazy but I’m terried of going to sleep at night’.” Therapist Russell Hoyles, who works at Fairfield Independent Hospital, St Helens, Merseyside, says: “Sleep dread or somniphobia is a sleep disorder associated with anxiety and fear around going to sleep. Trauma, frequent nightmares, sleep paralysisand fear of something bad happening while you sleep, such as burglary or fire, are all recognised triggers. “Sufferers often feel distress and even panic as it gets closer to bedtime and can experience physical symptoms such as tightness in the chest and hyperventilation.“Even when a sufferer does sleep, the quality of sleep is poor and fitful, which has a debilitating impact on day-to-le, emotional wellbeing, concentration and relationships. “The number of sufferers is hard to quanty, but we do know a signicant proportion, at least a third of the population, experience some type of sleep disorder.“Indeed, one of the most common, insomnia, can develop into ‘sleep dread’, especially when the insomnia is related to a physical condition. “Treatment depends on the inidual but starts with good sleep habits such as avoiding caffeine before bed.“Medication can help with the symptoms but understanding and devising strategies to address the problem using talking therapies such as cognitive behaviour therapy, counselling and relaxation can also help.”"},{"url":null,"title":"jet2 passenger who led raf","story":"NewsJet passenger who stormed cockpit and shouted Ill kill you all gets £, billChloe Haines was arrested on suspicion of assault and endangering an aircraft after shaken passengers claimed she screamed “I’m going to kill everyone” during the mid-air rampageShareByMartin Fricker:,  JUL Updated:,  JUL Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news uk-news video exclusive-jet-passenger-arrested-stansted-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true\"\"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA female holidaymaker who allegedly tried to storm the cockpit of a packed Jet plane has been slapped with an £, bill by the airline.

Joe Blackaby, , was bitten by the tick while at Reading Festival, but simply pulled the tiny bug from his leg and thought nothing of it. When Joe, from Caldicot, Wales, woke up feeling unwell the next morning, he brushed it off as a hangover. But when Joeaposs health continued to deteriorate, he knew something was wrong with his body and went to see his GP. Incredibly, it took three years for the -year-old to be diagnosed with Lyme disease - an infection caused by bacteria spread by ticks. Joe said the disease, contracted at the festival in , has taken his le away and has left him struggling to walk, talk and do simple tasks without feeling exhausted. He also has major problems with memory, cannot focus his vision and suffers spasms similar to a Parkinsonaposs patient.    Joe said: Itaposs an awful feeling watching your body deteriorate so rapidly, yet I would do anything to get better from this disease. He claimed that so little is known about his condition that doctors in Wales do not know how to treat him. My doctor has given up on me getting better, but I have not given up on myself, he added. In most cases patients begin to improve following a three-week course of antibiotics, but in Joeaposs case it has lasted six years and counting.  Stick to paths - Try not to stray from paths and avoid overhanging vegetation unlessnecessary. Ticks do not jump or fly so sticking to clear areas without tallgrass or shrubs will decrease the chances of being bitten. If in an areawhere there is no footpath, try and avoid tall grass or shady areas that aresurrounded by shrubs. Light Clothing - When in areas of woodland remained covered, wear long sleeve tops andfull- trousers. Protect areas such as the back of the knees, armpitsand the groin area. Opt for light coloured clothing in order to easilyidenty any ticks present that may become attached. Footwear - Wellies are not only reserved for rainy days and are perfect when in highrisk areas, as you can tuck trousers into the wellie boots. Tucking trousersinto socks is also a great defence mechanismwellies are not an option. Regular checks - Ticks are very small and hard to identy when not paying attention. Checkregularly whilst outside and also when home in order to remove any feedingticks. The longer a tick is left attached the harder it is to remove. Right tools - Avoid any home remedies to try and remove ticks such as covering theaffected area of the body in Vaseline or nail nish or even burning themoff. Instead, use a tick removal tool, which are sold in outdoor shops and somesupermarkets and pharmacies. This will help avoid aggravating the tick andlower the risk of secondary infection. When removed, use an antiseptic wipeand be aware of any symptoms of Lyme disease   He said the infection has affected most of his major organs, including his heart and left him with debilitating neurological issues. Every day is a battle to keep fighting, added Joe who used to be a keen surfer. I have memory issues and I do not remember things from my past. Photos of me feel like someone aposs le. It makes le feel meaningless when you forget everything you have done. My brain will often feel like it is on fire as it gets inflamed. At these times I canapost communicate at all. I just lie in a dark room for weeks waiting for it to pass. Joe said he has lost a considerable amount of weight as his body is no longer able to absorb nutrition from his food properly. I feel like a shell of my former self, he added. The bacteria is eating the cartilage in my body and causing bones in my spine to move out of place, resulting in muscle tears. Itaposs very painful and upsetting.  I know the more time that passes the more irreversible damage my body goes through, but currently there is nothing I can do but watch it happen. Joe insisted the only way he can get his le back is by travelling to Jemsek Clinic in the United States, which specialises in Lyme disease. He said clinicians will offer him a structured antibiotic protocol in a bid to combat his complex range of symptoms. The clinic has helped thousands of others overcome this illness and I have faith the same can happen for me, he added. A friend of Joeaposs set up a GoFundMe page to try and raise the money he needs to get to the USA.

Up to  school children witnessed Mondayaposs tragedy on their way home from school. Reports have claimed the Year Nine pupil was being bullied, but Catholic secondary Salesian School in Chertsey, Surrey, have said there is no record of him being picked on. Deborah Barrett, mother of Samaposs half-sisters, paid tribute to the teen, who was the youngest of six. She said: “He was a sensitive little soul, a cute little thing who was into gaming.    “He was funny and sarcastic with a great sense of humour.” She said his close-knit family from nearby Ashford, Surrey, would be devastated. Neighbours described him as a “lovely, polite lad” who was regularly seen riding his bike in the area. “He was often in here and would be with his big brother,” said a shopkeeper nearby. “He was always so polite and a really lovely lad. I just can’t believe what has happened.” “He was a good polite boy. Fourteen is no age to die.” A friend from primary school who laid flowers at the scene with her aunt told the Mirror: “He was a kind, caring boy. He was always nice to everyone.” One message taped to a fence with a bouquet at Chertsey station said: “So sorry le wasn’t kinder to you sweetheart.

There was a girl on phone, crying, trying to talk to the driver.” He added: “They were all looking down, whatever they saw must have been horric.” A nearby sweet shop worker said teachers came running down to the scene following the tragedy.

Among them was a slightly hung over, awe-struck teenager, wearing pyjamas, and a dreamy expression. Clustered with his family around a -inch, black and white TV in their living room in Blackheath, south east London, the -year-old, who had been out celebrating his birthday, was soon glued to grainy footage of two men hopping across the surface of the moon. “We were mesmerised,” remembers Sir Richard Branson. “Mum had called and said, ‘Don’t get too drunk, I want you home to watch with us’. For me, it was definitely a turning point.” It was, in fact, his eureka moment – the moment he decided to “live le on the edge and to the full”.    And the point at which he decided he would become an astronaut, like Apollo  heroes, Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin and Michael Collins. As the world marks the th anniversary of their momentous mission, Sir Richard is close to realising that dream. In December, his commercial space flight company, Virgin Galactic, flew its first manned craft, Virgin VSS Unity, to the edge of space. In February, it sent two pilots plus a test passenger. Next year, Sir Richard plans to take the -minute flight himself, before offering it topaying customers. For all his British manners, he admits it feels good to be “first” in his space race with rival billionaires, Tesla boss Elon Musk’s SpaceX, and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos’s Blue Origin.    Sir Richard, , says: “Having got five people into space before the other two, we are obviously pleased. I don’t think Elon and Jeff have said they want to go up themselves, so that race shouldn’t be a dficult one to win. I may be the only one to go up in their own spaceship.” But what of the moon – some , miles on  It doesn’t seem to be on Galactic’s radar, whereas Musk and Bezos plan lunar missions by  and . Sir Richard says: “Of course, who wouldn’t want to go to the moon, or Mars ” So would pride stop him catching a lt with one of his rivals  He says: “If they were ahead of us and were kind enough to invite me, I certainly wouldn’t turn a ticket down.”    It wasn’t just the Apollo  landing which sowed the seed for Virgin Galactic. Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev also had a hand, as raconteur Sir Richard loves to tell. He says: “Very many years ago I got a call and was told Mikhail Gorbachev wanted a word with me. He asked whether I would like to be the first civilian to go into space, on the Russian space ship. I was very, very flattered until his minions got involved and made it clear it would be at a £million cost. “I think he was hoping to fund the Russian project with me! “I might, might, have been able to scrape it together, but it most likely would have bankrupted Virgin, and I just thought it wouldn’t look good. “So, in the end, we spent that money building our own space ships, so the public one day could benefit.” Sir Richard began his meteoric rise in business by starting up a teenage magazine, Student, in , before launching Virgin Records in , then Virgin Atlantic, Virgin Trains, Virgin Mobile, and, in , Virgin Galactic.    He had hoped to make it to space to coincide with the anniversary of the Apollo  mission, but that is not to be. He jokes that he has a habit of missing deadlines. This time it is because Galactic is waiting to test its new launch pad in New Mexico. Last week the firm announced plans to become the first space tourism company to go public. But he’s in training. He says: “I’m doing about , steps a day, I have my watch.” Living on his own Caribbean island, Necker, helps his fitness regime. He says: “I’m lucky where I live is a beautul island and I can kite surf, play tennis every morning and evening, swim around the island, do weight training every other day.”    He has also trained at a centruge centre to withstand the G-forces of going from  to ,mph in eight seconds.He says: “It’s not too bad, it’s highly doable for most people.” After Sir Richard goes into space, the public can follow. Brad Pitt and Justin Bieber are rumoured to be among those who paid deposits for the £, tickets to see Earth from space and experience weightlessness.Buzz Aldrin, , hasn’t signed up, yet, but “he loves what we’re doing”, Sir Richard assures me. He adds: “Buzz might just be the one person we’d give an upgrade to.”  Sir Richard says he feels no sense of risk in taking the flight – only too aware that test pilots are taking those for him. In , the company’s plans were devastated when co-pilot Michael Alsbury was killed when the braking system unlocked too early during a test flight from the Mojave Desert, Calornia.

The love triangle happened after Rosie Haley, , who lives in Brisbane , Australia, came out as bisexual.She and her husband Ty, , an Australian defence force member, met Keneshia Petty, , in May  and they moved in together within two months. Now, they are engaged to be married despite both their families rejecting the polyamorous relationship.  Ty and Rosie met at  and were married within a year when they were . Two years ago, Rosie came out as bisexual. They both joined Tinder and met student Keneshia. Rosie is also a student and works as a waitress and support worker. After a few weeks talking, Rosie and Ty went on separate dates with Keneshia and both hit it off immediately. They formed a aposthroupleapos and have been inseparable since then.   Last November, Rosie proposed to Keneshia whilst Ty was deployed in the Middle East - but he joined the romantic moment on Skype . When he ed in February, he also proposed to Keneshia and they all plan to marry next year. Polyamory means ethical, authentic love that is encouraged and supported by each of us, Keneisha said.

I had it planned for months and decided to wait until her birthday. She said her grandparents and a few other family members were completely disapproving and would not even acknowledge Keneshia.

Hopefully, we can win the game and go on.“Qualication is in our hands so we can just focus on ourselves and, hopefully, win the rest of the games,we can, and see where it takes us.“We are concentrating on the rest of the cup games and getting ourselves ready for a dficult league season, too.“We do, though, have a good team, a strong team and a real togetherness through the players and coaching staff and that includes the players we’ve brought in.“The fans, too, showed us great support on Friday and they stayed around after the game and we really appreciate that.“It’s going to be a tough season but we’re all confident we can do well.”Connolly felt there was lots to take out of the performance at a rain-sodden Tynecastle but insists there’s plenty more to come from United.He told the Tele: “We came back late because of the play-offs so that was our first full  minutes for a lot of us.“We take a lot of positives out of Friday and there is a plenty of stuff we can work on.“Obviously, away to Tynecastle is a hard place. They had a strong team but I don’t think they had too many clear opportunities and, with Nicky Clark’s chance near the end, we could have ended up winning the game.“It was a tough night but it was good to play a team in the league above us and we showed we can handle ourselves against the bigger teams.“We did ourselves proud – disappointed we could only draw but there are positives to take into tonight’s game and, hopefully, go again.“Hearts’ two front players – Conor Washington is an international and Uche Ikpeazu I played against down south – both are tough to play against.“They are good players but I think the whole back four handled them well and so did the boys in front of us. We showed character at times when we needed to. We rolled our sleeves up and put our bodies on the line.”He added: “We were disappointed with the goal we lost. It was a sloppy one to concede but we’ll take the positives.“It was - at Hearts in the first competitive game of the season – we’re just disappointed we didn’t get more.”Connolly admits he’d rather avoid any more penalty shootouts after two defeats in their last two competitive contests following last season’s loss against St Mirren in the play-off.“Penalties are just not working for us right now!” joked Connolly.“We have improved since May but it’s just one of those things.

These should ensure everyone receives #joined up# care, that they are asked how they are feeling as part of every diabetes appointment and that a mental health professional with knowledge of diabetes is part of every diabetes care team.To sign our petition, go to diabetes.org.uk missingAngela Mitchell, National Director of Diabetes Scotland.Sir,I#m asking residents in the Highlands and Islands to give their views on Conservative proposals for tackling serious crime.In order to provide Scotland with an alternative to Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP in , we are keen to gain feedback from as many people to our policy proposals to make them as relevant as possible to the needs and aspirations of everyone in Scotland.Too many people in Scotland are affected by the behaviour of serious criminals. This needs to be properly addressed and my colleague Liam Kerr MSP, shadow Justice Secretary, has outlined key policy proposals in a member#s bill in the Scottish Parliament to tackle this scourge.It would give Scottish judges the power to impose whole le sentences to those convicted of the most serious violent and sexual crimes including the murder of a police officer.The courts would still have discretion to impose the appropriate sentence based on all the facts of each case, as they do in England and Wales where such a provision already exists.The proposed Whole Le CustodyBill will not mean the perpetrators of a particular crime will always receive a whole le sentence, but rather that the courts will have the power to impose one where there is sufficient justication.We have started the consultation and experts and members of the public are invited to register their views.Email me at donald.cameron.msp@parliament.scot or write to me at Donald Cameron MSP,  George Street, Oban, PA NT, with your views.MSP Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands.Sir,The SNP has warned Scotland’s NHS is under threat from a Tory-Trump trade deal that could leave the Scottish Government without a veto over a post-Brexit deal that sells Scotland out.This stark warning follows the revelations from Donald Trump that in terms of trade deals, everything, including the NHS, would be on the table.At Prime Ministers Questions, SNP Deputy Westminster Leader Kirsty Blackman MP said Donald Trump and the Tories could not be trusted on the NHS and criticised the UK government for plotting to take powers away from the Scottish Parliament that would allow it to safeguard Scotland’s NHS.The threats to Scotland#s NHS are growing under the prospect of a hard-right Tory-Trump Brexit trade deal. Those threats could undermine the integrity and independence of our Scottish NHS.The UK Tories will block any potential veto by the Scottish Government over such a damaging deal.The SNP government will fight to the end to defend Scotland#s public services from this unprecedented Tory Brexit danger. Our NHS must remain in public hands. It is not, and should never be, up for sale.Scotland has been completely ignored throughout the Brexit process and Tory plans to grab powers from the Scottish Parliament will leave us even more exposed.It is clearer than ever that the only way to properly protect Scotland#s interests, and keep our NHS in public hands, is with the full powers of independence.MP Brendan O#Hara, Argyll and Bute."},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures week 25","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowFiona McCuish of Ardrishaig captured the VIC puffer wending its way up the Crinan Canal.Fiona used her camera phone as the vessel passed through West Bank, Ardrishaig."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column june 28 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWhat is it with recruiting #professionals# to Argyll We seem to be a distinctly unattractive prospect, as witnessed by the problems with recruiting a dentist in Lochgilphead.What people fail to appreciate is that they stand to gain so much more than they would lose by coming to Argyll.The scenery is unrivalled the pace of le is civilised we are not that far from the central belt and a sense of community remains.Just turn to our front page story for proof.Disappointment at losing out on council grant funding has turned into joy in Tarbert.But only because the people of the village have such big hearts, as they have demonstrated in the past.The council may argue that this vindicates its decision to refuse funding.

Peter O#Neil edged out Penrice in race one, but Penrice would take his revenge in race two and it was all to play for in the final encounter. Peter O#Neil was up to the task and would take the overall, with Penrice a deserved second and  Damian Carter would third.The four stroke class was enthralling, with Sam Sibbald thundering around the Kilmartin track, big Andy Malloch and his Armstrong chasing him all the way to the flag and winning the final race but not the overall. Sam would be the victor followed by Andy and a consistent Keith Stanford third.For the youth class it was a day of mixed fortunes and consistency would be the key, with Jordan Graham coming out on top ahead of James Forrest and picking up a superb third overall was Rhys Brown.Pre- action would see committee man and track builder Grant McClure and his Maico, with three decades of riding under his belt, become the overall winner ahead of Callum Wilson on the superbly prepared Honda.The Twinshock under cc event would be a three race win for the flying Calum Kilgour and his cc Yamaha ahead of Jim Grieve, who would have some bike issues but would bring home his Honda in second fighting off a very persistent David Lawson and Gordon Peterson but it would be Gordon that would hold the third place trophy with some consistent riding.The Twinshock open class event would be a spectacular sight as cc Hondas and Maicos battled their way around the bracken.In race one there was a very small gap between first and second place and a similarly small gap between third. Brian Alexander would take the win from Craig ‘Smitch’ Smith, and John Crawford would come home in third with a notable mention to the very unlucky Paul Chiappa who had his fair share of misfortunes throughout the day, as his seat was torn from his bike at the top of one of the steep climbs. The overall would end up the same as the first race with Brian, taking the win from Craig Smith and John Crawford bringing the big Honda home in third.In the over s class it was a triumphant day for John Lamont with three resounding victories. Johnny Rutherford was second, a great result for the club sponsor, with David Watson bringing home the Honda with some consistent rides.For the group three races Robert Bell took the honours from Allan Shields and Bryan Colligan, all of these riders deserving a notable mention and with some very similar lap times and some quick racing in trying conditions.The clubman class was great to watch, with some fast up-and-coming riders such as Peter Rennie, Callum Laird and Stuart Wilson all angling for the win. Rennie would take the overall from Laird in second and  Wilson in third.The evolution class was again the Paul and Tom show. In what must have been the fastest racing all day, it would be Paul #PJ# Johnston who would take overall honours with three wins and Tom Grant would take the runner-up slot followed home ably by a consistent Roy Potts taking the third place.In the final block of racing it would be a win apiece for Jordan McDonald, Shaun Robertson, and John Kenny, but it would be the ever improving Shaun Robertson, ing from injury, who would take overall honours from a rapidly improving John Kenny in second and #Mr Consistent# Karl Livingstone in third.Results:Group Pre- class:  Grant McClure  Callum Wilson.

Apart from the cones on the street, we never had any issues with bad parking or disturbance from people attending the event.ldquoI could hear some music on the evenings but I liked the atmosphere and it certainly wasnrsquot a nuisance. We did attend the family ride on the Sunday, and while there was plenty of mud, I thought theyrsquod done a great job creating such a big event in its first year in Innerleithen.With the proposed plans to redevelop the old mill to create the Mountain Bike Innovation Centre, Tom added: ldquoI think its exciting times to be a resident in Innerleithen and I hope events like these continue to grow and do well here.ldquoI remember when Innerleithen was a poor cousin to Peebles and Glentress as an MTB and tourist destination, and I think itrsquos the hard work of local people who have brought Innerleithen to the fore. Most people are excited about the prospects and possible future developments here, and Irsquod hate people to get the wrong impression of the overall community support based on the reported views of a few people who were disturbed in the eventrsquos first year.ldquoHaving said that, I hope the organisers take on board the negative feedback and incorporate improvements into any future events.

The day after the crash, Superintendent Jim Guy of Strathclyde Police said there had been no evidence from the crew of any problems before the tragedy.He said the evidence available suggested an accident rather than terrorist attack. The scene of the crash was sealed off almost immediately and an air exclusion zone was imposed.Although most of the wreckage was left for accident investigators to examine, it is understood Royal Ulster Constabulary Special Branch officers removed boxes and cases containing secret papers on Friday morning.On Saturday,  personnel from RAF Machrihanish were drafted in to help find and catalogue debris from the crash.FIFTY YEARS AGOKintyre could be surfers# MeccaKintyre could become the major centre in Britain for surfingthe enthusiasm of two young men gets the encouragement it deserves.One of them, George Raynes, of Bishopbriggs in Lanarkshire, is secretary of the Scottish Surf Club, and with his treasurer, James Short of Glasgow, has just completed a preliminary survey of several of the Kintyre beaches with a view to exploiting them for the sport of surfing.George has surfed on beaches all over Britain and also in the Channel Isles and in Europe and he thinks that the beaches at Machrihanish and Southend could become the Mecca for British surfers and the venue for the British Championships.He was particularly impressed with the waves at Machrihanish but thinks Southend has great potential as well.He told the Courier: #The possibilities here are tremendous. These beaches are essentially accessible from the central belt of Scotland, in fact from all over Britain when one considers the air service, and the weather records show that there is plenty of sunshine and the water is warm compared to the waters off the east coast of England, for example.#In fact, I#ve been told that Kintyre topped the sunshine league in Britain last year.#The water is so warm, comparatively speaking, that the sport could become an all-year-round activity in this area. In the winter one would have to wear a wetsuit, of course, but the conditions are ideal and the wave forms have great potential # after all, they are coming straight in from the Atlantic over the north of Ireland.#What I#d like to see is a surf club established in Campbeltown. It could become a great asset from a tourist and amenity point of view.#And any Kintyre people who really took up the sport would have a great advantage over other surfers when it comes to competition because they have the benefit of readily available beaches all year round.#If this club gets going, the chances are that the British surf champions in the years to come will be Kintyre people.#ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOOrr Ewing CupFootballers were favoured with beautul weather last Saturday and the games played on Kinloch Park in the Orr Ewing Cup competition brought together very large gatherings of spectators.The match in the afternoon was brought to a sudden termination by an unfortunate dispute over the award of a goal. The opposing teams were Kintyre and HMS Thames.Kintyre opened strongly and after  minutes# play had scored twice. The dispute arose over the award of the second goal, which Thames claimed to be offside.The referee, Mr Duncan McCallum, an old Hearts player, was of a dferent opinion, and on his allowing Kintyre the goal, the naval team without more do walked off the field.It is understood that the Thames team intimated to the league at the weekly meeting on Monday night their withdrawal from the competition.The teams were: Kintyre # Jas McKinlay: James Black and Archd Sharp: M Muir, A McCrank and T Cameron: R McGeachy and D Brown: Dan McNaughton: N Scally and J Donaldson.HMS Thames # Meese: Jesseman and Love: McCloud, Hirst and Fernie: Dunnell and Weekes: McGeachy: Slynn and Segrott.Referee # Mr D McCallum.In the evening, the opposing teams were Campbeltown and Kilbrannan. A week previously Kilbrannan had inflicted a - win over a naval team: against Campbeltown on Saturday they found the tables turned on themselves, and with the same score repeated they had to suffer the chagrin of a five-goal margin.It was hard game, but high scoring seldom adds to the vim or interest of any match and so it was here.Campbeltown from the kick-off may be fairly said to have had the measure of their opponents, but while they were the better , on play there was nothing like a - goal margin between the teams.Campbeltown owed their comfortable lead mainly to the masterly play of their centre forward, Archd O#May. This young footballer was home on furlough from the Rhine Army, and his display was undoubtedly the feature of the game. He is a fearless player with a rare turn of speed and a most deadly shot.At least three of six goals came from his foot, and were beautully taken, while he was the means of a fourth which he gave the right wing the honour of finishing.Kilbrannan#s solitary goal was well taken by Brown after a clever break through and an inidual run.Kilbrannan has material for the making of a team that should get much better results than they have so far achieved.The players are keen and inidually have a lot of football in them, but an almost entire absence of method both in attack and defence spoils their chances.The teams were: Campbeltown # A McCallum: G Quigley and Chas McKinven: D Kelly, J McDonald and John Martin: Chas Black and Arch Black: Arch O#May: W McKillop and James Martin.Kilbrannan # John McIntyre: D Bannatyne and Wm Gilchrist: J Short, N McKenzie and James Boyce: D Gilchrist and M Brodie: C Kelly: D Mathieson and J Brown.Referee # Mr W Mustarde."},{"url":null,"title":"letter open letter to dog owners","story":"While responsible dog owners take care to ensure their dogs are under control at all times, there are still a number who do not # and seem unaware of the potential consequences of their actions.There has been a disturbing rise in the number of sheep and other livestock attacks, and we are hoping to enlist your help in raising awareness of dog #worrying# which will, in turn, assist the authorities, farmers and land-users.If a dog worries livestock on any agricultural land the owner, or person in charge of the animal at the time, is guilty of a criminal offence.Section  of the DogsAct  defines #worrying# as:Such incidents cause distress to the animals and often lead to them being injured and or killed.

It is better than some human beings are treated ndash that is the sad truth.Mr Farnsworth was presenting an annual report on the racecoursersquos performance over the last financial year.The Beast from the East snow storm, an outbreak of equine influenza, and a long spell of dry weather all contributed to what he described as one of the worst years the course had been through in his memory.A number of key fixtures were cancelled and profits fell.In December, four horses died during one day of racing at the course but a subsequent review by the British Horseracing Authority ruled that the course and race organisers were not at fault.Councillor Gordon Mackett asked Mr Farnsworththe racecourse had been affected by animal welfare concerns.The course manager said: ldquoWe did have a horrible day when there were four fatalities however, these were all completely separate incidents.ldquoIn a sport like this you will get injuries and fatalities from time to time.

History is the way we view and see things that happened in the past. That view is limited by a number of factors. The availability of surviving records and evidence is one.The vast majority of what happened in the past is inevitably lost to us. This is true even for our own personal memories. So history is the small tip of the iceberg of events and times gone by, brought to the surface by the survival of some accounts more than others.And these records are never unbiased. Often historical records and evidence are purposely partial, influenced by ideology and personal allegiances. But all are biased in some way, as the limited viewpoint and interests of those recording events is based on their experience or motives.As a result, we can only see historical events through a narrow keyhole, with most characters and goings on out of view. Itrsquos the common people who are most always invisible in history. Our own ideological preference and belief in what is important will then affect how we interpret the limited evidence we have.This is why history is often subject to furious debate, and rightly so. Irsquod say itrsquos almost impossible not to allow our own perspectives, interests and values to influence the way we interpret the broader meaning of historical events and their signicance for contemporary society.Such a debate is being had in East Lothian just now, as to the name of the new town to be built on the Blindwells site, between Prestonpans and Longniddry and just to the north of Gladsmuir and Tranent.The name can be romantically translated to mean lsquohidden springsrsquo and it was across this once-marshy ground that the Jacobites crept stealthily at night to mount a surprise attack on the Redcoats on September , . That famous battle lasted  minutes and was a victory for the Jacobites, and the launchpad of Bonnie Prince Charliersquos march into England.Consequently, the Scottish Battlefields Trust has submitted a petition, as reported in the Courier last week, to name the new community Charlestoun and build a statue of Charles.When I was at school, he seemed a dashing and heroic figure. The songs and stories about him are infectious and I totally understand how the stories told about him have created a romantic and thrilling image.But then I studied the topic in more depth, at both university and afterwards. The period has suffered from the romantic treatment but there are fascinating stories of loyalty and sacrice to a man who, in reality, saw the common people chiefly as cannon fodder for his personal and family ambitions.It is for this reason I feel there are enough name places and statues to aristocratic and powerful men whose main historical role was to make and wage war, evenhe has a famous and romantic reputation.This is not to say we shouldnrsquot remember the fascinating history of the area, including that fateful day of battle when the Jacobites crossed the land.But itrsquos how we commemorate it and who we include. What makes the Jacobite period truly fascinating is the tapestry of stories of the many people involved, on both sides. It was a brutal time, in which there was certainly deep loyalty on both sides, but there were many other reasons why people found themselves on one side or the other. It was a brutal civil war, brought on by the aspirations of the exiled Stuarts.Do we commemorate the memory of the man who caused that war or do we commemorate those who were caught up in it  Is it really the case thatwe do the former we do the latter  Irsquom not convinced.There are other stories to consider of course for the site. There was coal mining there for generations. The lives of mining families, men, women and children who toiled in horric conditions, still remains mostly unheralded by history. Maybe itrsquos not lsquoromanticrsquo enough. Likewise with farming, which was a constant economic activity in the area for generations.There was also another unusual underground activity on the site after the early mine closed. Smugglers made an illegal whisky still deep down in the mine shaft once it was disused. It took a while for the customs men to realise East Lothian had an illicit whisky-making enterprise deep below ground in the old mine workings. When they finally raided the mine, they found the still, but no sign of the makers of the whisky. It kind of gives new meaning to the name lsquohidden springsrsquo!It is suggested the children in schools should have the final say in the new name, which is a great idea. But let our children be introduced to all aspects of our local history and allow them to understand how the way history is taught influences what we believe is important in contemporary society as well, and that there is no lsquocorrectrsquo view on this.Irsquod love to be part of that discussion and debate."},{"url":null,"title":"parents-launch-petition-school-bus-operator-change","story":"Families whose children attend two secondary schools in East Lothian were stunned to discover that local firm PrenticeCoaches would no longer be used to transport the youngsters when schoolsafter the summer.The news was broken to them by Prentice, which is based in Haddington, last week, sparking a furious reaction from a number of parents.Now a petition has been launched calling for Prentice to have the contract, which has allegedly been awarded to a rival firm, given back.One mother whose children attend Knox Academy in Haddingtonand are bussed in from Gford said that she was shocked by the news.She said: ldquoPrentice have been looking after our children for  years and they are being replaced with no consultation or discussion.ldquoParents know the drivers and trust them to look after their children.ldquoIt is beyond belief that the council would simply put a dferent company in place without even consulting with the families affected.A petition calling for theof Prentice has collected more than  signatures since it was launched online.It says: ldquoPrentice provide a community service where parents feel reassured and comfortable putting their children on the buses.ldquoWe believe East Lothian [Council] has chosen to put cost over service and safety.ldquoThere is absolutely nothing wrong with the current service.ldquoThis is simply a cost-cutting exercise which could potentially put our children at risk.Prentice provided bus services for Knox Academy and North Berwick High School but has now lost the contract for those services.Ross Prentice, the company boss, admitted that he was ldquodisappointed by the councilrsquos decision.The company said: ldquoIt is a sad day.

Any route that smacks of pronouncing UDI is a bad look for a Government that wants to be taken seriously on the international stage.Yet Mr Mackayrsquos suggestion that the Scottish Government go to the Supreme Court or the European Court to try to overrule a UK Government refusal to grant a section  order for a second independence referendum is equally likely to end badly. He says ldquoitrsquos hard to see any court flouting the democratic will of the Scottish people, but that is surely the wishful thinking of an independence supporter.First, the court is likely to conclude that this matter is outside of its competence, with the decision to issue a section  order or not one that is fully the right of the UK Government. Secondly, any court will in any case be disinclined to get involved when, based on opinion polls, it is far from clear that there is majority support for having another referendum anytime soon. If such support were already overwhelming, then perhaps a court might be tempted, but instead, it is only the will of independence supporters that is being frustrated, not the will of the people of Scotland as a whole.Keith Howell, West Linton.LIKE Neil Mackay I am not a member of the SNP, but would like Scotland to be a self-governing country the international norm. Some points around his article, however.Plan B is not an original idea. It was first promulgated by Margaret Thatcher as the route to Scottish independence, and as such would be dficult for Unionists to argue was ldquobullying and illegal. All elections in Scotland for some years, driven by Unionists, have been fought only around independence and a referendum. The Supreme Court would certainly follow the English concept of constitutional law, and find Westminster sovereign. Its whythe Supreme Court was established: to override the Scottish constitutional view of ldquosovereignty of the people.

Of the  species identied, % were invertebrates, and only one formally classied as an invasive species ndash the leathery sea squirt.This last beastie ndash said to be one of the ugliest animals in the world ndash is now said to be well established on the bottom of the Clyde.The black bee fly ndash which goes by the unappealing Latin name of Anthrax Anthrax ndash arrived in the UK for the first time in .

It is not, however, dangerous.Dr Pettorelli, lead author and senior research fellow at ZSLrsquos Institute of Zoology, said: ldquoWe are currently massively unprepared for the climate-driven movement of species that is happening right now in the UK. As it stands, society is not ready for the redistribution of species, as current policies and agreements are not designed for these novel species and ecological communities ndash particularlythose species have no perceived valueto society.ldquoOur results suggest that many species are on the move in the UK, and that we can expect a lot of changes in the type of nature we will have around us in the coming years. ldquoBut the lack of an integrated national  dedicated to tracking and communicating about species displaced by climate change is currently a hindrance to mitigating those potential ecological, economic and societal associated impacts.Nuthatches are not the only bird on the move. Tropical-looking European bee-eater ndash identied by keen birdwatchers and which have been nesting in Kent and Nottinghamshire ndash are quite a stretch from their natural breeding grounds in Africa, central and southern Europe and East Asia.The study found that % of new species arriving or displaced were cited as having negative impacts on ecological communities and human society.

expansion plans to Aberdeenshire Council on behalf of Garioch Sports Holdings.Full planning permission was secured last year for a major extension of the Inverurie facility, but changes in the community’s requirements and pressures on funding have prompted a reduced development.Initially the plans would have seen the Burghmuir Drive centre expanding into one of the largest amenities of its kind in Scotland, incorporating tennis courts, a multi-sports arena, fitness suites and an all-weather G pitch for Inverurie Loco Works FC which has now been dropped.But while the scale of the expansion might not be as ambitious, the new plans do reveal tennis courts and improvements for fitness along with an Early Learning Centre for younger children.Thanks to signicant input from Judy Murray – mother of tennis stars Andy and Jamie – the plans feature three dedicated tennis courts and the centre has committed to a three-year partnership with the JM Foundation, highlighting the commitment of the centre to develop the sport across Garioch.The centre and JM Foundation will work in partnership in upskilling their workforce and identying potential coaches while funding coach education.In a supporting statement the centre writes: “The matter of securing the appropriate funding for the ious options which have been considered over the last couple of years has impacted upon how the plans have altered with the focus very much now being on the new tennis provision.“The most recent plans reflect the discussions with the Lawn Tennis Association and also Tennis Scotland.“The advice and guidance of Judy Murray has also been pivotal in how the plans particularly for the tennis courts have progressed.”The applicants also believe that despite the downturn in oil and gas and other industries, there is still a demand for its facilities.It reports: “As many of the activities and programmes now carry waiting lists, there is proof that despite a downturn in many industries the timing is now right to expand in tandem with the growth in participation and the increase in the town and rural residency.“An expansion of the present facility and delivery of its sporting, health and wellbeing activities has many positive additions as the market town itself strives to increase its provision to its residents.”data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch

This was a substantial commitment but was vital for Scotland’s long term interests, preparing ourselves for the challenges of an ageing population. We’ve recently extended free personal care to cover all those who are assessed as needing it, no matter their age.MSPs also charted a dferent course when, following a change of administration in , parliament voted to scrap tuition fees in Scotland, restoring Scotland’s long and proud tradition of free education.Similarly, the decision to abolish prescription charges brought to an end what was little more than a tax on ill health. The NHS of course is the greatest, and most valued, example of a universal service where care is provided on the basis of need and not ability to pay. Our health service, like others across the world, faces challenges. But it is a real achievement of the Scottish Parliament that we have resisted the marketization moves south of the border while ensuring that under the current government Scotland’s AE departments are the best performing in theUK.On other occasions, the Parliament has led the UK in making bold policy choices, such as the ban on smoking in public places. Our Climate Change Act includedthe most ambitious emissions reduction targets of any legislature in the world and, as Health Secretary, I was heavily involved in the campaign to introduce a minimum unit price for alcohol, which we knew would play a key role in tackling Scotland’s unhealthy relationship with drink – another world leading measure.data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"As the Scottish Parliament prepares to celebrate its th anniversary, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon reflects on both its journey and her own.\"  First Minister Nicola Sturgeon reflects on  years of the Scottish Parliament viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"It took a decade of hard work to make this policy a reality and I am personally very proud of the campaign, working with stakeholders, to persuade MSPs to back minimum pricing, as well as overcoming a legal challenge that went all the way to the Supreme Court.I am personally committed to making sure every child and young person in Scotland gets the best possible start in le. We have already delivered an increase in free, high quality childcare for all three and four year olds and extending entitlement to eligible two year olds and will increase it further before the end of this parliament.Scotland has also become a much safer society under devolution. Recorded crime has fallen to some of the lowest levels seen since the s. In particular, non-sexual violent crime has fallen substantially, thanks in no small part to the excellent work of the Violence Reduction Unit, which was established over a decade ago with cross-party support and is now being copied across the UK.In recent years, new powers have come to the Scottish Parliament and with those powers come increased responsibilities for MSPs to deliver for the people ofScotland.Income tax policy is now a key feature of the annual Scottish budget. We’ve used these new powers to introduce a fairer income tax policy, with most people paying less tax than they would south of the border – while continuing to raise revenue to support investment in the economy and public services.Last year Parliament passed the wide-ranging Social Security Act, paving the way for devolution of a number of benefits, as well as creating a number of newbenefits such as increased carers’ support allowance and best start grants for families with young children – and a new social security agency to deliver them. This new agency has a culture of dignity and respect at its heart and early feedback from service users has been overwhelmingly positive.I also appointed the first gender balanced Scottish cabinet and we are encouraging more women to stand for parliament, and bring a better balance to ourpublic le.Over the course of the Scottish Parliament consistent action has been taken to ensure communities have the opportunity to own the land they live and work on.Many communities have benefited from the right to buy that now covers rural and urban communities.Of course, the foundation of our country is a strong and resilient economy. That’s why we have slashed or abolished business rates for , premises –saving almost £. billion for our small businesses.We have invested in our infrastructure with all governments building new schools and hospitals and, of course, the iconic Queensferry Crossing.And, to help make sure we have the workforce we need for years to come, we have delivered just over a quarter of a million Modern Apprenticeships in the lastdecade.In April this year, new legislation to tackle controlling and coercive behaviour came into effect, giving Scotland some of the most robust domesticabuse legislation in the world.I’m also proud of the many steps we’ve taken to make Scotland a fairer society, including the introduction of equal marriage rights – attending one of the first same-sex weddings in Scotland is a memory that will stay with me for a long time.And we all worked together over many years to help Glasgow successfully host the  Commonwealth Games. This helped to inspire Scots to get more active,delivered new facilities and put Scotland on the world stage. It was a sight to behold.My final achievement is perhaps harder to quanty. There is no doubt that the re-establishment of Scotland’s parliament has profoundly changed our political culture for the better, with our nation’s lawmakers much more accessible to those they represent. It has also enabled us to have conversations we wouldn’t have had and to debate our own future, with the  independence referendum generating an increase in democratic engagement.Looking ahead, we now face the signicant challenges posed by Brexit which, of course, Scotland’s people and parliament overwhelmingly oppose. Given the long-term damage that Brexit will cause to Scotland, and the material change in circumstances this represents, I believe it is only fair that people are given the choice of whether to become an independent country. Indeed, the current SNP Government was elected on a clear manesto commitment that people should be offered that choice should Scotland be taken out of the EU against its will. Polls consistently show that people living here believe the decision on whether to hold a referendum should be a matter for Holyrood and not Westminster. Twenty years after it came into being, that is an important measure of the way people in Scotland view the Parliament and one that the new UK Prime Minister would do well to heed."},{"url":null,"title":"upcoming road closure","story":"Drivers are being advised to allow for extra travel time as an upcoming road closure in Inverurie will result in congestion and a prolonged ersion.Keith Hall Road Bridgein Inverurie will be closed for five days from Monday, November  to remove the scaffolding, which is currently in place, and repointing works to the parapets to take place.Site notices will indicate the closure and the alternative route via: B to A, A to B Kintore, B and B to Hatton of Fintray and Cc Kinmuck to Keithhall and vice versa.Aberdeenshire Council apologises for any inconvenience this may cause.To view all current and upcoming road closures and restrictions in the area please visit the Aberdeenshire Council website at www.aberdeenshire.gov.uk roads-and-travel roadworks.data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.fetoday webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"This is what , can fetch you across the UK\"  This is what you can rent for £, per month across the UK viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\""},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"July ,  at : amComedian and television personality, Alan Carr, is set to perform in Orkney, later this year.

And I understand that it is very unfortunate that this problem, while unrelated to the air traffic controllers’ industrial action, has coincided with it. However, that is not much consolation to frustrated users of the service.“The issue here is that this is a leline service and there are no alternatives for people who simply have to fly. Local people and businesses in the Northern Isles need a reliable service, and we simply cannot afford local service-levels to be reduced. We accept that we have to live with unavoidable weather events, but the recent disruptions have been workforce-related.“HIAL is a Scottish Government-owned organisation and one of the reasons for that is a recognition that it provides a strategically critical part of our transport infrastructure in the Highlands and Islands. It’s way past time for ministers to take a long hard look at the situation and reassure us that they are prepared to intervene on behalf of the travelling public.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

We’ll take it from there.We’ve commissioned Orkney-born composer Erland Cooper to incorporate your recordings into a special, new piece of music that aims to capture Orkney’s unique sounds and character – and broadcast it to the world.In doing so, we’re making the case for rural connectivity.

The schemes are designed to protect electricity consumers in the North of Scotland from high costs of distribution in their area. In   this was done by providing an annual assistance amount of £ million to consumers in the area, which Ofgem estimates is worth around £ per household.Mr McArthur said: “It is simply unfair for islanders to be surcharged when so many households in our island communities already experience the highest levels of fuel poverty anywhere in the country.“If these plans are implemented, it will be good news for consumers across the highlands and islands. It’s also evidence of the benefits of pooling and sharing across the UK.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Later, her crew will be presented with a specially commissioned plaque by Orkney Islands Council, marking the visit.Orkney Islands Council’s head of marine services, engineering and transport, and harbour master, Brian Archibald, said: “We’re proud to have been selected as the first alongside port of call on such a prestigious voyage. We hope it will be the first of many happy visits to Orkney for the ship and we look forward to giving her crew and passengers an outstanding Orkney welcome on Sunday.”• Keep an eye on The Orcadian Facebook page on Sunday for coverage, with a feature also due to be published in the Marine Scene section of the paper next week.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The move is a result of a partnership with the organisation PAMISwhich campaigns for these facilities, and has been supported by Transport Scotland.The move comes as a result of research highlighting that , people in the UK need such special assistance and facilities. Users include people with profound and multiple learning disabilities and people with a range of other disabilities including Cerebral Palsy, Motor Neurone disease, Multiple Sclerosis, stroke, some older people and other specic disabilities.The requirements are set out in British Standards, and include:The new toilets are already open on deck six of MV Hjaltland and MV Hrossey, and will be available on board MV Hamnavoe by the end of the year.“This investment is another sign of our commitment to making our facilities as welcoming as possible to everyone in the community,# said Stuart Garrett, managing director at Serco NorthLink Ferries.#It will open up opportunities for many people with disabilities and their familes to visit some of the most beautul parts of Scotland. It also supports those living on the islands when travelling to and from the mainland for leisure and essential healthcare.”The move is the latest in a series of measures aimed at improving journeys for all travelers. Earlier this month the company became the first Scottish transport operator to introduce the pioneering Neatebox support service. This followed improvements to the NorthLink website, disability awareness training for staff, and a new partnership with a sign language interpreting agency.Mum and carer Jenny Whinnet, who helped to start the PAMIS campaign  years ago, said: #This is an exciting development for families and carers.#It permits people who need these facilities to travel further afield confidently and with dignity. This is very dferent to the early years of this campaign, when it was so dficult for me to travel with my son Craig because there were no Changing Places toilets available.”Jenny Miller, Chief Executive Officer of PAMIS added: “We’ve been very impressed with the commitment and consideration shown by Serco NorthLink Ferries in developing changing places toilets on their ferries.#They have really listened to the stories from the families and people we work with and who feel excluded from so many activities that we all take for granted. We’re delighted that the Orkney and Shetland ferries will be the first in the country, and possibly the world, to have a Changing Places toilet.”Paul Wheelhouse, minister for energy, connectivity and the islands is pleased to see the new facilities up and running.He said: #This type of improvement is exactly why we set up the Ferries Accessibility Fund.#We know accessible travel not only enables people to enjoy equal access to our beautul country, but it also enables people to fully participate in society and improve the quality of their lives, so we want to continue to identy and remove any disabling barriers which prevent people from making journeys or lead to them having an unpleasant time on board.#It’s very important that Scotland’s ferry services are fully accessible, offering the best passenger experience possible to everyone and this targeted investment marks very welcome progress on that journey.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It is they, after all, who made history as ambassadors of humankind, setting foot onto a ­­\u2028far-flung celestial body. Michael Collins, Apollo ’s ­command module pilot, who watched on, fearful that catastrophe would intervene to ensure he would make theto Earth alone, played an integral part in the mission. So too did the many pioneers whose names occupy a mere footnote of history, despite the fact that without their expertise and composure, the disaster Collins feared – or much worse – would have almost inevitably come to pass. The semicentennial celebrations of the Moon landing is an occasion to remember those who occupy the foothills of the credits. One of the statistics surrounding Project Apollo, which seems to me both remarkable and entirely rational, is that around , people were involved in rendering the impossible possible.This army of engineers, scientists, programmers, mathematicians, and technicians defied technological limitations and bureaucratic wrangling to produce approximately five-and-a-half million parts which, working in unison, spirited Apollo’s crew to the Moon and back. : How moon landing conspiracy theories began and why they persist today – Professor Peter Knight:  years since the moon landing: why Scotland is the true home of astronaut Neil ArmstrongIn any other corporate environment, the prospect of workers on the ground feeling disconnected from the mission’s overall goal would barely warrant concern. But Project Apollo’s programme ­manager, George Müller, knew fine well the risks of letting such apathy go unchecked. He ensured the astronauts toured factories across America tasked with manufacturing the spacecraft components. This was no mere public relations exercise. It reminded workers that a single oversight on their part could kill the men standing before them, and it forged a sense of collective responsibility. Nowhere was this esprit de corps more evident than Building  of Nasa’s Johnson Space Centre in Houston, Texas, home to the Apollo mission operations control centre , where the spacecraft’s ­navigation, propulsion, le support, and communications systems were monitored with unflinching ­scrutiny.At any given time, between  and  men – and one trailblazing woman, JoAnn Morgan, the instrumentation controller – held in their hands the lives of three men a ­quarter of a million miles away. Their number included Stephen Bales, the son of a janitor and a ­beautician, who less than five years previously had moved from the farming community of Fremont, Iowa, to join Nasa as an intern, responsible for guided tours. In an interview with  Minutes to the Moon, a superb BBC World Service podcast detailing the graft, ingenuity, and composure which underpinned the final descent to the lunar surface, Bales recently reflected on the mission that would define his career. Without him, it would have probably ended in failure. As the Eagle craft neared the Moon, an alarm code known as  flashed on its on-board computer display. It was the only moment in the entire mission when a degree of urgency,not fear, could be heard in Armstrong’s voice.Bales, by then one of Apollo ’s guidance officers, saw the alarm four seconds later. Initially unsure of its signicance, he remembered the last simulation he and the flight controllers had carried out before the landing proper. Back then a similar code, known as , had appeared, prompting Bales to call an abort. In the subsequent debriefing, he immersed himself in the myriad alarms that could be triggered, working with Jack Garman, a computer specialist, to understand their meaning.In doing so, they realised a  referred to a software reboot which cancelled all the processes that the computer was running crucially, it happened so fast, no vital guidance or navigation data would be lost. So when the code appeared for real, Bales knew the mission could continue. It was a decision made in the space of  seconds – “an eternity,” said Bales – but it saved Apollo . There are countless other stories like his. Take that of John Aaron from Oklahoma, the son of a cattle rancher and a minister, recruited by Nasa at  without an interview. He felt ashe had walked into a foreign country where people spoke another language, on account of the dizzying number of acronyms being hurled around. After just six weeks, he contemplated jacking it all in. Fortunately for him, and the Apollo programme, he knuckled down. Only a few months later, his split-second decision making was credited with saving Apollo  after its rocket was struck by lightning. It is dficult to conceive of the pressure these men worked under, as they analysed the spaceflight while listening to three,not four conversations simultaneously on communication channels known as ‘loops’.The average age of those inside MOCR was just , and as Gerry Grfin, the flight director during Apollo ’s fraught re-entry into the Earth’s atmosphere, has pointed out, their youth counted in their favour. “It was the lack of fear,” he explained. “It wasn’t the lack of knowing it was risky.”It also means that, half a century on, many of them are still with us, able to reflect on an epoch-defining moment and receive our thanks for the part they played in it.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"can you help theatre make the world a better place linda crooks","story":"Next month, Scotland will be at the epicentre of the global arts and culture movement as the Edinburgh International Festival and Fringe blossom into le once again.The Traverse Theatre is at the heart of this cultural celebration – both physically and figuratively – and we welcome the heightened exposure and attention these festivals bring to the work of our theatre and many others in the capital. As Scotland’s only theatre dedicated to new writing all year round, the Traverse is much more than the bricks and mortar of the building we occupy off Lothian Road.The Traverse is a place where artists and audiences are invited to meet and attempt to make sense of the world, to question, learn, empathise, and to encounter dferent people and experiences. Our influence extends around the globe with our productions of Ulster American, What Girls Are Made Of, Mouthpiece and Locker Room Talk touring to audiences in Australia, New Zealand, North and South America, Ireland and the UK already this year.: Joyce McMillan: The rise of the far-right in Europe is no Cabaret, old chum: Theatre review: Mouthpiece, Traverse, EdinburghTheatre is fundamental to a healthy democracy and we believe the Traverse – defined by a bold and unique body of work that harnesses the erse talents of everyone in the team here and the artists and communities we work with – is a force for good in this sense. We provoke and encourage debate and facilitate a fusion of disparate groups and ideas. To maximise the scope of those conversations we must ensure the Traverse continues to be accessible, attractive and welcoming to the many, not just the few.If we are to achieve that, we need to react to the many changes in the world around us and open up new pathways for people to come to the theatre, both as writers and as audience members.To that end, today we launch the search for two people who will be instrumental in shaping the work of the Traverse through to its th anniversary in  and beyond. After a period of consultation and reflection we are bolstering our leadership team by recruiting for a new artistic director of the Traverse Theatre Company, and a director of creative development. This investment will ensure we give equal energy to creating a vibrant programme of work that celebrates new material and developing routes into the theatre for new writers and audiences.The director of creative development will devote time and effort to strengthening those pathways by nurturing our relationships with communities here in Scotland and further afield. We believe creativity is an attribute everyone has and that everyone should be given the opportunity to explore their artistic talents. In creating a new role which has ultimate responsibility for that work, we will in turn enable and empower the incoming artistic director to focus exclusively on overseeing a new writing programme that represents an ambitious artistic vision for the Traverse.The people we appoint to these two roles will be joining a talented and determined team that has been instrumental in shaping this new structure and is eagerly awaiting this next phase in our growth. We believe these changes will not only help us deliver our vision, but meet our ambition to change the world we live in through the work we produce and the creative development programmes we champion. The Traverse exists to amply unfamiliar voices and to reach fresh eyes and ears with the work we produce all year round. If you feel as passionately about that as we do, we would love to hear from you.Linda Crooks is the Traverse’s executive producer.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"nick clegg brexit means the clock is ticking to the end of the uk","story":"Brexit means the \"clock is ticking\" for the end of the UK, the former Liberal Democrat leader and deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg has claimed.In an interview with the New Statesman magazine, Mr Clegg, who took the Lib Dems into coalition with the Conservatives from  to , said Brexit had \"unleashed an aggressive and regressive right-wing English Nationalism\" that had taken over the Tories.“It seems to me that the clock is now ticking for the end of the union of the United Kingdom,\" Mr Clegg said.: Gordon Brown says Union is in more danger than ever from nationalism\"I am afraid I’ve sort of come to the view I think that is now more likely than not.

This industry produces more green house gases than the all of transportation. In fact, it is several times greater than transportation. The catch  scenario is this industry has had no regulation or legislation is regard to reducing greenhouse gases, infact, due to population growth, the pollution created by agriculture is vastly on the increase. Technology has played its part, but it is a situation where reducing pollution is very, very dficult to achieve given the nature of the industry itself. As the population increases, this will become more relevant in terms of the overall pollution created, and no doubt, something will have to be done. Whether sea based farming of certain foods may reduce the pollution, but much of agriculture is still based on land and the production of meat will still create problems related to greenhouse gases in terms of land used for meat production and or crop production as well. It is a dilemma which will become more relevant as the population increases.I can assure you these bairns weren#t pushed into anything. They were toldthey wanted to go they had to complete a form.

The courage comes from not following the crowd herd and forming an independent and educated view. Jumping headlong onto the bandwagon is easy, understanding the science and striving to do something about it the hard bit. Joining a not fully educated and scientically ignorant caucus is just so stupid.Especially a meaningless strike from school, what child would not love a day off among mates  No doubt the pig ignorant and stupid will be so impressed. A bit like supergluing yourself tp a bus or train, outstanding!!!I didnt say it took courage to join a protest, I said it takes courage to speak at the Town Hall. Andit was about time off school, they all would have gone. Please have more respect for our bairns and young folk.And these bairns are, for your information, studying the stem subjects at school.It is not a case of having respect for the bairns, Johan Adamson. It is just a case of having absolutely no respect whatsoever for those who politicise them and drive them like sheep. Primary children used in a political strike!! Repulsive behaviour, you should be ashamed, so socialist, child exploitation is the words that come to mind.They had to complete a form, primary children! What next, form a political Union and become militant  Little Orwellian sheep bleating for the Pigs.These were AHS pupils Ian, not primary pupils, and no one has politicised them.Educated them yes, but then I forgot you have the monopoly on climate change education and stem subjects.The organisers were I think over , so young adults.The fact is I will always criticise revolting behaviourand ignorance and I am not referring to the children.Yes I do believe sixth year pupils are capable of organising thisWhy do you assume Ian that these bairns are not studying stem subjects and that only you know about climate change then Ian Infantile comments  Pot kettle springs to mind.Now just who printed these forms the children had to fill in  Which teachers OKed the strike and arrange for Brae and Aith schools also took part, as well as bairns from the Sound Primary School and organised and paid for transport  I do not believe that was AHS sixteen-year-olds for one second.Whether by accident or design this provides a very convenient fig leaf for the council#s lamentable performance on child poverty.Much was made of the #children#s march# at the SIC#s education committee meeting today however in a news report about the part of the same meeting that dealt with the council#s child poverty action report, it was clear that the council have done next to nothing since the Shetland Inequalities Commission reported in March .know. All these admirable young citizens are guilty of is taking a stand based on commonly accepted information. I could ask what special knowledge does Ian think he has that allows him to lord it over them# but nerves fail me.On Ian’s earlier point, it is self-evident thatwe need some people with a high level of competence in STEM subjects who can take critical stand on matters scientic. Gaining some depth in the Arts and Humanities, however, increases the likelihood of developing sensitivity and compassion, concern for humanity and the future of our planet, self-awareness and insight into common human foibles, hubris and self-aggrandisement included! Learners on this path can also become alert to common logical fallacies. Even those who like Ian, with a preference for physical sciences, can benefit. Happily don’t need to be much of a scholar to spot an ad hominem attack. With all due respect for Ian’s past achievements in the physical sciences, it would be nicehe could make his points without belittling others #kids included. That’s a normal standard “of decency and tolerance” btw.I so agree with these word #gaining some depth in the Arts and Humanities, however, increases the likelihood of developing sensitivity and compassion, concern for humanity and the future of our planet, self-awareness and insight into common human foibles, hubris and self-aggrandisement included!#. You do so hold yourself in such regard high Peter, now go glue yourself to a train or bus to prove your point!But just at that moment, as though at a signal, all the sheep burst out into a tremendous bleating of- #Four legs good, two legs better! Four legs good, two legs better! Four legs good, two legs better!# It went on for five minutes without stopping. And by the time the sheep had quieted down, the chance to utter any protest had passed, for the pigs had marched back into the farmhouse ”.And what are you doing Ian to save the planet And what would you suggest the AHS and the SIC do Ad Hominem attacks # playing the man not the ball # are often used by those who don’t have much of an argument to begin with. Instead of dealing with whether the young people have a point or not, generous-spirited Ian opted to have a go instead.Logical fallacies show lazy thinking, masking an absence of creativity and independent thought. Ian’s trollswipe above looks Ad Hominem in approach st first, but he is also using the Tu Quoque Fallacy. This is where you accuse the opponent of hypocrisy to avoid answering their charge. Self-effacing Ian thus avoids addressing the possibility of his own hubris or lack of self-knowledge.Should I have made things easier for him and asked what his actual beef with the climate protestors was  He says “Joining a not fully educated and scientically ignorant caucus is just so stupid”and demands that everyone should be able to answer “how does today’s Global Warming compare with the Global Warming scientically after and during the Second Ice Age ” before taking a view. Perhaps he will educate us by answering his own question # sticking to terms that demonstrate tolerance and decency of course. Nuclear Free Council, Declair Climate emergency,climate justice what a load of utter bunkum. Especially stop allowing political activists to exploit our children.I put forward the question : Is nuclear power the only solution to stop greenhouse gas emissions and the only way to stop climate change progressing further  It may be the worse case scenario in terms of our power demand solution, but what are the alternatives to our demand for energy without causing further environmental and ecological damage to the planet by in using fossil fuels or cleaner alternatives like wind or solar   It has been suggested the Sahara Desert could be used for solar energy to power Europe, but how much land would be required and could this be expanded  The alternatives to fossil fuels may be cleaner, but how would this affect global weather patterns or the depletion of species due to the destruction of natural habitats being replaced for energy production Very sadly the SG SNP has committed to wind energy with its catastrophic environmental damage and only intermittent supply, but that is the policy of the scientically ignorant and utterly stupid.Thank you for your comments, Ian. I fear humanity will have no choice but to go nuclear for its energy production in the future.Alternative resources, like wind or solar, may be the short term answer, but as mentioned, the downside to this is the large amount of land which will be required with the ability to vastly expand as demand increases. What would be the environmental damage and the destabilization of le on the planet have in the long term with such technologies  There is also the issue of economics dictating progress on future energy production, and would this be counter-productive due profits taking priority over progress and the reduction of the pollution into the environment  I agree with your comments Ian, in regard to nuclear based energy production. However, like many issues to do with progress, something catastrophic will have to take place before we realize we should have acted sooner.There it is again, the abusive and arguably ignorant use of that word “stupid”. Having reread all contributions above it seems Ali denies there’s a problem by saying there are dangerously low CO levels, John distracts by arguing the council should care more for child poverty, and Ian disparages, disparages and disparages again. Are all three attempting to harmonise from the same alt-right reactionary hymn-sheet Ian’s singular approach is getting between him and his key message. I’ve long been puzzling as to what makes the good doctorso determined to overuse petty insult so freely, but it would be helpful to know just whathis specic problem with climate change protests is. If he could but answer his own Ice Age question to Brian , his motive might become a little clearer.

Hold on# Eureka!#Are all three attempting to harmonise from the same alt-right reactionary hymn-sheet # What a plonker, Peter, just cannot resist going political. Is thisLabour or SNP talking, he often points in both directions or is he now Green Maybe the characters on here who hate the idea of young people protesting about climate change should head down to the school and start shouting some of this stuff over the wall.But, then again, that might make them see . . . well . . . insane.Folk writing to the paper to have a go at the protesters is one of the most depressing contributions to local public debate imaginable.Hopefully, though, the usual naysayerswill only encourage them to do it more.There#s nothing wrong with anyone, of any age, having an opinion on whatever they like, and expressing it. But in their own time, only.The problem with this is that participation in this protest was permitted and facilitated,not encouraged by the education authority, which by default is an endorsement of the opinion being expressed in the protest and the timing method by which the protest was made, by the education authority.Education authorities and schools are supposed to be impartial, by granting #authorised absence# status to a politically motivated protest, that impartiality is now seriously called in to question and a dangerous precedent has been set.There was no reason other than a cynical publicity stunt for this protest to take place during the school day. If those still at school feel strongly enough to organise a protest like adults do, that#s fine, let them, but also like adults, it#ll have to happen in their own time, or they suffer the consequences of #unauthorised absence#, for it to be taken seriously.If they want to play in the big bad world, they play by the big bad world#s rules, not by special favours like this was.Only a few nutters are #impartial# about climate change these days.Do you mean that civil disobedience would have been better Well said Mark! The evident concern trollingis intended to deligitimise the voice of young people who, lets remember, are meant by right to have a say in matters that concern them. Scotland’s national curriculum intends younger learners become active and responsible global citizens. Therefore no one involved in supporting the reported protest has done any wrong, other than in the eyes of seemingly knee-jerk reactionaries who may well be hiding their true motives. Artfully comparing these identiable young people to Orwell’s unthinking farm animals, in order to subvert their point# well it more than lacks sensitivity and compassion. It is desperate, pitul and contemptible in equal measure. It may well also fall foul of observing normal standards of decency and tolerance that contributors to these pagesare meant to adhere to. Those joining the protest were not “stupid”, as has been claimed above. The overuse of that intolerant word may be though. I note you mention #Scotland’s national curriculum intends younger learners become active and responsible global citizens.# now could you explain how taking time off school and striking for the declaration of aclimate emergency makes the child an active and responsible global citizen  I rather feel they are being played by our Greeny ignoramuses and SNP political propagandists! Never mind, I am sure they enjoyed their day off school.Nuclear power  Thatgreat physicistRobert Oppenheimer , on seeing the first atomic bomb explode said with horror—-“ I am become death , the destroyer of worlds.”. The people of Japan and Chernobyl have had a taster and I suspect they arenot eager for a repeat. .However,Shetland is####..Hmm.Rock on.Haydn, Thorium reactors, not Uranium! no atom bombs, no long term isotopes decaying for millennia. Almost infinite clean energy with really cheap fuel.Where would your preferred site be for the Shetland nuclear power station be Dr Tinkler  Aith  Bigton  Would bring plenty work to the west side. You could include it in your manestoyou stand for the council again.Well, Ray Purchase, it is already here. Thousands of Shetlanders have had radiotherapy and had their lives saved by a nuclear atomic reactions of one type or another.I seriously doubtthere is a single person on Shetland who has not had their own, a member of their family or close friends le saved by the products of nuclear reactors.Are you so moronic as to deny that or is that a bit too deep for you to understand or Oh dear Dr Tinkler, it seems you’ve come down with a nasty case of whataboutery. I didn’t ask you about the undoubted benefits of x-rays and radiotherapy I asked you where you would build a nuclear power station in Shetland. Now do you think you could give a straight answer to a straight question  Physician heal thyself!If thorium proves viable, I would be happy for such a station in Lerwick. Safe, clean, small and less damaging than the district heating woodchip waste burner we have at present and infinitely less toxic. I also asked is that a bit too deep for you to understand  # So it seems to be!!Well done Ian, you answered the question! There was a lot of unnecessary waffling and needless aggression but you got there. So, in the incredibly unlikely event of a, totally safe, nuclear power plant being built in Shetland you’d still want it as far away from where you live as possible. Fair dos.Instead of nuclear power or gas have you ever put any thought into wind power  I’ve heard that they don’t cause any carbon pollution at all, so they’d be ideal. They’re very pretty too and scientic. Like an actual windmill, I’m a big fan.Sadly Ray, you are being misled. take Viking for example. Peat disturbance alone. over  kilometres of tracks, the ground footprint of over  square kilometres. A fair amount of COreleased there. Then tens of thousands of tons of concrete basses.emissions, Chatham House.  kilometres of the interconnector, Copper plastic!!! Now just imagine the peat is so unstable that helicopters are being used, just to move survey teams to reconnoitre the site. Tracked vehicles to damaging for the peat!! . Just what is that carbon footprint  Laughableit was not so sad!How something you and Mark Ryan Smith may understand. The very latest scientic information on controlling climate change “Tree planting #has mind-blowing potential# to tackle climate crisis” , now would not planting a tree be a more rational action for these children  That would be the sensible, intelligent and educated option. PS, could someone please inform the SIC SNP SCT and Green Lunatics!No one here has denied climate change Brian Smith. Just a discussion on the merits or otherwise of the School children#s strike. Our youngsters being encouraged to jump on the #Greta Thunberg# bandwagon. There you really do have a sacricial lamb to the European Green lunatics but that is another really sad story!You mustcarefully, Mr T.Well, Brian, I have never denied Climate change. I just dispute the best way to combat it.Deft footwork here from Ian. His, and his hero Farage’s position # not that he cares to own up to it # is not that there is no climate change. Obviously the climate changes over time. What he is conveniently avoiding are the questions around cause and appropriate response.Please do not make up speculative little stories porkies Peter. Farage is not my hero, however, I find him infinitely preferable to Corbyn and Salmond, however, here is not the place to digress further.Will Hell freeze over before Ian tells us what he presumes the protestors are ignorant of  Answering the question he posed Brian is not too mammoth a task for him surely. I suspect he is trying to dodge it for a reason.Read and weep Peter. If your intellect stretches that far. !! In the most simple of Science, It is set out below. The protestors are ignorant of the very most basic understanding of carbon capture and the prevention of climate change. Trees!! Only the very most utterly stupid, like yourself cannot see the wood for them!It is not clear the protest had a position on biomass, however Ian has firmly stated the need for those taking any position to be able to answer #how does today’s Global Warming compare with the Global Warming scientically after and during the Second Ice Age #Ian has thus far excitedly cited three articles, none of which reference any ice age. The first: #Tree planting ‘has mind-blowing potential’ to tackle climate crisis#, has Professor Crowther emphasising #it remains vital to reverse the current trends of rising greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuel burning and forest destruction, and bring them down to zero# this is needed to stop the climate crisis becoming even worse and because the forest restoration envisaged would take - years to have its full effect##Reafforestation, necessary as it is, isn#t no silver bullet, nor a speedy enough solution, though many on the protest would likely love to plant some trees.The second and third articles focus on biomass, which is contested.To help Ian make his point, does he mean the Cryogenian, the second last ice age or the Little Ice Age  Again, other than to spread scorn and belittle, what is Ian#s actual point Sorrymy point is beyond you Peter. My question # “how does today’s Global Warming compare with the Global Warming scientically after and during the Second Ice Age ”That would require a thesis at post-graduate level to answer. Hardly space here! My point was that these children simple to not have the science to have a considered and informed opinion based on knowledge. The science is actually simple, I suggest you look it up and read it.Lest anyone thinking of studying the sciences, physical or social, be put off, Ian’s approach to advancing a scientic argument is far from typical. Thomas Kuhn made a very useful contribution by proposing that as a science advances some innaccurate claims will inevitably be made and indeed built on, but will later be corrected as sufficient contrary evidence emerges. Hawkins himself corrected some of his own foundational work. A settled consensus generally emerges over time through reasonable and reasoned dialogue and argument in which peer reviewed sources, research evidence and the thinking they provoke are made apparent.This is perhaps one reason why the Shetland Times asks contributors to observe normal standards of decency and tolerance for the opinions of others. It helps to bring forth the truth.It is, however, more than unusual for anyone taking themselves seriously to make a strong central scientic claim then refuse to back it up, clary it’s meaning or intent# unless of course Ian is proposing rhetoric, cant and distracting insult are now sciences, in which case top marks are due to the happy fellow.What a load of pretentious twaddle. You have outdone yourself here Peter. The word Science simply means knowledge, no more no less. It is just as simple as that.Whilst he remains intent on running away from clarying and substantiating his own point, here is an easier question for Ian: Why does he call Greens lunatics  There must be some point of disagreement between him and them, in his own head at least.That would be self-evident Peter. Read up the following. Bio-Fuels, palm oil plantation. Diesel fuel promotions, particulates. Germany non-nuclearpolicy,brown coal burning. Shetland exports clean gas imports polluting wood chip. Tree planting reverses CO build up, wood chip more polluting than coal burning and deforests huge areas. The EU % of renewable, Biomass .Greenies promote non-nuclear. more people killed in wind farm accidents in Uk than nuclear ever has. All the above would indicate a somewhat lunatic approach from the Greens. Now we have, using helicopters to survey Viking Energy sites as peat too unstable for tracked vehicles to reach, unbelievable!!! I hate to say the cult of #Greta Thunberg#,depression, eating disorders, and anxiety attacks,Asperger’s syndrome, high-ing autism, and OCD. She also suffers from selective mutism and self-harm. The sacricial lamb of the Greens across Europe. The inspiration behind the school strikes!!!!! Nowthat#s not lunatic, what is Ian’s position on global warming is either well grounded or is, well, hot air. He knows how this goes. Either he has a reputable theorist publishing an article in a reputable journal, or even a weblink to a news story referencing such, or he doesn’t. Because some vested interests have bought and paid for their own pet scientiststhere may be dferent opinions regarding whatever his as yet unclear point was with his unnamed and undated second ice age. If he really wants to be taken seriously he should put up or# consider his alternative.C’mon Ian, one reference to one reputable scientist backing up whatever it is you so obviously don’t want to say. You know you can do it.I am would be intrigued to opinions relating to climate change due to agriculture and what would be the answer to providing food but reducing or stopping climate change due to agriculture. I may be wrong but I believe agriculture produces  times more greenhouse gases than all of transportation put together, but this has, conveniently, been avoided by the media and scientic community. There is a terrible dilemma between producing food to this of attempting to reduce green houses gases and the progressive climate change taking place Both Ian and Greta Thunberg are right tho. We are not taking climate change seriously enough and we are confused.One minute providing grants to preserve Shetland#s peat carbon store, and the next proposing digging acres of it up, releasing all that carbon, to build Viking.Giving out paper straws in McDonalds with juice in a plastic cup .I mind askingabout planting trees on my croft. They said #oh we dont want these clumps of trees any more, not our landscape#, when I had always thought tree planting was good.Such a mixed message. Why dont we have a green rating system like we have for our washing machines. You could rate biomass, nuclear, windfarms from construction to operation in terms of green to red, so we would know where we are in the scale with our choices.Any way, still have a patch of high hill that would be great for a mini woodsI referenced Greta with a very heavy heart, a truly exploited child whose background would fire concern with any child specialist in the UK, psychologist or Social worker.Sorry, Johan, who isn#t #taking climate change seriously# Theresa May and the Tories are taking it very seriously, indeed, passing Mrs May#s unilateral # net zero# plan into law. The Treasury says it will cost over £ trillion , enough to fund the salaries of , nurses for  years.Too little for Greta Thunberg and her #Extinction Rebellion pals, apparently.This will find its way on to consumers# electricity bills, including those in fuel poverty, a clear majority of homes in Shetland #  percent, before the recent price hikes.The Shetland Labour Party that I grew up with was concerned with alleviating poverty, not creating it. They were not interested inwinning #Green Blue Peter Badges# for futile, bourgeois bagatelles like#tackling climate change#, without any hope of success.Britain, far less, Shetland, can achieve nothing alone.The only candidate to exhibit concern for Shetland#s poor is Ian Scott.Im confused. You state that the Tories are proposing  net zero and then you say Labour creating poverty.I am very seriously concerned about fuel poverty everywhere and especially in Shetland. I hope that there are no price hikes in our fuel bills, this is something we need to resist, and I also hope more help is forthcoming for retrofitting better heating systems and more insulation to improve housing quality.Please do not try to tell me what I believe.Johan, I don’t recall you ever mentioning fuel poverty before. Do you support or oppose “ net zero”, which was done in knee-jerk response to the campaigns of Greta Thunberg and her pals “Extinction Rebellion” Only, you have been supporting Ms Thunberg’s “climate emergency” campaign at local level, have you not Mrs May’s , nurses salaries for  years isn’t “emergency” enough for them, they want more.You can huff and puff as much as you like, the cost will find its way to the fuel poor, increasing their number.I put it to you that you cannot simultaneously support Greta Thunberg AND the fuel poor, whom you have now mentioned for the first time.Mr Scott has been arguing for Shetland’s poor since long before he became a councillor.No John I have not been supporting Greta#s campaign locally and yes I have mentioned fuel poverty before and I think I can support greener politics and the poor. It is an important point tho, how we are going to pay for it all. I heard somewhere the Tories are going to pay for it from the proceeds of G.Johan, I responded to your comment above that Greta Thunberg is right .You have also defended the Shetland schools strike “climate emergency” demonstration in this self, same thread.I quote: “Both Ian and Greta Thunberg are right tho. We are not taking climate change seriously enough#..etc..”That sounds awful like you think Mrs May committing  years’ worth of , nurses salaries isn’t “taking climate change seriously enough” If you are now saying that you do not support Greta Thunberg and do wish to tackle Shetland’s lamentable fuel poverty, will you be making a clear, prominent statement to that effect in your campaign literature Including your and Shetland Labour’s proposals for solving the fuel poverty The twisting of my words is really uncalled for, and completely ignoring the main point of my post which is that we need a green rating system to stop you all arguing about what is green and what is not # but then you enjoy the fight too much and would poo poo any system anyway I suppose.Strange move of support from Wir Shetland to Ian Scott  You#re scraping the barrel, now, Johan, getting personal. After your Up Helly-Aa performance, your comment about #enjoying the fight# is, frankly,a bit rich.It appears you are not prepared to make the campaign commitment I suggested. That#s ok.I#m not supporting anyone yet as I haven#t heard from all the candidates. I merely pointed out that Mr Scott is the only one so far to have shown any real concern for Shetland#s poor. He needs to say more about that. Under the present arrangements #climate emergency# will dump on the fuel poor. They have votes, too, of course # more than  percent of the electorate.Good luck with your campaign.Given his concern for the fuel poor John Tulloch will presumably be supporting whichever candidate puts the cancellation of Brexit first and foremost in their manesto  The largest driver of upward pressure on heating bills over the past two years is the devaluation of the pound following the Brexit vote. Greta Thunberg had nothing to do with it. In the event of further declines in the value of the pound post prime minister Johnson increased hard Brexit probability, the suffering of the fuel poor will continue to worsen as the wholesale price of gas becomes relatively more expensive when purchased in pounds sterling.The  dilemma that John Tulloch posed to Johan Adamson could equally well be phrased thus: I put it to you that you cannot simultaneously support Brexit AND the fuel poor.I apologiseI have gotten personal. Be as naesty as du wants, I just cant fathom why you need to be so  Breakfast TV only this morning were talking about how the market is not working, people not changing utility supplier and these people paying more as a consequence.Its surely not fairyour contract runs out that they are able to leave you on a higher rate Action on fuel poverty needs to include tackling the inequalities in the market as well as action to make our houses warmer.Ok, Johan. I’ve made my points about fuel poverty and there’snothing I want to add.So forgive meI don’t digress into bickering about who has or hasn’t been “naesty”. Readers may judge.Good luck with your campaign.Yes, Ian can answer a question when he chooses to. And there is sense in some of what he says. Wind farms on peat, for example, happen when commercial interests chase subsidies, so it is up to governments to get the correct approach. Not all that blame goes at the Green’s door, and they are either correct to claim there is a climate emergency or they are not.On the climate emergency Ian’s thoughts can only be guessed at. They have something to do with an ice-age, which is appropriate as progress towards getting him to answer his own question is, as yet, glacial.A big problem inside these debates stems from some people get beguiled by fake scientic claims. This is why genuine people making genuine scientic claims are generally happy to back them up by referencing the work of the real scientists involved. This offers folk who may or may not be less expert than Dr. Ian Tinklersome protection from charlatans with an axe to grind. Again,Ian is serious, rather than just being a contraryIan, he will reveal his ice-age source s. Or would doing so would reveal his actual movitation  C’mon Ian, youknowyouwantto.I actually sent them to the Times. They failed to print them as perhaps regarded as irrelevant pertaining to the school strike. I will do so again so Peter can untwist his knickers.The book you really should read, Mr T., is The Uninhabitable Earth by David Wallace Wells.

Writing for theis not reliable science training any more than writing for the Mail..Try reading it.Abruptclimate change , at younger dryasfor years also because of meteorite strike in Greenland. We still haven#t founda proper way of storing spent nuclear fuel, i can seethe repository at Sellafield being under miles of snow through the many ice ages to come before it issafe again.The nuclear nonsensewas never about cheap and safe electricity it was of course about weapons grade plutonium tons,produced here in Scotland alone,why that amount when a few tons could polish off the entire planet does anyone know Do we trust Boris and fruitcake farm with this ,aye right- their record speaks for itself! Maybe the bairns protesting about climate change holds a candle of hope up - -we are all going to need it.Graham Fleming, Thorium breakdown isotopes have short half-lives. Long term storage is nor an issue. Ask a standard grader that is beyond your understanding.Incidentally, the global stockpile of separated plutonium is about  tonnes. That is  tonnes too much, however Thorium reactors produce none at all. Sad you cannot get your facts straight Graham Flemming, so very SNP.Having read these pages for a long time Peter, it should be apparent by now that Ian is a dental surgeon by training and therefore qualies for Dr status.No need to have a PhDor any other bits of paper !Ok, well thanks to Ian, andthe Times did withhold the links as irrelevant to the school strike they maybe had a point. It was Ian that insisted to Brian Smith way back when that this issue was relevant, for whatever reason.I#m still not clear what Ian draws from these articles though, or why anyone would have to have this knowledge to take a view on the current level of threat, but I get that global warming isn#t about to lead to another ice age. I don#t recall the protest saying it would# It#s a welcome change to have Ian express himself without resort to petty insult though. Long may that continue. On his earlier point on science, however, I#m not sure most scientists would agree science means knowledge only, as Ian proposed, without including the search for it by using scientic methods.But here is the big unanswered question # whatever it is Ian take from these links # does he, or does he not, think we are facing a climate crisis  If we are then surely the kids are right to be concerned, especially as some government sponsored action on climate change is potentially green-wash.Slight problem with the colour test Johan.About % of men have problems when distinguishingbetween red and green .

The Loch Ewe farm has failed the required environmental standards for nearly  years. Mowi, despite virtually unlimited resources, were apparently unwilling or unable to make the necessary changes. broadcast in May.In January , the Scottish Parliament#s Rural Economy and Connectivity Committee agreed to undertake an enquiry into the state of salmon fishing in Scotland and in November  the regulatory body SEPA published proposals for a revised regulatory regime for the finfish sector. Within these proposals, SEPA said it would begin a programme of work to #modernise the regulation of existing sites#.Mowi#s head of environmental management, Stephen MacIntyre, said that the company wanted to #align its growth# with recent recommendations. The company had plans to sustainably grow their fish production levels over the next few years by #expanding into new high-energy farming areas located further offshore#.Bill Whyte, convener of the Wester Ross Area Salmon Fishery Board, said he welcomed Mowi#s recognition of the wild salmonid habitats and added: #We will expect further clarity about the process of biomass relocation. However,Mowi can provide evidence through EIAplanning and SEPA regulatory structure that the relocated biomass will have reduced potential impact on wild migratory fish, then we would be prepared to support biomass relocation on a conditional basis.#*A spokesperson from the Scottish Environment Protection Agency , said: “It is really encouraging to see that industry is proactively choosing to consider more sustainable locations for fish farms, away from more sensitive waters where pressures on the marine environment are greatest. “SEPA’s new regulatory framework for marine cage fish farming, launched on  June, , combines more accurate modelling and enhanced monitoring to encourage a more sustainable approach to the siting of fish farms. “In practice, we anticipate this will lead to fewer fish farms in shallower, slow-flowing waters and more fish farms in offshore locations where the environment capacity can better assimilate wastes. The new framework is designed to actively support operators who are seeking to relocate to more sustainable locations, and through improved practices and the innovative use of new technologies, reduce their impact on the marine environment.#They went on to add: “Indeed, our new framework provides exactly the type of flexibility and outcome-focus Mowi outlines it is looking for.Within this new framework, we will consider each inidual proposal on its merits against the legal standards.We encourage Mowi and other operators to work with us and other interested parties to explore their innovative proposals under our new framework.We look forward to doing so."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Kara-with-100m-IM-Gold.jpg","title":"inspirational western isles swimmer kara hanlon wins four gold medals at international island games in","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine July.And the -year old was not the only WesternIsles athlete to celebrate a podium place in the shadow of the famous rock, asmore joy followed in the pool and in the athletics stadium.Isla Budge won bronze in the -metres freestyle event, while in Thursday’s triple jump final Mary Macleod won silver and Heather MacKinnon took bronze.Eriskay jumper MacKinnon had won gold in the event in Gotland two years ago with a shorter jump than it took to win third this time around.Hanlon’s week of glory began on Monday whenshe retained the  metres breaststroke title she won in Gotland in .

We are still accepting donations up until next week until they are ready to be given out at St Peter’s [youth club],” he said.“We would just want to thank all those who have given their unorms, the community and Principal from St Oliver Plunkett, Mr McCabe, who put the message up on the school’s Facebook page and really ran with it.”Pastor Tony Meehan from the West Belfast Foodbank told the Andersonstown News that he had been “surprised” at the scale of the response.“The week the schools were closing no unorms had been given in, I was having a minor panic thinking people weren’t going to respond. But on the Thursday of the final week a couple of the primary schools had done a non-unorm day and told the children to bring their unorms in – two mini buses were filled full of bags of unorms,” he said. “Since then we been receiving donations every single day. We want to emphasise that there will be unorms from all schools, primary and post primary, in West Belfast available on the two days we have set aside for collection and to thank everyone who has donated so far.”Free school unorms will be distributed on July  from pm-pm and July  from am-pm at St Peter’s Immaculata Youth Club.

We’re guests every year at the place we go.“As guests we are very conscious that we want to be part of the community. We are very clear that we want to spend money in the community. We want to help with legacy funds in the community. But we will be gone in a couple of weeks. And so we want to live with the community.”He added: “There’s always things going on around the golf. And that’s wonderful. And the community carries on. Our job is to put on the Open Championship and to respect the fact that we are guests.”Portrush home-grown golf star Graeme McDowell also tried not be to drawn into the realm of politics when asked about the musical event on the final practice day.“I certainly don’t really want to start getting into politics and religion and that kind of stuff,” he said.“I’m not intelligent and educated enough in the real intricacies of why and how we still do this stuff.“People like to celebrate. As long as it’s all respectfully done, we’ll listen to people. It’s a free country, right “I don’t really want to get into that stuff. It’s a very dficult conversation, and Northern Ireland is a very unique place.

They have provided assurances that she will not be disadvantaged as a result of losing out on the experience of acting up nor will she be victimised in any way. The Board has also committed to liaising with the Equality Commission on appropriate training in recruitment and selection with specic focus on part-time workers.Anne McKernan, head of legal services at the Equality Commission, welcomed the result. \"This is a good result all round,\" she said. \"One of the main reasons we support cases is to effect change.\"While Catherine missed out on this opportunity, she has been able to secure a change in policy and practice that will benefit other teachers into the future. \"Its good that this has been resolved productively and amicably.\"Ms McKernan said the case should serve as a reminder to employers of the need to treat staff fairly. \"Were publicising this to remind all employers of the dficulties and dangers of disadvantaging people on flexible or part-time working arrangements, even unintentionally,\" she said.The legal expert pointed out that % of female employees work part-time in NI compared to % of male workers.Women make up % of part-time employees here. \"Because of the high concentration of women in part-time jobs, any measure which excludes part-timers from a particular post or promotion is likely to have a more adverse effect on women,\" Ms McKernan explained. \"Thats why it may amount to indirect sex discrimination.\" Ms McCormick, who will continue teaching at the grammar school, also welcomed the outcome which she believes has led to positive change. \"I love my job and am happy at the school,\" she said. \"So Im pleased that a new co-option policy has been put in place which will ensure that opportunities for career enhancement are dealt with in a formal and procedurally correct manner.\""},{"url":null,"title":"private jet numbers soar at derry airport for the open","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsThe TwelfthThe OpenNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

More often than not, these people are unassuming and go about their lives in the same manner.“These people are society’s real legends and in the history of St Joseph’s, fewany, earned that accolade more than John Dunne.”That chapter of the book on St Joseph’s was entitled ‘One of nature’s gentlemen’, and there’s absolutely no reason to change that title for the purposes of this appreciation of John Dunne’s le because in my opinion its accuracy cannot be upgraded in any way.‘Big John’ as he was affectionately known to all former pupils of the school, made a positive mark on thousands of young lives in his four decades at St Joseph’s. It would be hard to find anyone that would disagree that the word big when applied to John Dunne not only represented his physical stature but also his intelligence and patience.By , the Dunne family had lived at Brandywell Road, Burnfoot and then back to Derry and more specically the newly developing Creggan estate.John Dunne began his career at St Columb’s College in  in the company of contemporaries such as Nobel laureates John Hume, Seamus Heaney.In  he told me: “I enjoyed the time at St Columb’s without really realising or wondering what le was about. There were people then who went back up to the College at six o’clock and studied until nine o’clock.“But, I and another man, Bill Smyth, who also ended up teaching at St Joseph’s, instead of going to the school, followed a great interest we had discovered-greyhounds. That was our main pursuit. Strangely, we both also ended up training as teachers at St Joseph’s College in Belfast which was linked to Queen’s University but separate in that it awarded its own accreditation.”It was at training college that John Dunne encountered a dilemma. Already well-known for his ability as a footballer, his lelong passion, he had to make the choice of whether he would pursue as a career as PE teacher.“I had distinct limitations, because when I was very young, I nearly died twice. When I was six months old and again when I was five, I caught pneumonia. I remember the second time and having to lie from about December to April before I came around.“I was in a sort of comatose state for a long time, but my mother God rest her, battled away and I survived. But, it left me severely limited in terms of stamina. In terms of pace, I was very quick off the mark, but I couldn’t sustain it. And, the further up you went in football, the more of a problem it became. I loved reserve football, but the full senior game was just too fast for me,” he said.In September  John began his teaching career at the newly opened St Joseph’s Secondary School in Creggan for the princely sum of £ per month. It was here that he spent the entire span of his professional le.The new school with its emphasis educating those who had not successfully navigated the old  plus exam, it was a ready-made home for John Dunne and many of his contemporaries alike. Like many of his era, John benefitted from easier access to grammar school system because of post-war changes to British education policy. But, also like many of his generation, John spoke candidly about his reservations on it. His words also revealed why he preferred the non-selective route through school.“The thing about going to St Columb’s is that we weren’t completely accepted. We were dferent somehow. The boarders who stayed there were the ‘real’ St Columb’s boys as far as the clergy were concerned.“There are things now that are still etched in my memory. Where I lived, there was a protest after a child lost a leg having been hit by a bus. The people were worried about the safety of their children so they weren’t prepared to let the bus keep travelling that route.“Anyhow, the protest could be seen from the College. A priest, who shall remain nameless said, ‘well, what would you expect from people like that ’“We took great umbrage at that. I had been through a kind of elitist system at St Columb’s, where you had to prove yourself in the first place by getting so many marks in an  plus exam, in English and Maths-and they weren’t easy. They were quite dficult examinations. I went to the Christian Brothers at they drilled us kept us on in the afternoon for an hour, got us up on Saturday mornings and drilled us and drilled us.“When I went to teach in a secondary school it was very dferent. You had children there that for one reason or another had fallen through the system. They hadn’t perhaps done themselves justice in the system that surrounded them. In my time at St Joseph’s there were children who should not have been there because they could not get anything out of the system at all, no matter how much we tried or how much sympathy we had for their position. But we did try.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh“I had been through a system where I met good teachers, people who had made a good impact on my le. So, what I did when I saw what they were doing was imitate them. I wove all the goodness in other people into a fabric that I could use myself, and I found that it worked,” said John.At the end of John Dunne’s first decade as a teacher, the Troubles erupted on the streets of his native city. St Joseph’s geographical location meant that major disturbances often encroached upon the school itself. It befell people like John Dunne to provide a calm backdrop to the mayhem outside the gates of St Joseph’s.In  he said: “It was a very, very strange environment to be working in, because all hell could have broken loose in the immediate vicinity of the school at any time. There were teachers out on the streets, acting as buffers, trying tom keep a lid on things.“In practical terms, I found it very hard because in summer time it was very hot and you had to open the windows to let a bit of air in. But, there were helicopters flying about and the noise was unbearable and the youngsters couldn’t hear you. A lot of young people became involved and some of them lost their lives as a consequence.”Apart from a very quick but understated wit, John Dunne was blessed with a fantastic voice, full of dramatic intonation, that would have been the envy of many stage actors.As a teacher of the English language John had the ability the bring the most boring text to le and kept his students enthralled. He could have been reading the contents of the back of a cereal box aloud, but when he spoke people listened.The ability to relate a story, complete with an array of accents when required, was one that he credited his grandfather John Downey with.“He was a great storyteller. I remember as a young boy he used to take me early in the morning for his pension. We used to go to Mass about seven or eight o’clock and then go to the train station on the Strand Road and out to Bridgend for his pension and then visit people in the area.“But when we were walking, he always told me stories about haunted houses, about what kind of flowers were at the side of the road.“There seemed to be no end to his knowledge and then he could deviate and tell me another yarn. I just thrived on his stories.“I think also it was the way I was taught at the Christian Brothers. They were very precise about language. It’s become too loose now. People are very loose, especially when using mobile phones.“I’ve even read about the use of the apostrophe being lost. I was taught these things were important when you wrote something. I stuck to it and I tried to instil it into youngsters without being overly heavy about it.”John Dunne’s dulcet tones were employed again when Derry City FC re-entered senior football in  and for many years after he commentated on many of the games played by his beloved Candystripes.This interview with John Dunne was conducted in  at Pilot’s Row community centre. At this stage he had been retired from teaching for almost two decades. But, the huge capacity that he had to retain swathes of information was still very much evident.Asto prove that very thing, in the later stages of this conversation a young boy, no more than ten or eleven years old walked past and said cheerily, ‘hello John!’Without blinking an eye, John Dunne recounted the boy’s family history and how many of his relatives attended St Joseph’s. That was proof that you could take the man away from St Joe’s, but not St Joe’s away from the man.The interview with John Dunne ended with him speaking about the five decades since the school opened.He said: “It’s been some fty years, especially for somebody like me who has finished up living in the Bogside. When I got here, I was a little bit apprehensive about being someone who worked in St Joseph’s and being accepted into the local community. But, it’s no bother. I am on first name terms with people.“I was walking over to Mailey’s pub one night in the summer about .. It was a beautul night. There was a group of young men sitting in a garden. I was walking in the middle of the road and one of them came out and addressed me by my name.“He said, ‘John, there are not many teachers that could do what you are doing and walked through this area untouched.“That’s good to know I said.”CAPTION: The late John Dunne."},{"url":null,"title":"operation motorman findings seamus bradley inquest made public next month","story":"The Inquest findings into one of the most controversial killings of the Troubles in Derry will be made public next month, the Derry News can reveal.Seamus Bradley was shot dead in highly disputed circumstances by the British Army during Operation Motorman in the early hours of July , .The Coroners Service for Northern Ireland has now confirmed that the findings of the Inquest will be announced by Judge Patrick Kinney on August  at Laganside Court in Belfast. The Inquest hearings took place over a twelve-day period last year.The British Army have claimed for the last  years, that Mr Bradley a -year-old IRA member, was armed when they opened fire on him close to the Bishop’s Field area of Creggan. This claim has consistently denied by the Bradley family over the decades.Danny Bradley, brother of the deceased man told the Derry News: “At the end of the day this is good news. It has taken  years and caused a lot of hurt for so long.“I am hoping that the findings will come out the way that we want it and we will be travelling together as family to Belfast next month to hear the outcome.“It destroyed our family, but I had to get the answer about what happened and I am certainly looking forward to that. After  years I will be glad to put it to bed because it has been a struggle.Seamus Quigley, solicitor for the family told the Derry News: “We share the relief of the Bradley family that after  years the findings of the case are now finally in sight.”googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshIn April this year the Public Prosecution Serviceannounced that it would proceed with charging a former British soldier with the murder of a teenage boy also killed on the morning of Operation Motorman.-year-old Daniel Hegarty was shot in the head on the morning of July , . His cousin Christopher Hegarty was also struck in the head by a round fired by the same soldier but survived the shooting. Soldier B, the man responsible for both incidents will also face a charge of wounding with intent in relation to Christopher Hegarty.The decision to prosecute the soldier represented the reversal of a decision taken in  not to prefer charges against the former British serviceman. That decision was however overturned after a Divisional Court ruling last year.Previous decisions not to prosecute in the Hegarty case were taken in  after the original Inquest and again in  following a review of the case by the former Historical Enquiries Team.Announcing the decision in relation to the Hegarty case, Director of the PPS Stephen Herron said: “I have given careful consideration to all of the available evidence. This has included material obtained in the course of the initial investigation by a later investigation carried out by the Historical Enquiries Team material generated by Inquest proceedings and a number of forensic reports-the most recent of which was provided after the Court ruling in .“I have concluded that the evidence which can be presented at court is sufficient to provide a reasonable prospect of conviction and the Evidential Test for Prosecution is met.”Nine people also died in Claudy on July ,  as three car bombs tore through the heart of the County Derry village.CAPTION: -year-old Seamus Bradley who was killed by the British Army on July , . "},{"url":null,"title":"scrapped bogside parking scheme blocks roll areas","story":"A Derry MLA has criticised a government department for its failure to deliver a Bogside residents’ parking scheme over the past decade.The comments made by SDLP MLA Mark H. Durkan come after the latest public consultation attracted over  objections which he now believes will scupper plans for similar schemes in areas such as Rosemount and Bishop Street.Mr Durkan said the Department for Infrastructurehas been “extremely ham-fisted” in its handling of the consultation process.The parking scheme issue stretches back around ten years, with ious public consultations having taken place in that time. At one stage, it was expected to be introduced in  but had to be pushed back until .In  then Roads Minister Danny Kennedy gave assurances that, “in the absence of signicant objections”, the scheme would be in place no later than Spring .However, this week, after a consultation ended last April and a further information session was held in November, a spokesperson for the Department explained that the proposed Rossville Street Residents’ parking scheme received a large number of objections from the residents.Of the  responses received, there were  objections to the scheme.The DfI told the Derry News that key areas of concern coming out of the consultation included the number of permits allocated for visitors, access for family carers and concerns over costs.The Department has since confirmed that the resident and visitor permits would be free and that a special permit would be available for family carers, also free of charge.The DfI spokesperson added: “The Department acknowledges that there is still a need to manage car parking in the Bogside and is now considering how to progress matters.“Consideration is being given to advancing a smaller scheme within the Rossville area to include Abbey Park, Glenfada Park and Columbcille Court, possibly as a pilot. The Department would hope to commence consultation for a smaller scheme in September.“The Department will write out to all residents living within the limits of the original Rossville scheme as soon it is confirmed how an alternative scheme will be progressed.“The Department is not in a position to consider other schemes at this time.”StaggeringMark H. Durkan is worried that delays to the Bogside parking scheme will now hamper the roll-out of similar schemes.“The fact this is happening will now block progress on any residents’ parking scheme where in the city.“Bogside residents want a parking scheme so it must be the design of it that people are objecting to. It’s staggering that a much-needed parking scheme in an area where residents struggle and have been crying out for a solution to the problem of getting parked outside their homes during the day has been scrapped.“This scheme has been deliberated over for ten years and the department has brought proposals forward that have been met with such opposition. It begs the question, was enough done to liaise and interact with objectors, and could they respond in turn to these objections.“Bogside was identied as a key area, as was Bishop Street and the next was the lower Rosemount university area. But now it seems asthe department has pulled the plug on those schemes and there is no chance of progress.”Parallel schemesThe SDLP representative had enquired about the possibility of a similar scheme in other areas which are badly impacted by students such as Rosemount, and Abercorn Place and Terrace which are both affected by city centre workers.“These could have been done in parallel so that at least one scheme could be advanced. People in Rosemount are frustrated that they’ve been put on the back burner while this other scheme was being progressed, but they’ll be even more frustrated to see it isn’t being progressed.“Rosemount and Bishop Street will now be way down the line, the handling of this by the Department of Infrastructure seems extremely ham-fisted,” Mr Durkan added.The Rossville Street area Residents’ Parking Scheme would be the first such scheme for the City and involves over  residential properties mainly in the Rossville Street, Fahan Street, Little Diamond, Creggan Street and Chamberlain Street areas.A DfI publication in March stated that, proposals for the Scheme were first announced by the previous Minister for Infrastucture, and following informal consultations “there has proven to be signicant support from residents who are experiencing increasing dficulties parking outside their homes.”The Department wrote to all residents within the area and encouraged all interested parties to formally respond to the proposals before  April.If introduced as proposed, the scheme would have designated free of charge parking places for residents only between the hours of . am and noon and between . pm and . pm from Monday to Saturday inclusive.Visitors would have been able to park within areas designated for residents provided a valid visitor’s permit is displayed on the vehicle.

There needs to be swt action as an enhanced facility could alleviate the problem people are currently facing.A Department for Infrastructure spokesman said the current Driver and Vehicle test centre network was built around  years ago.ldquoMuch has been done to maintain and modernise the test centres in that time, particularly to meet the growing demand for vehicle tests. However, present and future legislative requirements, coupled with increasing and changing demands for testing services, mean that the current network is no longer sustainable, he said.ldquoAs such, we have been reviewing the network with a view to determining the most appropriate network of test centres to meet our future needs. To date, with the exception of a new test centre being built at Hydebank in Belfast, no decisions have been taken on the size of any other specic test centres within a future network.The spokesman said the new test centre at Hydebank and will provide additional testing capacity for the Greater Belfast area.He added: ldquoOur plans for a new network are continuing to be progressed, specically in terms of the design for the new test centres and the acquisition of land.ldquoHowever, in the absence of the NI Executive there is currently no means to progress proposals beyond the construction of the new test centre at Hydebank..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Carryduff man honoured with major accolade  ","story":"A CARRYDUFF country sports enthusiast has been honoured with a major award.John Leighton, who is the president of the Ulster Gundog League, has been presented with The Great Game Fairs of Ireland letime achievement award.The awards, made each year at the Irish Game Fair at Fine Food Festival held at Shanes Castle, Antrim, are designed to recognise and reward outstanding iniduals who devote themselves to nurturing rural heritage.Announcing Johnrsquos award, Albert Titterington, managing director of The Great Game Fairs of Ireland, said: ldquoIt is an absolute pleasure each year to have the opportunity publicly to recognise some of the outstanding members of the game show family who commit their time, talents and enthusiasm to preserving rural traditions and promoting country sports.ldquoThese people work tirelessly behind the scenes and without any thought of reward mdash and John epitomises that blend of modesty and high achievement.ldquoOver the years John has enjoyed considerable sporting success with the dogs he trains and we have been proud to have enjoyed his support and insight as he served as spaniels directorrsquo with our fairs, shaping competitions and ensuring top quality entries.Mr Titterington said Mr Leightonrsquos  years of gundog competition experience commanded ldquoinstant respect in gundog circles and described him as a ldquopopular figure across this island and beyond..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Cormac delivers at Irish Open  ","story":"ARDGLASS golfer Cormac Sharvin has just had the biggest week of his le.The  year-old was the top Irish finisher at the Dubai Duty Free Irish Open at Lahinch.He finished joint th place on nine-under par to earn the biggest payday of his le, pocketing a cheque for euro,.It was almost three times the amount he has earned on the European Challenge Tour so far this season.Unfortunately, he missed out on securing a dream spot at next weekrsquos Open Championship at Portrush.After signing off with a final round  on Sunday he said: ldquoI felt I didnrsquot play much dferent from the first three days.

He crossed the finish line in ., in sixth place overall, but first U-, a real eye-catching performance out of  finishersMeanwhile, Dee was not letting the side down as he again proved best in his age group, clocking yet another sub  time, his clocking of . was also good enough for overall seventh out of the  finishers.Ford kNewcastle was the venue for a nearer home race on Friday night and several East Down men and women took advantage of the opportunity to warm up for the action in Delamont the next day.Gordy Graham took third place overall in . a mere  seconds behind winner, Newcastlersquos David OrsquoFlaherty, while Catherine OrsquoConnor was second female in . to Gordyrsquos cousin, Laura Graham, who won in .. Paul Lloyd was st in . and Donal Smith placed th in  minutes on the button, out of a total of  runners.DelamontAs Van Morrison once said: ldquoMy momma told me therersquod be days like this,Thus was described East Downrsquos fantastic day out in Delamont on Saturday in the  X k relays, a new and exciting event organised by the Daye Brothers aka Atlas Running, which required teams of five runners each, with each one running a klap as the hot and hilly trails and paths around Delamont were described.At one point we thought we wouldnrsquot have enough runners to fill three teams so to get four teams of five representing East Down was pretty damn impressive.Some pretty impressive performances from the East Down gang as well with victories for the menrsquos A team and the mixed team and third in the all female team.Massive well done to all involved especially the team captain, Deirdre Weatherall who rallied the troops with carrots and sticks and a promise of ice creams, that did not materialise.All agreed that she did a fine job of getting  names in the hat and in the right place at the right time. It was great to see also that several relative newcomers to the club, Gillian and Gerard Grant, Donal Smith, Michael Morrissey and Alison Graham are happy to get involved with some of the older hands and the younger ones to enjoy the delights that a team relay can bring.Performances of the day have to be shared by Gavin Hynds whose third leg run for the EDAC male B team, which effectively hauled them up from last place to th.His time of . for the leg was only bettered by runners from the top two teams on the day, and by Neil Curran, the anchor leg runner for the EDAC A team.His final leg of . only put paid to the battling St Peterrsquos AC quintet during the final lap. The Lurgan team, which had held the lead from the start were understandably disappointed, but the EDAC squad deserved their win.Track and fieldOn to Sunday and it was our juvenile members who had to make the long journey to Tullamore in Co Offally to take part in the All Ireland T F Championships.Spread over two weekends, it therefore means that, for some, there are two journeys to the heart of Ireland on consecutive weekends.Thank you to all the parents for driving all these miles. Your efforts are greatly appreciated by everyone in the club and especially by the athletes themselvesNevertheless, it proved a great day at Tullamore at the first of three days of action with the sun shining for a nice change.East Down had four athletes taking part all in the m, but in two dferent age groups. In the U- race Anna Gardiner and Lucy Foster both ran in separate heats with both finishing in sixth position.The top three in each heat qualied automatically for the final later in the day along with the fastest two finishers outside the top six.Unfortunately, both EDAC girls missed out on qualication, but they ran super races with Lucy gaining a PB of .. and Anna running ...Lauren Madine and Kirsti Foster both competed in the U- race with both winning their heats and automatically qualying for the final later in the day.A last minute change of time table meant the final was brought forward by an hour so that meant quick warm-ups and back on the track was not the ideal preparation that would normally take place before an All-Ireland final.Nonetheless, the two girls put their minds to it and gave it their best shot. Having two out of eight from one club in an All-Ireland final is an achievement in itself.Kirsti came fourth overall in .., just missing a medal by tenths of a second. Lauren had to settle for seventh in . as she was hampered by ankle issues which had developed after her heat.Well done to all four for their efforts.

These are two key elements of Delamontrsquos future success.Cllr Walker said he hopes that the public will be given time to view the content of the master plan when it is completed and that money to provide a raft of new facilities can be secured to allow work to potentially start next year.ldquoThe Education Authority stuck to its promise to invest in Delamont and I hope that the local authority will honour its commitment and start planning to provide more facilities at the country park which offers huge development potential, he said.ldquoWhile already a signicant tourism attraction, there are not that many facilities apart from a childrenrsquos playground, stunning walks and the hugely popular Steamerrsquos cafe and miniature railway.ldquoWhile I am not advocating that the beauty of the area is spoiled in any way, there are hundreds of acres of space which could be used to boost the parkrsquos tourism offering.Cllr Walker said the availability of finance to enhance the park is critical to its future development, providing new attractions and creating a boost for nearby businesses in Killyleagh.He added: ldquoThe eagerly-awaited master plan is the key to unlocking Delamontrsquos future development and can also pave the way for much-needed investment. This is something I and many others are looking forward to..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Delight after new family walking trail opens at Saul  ","story":"A NEW walking trail for all the family to enjoy has been opened in Saul.The Saul Family Trail was officially opened last Wednesday by Newry Mourne and Down Council chairman Charlie Casey.Just under km in , the new route is at Saul GAC, which was behind the project.Club officials attended last weekrsquos launch and along with representatives of ious support organisations and members of the local community.Saul GAC is located at the foot of Slieve Patrick, a popular walking area for locals and tourists alike due to its beauty and historic interest.The current walking routes around the mountain are quite challenging and are not suitable for all levels of ability.The new trail is fully accessible to allow and encourage everyone to participate in outdoor activities.It offers Saul and Raholp a hub from which local people and visitors can enjoy the beauty of the local environment.

If Fascism hadnrsquot been beaten we would be living in a very dferent world today. ldquoWe would be living in fear of a regime which would not tolerate any descent. We are very lucky and should be thankful to those veterans who risked all and gave their tomorrow for our today.Cllr Hanna said the districtrsquos surviving veterans were small in number and well into their nineties, and that society owed a debt to them for their part in the battle to secure the freedom people enjoy today.He said he included the Merchant Navy in his proposal because many risked their lives on merchant ships to ferry supplies which helped win the war.ldquoThis was a cruel war where many lost their lives and I really hope we never have to face anything like this again. Those from Northern Ireland who fought and served during World War Two came from all sections of the community.ldquoBefore it is too late, I believe this council should acknowledge what these brave people did for us all by presenting surviving veterans with a silver poppy at a cross community service in November, said Cllr Hanna.He added: ldquoI hope that the council will support this motion as a mark of respect for the generation which has given us freedoms we take for granted.The SDLPrsquos Declan McAteer said he was ldquosomewhat dubious about the suggestion for the council ldquoto go out on a limb and procure silver poppy medals.ldquoI fully respect the sentiment of those wishing to identy with what is essentially a British symbol which wonrsquot by endorsed by all Irish men or women. The poppy, for better or worse, is associated with all conflicts that Britain was involved in from the First World War right through.ldquoI would say that perhaps thatwe do anything around this we

district planners mdash has revealed in its annual audit committee report that the current number of live planning applications in the system is just over ,.The confirmation comes after local politicians recently pointed to what they described as ldquoserious problems at council management level for not taking the planning backlog seriously enough.Politicians have expressed concern that planners are not responding to their telephone calls and emails, with people who lodge applications also concerned that they are not getting any information from officials.Elected representatives say while all the fault does not rest with planners, they are firmly of the view that there are simply not enough staff to deal with the huge volume of work.Concern has also been expressed that the planning department is having problems retaining staff to work in a department that receives the second highest number of applications across the Provincersquos  councils.Politicians say there is a need to ensure the planning department is running properly which the council explains in the new report is exactly what it aims to do.A major review of planning has already been undertaken and amendments made to the so-called scheme of delegation which is a set of rules which determines whether a planning application will be decided by the local authorityrsquos Planning Committee or planning officers.A critical look has also been taken at staffing structures in tandem with the arearsquos chief planner, with council officials conceding that while there are issues with staff turnover, positions are filled as quickly as possible.In addition, the council has admitted there is a communication issue within the planning department with the change that needs to happen something that cannot be achieved overnight.Signicantly, the new council report warns that failure to deliver timely planning decisions is a ldquorisk within the corporate risk register, with the number of live planning applications increasing, not decreasing, with the figure standing at , at the end of May.The report says an internal audit of the planningrevealed that there are a number of key controls absent from the local authorityrsquos planning system, in particular, its performance against legislative targets, the completeness and validation of documentation supporting applications and enforcement actions.The audit also points to a lack of clarity in respect of key performance indicators within the planning department and the lack of non-compliance by the local authority with its own planning and enforcement procedures.The report says senior council management is considering ways forward to ensure compliance with policy and legislative targets, while maintaining the number of live cases to an acceptable level.Council officials say that over the coming months they intend to take steps to address the ious issues within the planning department to further enhance governance arrangements and are satisfied that these steps will address the need for improvements..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Plans for new

An entity that has profoundly influenced the history of the past century, it has been a beacon of democracy, a powerhouse of scientic discovery and innovation, a font of creativity that has enriched every sphere of the arts and a leading influence for international order and peace.

I also had the pleasure of meeting campaigners from across the UK as part of the Extinction Rebellion protests in Parliament.And I recently bumped into some students from Stanwell School who have been taking part in the climate strike movement and standing up for action on climate change and the climate emergency. I was glad to help get their and other constituentsrsquo voices heard on this in Parliament, because itrsquos not being debated enough - itrsquos getting lost behind other things.So whether itrsquos local action we can take on recycling and packaging, or global action on climate change and carbon emissions, we all need to do more to deal with an emergency thatrsquos going to affect us all for generations to come.I was out and about again in Penarth this weekend, along with a team of our fantastic Labour town and Vale councillors, talking to people about the forthcoming European elections. There was a lot of support for our clear Welsh Labour position backing a final say in a peoplersquos vote for the public on any Brexit deal.Following the mixed results in the local elections in England and Northern Ireland last week, there was much talk about Labour lsquobailing outrsquo the government. Let me be crystal clear on this ndash I will never lsquobail outrsquo the disastrous Tories on Brexit, and neither will the overwhelming majority of Labour MPs.We can resolve the situation, but not by any backroom stitch-up that would risk letting down both those who voted Leave and Remain. The only way forward out of this mess is to let the people have the final say on any deal. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

And under my leadership, a Conservative administration will proudly put the people of the Vale of Glamorgan first.ldquoNaturally, we are open to working with other councillors who share those ideals.ldquoOthers - including those who resigned from the Conservative party - will have to explain to voters where they stand on these issues - and I would urge them to back us, rather than propping up a Labour administration that was rejected by the Vale at the last election.Cllr Bailey said he had a six-point plan for the Vale.He pledged to deliver the Dinas Powys bypass stop inflation-busting council tax rises scrap proposed parking charges review the local development planto curb inappropriate development protect rural schools and oppose the Barry Biomass plant.Cllr Bailey said that he was also keen to improve engagement with the public, after a series of hugely unpopular decisions taken by the existing cabinet.He said: ldquoDuring the elections in , we promised to build a stronger relationship with local residents by consulting them on key decisions.ldquoUnfortunately, too many people feel that their views are simply being ignored and that Vale consultations are just tick box exercises. Take the proposals around car parking charges, or the closure of Llancarfan School. I donrsquot think anyone outside of the Civic Offices believes that those decisions werenrsquot already done deals, and thatrsquos simply unacceptable.ldquoAnother good example is the councilrsquos failure to listen to the public over Penarthrsquos original Victorian lamp posts.ldquoIrsquove been criticised for wanting to listen to the people who elected me, and I make no apologies for that.

Although a relative newcomer to the site, having previously taught in Newport, it is clear he is immensely proud of the students and staff.ldquoVisitors to the school often comment on the warm, friendly and purposeful environment that exists at Stanwell and, despite its size, they see how the school cares about the inidual child and their progress, he said.ldquoThe schoolrsquos Mission Statement is summarised as lsquoLearning to Excelrsquo and this is the vision for every child, whatever their starting points, interests or talents. The school thrives because we have a fantastic team of teachers, teaching assistants, support staff, parents and governors who help make this vision a reality.ldquoThis is what makes the school so successful because everybody gives so much.Wandering through a theatre the school uses to put on assemblies and biannual productions, Mrs Kynaston pointed out a section of floor that moved away to create an orchestral pit. The production value afforded to every department ndash theatre, maths, sports, English ndash was astounding.ldquoWe try to give our pupils the very best, said Mrs Kynaston. ldquoWe want them to truly reach their potential. To excel.Mr Brown agreed. ldquoOur amazing staff believe in every young personrsquos potential to succeed and really do go the lsquoextra milersquo for pupils, he said. ldquoOur pupils flourish academically but also as well rounded, confident young people ready to contribute to society.The extra-curricular provision at the school is broad and this really helps to develop our students confidence and skills beyond the classroom setting.That extra-curricular provision is a key focus for the school.Lessons finish at .pm, earlier in the day than most other schools, but that affords pupils plenty of time to take on other pursuits.The school offers a huge number of activities, ranging from the expected - rugby, football, hockey, theatre and orchestra - to the esoteric, like German Film Club or Cipher Club.School trips in recent years have taken students to such exotic destinations as Costa Rica, Iceland, Borneo, Morocco, Spain, Germany, France, and Italy, allowing students to soak in culture both at home and abroad.Clearly, a huge pupil base allows for a huge number of options.The schoolrsquos ability to bring such a population to the table, and keep them focussed, has produced excellent results.In the last fty years alone, it has produced Olympians, rugby internationals, Members of Parliament and television presenters.It has ties to Nasa, and men who walked on the moon have visited the school for talks.Its most curious claim to fame comes in the form of a mascot painted on a wall.Emma Davies, a former pupil of the school, had a design chosen as the official Welsh Wenlock ndash the Olympic mascot for the London  games.But Stanwell flourishes academically, as well.In its  GCSE results,  per cent of Stanwell pupils achieved at least their expected grades, compared to  per cent of the rest of Wales. The same story went for maths, with  per cent again hitting their expected target or better, against  per cent of Wales.       ,params: .pushAt A level,  per cent of all grades were A* or A, with  per cent of the year group achieving A* to C overall.A level results put Stanwell students amongst the top performers in Wales, with many iniduals securing exceptional grades.  of themachieved the equivalent of three A grades or better.Three of its pupils went to Oxford University last year, while another earned a place at Cambridge University.Mr Brown said: ldquoWe place a large emphasis on listening to our learners and and our pupils make a dference as leaders in the school, whether itrsquos through well established groups such as our school council, eco-committee or charity committee, or in aspects of teaching and learning where we have subject prefects and learner voice groups.ldquoThey help us evaluate our work as a school and plan for the future.ldquoWhat always comes through is how proud they are of their school.Rightly so. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log        ,params: .push-- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The renaming of our on-air studio to ldquoThe John Wilce Studio was a popular choice to recognise his outstanding dedication.ldquoJune  wouldrsquove been Johnrsquos th birthday, so this we felt really was a fitting tribute and a lovely memorial to all those who knew him, as a constant reminder of his contribution to Radio Glamorgan.Mr Wilce regularly presented on Sunday evenings, often dedicating features to listeners. Without fail he played a Beatles track every time he was on air.When Mr Wilce was off-air, he oversaw and maintained broadcast equipment, actively engaged in fundraising and stood as a trustee, assisting with the day-to-day running of the station.Jamie added: ldquoI speak on behalf of everyone at RG to say it was a privilege to know John, not only as a fellow volunteer but as a friend. He always put everyone  first and his patience was beyond words. His music knowledge was phenomenal and the impact he had on everyone he met, not just at Radio Glamorgan has really come to light since his passing.Michelle Fowler, volunteer services manager at Cardf and Vale University Health Board, said: ldquoItrsquos such a wonderful tribute to rename the studio after John.

The coalition also includes Llantwit First Independents.This is where the new leadership stands on the key issues facing the Vale:Parking chargesCllr Moore said new parking charges proposed by the previous administration, which included town centre car parks, coastal resorts and country parks, will be reviewed.He said new parking charges are likely in the Vale, but they will be ldquorealistic.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWe have to be sensible. Some of the things put forward previously were off the wall, they went too far.ldquoIt will be a full revamp of everything. Whatever we do wersquore not going to fleece the residents of the Vale.ldquoWe may have to make some changes. It does cost money to provide car parking. There are things we will have to start charging for. It will be realistic and fair for everybody.School improvementsThe new cabinet says delivering on major new school buildings is a priority for the new administration.Developments in the pipeline include new builds forPencoedtre and Whitmore High Schools, and expansion and refurbishment of Ysgol Gymraeg Bro MorgannwgAgeing schools in the Vale are set to get a pound. million cash boost for repairs.Llancarfan Primary SchoolLlancarfan Primary School was set to be lsquoclosedrsquoand moved to a new pound million facility in Rhoose.The previous cabinet had approved the plans despite protests from parents and campaigners.Cllr Moore said Llancarfan School move was ldquopremature - but did not commit to scrapping the plan entirely.ldquoIf itrsquos justiable itrsquos justiable, he said. ldquoIf itrsquos not, we will look at alternatives.ldquoItrsquos not an easy decision to take. Itrsquos something we have to take some time about.ldquoWhat Irsquom not going to do is jump or kowtow to people who shout the loudest.Cllr Burnett has previously tweeted the closure of Llancarfan ldquowouldnrsquot be happeningLabour were running the council.New roadsWork continues on outline business cases for two major new roads being proposed ndash the A to M link around Pendoylan and Dinas Powys Bypass between Barry and Cardf ndash but no decision has been made whether either will actually go ahead.The future of both roads rests on whether Welsh Government and the council deem them viable, and whether ministers cough up the cash to fund them.But Cllr Moore said he doesnrsquot think Welsh Government will find the money required for the Dinas Powys Bypass.ldquoItrsquos out of our hands, he said.IncineratorCllr Moore said he believes Welsh Government will order the Barry Biomass incinerator to carry out an environmentalimpact assessment.Cllr Moore, who has previously attacked what he termed ldquoscaremongering and lies around the biomass plant, said he did not want the facility in Barry Docks.He said: ldquoWe opposed it vehemently, both as a council and as a party and personally. It shouldnrsquot be there.ldquoBut now it is there it has to operate within legal parameters.ldquoIf it does, therersquos nothing anyone can do about it.The council refused the original planning permission for the facility, but a planning inspector allowed it in  following an appeal. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We believe it is important that all families feel welcome in the school. Education is a partnership between home and school with a shared responsibility based on trust and mutual understanding and the co-operation and participation of parents with our school in the education of their child is positively encouraged.ldquoA good relationship between school and home builds a childrsquos confidence, aids their learning and helps them to fulfil their potential in all areas.They stressed that the children had an equal say in their education, through the use of techniques like lsquoImmersion Daysrsquo ndash where pupils have a multi-sensory experience of any given topic.These learning opportunities have ied from using LEGO in building new robot designs and solving problems, to visits from STEM experts. businesses and education experts.The pupils develop a basis from these experiences from which to draw questions and interests, while the staff ask for pupilsrsquo ideas about how they would like to learn further.ldquoWe recently we had an Immersion Day on the topic of volcanoes, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoA few of the pupils mentioned ways they would like to learn more about the subject. When we followed their suggestions a few weeks later, they were incredibly enthused ndash it really focuses them, develops their engagement.These pioneering techniques of giving the children an equal say in their education have a proven record.Albert Primary featured in Estynrsquos lsquoRecognising excellence in education and trainingrsquo publication for its innovative approach.The publication said: ldquoThe school provides pupils with an excellent range of high quality learning experiences.Mr Gilbert said: ldquoMost importantly the inspection report captures the ethos of our school and, in particular, it confirmed that we are achieving our aim to make the school a happy and secure place in which pupils grow in confidence and independence.Albert Primary also earned an award for being the top performing primary school in Wales in recognition of their implementation of the Renaissance Reading programme, and the impact it has on their childrenrsquos reading progress.The staff were experienced and enthusiastic. During the tour, I was treated to a brief rehearsal of the schoolrsquos summer production ndash The Lion King. The youngsters performing looked genuinely thrilled to be involved, and were remarkably talented singers.There is plenty of sport provision, with the deceptively spacious grounds playing host to several open tarmac areas and courts. Football, basketball, rounders, cycling and more were on offer, along with chess, drama and music clubs. For those looking to go off school site, Belle Vue Park is feet away from the front entrance, and often works with the school.This year, Albert Primary has been awarded the prestigious Platinum Flag Award after previously gaining three Green Flag Awards thanks to the environmental education programme, Eco-Schools.But no school is without its problems.A major concern for Albert Primary is having to balance a large deficit budget. In order to do so the school has lost a number of agency learning support staff, with the deputy head taking on a greater teaching commitment next year to make up for the shortfall.Another blow came after four years of saving and planning to convert a disused toilet block into a teaching and community centre.The funds, totalling pound,, had to be used to offset the deficit budget instead. The proposal was to refurbish the existing outbuilding to provide a new classroom facility for the oversubscribed main school to use, alongside the community.The governors are currently creating a task group of stakeholders to address future funding sources.But the spirits of the pupils and staff have not been dampened by financial dficulties.ldquoI believe that we are extremely fortunate in Albert Primary to have created such a positive and vibrant environment in which our children can learn, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoIt is the dedication and commitment of its staff and everyone associated with the school that makes Albert Primary the school that it is today ndash successful, happy and continually improving.Albert Primary was founded in  to accommodate all ages of children up to school leaving age.Much of its original character has been preserved and it now holds Grade  listed status. The school has some unusual Victorian artwork by Norton Nante and parts of the school were designed by highly respected Victorian architect J Coates Carter.A Victorian mural on the front of the building shows several children hard at work. One of them is holding a pet mouse on a lead.It is clear that this quirky attitude to learning has been present and successful in the school for a long time.Long may it last. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Ellie doesnrsquot want to give up on her dream and the book seesshe can make it in a world that can be so negative.Penarth author Alison Powell has been involved from the projectrsquos beginning and helped bring Ellie and her family and friends to le.Ms Powell said: ldquoWhen I was approached I was delighted ndash as a mother of two children, I know how important it is to re-enforce positivity through all aspects of le, to challenge stereotypes and ensure they know they can strive for any career they choose, regardless of gender, race or orientation.Evan, a year two Rhws Primary pupil, said: ldquoI loved the bit in the story where Ellie got a job.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Ulster Business speaks to director Clare Kelly about a burgeoning firm which is leading the way in more than just business, but connectivity, co-working and wellness for its members Eighteen years ago and in its early stages of infancy, Glandore began its le in one building at Fitzwilliam Square in Dublin – capable of hosting just  members.Fast forward to the present day and it’s an all-island business with an -strong workforce across nine locations in Belfast, Dublin and Cork – playing host to as many as , people. And it’s very much a family-owned and run business, led by founder Michael Kelly with daughters Clare, Fiona and Rebecca each as directors within the company.Glandore’s high-end flexible working spaces have been up-and-running in Belfast for  years – with capacity for  members across its two locations here. However, the family’s connection to the city dates back to , when Michael first bought - Arthur Street, now Arthur Place.It’s been at the forefront of attracting some of the leading international foreign direct investmentto Belfast, working closely alongside Invest NI to bring in cyber-security and technology firms from the US and beyond – first setting up here in . Glandore offers its members a wide iety of flexible office space, co-working and hot-desking – designed so companies can grow organically. But it’s also focused on bringing its members together, connecting indigenous and international firms, while also considering wellness in the workplace, and improving its green credentials. Clare Kelly is a director of the family business – a qualied occupational therapist and Trinity College graduate, who joined Glandore in .She’s now tasked with focusing on the key marketing and business development elements of the burgeoning company – attracting and retaining members, and ensuring there remains a strong pipeline of clients.“We offer our members a erse range of services,” Clare tells Ulster Business. That includes short-term hot-desking for small businesses with just a handful of employees, to providing flexible high-end office space for companies with dozens, or hundreds of workers.”And while the flexibility allows firms to scale from small numbers to a larger workforce – taking short-term space for as little as just three months – Clare says many of the companies stay for several years, orto Glandore further down the line in their own business journey.“We also host a range of events, and can bring everyone together through the network of our members. That has allowed us to cater from very early start-ups, right through to the largest multi-national company, or scaling FDI business,” Clare says.“The dference with Glandore is the flexibility. A company may wish to bring in one or two people, and then concentrate on recruitment – but they can then scale with their growth, from say  to  people. “That flexibility and scale is key. In terms of Glandore, we are offering high quality space, but also offering a range of business services to our members.”Across its two Belfast city centre flexible workspace buildings, Glandore’s expanding network means it can now host around  members – with locations at Arthur House and the nearby Arthur Place.It has six locations in Dublin, including the Silicon Docks and Central Business District, and has boasted a long list of foreign direct investment firms, including Facebook, Twitter, Dropbox and Smartbox, and has also opened its newest office space building in Cork city.Glandore has forged strong relationships with Invest NI – helping provide high-end working environments for rapidly expanding FDI businesses – along with Belfast City Council, the Belfast Chamber and Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry.Some of its high profile international current, or former members, include cyber-security experts Rapid , digital marketing firm Bazaarvoice and global payments giant Cayan – a company which has now expanded into its Belfast headquarters at City Quays.The quality and bespoke nature of the offices are part of what helps Glandore stand out from the crowd. Clare says firms are able to specy exactly what they want, with a top-end design and fit-out team on hand to develop a specic working environment for each business.“When Glandore was set up by Michael in , he always focused on a high quality working environment,” Clare says. “We take premium office space in premium locations, and there is no expense spared in fit-out.“We provide a bespoke set up – whether they need a co-working space or a virtual office, for example. We can tailor that for each business. It’s not a cookie-cutter approach.”And while she says design and the aesthetics are important, behind the decor is the IT and security infrastructure to ensure that guests have the very best available to them.“We have always invested heavily in our network, and have our own on-site IT. We have an IT director, manager and team – so there is support even before day one. All of these things are important to firms of all sizes.”For Glandore, it’s not simply about putting guests on seats – there’s much more to the offering. “We have such a erse mixture of companies in the network and community, and we are able to mix the indigenous firms with the international companies, and actively, facilitate connections between our members.”That includes an alumni programme, which sees members past and present ing to celebrate their successful partnerships.“We bring back customers from the last  years, and representatives from Invest NI and Belfast City Council. It’s about making the connections between the current scaling members and those which have come before,” Clare says.“That support is invaluable. It can be very isolating in the those days when you are setting up, so it’s great to have someone you can bounce ideas off.”Glandore goes further still, with the introduction of both the Glandore Wellness Programme and Glandore Green Initiative – the latter focused on creating a greener and more sustainable office space.“We have been working with these companies for several years, and we get a bird’s-eye view,” Clare says. “One thing we have been very mindful of is the need for us to support from a wellness perspective.“We offer a complimentary wellness programme, which started in , long before it became a buzzword. It offers a way for our members to connect with each other, and help in retaining talent.”And while almost every business has experienced some Brexit-related impact, Clare says Glandore has reached its highest occupancy rate in its history – rising to % in Belfast.“It has been a very uncertain time and that has impacted businesses across Northern Ireland. There have been some delays in regards to FDI, but our hats go off to Invest NI which still attracting businesses into Northern Ireland.”And while there’s also scope for further growth in Belfast, there’s potential for that demand to move outside Belfast, with a potential to grow into the North West.“The hope is to continue our expansion as an all-island business, having operated on both sides of the border for  years, with capacity to grow the businesses in Belfast.“With the likes of Derry, that would be something on the agenda for Invest NI as part of its remit to win investment for outside Belfast. We will take the lead from the councils and from Invest NI, and we will look to see where we can add. If there isn’t space for a business to land, people will go where.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/nstreet1.jpg","title":"belfasts north street arcade to be redeveloped","story":"Posted on Tuesday  June  by John Mulgrew A former Belfast shopping arcade left derelict after being gutted in a blaze more than a decade ago could be brought back to le amid fresh development plans. North Street Arcade was destroyed in a fire in , which caused severe damage to the floor and glass roof. It’s been sitting empty for  years, but once played host to a range of popular Belfast stores, including DJ and local punk pioneer Terri Hooley’s record shop, Good Vibrations. The plans to redevelop the arcade are included in a revised scheme called Tribeca Belfast – formerly Royal Exchange. UK developer Castlebrooke is planning to redevelop much of the north side of the city centre as part of a £m scheme. It’s made a number of amendments and changes to the development, most notably revising back from a formerly retail-led scheme to one with fewer shops. Tribeca Belfast includes development around Royal Avenue, Donegall Street, North Street, Garfield Street and High Street. Castlebrooke Investments says it is now committed to bringing North Street Arcade back into use in a new format, with space designed for independent retailers. It has also been announced that architectural design firm Squire  Partners has been appointed to work on the amended proposals. The team from Squire  Partners will work alongside conservation architects from Belfast-based Consarc Design Group. Neil Young, chief executive of Castlebrooke Investments, said: “We are very pleased to be able to reveal our proposed amendments to our outline planning application for Tribeca Belfast, changes which we feel demonstrate that we have listened to feedback from the city. “We will continue to listen and today we have launched a voluntary public consultation process into these planned changes ahead of the submission of our application. Our community exhibition will provide an opportunity for anyone interested to see the new plans and we will be revealing more information about this in the coming weeks.” Murray Levinson, partner at Squire  Partners, said: “The mix of uses across the site – designed to attract a iety of retail, restaurant, cultural and workplace tenants – and the creation of new public realm, will ensure this part of Belfast will be active throughout the day and into the evening. Providing a large number of residential apartments with shared gardens, as well as a hotel, will create a new opportunity for people to live in the city centre.” And Graeme Moore, specialist conservation architect at Consarc Design Group, said: “Consarc Design Group is delighted that we continue to be involved with the proposals for Tribeca Belfast to offer our expertise in building conservation. As with the previous proposals, all of the listed buildings within this phase are to be retained, restored and adapted for a sustainable ongoing use within the masterplan, rooting the new development in the unique historical character of this part of the city centre.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/droad_1.jpg","title":"major new apartment building planned for dublin road","story":"Posted on Friday  June  by John Mulgrew The Dublin Road in Belfast A new serviced apartment building could be developed along Belfast’s so-called ‘Golden Mile’ on the Dublin Road, it can be revealed.

Entries are now open for the  Deloitte Technology Fast  programme.

Peter Allen, partner at Deloitte, said: “For  years, the Technology Fast  awards have celebrated the success and growth of Ireland’s leading indigenous technology companies. “It is fantastic to be able to look back and see how some of the companies which appeared on the Fast  list in the early days have become global businesses and market leaders. “The likes of First Derivatives and Novosco, who were early stage tech companies when they first made the Fast , are now major employers and shining lights within the NI economy.” One of the few Northern Ireland companies to have topped the Fast , appearing in it  out of the  years since the ranking’s inception, is Newry-headquartered financial software company First Derivatives.

Once again, it raises serious concerns over the agri-sector in particular, meat in particular, and beef especially, in regards to “increased vulnerability to low cost non-EU imports in the GB or NI market”. Its not just the physical goods, though as it says Northern Irelands IT sector is facing the cost of exporting services increasing, by an average of .%.
