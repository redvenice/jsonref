Jeff Flake, whose vote could make or break Brett Kavanaugh\u0027s Supreme Court nomination, is indicating he would vote no on the nominee unless he hears from Christine Blasey Ford          Brett Kavanaugh needs to be voted out of the Judiciary Committee before his nomination can move to the Senate floorKavanaugh needs to get through the Senate Judiciary Committee before Republican leaders can schedule a floor vote to finalize his confirmation.If Flake votes no in committee, given the Democratic opposition, it would be a tie-vote and that means Kavanaugh would not have the committee\u0027s recommendation to be confirmed.His nomination could still be brought to a vote to the Senate floor but, given the Republicans 51-seat majority, if Flake votes no again, the GOP cannot lose a single other senator if all Democrats vote no and Vice President Mike Pence would be the tie breaking vote.In 1991, Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas passed out of the Judiciary Committee on a tie 7-7 vote. He was confirmed by the entire Senate 52-48.Kavanaugh\u0027s committee vote is scheduled for Thursday although Democrats are trying to delay it. Flake is retiring from the Senate after this year - a decision he made after repeated hammering from Trump. He has been a harsh critic of the president both during the presidential campaign and since Trump took office.Meanwhile, Sen. Chuck Grassley, the Republican chairman of the Judiciary panel, is working to schedule followup phone calls between Kavanaugh, Ford, and committee staff on both sides of the aisle. \u0027The Chairman and ranking member routinely hold bipartisan staff calls with nominees when updates are made to nominees\u0027 background files. Given the late addendum to the background file and revelations of Dr. Ford\u0027s identity, Chairman Grassley is working to set up such followup calls with Judge Kavanaugh and Dr. Ford ahead of Thursday\u0027s scheduled vote,\u0027 he said in a statement Sunday evening. But some Democrats are grumbling a phone call may not be enough.           Sen. Lisa Murkowski said the committee may need to delay their Thursday vote          Sen. Susan Collins said she will be \u0027talking with my colleagues\u0027 about whether Thursday\u0027s committee vote should go forwardFord is willing to testify publicly and before the committee.\u0027She\u0027s willing to do whatever it takes to get her story forth, yes,\u0027 her attorney Debra Katz told NBC\u0027s \u0027Today Show\u0027 on Monday morning. Flake isn\u0027t the only Republican who wants to hear from Ford, whose bomb shell interview in The Washington Post on Sunday rocked the foundations of Kavanaugh\u0027s nomination.   Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham said he was willing to have Ford testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee but he wants it done before Thursday\u0027s scheduled vote.\u0027If (Christine Blasley) Ford wishes to provide information to the committee, I would gladly listen to what she has to say and compare that against all other information we have received about Judge Kavanaugh,\u0027 Graham said in a statement on Sunday.\u0027If the committee is to hear from Ms. Ford, it should be done immediately so the process can continue as scheduled,\u0027 he added. Republican Sen. Bob Corker made a similar statement to Graham\u0027s to Politico, saying a delay \u0027would be best for all involved, including the nominee.\u0027Corker\u0027s vote is critical if Kavanaugh\u0027s nomination comes to the full Senate. Additionally, two of the other key Republican votes in the Senate are women - Senators Lisa Murkowski and Susan Collins - neither of whom face voters this year and both of whom said they are with holding judgement of Kavanaugh until after his confirmation hearing is concluded. Collins told CNN Sunday evening that she\u0027s \u0027very surprised\u0027 about the Kavanaugh allegation and \u0027it\u0027s an issue that I brought up with him last Friday and he denied\u0027 it. She said she will be \u0027talking with my colleagues\u0027 about whether Thursday\u0027s committee vote should go forward.  Murkowski says the committee \u0027might\u0027 need to consider delaying a vote on Kavanaugh.\u0027Well, I think that might be something they might have to consider, at least having that discussion,\u0027 Murkowski told CNN late Sunday night. \u0027This is not something that came up during the hearings. The hearings are now over, and if there is real substance to this, it demands a response. That may be something the committee needs to look into,\u0027 she said.     Sen. Dianne Feinstein, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, called for Kavanaugh\u0027s Thursday\u0027s vote to be delayed          Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer, left, has also called for a delay          Brett Kavanaugh is President Trump\u0027s second nominee to the Supreme CourtThe White House was hoping to pick up some Democratic votes - particularly Joe Manchin of West Virginia, Joe Donnelly of Indiana and Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota - all of whom voted for Trump\u0027s first nominee Neil Gorsuch and who face voters this fall in their home states, which the president carried in the 2016 election. All have said they are undecided.Also undecided are Democratic Senators Jon Tester of Montana and Claire McCaskill of Missouri, both of whom are in tough re-election contests in states Trump carried in 2016. Democrats are calling for Thursday\u0027s vote to be delayed until sexual assault allegations against him can be investigated.Their revitalized push againstTrump\u0027s nominee comes after his accuser publicly identified herself as Christine Blasey Ford, a university professor in California, and offered a chilling account of a high school incident where she alleged Kavanaugh attacked her. Senator Dianne Feinstein, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, said the FBI should reconsider its decision and investigate before his nomination comes to a vote before the committee.\u0027From the outset, I have believed these allegations were extremely serious and bear heavily on Judge Kavanaugh\u0027s character. However, as we have seen over the past few days, hey also come at a price for the victim. I hope the attacks and shaming of her will stop and this will be treated with seriousness it deserves,\u0027 she said in a statement on Sunday.She concluded: \u0027It is in the hands of the FBI to conduct an investigation. This should happen before the Senate moves forward on this nomination.\u0027 Additionally, Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer has called on Grassley to postpone Thursday\u0027s vote until the allegations are investigated.\u0027Senator Grassley must postpone the vote until, at a very minimum, these serious and credible allegations are thoroughly investigated. For too long, when woman have made serious allegations of abuse, they have been ignored. That cannot happen in this case,\u0027 he said in a statement.\u0027To railroad a vote now would be an insult to the women of America and the integrity of the Supreme Court,\u0027 he added. But so far their cries have fallen on deaf ears. \u0027I thought he might inadvertently kill me\u0027: Woman who...\u0027Interesting how quickly you got 65 names\u0027: Debra Messing...Dozens of women sign a letter defending Trump\u0027s Supreme...Supreme Court nominee Kavanaugh says he had no idea the man...Share this articleA spokesperson for Grassley told The Washington Post: \u0027The vote hasn\u0027t been rescheduled.\u0027 Grassley and other Republicans have questioned the timing of the allegations, noting they have come out days before Kavanaugh is up for a vote.\u0027It\u0027s disturbing that these uncorroborated allegations from more than 35 years ago, during high school, would surface on the even of a committee after Democrats sat on them since July,\u0027 Grassley said Sunday in a statement.He added if Feinstein and Democrats \u0027took this claim seriously, they should have brought it to the full committee\u0027s attention much earlier.\u0027He also called on Feinstein to release the letter she received that originally outlined the allegations. He concluded: \u0027It raises a lot of questions about Democrats\u0027 tactics and motives to bring hi to the rest of the committee\u0027s attention only now rather than during these many steps along he way. Senator Feinstein should publicly release the letter she received back in July so that everyone can know what she\u0027s known for weeks.\u0027The committee voted last week - before talk of an allegation against Kavanaugh became public - to vote on whether to move his nomination forward on Thursday.If Kavanaugh makes it out of committee, Republicans are aiming for a full Senate confirmation  before the Supreme Court term begins Oct. 1.          Christine Blasey Ford is going public with her allegation against Brett Kavanaugh          Christine Blasey Ford said she was worried Brett Kavanaugh might kill her during a drunken high school assault back in the 1980sBut one by one Democrats called for a delay after Ford went public with her story, saying she thought Kavanaugh might kill her during an alleged drunken high school attack.\u0027I thought he might inadvertently kill me,\u0027 said Ford, now a 51-year-old research psychologist in northern California, to The Washington Post. \u0027He was trying to attack me and remove my clothing.\u0027Ford described in detail how, when she was at a teenage party in the 1980s, Kavanaugh and a friend followed her upstairs when she went to the bathroom and pushed her into a bedroom. She detailed how Kavanaugh alleged held her down, tried to rip off her swimsuit, and groped her.She said she escaped when his friend, Mark Judge, jumped on top of them.Kavanaugh has vigorously denied the allegations.              Sen. Kamala Harris is one of six Democrats on the committee calling for the Kavanaugh vote o be delayed          Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham said he\u0027s open to having Christine Ford testifyDemocrats on Sunday praised Ford for coming forward while Republicans rushed to Kavanaugh\u0027s defense.Republicans  are expected to question Ford\u0027s memories and why Democrats sat on the accusations, sources in the White House told Politico.Additionally Trump is expected to go after Ford, those sources said.  A lawyer close to the White House told the news website Kavanaugh\u0027s nomination will not be withdrawn.\u0027No way, not even a hint of it,\u0027 the lawyer said. \u0027If anything, it\u0027s the opposite. If somebody can be brought down by accusations like this, then you, me, every man certainly should be worried. We can all be accused of something.\u0027Other Republicans point out Kavanaugh has passed numerous FBI background checks when he was White House staff secretary for George W. Bush and as a federal judge, a position that saw him confirmed by the Senate.Democrats on the Judiciary Committee offered a consistent voice on delaying the vote.Seven of the committee Democrats thus far have called for the vote to be delayed. \u0027At a bare minimum, this week\u0027s scheduled committee vote on Judge Kavanaugh\u0027s lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court must be postponed until this matter is fully and thoroughly investigated,\u0027 said Sen. Cory Booker, who\u0027s mentioned as a possible White House 2020 candidate. \u0027The Senate Judiciary Committee must now give these allegations the serious weight they deserve. They must be fully and fairly investigated. Unquestionably, the Kavanaugh confirmation vote must be delayed,\u0027 said Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal. \u0027This was a very brave step to come forward. It is more important than ever to hit the pause button on Kavanaugh\u0027s confirmation vote until we can fully investigate these serious and disturbing allegations. We cannot rush to move forward under this cloud,\u0027 said Democratic Sen. Doug Jones. \u0027Christine Blasey Ford courageously stepped forward to tell her story — it is a credible and serious allegation. The Senate has a constitutional responsibility to scrutinize SCOTUS nominees. A vote on Kavanaugh\u0027s nomination must be delayed until there is a thorough investigation,\u0027 said Democratic Sen. Kamala Harris, who is mentioned as a possible 2020 presidential contender.\u0027It took a lot of courage for Christine Blasey Ford to come forward to share her story of sexual assault by Brett Kavanaugh. Her story is very credible \u0026amp I believe her,\u0027 said Democratic Sen. Mazie  Hirono. \u0027This development is yet another reason not to rush Kavanaugh\u0027s nomination.\u0027  Christine Blasey (now Ford) and Brett Kavanaugh in their respective high school year books          Flake is casting doubt on Kavanaugh\u0027s nomination \u0027I admire the courage Ms. Ford has shown in coming forward with her story. This requires a pause, at a minimum, in the unseemly, special-interest-funded rush to put Brett Kavanaugh on the Court,\u0027 said Democratic Sen.

She gave it unhesitatingly.Even as Powell and the PM spoke, the double agent himself was being smuggled, thousands of miles away, across the Russian border into Finland and safety in the boot of a Ford saloon car.His name was Oleg Gordievsky, widely acknowledged to be the most valuable secret service mole at the heart of the KGB during the latter decades of the Cold War.He was 46 then, and 79 now.          Oleg Gordievsky receives the Companion of the Most Distinguished Order of St Michael and Saint George from Queen Elizabeth II for his services to UK security (pictured in 2007)He continues to defy Moscow but has escaped the fate of subsequent turncoat and defector Sergei Skripal, a victim of the Salisbury Novichok poison attack.So why are you reading about Gordievsky today?Because a new book revives claims that Michael Foot was in the pay of the Soviet Union when he was leader of the Labour Party in the late Eighties.Such is the world of espionage that these claims are impossible to verify but in his book, The Spy And The Traitor, the respected intelligence historian Ben Macintyre reveals that MI6 found them credible and that Secret Intelligence Service chiefs were prepared to tell the Queen if Foot ever became prime minister.          Gordievsky graciously accepted the award from the Queen, wearing top hat and tails. He receives a £20,000-a-year pension from MI6The source of the allegations was Gordievsky.Foot, he said, had met his KGB handlers over lunch at the Gay Hussar, a Hungarian restaurant in London’s Soho, and received the equivalent of £37,000 in today’s money for being ‘a confidential contact’.The accusations were first published in the Sunday Times two decades ago. Foot fiercely challenged the story and won a famous libel victory against the newspaper. He continued to deny the accusations until his death at the age of 96 eight years ago.Whatever the truth about Agent Boot — the KGB’s pseudonym for Foot, apparently, a play on his name — the controversy has turned the spotlight on the enigmatic figure of Gordievsky.          Gordievsky first came to the attention of the West in the Sixties when based in Copenhagen, running Soviet spies in Denmark and was thought to be vulnerable to blackmail after being spotted buying homosexual pornography in the city’s red light districtIn 2007, he was made a Companion to the Order of St Michael and St George (CMG) ‘for services to the security of the UK’. Fittingly, this is the same honour given to James Bond. Gordievsky graciously accepted the award from the Queen, wearing top hat and tails. He receives a £20,000-a-year pension from MI6.Ever since his defection, Gordievsky has lived comfortably in the Surrey suburbs, for most of that time with his long-term British-born companion Maureen. Salmon canapes and red Bulgarian wine are said to regularly grace their dining table.So how did he escape from the Moscow shadows to become the greatest asset our secret services have ever turned?Gordievsky first came to the attention of the West in the Sixties when based in Copenhagen, running Soviet spies in Denmark and was thought to be vulnerable to blackmail after being spotted buying homosexual pornography in the city’s red light district.In fact, as Macintyre explains in his book, he had been intrigued by gay practices and had taken the magazines home to show his then wife Yelena and place them on the mantelpiece as ‘an open exhibition of freedom unavailable in Soviet Russia’.Gordievsky did make a pass at Western intelligence, however, after becoming disenchanted with the Soviet system and its brutal repression of the 1968 Prague Spring, when tanks were sent into Czechoslovakia to crush the growing reform movement.His feelings were picked up by MI6 when a defector informed it that Gordievsky had shown ‘clear signs of political disillusionment’.A surreptitious approach was duly made when he was playing a morning game of badminton with a female member of the Young Danish Communists.It was, to quote Macintyre, the beginning of the ‘career’ of ‘Britain’s greatest ever spy’.In 1982, more than a decade after being recruited on the badminton court, Oleg Gordievsky was posted to the Russian Embassy in London where he would be made the ‘resident’ — the head of the KGB in Britain. His swift advancement was helped by the fact that MI6 arranged for his immediate superiors to be kicked put of Britain.It meant that Gordievsky provided a valuable insight into Soviet thinking at a crucial stage of the Cold War.Three years after settling in London, though, Gordievsky was suddenly summoned back to Moscow where he was subjected to a lengthy interrogation that involved the administration of a truth drug someone — in the CIA, it was suspected — had betrayed him.Gordievsky may not have cracked, but he knew the game was up. It was time to activate Operation Pimlico, the daring escape plan already formulated by MI6 in the event of such an eventuality.But how to get him out of Russia when he was under such scrutiny? The chain of events that were set in motion proves the old adage, that truth is indeed sometimes stranger — and in this case, at least, infinitely more fascinating — than fiction.In his flat on 103 Leninsky Prospect in Moscow, Gordievsky retrieved a hardback copy of Shakespeare’s sonnets, and soaked the flyleaf so he could peel it off. Inside, he found a sheet containing his escape instructions, which he committed to memory.So he found himself standing on a Moscow street corner, as per the instructions, at 7pm on July 16, 1985, clutching a Safeway carrier bag. Safeway bags bore a large letter ‘S’, an immediately recognisable logo that would stand out in the drab surroundings of the Soviet capital.This was the signal — to British agents working in an office across the street — that his cover had been blown, and that he needed to be pulled out of the Motherland immediately.Exactly 24 minutes later, a man walked passed him carrying a Harrods bag eating a chocolate bar Gordievsky had been told in advance that it might be a Kit Kat or a Mars bar. In fact, it was a Mars bar. The man was an MI6 officer.‘As he passed within four or five yards, he stared straight at me,’ Gordievsky recalled in his memoirs. ‘I gazed into his eyes shouting silently, “Yes, its me! I need urgent help”.’Gordievsky had already said goodbye to his wife and two daughters, whom he would not see until the end of the Soviet regime.He took a train north to Leningrad, Russia’s second city, from where he made his way to the town of Zelenogorsk, up the coast from the Baltic Sea.Next, he caught a bus heading for the Russian-Finnish border (the nearest East-West frontier to Moscow) where the border guards were accustomed to seeing diplomatic vehicles pass through checkpoints.Gordievsky hid in bushes until the car, with two MI6 operatives inside, arrived to pick him up.One of the officers opened the bonnet of the Ford, which was Gordievsky’s signal to emerge from the undergrowth. After scrambling into the boot, he was wrapped in a space blanket to deflect the infrared cameras and heat detectors believed to be deployed at Soviet borders, and given a tranquiliser pill.If the plan failed, Gordievsky knew that he would taken back to Moscow and shot.But it was a success.Some time after Gordievsky was driven across the Finnish border, the head of MI6 made an urgent appointment to see Charles Powell, Margaret Thatcher’s private secretary, at No 10, and explained that Operation Pimlico was under way, and that the personal authorisation of the Prime Minister herself was urgently required.‘We have to honour our promises to our agent,’ she would tell Powell, not realising that Gordievsky was already on his way back to Britain in the boot of a car.For his part, Gordievsky has since said he has no regrets about betraying the KGB and says there is nothing he misses about Russia. ‘Everything here is ine’ compared to Russia, he declared in a subsequent interview.Gordievsky has little contact with his daughters, Mariya, 38, and Anna, 37, or his former wife Yelena. They joined him in Britain in 1991 after extensive lobbying of former leader Mikhail Gorbachev by Margaret Thatcher, but after being apart for six years, the marriage ended.How valuable an asset was Gordievsky? There was no new Cambridge spy ring, no network of KGB agents that had ‘wormed their way into the establishment in order to destroy it from within’. The most explosive ‘revelation’ was that Moscow was ‘prepared to use dirty tricks and hidden interference’ to swing an election in favour of Michael Foot — an ‘intriguing harbinger of modern times’, according to Macintyre.More importantly, perhaps, he opened up the inner workings of the KGB at a key moment in history. When he came to Britain Gordievsky was secretly briefing both sides, under the guidance of MI6. He told the Russians what to say to the British — and warned the British what the Soviet delegation would say to them, triggering the end of the Cold War.Since settling here, he has worked as a security adviser and has often appeared on TV as an expert on Russian espionage.He has been a consultant editor for the journal of National Security and co-hosted the Channel 4 show Wanted in the Nineties, in which contestants had to complete a list of challenges without being detected by a ring of spymasters.Gordievsky remains a passionate Anglophile, subscribing to The Spectator and penning articles for the Literary Review. Paintings hanging on the walls of his home in Surrey reflect his love of avant-garde art. One of his great pleasures, he says, is feeding the foxes who visit his garden.There has been only one sinister episode during this gilded life in the stockbroker belt.In 2008, he spent 34 hours unconscious in hospital after falling ill at his home. He was initially paralysed and still has no feeling in his fingers. He claimed he was the victim of a Kremlin-inspired assassination plot.‘I’ve known for some time that I am on the assassination list drawn up by elements in Moscow,’ he said at the time. ‘It was obvious to me that I had been poisoned.’He said he was poisoned with thallium, a highly toxic metal used in insecticides which was favoured by the KGB in assassinations during the Cold War.Of course, this poisoning claim sounds eerily like what happened earlier this year in Salisbury.Indeed, it seems that stories about Kremlin assassins, Soviet defectors and British Left-wing politicians who are deemed Moscow’s useful idiots will continue to run and run. But surely none can surpass that of the superspy who came in from the cold. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/16/15/503288C600000578-0-image-m-56_1537108716557.jpg","title":"Politicians wear glasses likely voted power study suggests","story":"    When 203 people were shown 16 pictures of politicians, they said they were most likely to vote for those with spectacles like, Jacob Rees-Mogg (pictured)When 203 people were shown 16 pictures of politicians, they said they were most likely to vote for those with spectacles. Those in glasses were seen as clever and were liked more regardless of their party, further research found.Vince Cable denies \u0027running out of road\u0027 as Liberal Democrat...\u0027It\u0027s so undemocratic\u0027: Sadiq Khan is lashed by the Tories...Share this articleA study led by the University of Cologne concluded that eyewear offers \u0027an easy, effective and robust way for politicians to change their facial features and increase the probability of electoral success in the West (as long as competence is important)\u0027. The psychologists said politicians try to avoid wearing glasses in public because of possible associations with \u0027vision deficiency, old age and weakness\u0027.Donald Trump taunted rival Jeb Bush during the 2016 US presidential campaign about getting contact lenses \u0027to look cool\u0027.

The note to the Russian Consulate in London is dated November 30, 2010, shortly after Assange\u0027s website WikiLeaks had released a first batch of U.S. State Department filesAmong other things, the documents lay out Assange\u0027s campaign to avoid being arrested and extradited to Sweden over allegations that he sexually molested one woman and raped another during a trip to the Scandinavian country in August 2010.Assange has always denied wrongdoing in the case, which he cast as a prelude to extradition to the U.S. The Swedish prosecution jeopardized what at the time was WikiLeaks\u0027 biggest-ever disclosure: the publication of around 250,000 U.S. State Department cables. Swedish authorities issued a warrant for his arrest on November 18, just 10 days before the cables exploded across the web, with bombshell revelations about drone strikes in Yemen, American spying at the U.N. and corruption across the Arab world.Italy\u0027s then-foreign minister, Franco Frattini, described the release as the \u0027Sept. 11 of world diplomacy.\u0027 Enraged American politicians demanded that Assange be treated like a terrorist.Metadata suggests that it was on November 29, the day after the release of the first batch of U.S. State Department files, that the letter to the Russian Consulate was drafted on the Jessica Longley computer.The AP couldn\u0027t confirm whether or when the message was actually delivered, but the choice of Israel Shamir as a go-between was significant. Assange\u0027s involvement with Shamir, a fringe intellectual who once said it was the duty of every Christian and Muslim to deny the Holocaust, would draw indignation when it became public.Shamir told the AP he was plagued by memory problems and couldn\u0027t remember delivering Assange\u0027s letter or say whether he eventually got the visa on Assange\u0027s behalf.\u0027I can\u0027t possibly exclude that it happened,\u0027 Shamir said in a telephone interview. \u0027I have a very vague memory of those things.\u0027Shamir\u0027s memory appeared sharper during a January, 20, 2011 interview with Russian News Service radio - a Moscow-based station now known as Life Zvuk, or Life Sound. Shamir said he\u0027d personally brokered a Russian visa for Assange, but that it had come too late to rescue him from the sex crimes investigation.Russia \u0027would be one of those places where he and his organization would be comfortable operating,\u0027 Shamir explained. Asked if Assange had friends in the Kremlin, Shamir smiled and said: \u0027Let\u0027s hope that\u0027s the case.\u0027Shamir often makes eyebrow-raising claims (in the same interview he said that the U.S. offered Assange $100 million not to publish the cables), but it was true that any visa for Assange would have been moot.On November 30, 2010 - the date on the letter - Interpol issued a Red Notice seeking Assange\u0027s arrest, making any relocation to Russia virtually impossible. With legal bills mounting, Assange turned himself in on December 7 and his staff\u0027s focus turned to getting him out of jail. One WikiLeaks spreadsheet listed names of potential supporters arrayed by wealth and influence a second one titled \u0027Get Out of Jail Free\u0027 tracked proposed bail donations and pledges for surety.As they gathered money, Assange\u0027s allies also plotted what to do once the WikiLeaks founder was released.One document showed Guatemalan human rights lawyer Renata Avila floating the idea of jumping bail.\u0027I will advise him to seek asylum abroad: we already contacted the Ministry of Justice in Brazil, there is a possibility to run out of the country in a Brazilian ship,\u0027 Avila told fellow WikiLeaks supporters in a memo. The document said Assange should \u0027plan to escape and pay the bail money back to his supporters.\u0027Avila didn\u0027t return repeated messages seeking comment. It\u0027s not clear whether her idea went anywhere former Brazilian Justice Minister Eduardo Cardozo, who was serving on then-President-elect Dilma Rousseff\u0027s transition team at the time, told the AP that he\u0027d never heard of an Assange asylum request.Assange would eventually skip bail after exhausting his British legal campaign to block the Swedish extradition effort, darting into the Ecuadorean Embassy on June 19, 2012. The move frustrated the sex crimes prosecution, which was dropped last year, but it sparked a standoff that continues to this day, with Assange refusing to leave the embassy unless he is shielded from extradition to the U.S.Assange\u0027s escape left many of his guarantors in the lurch. When a group of them went to court in late 2012 to reduce their bill, the escape plan went unmentioned.A lawyer for four of Assange\u0027s supporters, Henry Blaxland, told the judge that Assange\u0027s Ecuadorean asylum stunt caught everyone off guard.\u0027Nobody could reasonably have foreseen that\u0027s what he would do,\u0027 Blaxland said."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/16/22/503D116D00000578-0-image-a-36_1537132012146.jpg","title":"Immigration undermined UK culture say four 10 Brits","story":"     Half of voters say immigration is straining public services, and nearly all of them think that MPs lie about the issue, a report reveals todayJust 15 per cent of people feel the Government has managed immigration competently and fairly, while only 17 per cent trust them to tell the truth about immigration in Britain. However, 63 per cent of people felt migrant workers supported the economy by doing the jobs British workers did not want to, and a similar number said they brought valuable skills for the economy and public services such as the NHS.MoD experts trial fleet of drones and robots to help examine...Woman charged with third-degree assault after \u0027purposefully...Share this articleFifty-nine percent believed that the ersity brought by immigration has enriched British culture, but half said public services were under strain from immigration and that migrants were willing to work for less, putting jobs at risk and lowering wages.The paper, produced by a project called the National Conversation on Immigration, reveals a ‘shocking’ level of public mistrust over immigration.Four out of ten were willing to keep the current EU free movement rules after Brexit if it meant a better deal for British business.

But I always want to see the best candidate selected. That’s what members rightly decided last night.’ But who is Dave Sharma?Who is Dave Sharma?Born Devanand Sharma in Vancouver, Canada in 1975, more commonly known as Dave, his family moved to Parramatta in Sydney a few years later, he revealed in an interview with The Indian Herald back in 2013, when he was appointed as Australia’s youngest Ambassador of Indian heritage at age 37.Sharma said that his grandfather was a Brahmin priest from the Uttar Pradesh region of India who moved to Trinidad in 1908. ‘My father was the youngest of 9 children. My father was born in 1928 in Trinidad and currently lives in Sydney. He however spends time between Trinidad, Australia and Canada.’Dave continued to explain that his ‘father did a Law Degree and he married my mother Diana who was from Sydney in 1964. They met each other in Kings College in University of London, where both of them were studying.’He also said that while a lot of his father’s family went into law, Dave was the first to embark on a career in foreign service. Studying at Turramurra High School, he achieved the highest HSC Tertiary rank of 100 in the entire state of NSW, also being the highest ranked student in NSW Public Schools that year.After studying law at the University of Cambridge, Dave went back to school to study medicine at the University of Sydney before topping it up with a Masters in International Relations from Deakin University.Before becoming Australia’s Ambassador to Israel, Dave served in the Australian diplomatic offices as Counsellor at the Australian Embassy, Third Secretary at the Australian High Commission and as Senior Civilian Adviser with the Peace Monitoring Group.Dave was also an Adviser to Foreign Minister Alexander Downer from 2004 to 2006 and was a Senior Career Officer with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT), as well Assistant Secretary in the Africa Branch and Acting First Assistant Secretary in the International Division in the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet.          Prime Minister Scott Morrison and Liberal Party candidate for Wentworth Dave SharmaFollowing his appointment by Foreign Minister Bob Carr, Dave said that becoming the Ambassador of Israel was a ‘high profile posting as Israel is such an important part of the world for us. We also have a big Jewish community in Australia and have taken a close interest in this relationship.‘Indian community is a very successful migrant community in Australia and instead of concentrating on a few professions they should adopt alternate professions as well like Public Policy and join Government at the Federal level and expand their presence in non-traditional areas.‘Australia is a very open society and there are positions available for all Australians. There is meritocracy and hard work in Australia is recognised.’ He moved to Israel with his wife Rachel and their three daughters in 2013.Dave Sharma Liberal CandidateMalcolm Turnbull’s choice for his Liberal candidate won over the new Prime Minister Scott Morrison’s pick, despite calls for a woman to take up the vacant seat in Wentworth. Last week, Dave Sharman beat seven other candidates in the running for the blue ribbon electorate.Sharma will now face a by-election battle on October 20, but early polls indicate that there will be a big swing against the Liberals, who have never lost Wentworth, which includes Australia\u0027s most expensive suburbs of Point Piper and Vaucluse.This came after Morrison had already had an embarrassing episode earlier on in the day, having posted a video of Question Time edited together with Fatman Scoop’s song Be Faithful, with the caption: ‘QT was on fire today. Good work, team.’Of course, the tweet was savaged online for the song\u0027s inappropriate lyrics (\u0027who f***ing tonight?\u0027), the allusion to Liberal party member\u0027s wealth (if you\u0027ve got a hundred dollar bill put your hands up) and the possible illegality of using parliamentary footage as promotional content.Morrison removed the post hours later and apologised for using a song that’s lyrical content was \u0027not okay\u0027. In addition to this, Turnbull had been accused of attempting to tear the party that had sacked him apart.Morrison\u0027s preferred candidate Katherine O\u0027Regan, a former deputy mayor of Woollahra, received just 19 votes out of 201 in the first round and came fifth out of eight candidates, despite being the frontrunner. The other women in the preselection race: Mary-Lou Jarvis, another Woollahra councillor and rheumatologist Maxine Szramka also fared poorly against the male contenders.          Mary-Lou Jarvis (R) is seen at the Liberal Party pre-selection meeting for the seat of WentworthTo make matters worse, Mr Morrison misspelled his name as David on Twitter, despite his name being Devanand. \u0027Big congratulations to David Sharma, our new Liberal candidate for Wentworth,\u0027 he tweeted before deleting the social media message.However, Dave Sharma also received backlash after an opinion he penned for The Age in June emerged, resulting in many social media users slamming the candidate for his views. In the piece, Sharma wrote: \u0027Most school assets - the buildings and infrastructure - are used only during school hours, or roughly 15 per cent of the time. School employees and teachers are similarly underemployed, working hours closer to three-quarters of a regular full-time job.\u0027We expect government services to adapt to the tempos and demands of modern life, yet the school system remains stubbornly resistant to even the contemplation of change.\u0027And in an economy which demands increasingly high levels of skill and education, if we are to maintain our standards of living and way of life, perhaps some of the answer lies simply in more hours of education and learning.\u0027Mark Burnett net worth revealed after Emmy\u0027s fight with Tom ArnoldDoes America\u0027s Got Talent finalist Courtney Hadwin have an unfair advantage?Who is Dave Sharma?

She gave it unhesitatingly.Even as Powell and the PM spoke, the double agent himself was being smuggled, thousands of miles away, across the Russian border into Finland and safety in the boot of a Ford saloon car.His name was Oleg Gordievsky, widely acknowledged to be the most valuable secret service mole at the heart of the KGB during the latter decades of the Cold War.He was 46 then, and 79 now.          Oleg Gordievsky receives the Companion of the Most Distinguished Order of St Michael and Saint George from Queen Elizabeth II for his services to UK security (pictured in 2007)He continues to defy Moscow but has escaped the fate of subsequent turncoat and defector Sergei Skripal, a victim of the Salisbury Novichok poison attack.So why are you reading about Gordievsky today?Because a new book revives claims that Michael Foot was in the pay of the Soviet Union when he was leader of the Labour Party in the late Eighties.Such is the world of espionage that these claims are impossible to verify but in his book, The Spy And The Traitor, the respected intelligence historian Ben Macintyre reveals that MI6 found them credible and that Secret Intelligence Service chiefs were prepared to tell the Queen if Foot ever became prime minister.          Gordievsky graciously accepted the award from the Queen, wearing top hat and tails. He receives a £20,000-a-year pension from MI6The source of the allegations was Gordievsky.Foot, he said, had met his KGB handlers over lunch at the Gay Hussar, a Hungarian restaurant in London’s Soho, and received the equivalent of £37,000 in today’s money for being ‘a confidential contact’.The accusations were first published in the Sunday Times two decades ago. Foot fiercely challenged the story and won a famous libel victory against the newspaper. He continued to deny the accusations until his death at the age of 96 eight years ago.Whatever the truth about Agent Boot — the KGB’s pseudonym for Foot, apparently, a play on his name — the controversy has turned the spotlight on the enigmatic figure of Gordievsky.          Gordievsky first came to the attention of the West in the Sixties when based in Copenhagen, running Soviet spies in Denmark and was thought to be vulnerable to blackmail after being spotted buying homosexual pornography in the city’s red light districtIn 2007, he was made a Companion to the Order of St Michael and St George (CMG) ‘for services to the security of the UK’. Fittingly, this is the same honour given to James Bond. Gordievsky graciously accepted the award from the Queen, wearing top hat and tails. He receives a £20,000-a-year pension from MI6.Ever since his defection, Gordievsky has lived comfortably in the Surrey suburbs, for most of that time with his long-term British-born companion Maureen. Salmon canapes and red Bulgarian wine are said to regularly grace their dining table.So how did he escape from the Moscow shadows to become the greatest asset our secret services have ever turned?Gordievsky first came to the attention of the West in the Sixties when based in Copenhagen, running Soviet spies in Denmark and was thought to be vulnerable to blackmail after being spotted buying homosexual pornography in the city’s red light district.In fact, as Macintyre explains in his book, he had been intrigued by gay practices and had taken the magazines home to show his then wife Yelena and place them on the mantelpiece as ‘an open exhibition of freedom unavailable in Soviet Russia’.Gordievsky did make a pass at Western intelligence, however, after becoming disenchanted with the Soviet system and its brutal repression of the 1968 Prague Spring, when tanks were sent into Czechoslovakia to crush the growing reform movement.His feelings were picked up by MI6 when a defector informed it that Gordievsky had shown ‘clear signs of political disillusionment’.A surreptitious approach was duly made when he was playing a morning game of badminton with a female member of the Young Danish Communists.It was, to quote Macintyre, the beginning of the ‘career’ of ‘Britain’s greatest ever spy’.In 1982, more than a decade after being recruited on the badminton court, Oleg Gordievsky was posted to the Russian Embassy in London where he would be made the ‘resident’ — the head of the KGB in Britain. His swift advancement was helped by the fact that MI6 arranged for his immediate superiors to be kicked put of Britain.It meant that Gordievsky provided a valuable insight into Soviet thinking at a crucial stage of the Cold War.Three years after settling in London, though, Gordievsky was suddenly summoned back to Moscow where he was subjected to a lengthy interrogation that involved the administration of a truth drug someone — in the CIA, it was suspected — had betrayed him.Gordievsky may not have cracked, but he knew the game was up. It was time to activate Operation Pimlico, the daring escape plan already formulated by MI6 in the event of such an eventuality.But how to get him out of Russia when he was under such scrutiny? The chain of events that were set in motion proves the old adage, that truth is indeed sometimes stranger — and in this case, at least, infinitely more fascinating — than fiction.In his flat on 103 Leninsky Prospect in Moscow, Gordievsky retrieved a hardback copy of Shakespeare’s sonnets, and soaked the flyleaf so he could peel it off. Inside, he found a sheet containing his escape instructions, which he committed to memory.So he found himself standing on a Moscow street corner, as per the instructions, at 7pm on July 16, 1985, clutching a Safeway carrier bag. Safeway bags bore a large letter ‘S’, an immediately recognisable logo that would stand out in the drab surroundings of the Soviet capital.This was the signal — to British agents working in an office across the street — that his cover had been blown, and that he needed to be pulled out of the Motherland immediately.Exactly 24 minutes later, a man walked passed him carrying a Harrods bag eating a chocolate bar Gordievsky had been told in advance that it might be a Kit Kat or a Mars bar. In fact, it was a Mars bar. The man was an MI6 officer.‘As he passed within four or five yards, he stared straight at me,’ Gordievsky recalled in his memoirs. ‘I gazed into his eyes shouting silently, “Yes, its me! I need urgent help”.’Gordievsky had already said goodbye to his wife and two daughters, whom he would not see until the end of the Soviet regime.He took a train north to Leningrad, Russia’s second city, from where he made his way to the town of Zelenogorsk, up the coast from the Baltic Sea.Next, he caught a bus heading for the Russian-Finnish border (the nearest East-West frontier to Moscow) where the border guards were accustomed to seeing diplomatic vehicles pass through checkpoints.Gordievsky hid in bushes until the car, with two MI6 operatives inside, arrived to pick him up.One of the officers opened the bonnet of the Ford, which was Gordievsky’s signal to emerge from the undergrowth. After scrambling into the boot, he was wrapped in a space blanket to deflect the infrared cameras and heat detectors believed to be deployed at Soviet borders, and given a tranquiliser pill.If the plan failed, Gordievsky knew that he would taken back to Moscow and shot.But it was a success.Some time after Gordievsky was driven across the Finnish border, the head of MI6 made an urgent appointment to see Charles Powell, Margaret Thatcher’s private secretary, at No 10, and explained that Operation Pimlico was under way, and that the personal authorisation of the Prime Minister herself was urgently required.‘We have to honour our promises to our agent,’ she would tell Powell, not realising that Gordievsky was already on his way back to Britain in the boot of a car.For his part, Gordievsky has since said he has no regrets about betraying the KGB and says there is nothing he misses about Russia. ‘Everything here is ine’ compared to Russia, he declared in a subsequent interview.Gordievsky has little contact with his daughters, Mariya, 38, and Anna, 37, or his former wife Yelena. They joined him in Britain in 1991 after extensive lobbying of former leader Mikhail Gorbachev by Margaret Thatcher, but after being apart for six years, the marriage ended.How valuable an asset was Gordievsky? There was no new Cambridge spy ring, no network of KGB agents that had ‘wormed their way into the establishment in order to destroy it from within’. The most explosive ‘revelation’ was that Moscow was ‘prepared to use dirty tricks and hidden interference’ to swing an election in favour of Michael Foot — an ‘intriguing harbinger of modern times’, according to Macintyre.More importantly, perhaps, he opened up the inner workings of the KGB at a key moment in history. When he came to Britain Gordievsky was secretly briefing both sides, under the guidance of MI6. He told the Russians what to say to the British — and warned the British what the Soviet delegation would say to them, triggering the end of the Cold War.Since settling here, he has worked as a security adviser and has often appeared on TV as an expert on Russian espionage.He has been a consultant editor for the journal of National Security and co-hosted the Channel 4 show Wanted in the Nineties, in which contestants had to complete a list of challenges without being detected by a ring of spymasters.Gordievsky remains a passionate Anglophile, subscribing to The Spectator and penning articles for the Literary Review. Paintings hanging on the walls of his home in Surrey reflect his love of avant-garde art. One of his great pleasures, he says, is feeding the foxes who visit his garden.There has been only one sinister episode during this gilded life in the stockbroker belt.In 2008, he spent 34 hours unconscious in hospital after falling ill at his home. He was initially paralysed and still has no feeling in his fingers. He claimed he was the victim of a Kremlin-inspired assassination plot.‘I’ve known for some time that I am on the assassination list drawn up by elements in Moscow,’ he said at the time. ‘It was obvious to me that I had been poisoned.’He said he was poisoned with thallium, a highly toxic metal used in insecticides which was favoured by the KGB in assassinations during the Cold War.Of course, this poisoning claim sounds eerily like what happened earlier this year in Salisbury.Indeed, it seems that stories about Kremlin assassins, Soviet defectors and British Left-wing politicians who are deemed Moscow’s useful idiots will continue to run and run. But surely none can surpass that of the superspy who came in from the cold. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/16/15/503288C600000578-0-image-m-56_1537108716557.jpg","title":"Politicians wear glasses likely voted power study suggests","story":"    When 203 people were shown 16 pictures of politicians, they said they were most likely to vote for those with spectacles like, Jacob Rees-Mogg (pictured)When 203 people were shown 16 pictures of politicians, they said they were most likely to vote for those with spectacles. Those in glasses were seen as clever and were liked more regardless of their party, further research found.Vince Cable denies \u0027running out of road\u0027 as Liberal Democrat...\u0027It\u0027s so undemocratic\u0027: Sadiq Khan is lashed by the Tories...Share this articleA study led by the University of Cologne concluded that eyewear offers \u0027an easy, effective and robust way for politicians to change their facial features and increase the probability of electoral success in the West (as long as competence is important)\u0027. The psychologists said politicians try to avoid wearing glasses in public because of possible associations with \u0027vision deficiency, old age and weakness\u0027.Donald Trump taunted rival Jeb Bush during the 2016 US presidential campaign about getting contact lenses \u0027to look cool\u0027.

The anonymous retired agent claimed Russian military intelligence uses \u0027liquidators\u0027 to kill enemies - but doubts that the men named as Alexander Petrov (left) and Ruslan Boshirov (right) are plausible as killersMoscow has already come up with dozens of versions, the British have alleged.But unusually the former GRU staffer conceded that the Russians use death squads, and might have done so in the Skripal case.\u0027Of course, such people exist, not only in the Russian secret service but in any other too,\u0027 he said.He also claimed that the pair seen on CCTV may have been replaced by actors for the stilted RT broadcast last week when they went public to deny any involvement.\u0027The main question about Petrov-Boshirov is not if they are killers or gay tourists,\u0027 he said. The main one is if they are really Petrov and Boshirov.\u0027It might well have been like this: the British secret service located two people and considered them to be liquidators.\u0027And the Russian authorities quickly found two similar looking guys and appointed them Petrov and Boshirov.\u0027Unimpressed with their performance he said: \u0027Somebody just did not spend much time searching - and first two suitable guys from the service were taken. They are soldiers and could not disobey the order.\u0027The pair in Salisbury should have been taught to watch out for CCTV cameras and mask their traces, he said.\u0027The problem is that in England, as far as I know, the density of such cameras is very high.\u0027So at the stage of preparation the task had to be different – not to avoid the cameras but to mask well. How to hide traces?\u0027Well, the first thing is not to make any traces – not to live together (in the same hotel), not to arrive and leave together, not to approach the Skripals\u0027 house together.\u0027Savaging their espionage tradecraft in Salisbury, he said: \u0027If these two guys (Petrov and Boshirov) really are intelligence officers, if they were truly involved in this attempt to liquidate the Skripals, then it means that (our) whole authority has collapsed. And this is truly horrible.\u0027The only other option was that they were part of a \u0027mafia\u0027 operation to kill ex-GRU agent Skripal because he had been involved in criminal work, possibly in Spain, he said. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/17/08/5040F28D00000578-6175215-Mrs_May_has_previously_credited_her_husband_with_helping_her_thr-a-16_1537168270529.jpg","title":"Rally drivers high speed race comes abrupt end bonnet suddenly flies open","story":"    Rally car drivers  are shocked when a bumper flies up and blocks their view during a race          Art McCarrick (pictured left) and John McCay (pictured right) from Ireland suffered the bonnet mishap during a competition They soon reach a straight stretch and the driver immediately accelerates.But suddenly the bonnet flies up and smacks against the windscreen, completely blocking his view of the road.I found the perfect way to beat traffic jams - dodge \u0027em!...Share this articleOne of the rally racers screams \u0027Oh!

The note to the Russian Consulate in London is dated November 30, 2010, shortly after Assange\u0027s website WikiLeaks had released a first batch of U.S. State Department filesAmong other things, the documents lay out Assange\u0027s campaign to avoid being arrested and extradited to Sweden over allegations that he sexually molested one woman and raped another during a trip to the Scandinavian country in August 2010.Assange has always denied wrongdoing in the case, which he cast as a prelude to extradition to the U.S. The Swedish prosecution jeopardized what at the time was WikiLeaks\u0027 biggest-ever disclosure: the publication of around 250,000 U.S. State Department cables. Swedish authorities issued a warrant for his arrest on November 18, just 10 days before the cables exploded across the web, with bombshell revelations about drone strikes in Yemen, American spying at the U.N. and corruption across the Arab world.Italy\u0027s then-foreign minister, Franco Frattini, described the release as the \u0027Sept. 11 of world diplomacy.\u0027 Enraged American politicians demanded that Assange be treated like a terrorist.Metadata suggests that it was on November 29, the day after the release of the first batch of U.S. State Department files, that the letter to the Russian Consulate was drafted on the Jessica Longley computer.The AP couldn\u0027t confirm whether or when the message was actually delivered, but the choice of Israel Shamir as a go-between was significant. Assange\u0027s involvement with Shamir, a fringe intellectual who once said it was the duty of every Christian and Muslim to deny the Holocaust, would draw indignation when it became public.Shamir told the AP he was plagued by memory problems and couldn\u0027t remember delivering Assange\u0027s letter or say whether he eventually got the visa on Assange\u0027s behalf.\u0027I can\u0027t possibly exclude that it happened,\u0027 Shamir said in a telephone interview. \u0027I have a very vague memory of those things.\u0027Shamir\u0027s memory appeared sharper during a January, 20, 2011 interview with Russian News Service radio - a Moscow-based station now known as Life Zvuk, or Life Sound. Shamir said he\u0027d personally brokered a Russian visa for Assange, but that it had come too late to rescue him from the sex crimes investigation.Russia \u0027would be one of those places where he and his organization would be comfortable operating,\u0027 Shamir explained. Asked if Assange had friends in the Kremlin, Shamir smiled and said: \u0027Let\u0027s hope that\u0027s the case.\u0027Shamir often makes eyebrow-raising claims (in the same interview he said that the U.S. offered Assange $100 million not to publish the cables), but it was true that any visa for Assange would have been moot.On November 30, 2010 - the date on the letter - Interpol issued a Red Notice seeking Assange\u0027s arrest, making any relocation to Russia virtually impossible. With legal bills mounting, Assange turned himself in on December 7 and his staff\u0027s focus turned to getting him out of jail. One WikiLeaks spreadsheet listed names of potential supporters arrayed by wealth and influence a second one titled \u0027Get Out of Jail Free\u0027 tracked proposed bail donations and pledges for surety.As they gathered money, Assange\u0027s allies also plotted what to do once the WikiLeaks founder was released.One document showed Guatemalan human rights lawyer Renata Avila floating the idea of jumping bail.\u0027I will advise him to seek asylum abroad: we already contacted the Ministry of Justice in Brazil, there is a possibility to run out of the country in a Brazilian ship,\u0027 Avila told fellow WikiLeaks supporters in a memo. The document said Assange should \u0027plan to escape and pay the bail money back to his supporters.\u0027Avila didn\u0027t return repeated messages seeking comment. It\u0027s not clear whether her idea went anywhere former Brazilian Justice Minister Eduardo Cardozo, who was serving on then-President-elect Dilma Rousseff\u0027s transition team at the time, told the AP that he\u0027d never heard of an Assange asylum request.Assange would eventually skip bail after exhausting his British legal campaign to block the Swedish extradition effort, darting into the Ecuadorean Embassy on June 19, 2012. The move frustrated the sex crimes prosecution, which was dropped last year, but it sparked a standoff that continues to this day, with Assange refusing to leave the embassy unless he is shielded from extradition to the U.S.Assange\u0027s escape left many of his guarantors in the lurch. When a group of them went to court in late 2012 to reduce their bill, the escape plan went unmentioned.A lawyer for four of Assange\u0027s supporters, Henry Blaxland, told the judge that Assange\u0027s Ecuadorean asylum stunt caught everyone off guard.\u0027Nobody could reasonably have foreseen that\u0027s what he would do,\u0027 Blaxland said."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/16/22/503D116D00000578-0-image-a-36_1537132012146.jpg","title":"Immigration undermined UK culture say four 10 Brits","story":"     Half of voters say immigration is straining public services, and nearly all of them think that MPs lie about the issue, a report reveals todayJust 15 per cent of people feel the Government has managed immigration competently and fairly, while only 17 per cent trust them to tell the truth about immigration in Britain. However, 63 per cent of people felt migrant workers supported the economy by doing the jobs British workers did not want to, and a similar number said they brought valuable skills for the economy and public services such as the NHS.MoD experts trial fleet of drones and robots to help examine...Woman charged with third-degree assault after \u0027purposefully...Share this articleFifty-nine percent believed that the ersity brought by immigration has enriched British culture, but half said public services were under strain from immigration and that migrants were willing to work for less, putting jobs at risk and lowering wages.The paper, produced by a project called the National Conversation on Immigration, reveals a ‘shocking’ level of public mistrust over immigration.Four out of ten were willing to keep the current EU free movement rules after Brexit if it meant a better deal for British business.

When asked about what he had said, her spokesman referred to what Theresa May told the BBC in an interview broadcast earlier: “The PM said very clearly that she believes our best days are ahead of us and that we will have plans in place for us to succeed in all scenarios.”The IMF’s warning came in the preliminary findings of its annual health check of the UK economy. The Washington-based organisation will flesh out precise details of the size of a UK recession in the event of a disorderly Brexit when it publishes the final report in November.Speaking at a press conference at the Treasury, Lagarde took issue with Brexit supporters who have said the UK would thrive if it left the EU without a deal and then traded on World Trade Organization terms.“Our projections assume a timely agreement with the EU on a broad free-trade pact and a relatively smooth Brexit process after that. A more disruptive departure will have a much worse outcome. Let me be clear: compared with today’s smooth single market, all the likely Brexit scenarios will have costs for the UK economy, and to a lesser extent for the EU as well. The larger the impediments to trade in the new relationship, the costlier it will be. This should be obvious but it seems that sometimes it is not.”The IMF came in for criticism from pro-leavers after giving a number of warnings about the consequences of Brexit in advance of the EU referendum in June 2016.Lagarde said the impact of the vote had been to slow the economy, adding that it would have been better had the passion surrounding the Brexit debate been devoted to curing the UK’s productivity deficit with other leading economies.Asked if she saw anything positive coming out of Brexit, Lagarde said: “I see a lot of negatives. If all the uncertainties were removed it would be better. It is bad for the economy to have this amount of uncertainty.”The IMF’s latest contribution to the Brexit debate came at a time when May has been battling leading Eurosceptics over her Chequers proposals, warning that her plan for a deal with Brussels is the only option. She told the BBC on Monday it was either her deal or no deal.Lagarde said progress had been made in preparing the UK for life outside the EU. “Nevertheless, the range of issues that remains to be addressed is daunting and the time left to accomplish them may be very short.” Ideally, she added, the transition period would be longer than the 20 months agreed between London and Brussels.The IMF said UK growth has already dropped and business investment has been lower than would be expected since the EU referendum two years ago. Over time, new trade agreements with countries outside the EU could eventually reduce some of the losses for the UK, it said, adding: “However, such agreements are unlikely to bring sufficient benefits to offset the costs imposed by leaving the EU.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e23dc24e681653a3856e442ed713ef3b3db8938e/0_74_3216_1930/master/3216.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f7c412018721646aad602682f22b6a05","title":"uk deportation ubs kweku adoboli ghana","story":"Kweku Adoboli is due to be deported despite leaving Ghana as a four-year-oldThe UK government has refused to intervene to prevent the deportation of Kweku Adoboli, a former UBS banker jailed for Britain’s biggest ever fraud, who will be sent to Ghana this week despite leaving his birth country as a four-year-old.Caroline Nokes, the immigration minister, said the government’s decision to deport Adoboli had been “upheld independently, at several stages, by the courts” and it would not be appropriate for her to intervene despite appeals from 132 MPs and MSPs.Nokes’s refusal to intervene means it is almost certain that Adoboli will be placed on a a flight to Accra, the Ghanaian capital, on Tuesday. His legal team is preparing a fresh application for judicial review on public interest grounds to be submitted later on Monday but his lawyers concede it is very unlikely to be accepted.Adoboli, 38, who was found guilty in 2012 of fraud that lost his Swiss bank $2.3bn (£1.8bn), is being deported to Ghana because he is not a British citizen, despite having lived in the UK for 26 years. He was sentenced to seven years in jail and served half of that time.Nokes said the law “requires that the secretary of state must make a deportation order in respect of a foreign criminal where they are sentenced to a period of 12 months or more imprisonment”.She added in a letter to Adoboli’s MP, Hannah Bardell: “Although Mr Adoboli’s offence was not one of violence, he committed a serious offence and this was reflected in the length of his sentence.“Financial crime, like all crime, has an impact on the society that we live in and the public expects robust action to be taken against foreign nationals who abuse our hospitality by committing crime.“The decision to to deport him has been upheld independently, at several stages, by the courts. His application to appeal to the court of appeal was dismissed on 28 June 2018 and on 13 August his application for a judicial review was refused.”Adoboli, who is being held in an immigration removal centre near Heathrow airport, said: “By denying the application of discretion to my case, a precedent is being created that will allow the Home Office to deny human rights to many other deserving cases.“This is the hostile environment at work and we should all use this opportunity to persuade the government to deliver on the ‘fair and decent’ immigration policy it promised.”Nokes said the government was “committed to a fair and humane immigration policy” and rejected the suggestion that Adoboli’s treatment was similar to that of the Windrush generation of immigrants.“The Home Office recognises the weight of dissatisfaction towards the treatment of the Windrush generation and officials are working hard to put this right … I do not believe that the issues faces by the Windrush generation, who were legally resident in the United Kingdom but did not have the documentation to prove it, are analogous to Mr Adoboli’s case.”Nokes said the UK Borders Act 2007 does not provide for ministerial discretion and that it “would not therefore be appropriate for my intervention”.Nokes has previously blocked at least two British citizens on Twitter when they asked for her assistance after the Home Office failed to respond to their complaints or appeals from their MPs."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8e29c820ad3f753c532ac811ba736d71cb2a6429/0_21_6545_3927/master/6545.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=23c21fad60a917297d1d332cfcfb759c","title":"chequers proposal hard brexit remainers parliament","story":"Sanity time is at hand. Michael Gove is right. The reckless, crash-bang-wallop of the hard-Brexit fantasists has had its day. They have not produced a plausible future for British trade with Europe. The default option is now “crashing out”, and that is infantile. Of course the Chequers proposal has problems. But it takes the UK out of the EU and keeps frictionless trade with EU members. Both were always pledged by the prime minister as constituting Brexit. The EU asked for Britain’s proposals to meet this pledge, and now has them. It should negotiate them.Gove may have his own motives for showing sweet reason. He is on a roll while his rival Boris Johnson is off with the fairies – he should try telling Yorkshire that England “acquiesced” in the Norman conquest as he did in his  column today. Chequers leaves trade in goods unimpeded, while services have always been subject to ad hoc deals. This has nothing to do with taking back control. All trade requires compromise on regulatory standards, in or out of the EU. To be a part of Europe’s single market, as Thatcher insisted, is blatantly in Britain’s interest. The EU’s deals with the rest of the world are far more effective than any the UK could get alone.That Chequers is disliked by remainers and leavers alike is probably the best argument for it. Either way, it is the one game in play. That is why it is irresponsible for Labour’s Keir Starmer and the Liberal Democrats’ Vince Cable both to say their parties will vote against a Chequers-based settlement in parliament. It clearly does not help UK negotiators. And do these remainers really think the UK will then revert to full EU membership?The consequence of parliament not ratifying Chequers would be a numbing chaos. How that helps either side is a mystery. There would be no time for a general election or another referendum, which again would decide nothing. It would probably involve some clock-stopping ritual and a worse Chequers. Westminster appears to have gone bonkers, Cable and Starmer included.Finding common ground on single-market continuity has to make sense, along with some deal on EU passports, pending a new and urgent approach to migration across Europe. Britain should clearly stay with various EU agencies, as agreed under Chequers. Only luddites and xenophobes could seriously want to end all collaboration in law, security, science and medicine. Gove is therefore right. This is a traumatic moment for the UK. While talk of cataclysm may be exaggerated, politicians are toying with people’s livelihoods. Once the UK has withdrawn, once frictionless trade has been defined and resolved, the UK can sit back and assess the benefits and disbenefits of its new status in Europe’s economic space.It can then retreat further from the EU, or return to a closer relationship. Both options can be contemplated. No parliament can bind its successors. The referendum itself proved that. The UK must just get over this hurdle, with the least damage done."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/626da39dd6b295e2fcf65c39fad3f4749be4458e/8_0_2103_1262/master/2103.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f57543545b2a3e9584f25167ebd03a7f","title":"herbie bug vw beetle volkswagen","story":"For a car that was in large part the brainchild of Adolf Hitler, who wanted a “people’s car” for Aryan families, the Volkswagen Beetle has done remarkably well to last for 80 years. Hitler commissioned it, laid the cornerstone for its famous factory in Wolfsburg and was presented with the first convertible version. The design of the new car, which bore an uncanny resemblance to a stormtrooper’s helmet, was then adapted for military use and produced using slave labour. Quite a beginning.You would not have thought the car the Führer named the Kraft-durch-Freude-Wagen (“Strength Through Joy Car”) would have survived the collapse of the Reich, but survive it did – until last week, when VW announced the Beetle had reached the end of the road and would not be produced after 2019. In fact the Beetle did more than merely survive its unfortunate birth. It became the world’s most popular car, and still has claims to be the best-selling vehicle based on a single platform. The Toyota Corolla has sold more units, but the Corolla is really a brand name attached to a variety of different model types. From 1938 until 2003 the shape of the Beetle barely changed 21.5m were sold.In a sense this is the Beetle’s second death. Production of the Type 1 – the beloved version with the engine in the boot – was phased out in 2003, and the two versions produced since, while drawing on the original’s heritage, never had its quirky appeal or popular success. The “New Beetle”, launched in 1997, looked like the original but its engine was in the front (how dull) the even newer, lower-slung Beetle unveiled in 2011 bore only a passing resemblance to the Type 1. The real Beetle had already been killed off now the epigonic variants will disappear too.The great paradox of the Beetle was that the Nazi-mobile developed in the late 1930s and mass-produced from the 1950s became the representative of the counterculture, beloved of Californian surfers and radicals of the Woodstock generation. At a time when many Americans were driving vast, gas-guzzling saloon cars, the Beetle seemed to represent a friendlier, greener alternative, even though in reality quite a bit of gas was being inefficiently guzzled.America’s love affair with the Beetle was cemented by the string of Disney films starring Herbie, a sentient car that was forever outwitting villains in large black saloon cars. It is no coincidence that the first film in the series, The Love Bug, appeared in 1968 – the year of global youth protest. Hitler’s car had been transformed into the perfect vehicle for generational and class animosities.What probably is a coincidence – though the coming together of cultural references seems too good to be true – is that the car immediately behind the Beatles on the cover of Abbey Road, parked just beyond the famous zebra crossing, is a white Beetle. The licence plate of the car, LMW 281F, was repeatedly stolen after the album came out in 1969, and the car eventually ended up in the VW museum in Wolfsburg. For VW it was manna from heaven: Beetles, Beatles … the circle was complete.Bugs in the US Beetles (in a variety of languages) in Europe – the lovable, wheezy, modest but knowing little car had imprinted itself on a generation. It is telling that the Beetle and the Bug did not begin as brand names but were adopted by VW because that’s what the people who bought the cars called them. The Beetle really had become the people’s car. It was a nice touch that when the New Beetle was produced in the late 1990s, it incorporated a flower on the dashboard – a homage to the flower power generation that had taken the original to its heart.The fact that the performance of the original Beetle was lacklustre hardly mattered in fact it made it even more desirable. It was a car for people who didn’t really like cars. “It was never much fun to drive,” wrote the novelist Geoff Nicholson in 1999. “It was a nightmare going round tight bends and lethal in a crosswind … The old Beetle was quirky, eccentric: the engine was in the wrong place the pedals seemed to be in the wrong place rear visibility was thrillingly, dangerously nonexistent.” He was presciently explaining why he didn’t think the New Beetle had much of a future: it was too good, too much like every other modern car, a “Golf Mk 4 in fancy dress”. Americans initially warmed to the retro appeal of the New Beetle, but then they decided they preferred SUVs after all. Nicholson was spot on in his analysis: “The New Beetle, I suspect, will come to be seen as a footnote to the original, but as footnotes go, it’s a good ’un.”There are many books about the Beetle, including an academic history published in 2013 by Harvard University Press. Harvard would not normally concern itself with such fripperies, but the Beetle is more than a car it’s a thread running through the 20th century, which is why even the footnotes are good.The car’s decline from the 1970s on – 1971 was the high point when 1.3m were produced – tells us something significant. Our relationship with cars has changed. Who now, other than a few Partridgean men, would feel emotionally attached to a car? We might use them as status symbols – hence the popularity of four-wheel drive Range Rovers in the posher parts of London – but we don’t love them. Disney isn’t going to make half a dozen movies about the Ford Focus.Motoring is no longer fun. It’s tedious and, worse than that, it’s bad for us and for the planet and for children who have to breathe in noxious fumes. VW, which once revelled in the love for the Beetle, has more recently been rocked by the “Dieselgate” scandal, in which it was shown to have been cheating on emission tests for its diesel models and claiming they were less polluting than they were. Herbie the Toxic Bug.The future is electric, with simple, non-polluting boxes probably operated with minimal human involvement (sentient cars!) getting us from A to B. The era when cars were enjoyable, idiosyncratic and representative of the nations and the times that produced them – think Mini, Morris Minor, 2CV, Trabant – is over. Motoring today is just about getting there without emitting too many noxious gases and finding a parking space you can squeeze into.Hinrich Woebcken, chief executive of Volkswagen in the US, announced the death of the Beetle with a heavy heart and didn’t rule out another resurrection one day. “I would say, ‘never say never’,” he intoned. But that would surely be a mere footnote to a footnote. The Beetle has finally been killed off because, for better or worse, motoring in the future will be bug-free."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/122ef70130f82461415f362d4f5657b7f9fea25e/0_385_5850_3509/master/5850.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5a5947e04e4174797dc6fafc44979ba8","title":"new measurement poverty social metrics commission","story":"Today the Social Metrics Commission (SMC) is publishing its new measurement of poverty for the UK. This is significant because there is currently no official measurement of poverty for Britain, and no agreed targets to reduce poverty. We all want to live in a society where we protect each other from harm, and everyone is able to meet their needs and improve their prospects. If we do not measure and understand who is in poverty, and why, then how can we deliver policies that reduce poverty effectively and focus on the most disadvantaged in our society?That is why we established the SMC in 2016 as an independent commission, with the sole aim of developing new measures of poverty for the UK. We were clear from the start that we also needed to build a broad consensus around poverty measurement if we were to deliver concrete action and real progress in the fight against poverty. We have brought together poverty experts and thinkers from the left and right, and after two and a half years of debate and rigorous analysis, we have united the views and experiences of 15 commissioners and numerous data and analytical experts to produce a new metric.For the first time, as well as looking at incomes, the new metric accounts for a range of inescapable costs that reduce people’s spending power, and the positive impact of people’s liquid assets on alleviating immediate poverty. These inescapable costs include childcare and the extra costs of living with a disability and rent or mortgage payments, which help to lock people in poverty. The measure also includes liquid assets such as savings, stocks and shares, which can help to prevent people being swept into poverty when their income drops or they have unexpected expenses. The metric reflects accurately the realities and experience of living in poverty and importantly it shows who is poor in Britain today.There are many new findings in the report and we wanted to highlight four big things that struck us personally.The true costs of living with a disability have been overlooked for too long, and the new metric takes account of the inescapable costs of disability, accounting for them alongside the value of disability benefits, to reflect the lived experience and costs of a disability.Second, it shows families struggling to make ends meet when the inescapable costs of childcare and housing are included, which can hit a family’s cash-flow hard. Those families who lack a financial buffer to fall back on and have no liquid assets are much more likely to be trapped in poverty. When previous measures focused on incomes only they did not adequately consider the impact that a lack of financial resilience and high essential costs have on families’ lives. The commission’s metric ends that oversight by developing a clear methodology that includes real costs, and therefore calculates net income.Many at this point will ask: what about the triple lock for pensioners, the generational balance of support and the level of investment in the welfare state? What is the balance between work as a way out of poverty and the support provided by social security and other public services? There will be many days to discuss and resolve these issues, but this is not that day. Today we are launching new measures that will hold those conversations and discussions to account. We want to put poverty at the heart of government policy-making and ensure that future decisions are made that tackle the long-term interest of those in poverty.Of course, views on policy priorities will differ across the political spectrum. The most important thing now is that, as a country, we have a better understanding of the extent and nature of poverty, which we can all agree on. We truly believe that the commission’s approach provides that understanding.

Although the university never owned enslaved people or traded in the goods they produced, it is now clear we received significant financial support from people whose wealth came from slavery.”The report concluded that the university benefited by between £16.7m and £198m, depending on how the amount is updated to its present-day value. It studied about 200 endowments, bursaries and prizes, looking for whether the people donating the sum made most of their money directly from slavery, or less directly, through trading in tobacco, sugar, and cotton.The Slavery, Abolition and the University of Glasgow report was co-authored by prof Simon Newman and Dr Stephen Mullen, and examined the roles of University alumni such as Robert Cunninghame Graham in the slave trade. A former rector of the University, Graham made a gift of £100 to establish the Gartmore Gold Medal, awarded every two years for the best student work on “political liberty”. Graham had been a slave owner for nearly four decades at the time he endowed the prize.The study also demonstrated that between 1727 and 1838, more than 100 students who attended the Old College came from the Caribbean, “most of them the sons of slave-owning planters and merchants”.Co-author Newman said “The University of Glasgow is an institution that grew in a city tied to the trade in tobacco, sugar and cotton, all of which were initially produced by enslaved Africans. Launching an in-depth investigation to look at how the university might have benefited from the profits of racial slavery was, in my opinion, a brave decision. But it is a decision rooted in the core values of an educational institution dedicated to the pursuit of truth and social justice.”Other universities, especially in the US, have carried out work to research the extent to which they were funded by or supported slavery, and to present that history in an appropriate context. The University of Mississippi, for example, has added a plaque to a stained-glass window commemorating the “University Greys”, explaining that the infantry unit were fighting in the Confederate army to support the injustice of slavery.The way universities and museums deal with the legacy of slave-owning benefactors has become a major subject of debate within academia, often brought into the public eye by protests from present-day students such as the “Rhodes must fall” campaign at Oxford.As part of the process, Glasgow University joined the international Universities Studying Slavery group, which includes more than 40 institutions from the US, UK and Ireland. They also collaborated with the University of the West Indies.Prof Sir Hilary Beckles, the vice-chancellor of the University of the West Indies, welcomed the report, saying: “I celebrate colleagues in Glasgow for taking these first steps and keenly anticipate working through next steps.”Muscatelli added: “The university has set out a programme of reparative justice through which we will seek to acknowledge this aspect of the university’s past, enhance awareness and understanding of historical slavery. The university deeply regrets this association with historical slavery, which clashes with our proud history of support for the abolition of both the slave trade and slavery itself.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ba5e49d75d9db757427ec04e411aa3b6c1d8c5df/0_0_6246_4162/master/6246.jpg?width=880\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cd26941dd6ac5421793394fd8b2090e3 880w","title":"photographs by iranian film makers abbas kiarostami jafar panahi","story":"Despite facing censorship, house arrest and exile, directors such as Jafar Panahi and the late Abbas Kiarostami kept Iran at the forefront of world cinema.

Having fled to Palermo on Nelson’s HMS Vanguard when French Revolutionary troops invaded Naples in 1798, and encouraged by his Austrian-born wife Queen Maria Carolina, King F constructed a crown dairy in the Palermo commune of Partinico. According to the writer and food historian Mary Taylor Simeti, this daily supply of cream and butter was vital when the rest of Ferdinand’s court, with its aspirations to French style, arrived in Sicily. They turned their backs on traditional Sicilian cooking, sending to Paris for their chefs, who became known as monzù – a corruption of monsieur.Bechamel, brioche, mousses, glazes, sauces, pastry enriched with butter and cream: the food of the extremely rich had virtually no influence on the food of most of the population, who were, for the most part, desperately poor. In time, though, even when the fashion for French cooking faded and the monzùs turned their attention to elaborating on traditional Sicilian recipes, certain dishes and habits persisted and seeped into popular cooking.Now, in much the same way as Sicilian dialect and proverbs are speckled with reminders of the Greek, Arab, Spanish and French legacies, modern Sicilian cuisine is, too. Olive oil and opaque pork fat may rule supreme, but pastry, the brioche filled with gelato in Catania, and the bechamel my olive-oil-loving Sicilian mother-in-law spreads cautiously in baked pasta are all buttery reminders of the French culinary influence.In her book Sicilian Food, Simeti notes Denti di Pirajno’s elaborate recipe for pasticcio di sostanza – roughly translated as “pie of substance” – a rich pastry crust stuffed with chicken, giblets, mince and sausage with red wine and spices, the very substantial grandfather of modern and popular pasticcio.She also has a (shorter) recipe for a straightforward crostata di mandorle – almond tart – that I like to make.There is butter in the pastry but not the filling, which means it isn’t as rich as the de rigueur frangipane. It is lovely, though – a jam tart with a thick blanket of egg-enriched marzipan, which, when baked, takes on a light golden crust, but – because of almond’s natural oils – remains soft and slightly gooey underneath. You could use a fresh fruit compote I suppose, or press fruit into the top, and any fruit jam would work, but plain, not-too-sweet apricot jam works particularly well in pastry that has a French accent and an almond top that speaks Sicilian.For the pastry175g cold butter or half butterhalf lard, diced250g plain flour, sifted1 pinch salt50g icing sugar1 egg, beatenFor the filling250g-300g apricot jam2 large eggs175g caster sugar250g ground almondsHeat the oven to 180C350Fgas 4, and put a baking tray in the oven to heat up.Rub the butter into the flour until it resembles fine breadcrumbs, add the salt, icing sugar and beaten egg and bring the ingredients together into a ball. Wrap in clingfilm and chill for at least an hour.Roll the chilled dough into a circle large enough to line a 28cm shallow tart tin – loop it over a rolling pin to lift it into place in the tin. Patch any tears and press the dough into the sides of the tin. Spread the jam over the base of the pastry.Whisk the eggs in a bowl with the sugar until soft and fluffy. Add the ground almonds, and then spread this over the jam – a knife or fork dipped in hot water is good for this.Bake for 30-40 minutes, until the top is firm and lightly golden."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a0b8b5e74f1863516eee367666cae9a15c9e957a/726_0_4034_2421/master/4034.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fba17ce8081fabe47234902c07359465","title":"monaco mistakes transfer window ligue 1 atletico madrid champions league","story":"Monaco are 15th in Ligue 1 and now face the daunting task of hosting Atlético Madrid in the Champions LeagueBy Adam White and Eric Devin for Get French Football NewsMonaco are not like other clubs. PSG, Marseille and Lyon boast raucous home fans, splurge on marquee signings and all proudly claim to be the biggest and best club in Ligue 1. Monaco, however, averaged the lowest home gates in Ligue 1 last season and, since signing James Rodríguez and Radamel Falcao five years ago, they have based their success on selling their best players rather than haughtily parading big-name signings. Spearheaded by the club’s hardball negotiator-in-chief, Vadim Vasilyev, their unerring transfer policy has long been the basis of their success. This summer, however, they might finally have made mistakes.Since Russian oligarch Dmitry Rybolovlev acquired the club in 2011, when they were floundering in Ligue 2, Monaco have worked in cycles. The plan has been to sign younger players from Ligue 1 and cost-effective overseas markets – primarily Portugal (João Moutinho, Ivan Cavaleiro, Helder Costa). Those bourgeoning talents are then played alongside a sprinkling of older pros and developed over a handful of seasons until an eye-catching achievement raises their market value.Their run to the Champions League quarter-finals in 2015 was the culmination of Anthony Martial, Yannick Carrasco and Geoffrey Kondogbia’s generation and the title triumph in 2017 hastened the departures of Kylian Mbappé, Benjamin Mendy and Bernardo Silva. Maintaining a level of success is crucial to this model. Thanks to the masterful management of Leonardo Jardim, who has continually balanced the requirements of improving his players and finding a way to win, that goal has always been achieved. Routine entry to the Champions League also keeps Monaco’s squad at the forefront of Europe’s footballing consciousness and helps bring in funds.Having stayed at the club to help secure second place last season – an achievement in itself – the final few sellable title winners were allowed to go, leaving Vasilyev with a new team to build. That process has been close to disastrous. Monaco have picked up just five points from five league games so far this season and now their horribly inexperienced, raw and naive side are preparing for the visit of Atlético Madrid in the Champions League on Tuesday. They look unlikely to fare well in the Champions League this season or finish high enough in Ligue 1 to qualify for next year’s competition.Monaco’s recruitment policy has shifted from targeting players on the cusp of realising their potential to simply signing promising youngsters. While 22-year-olds Aleksandr Golovin and Samuel Grandsir fit the old mould, high-profile teenagers Pietro Pellegri (17), Sofiane Diop (18) and Willem Geubbels (17) do not. The three forwards had just nine senior outings between them at the start of the campaign. Although their talent is obvious, they remain longer-term investments who are not ready for the responsibility Thomas Lemar and Fabinho assumed upon their arrivals.Across previous generations, Monaco found the balance they needed to maintain momentum. As the previous cycle began, the experience of João Moutinho, Kamil Glik and Radamel Falcao complemented the developing talents of Thomas Lemar, Fabinho and Mendy, all of whom had considerable top-flight experience. Youth has become the focus of Monaco’s recruitment policy 11 of the 18 players selected for their 1-1 draw at Toulouse on Saturday were 23 or under. These youngsters dearly missed the calming influence of João Moutinho, who joined Wolves this summer.The £30m spent on Keita Baldé now seems misguided Youri Tielemans, added last summer alongside Baldé, remains little more than promising Jean-Eudes Aholou, a 24-year-old midfielder signed from Strasbourg, looks a little out of his depth. A previously mutually beneficial connection with super-agent Jorge Mendes led to the signing of midfielder “Pelé” from Rio Ave, reportedly upon the Portuguese deal-maker’s persistent request. The hope was that Mendes would send one of his top players Vasilyev’s way later in the window, but that assumption proved incorrect. Jardim is apparently so displeased with Pelé that he was open to the player leaving on loan before the summer window closed.Full-back continues to be a problem position. Djibril Sidibé’s fitness concerns have prevented his sale and led to the signing of Benjamin Henrichs from Bayer Leverkusen for an uncharacteristically costly £18m. Promising full-back Almamy Touré was in line to become first choice this summer but, with Sidibé and Henrichs at the club, he is refusing to sign a new deal and will probably leave next summer for free. A deal for Toulouse defender Issa Diop – an affordable, developing player with Ligue 1 smarts who would have fitted the policy that had been so profitable for Monaco – fell through and he eventually joined West Ham.In previous seasons, Jardim has found a way to achieve the club’s goals without a huge outlay, but he may not have the tools at his disposal to repeat the feat this season. Monaco, who rose sharply from the foot of Ligue 2 at Christmas 2011 and became Ligue 1 winners five and a half years later largely thanks to considered, astute coaching, scouting and administration, are now on the brink of a dramatic fall as a result of the failings of the same hierarchy. With whispers abound that Rybolovlev is considering his continued investment in the club, the Monaco project may have already seen its peak.• PSG will be happy with their comprehensive 4-0 win over Saint-Étienne, especially having been deprived of Neymar and Kylian Mbappé. Questions must be asked of Jean-Louis Gasset’s improvised tactics. Without experienced duo Mathieu Debuchy and Rémy Cabella through injury, the Saint-Étienne manager opted to play a 3-4-3 with Kévin Monnet-Paquet and Gabriel Silva as wing-backs. Neither player impressed, with Monnet-Paquet in particular being embarrassed by Julian Draxler. Gasset’s 4-2-3-1 was solid and reliable at the end of last season so, even without Debuchy and Cabella, he was rash to change things.• Nantes spent heavily, by their standards, this summer. Marquee signings Anthony Limbombe and Lucas Evangelista have impressed and look good value for their fees, but manager Miguel Cardoso is struggling to wring the best from his side tactically. Despite a surfeit of attackers, he played a negative 4-3-3 even at home to promoted Reims, with Limbombe and Gabriel Boschilia only featuring from the bench. Edouard Mendy did impress in goal for Reims, but Nantes have only scored five goals in as many matches. If they don’t become more clinical in attack, Cardoso will come under fire – and not without some justification.• Nîmes played the entertainers again on Sunday in a 3-3 draw at Bordeaux. They have been full of attacking verve so far this season but Umut Bozok, scorer of 24 goals in Ligue 2 last season, had struggled until Sunday. He scored and set up a goal on Sunday to finally make his mark in the top flight. As thrilling as Nîmes have been, they could reach another level if the 21-year-old continues to improve.• This is an article from Get French Football News• Follow Adam White and Get French Football News on Twitter"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/87a5f710b1b8f6966f84ab6e195d93340dd14dc1/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9ff8681b3e52cdcc457810bf9530d3fd","title":"premier league 10 talking points from the weekend action","story":"Ryan Fraser ran Leicester ragged Neil Warnock will not tolerate more Cardiff mistakes and Rafael Benítez needs a new planJürgen Klopp was asked to describe his emotions during stoppage time in the 2-1 victory at Tottenham. His dominant Liverpool team had led 2-0 going into it but they conceded to Érik Lamela in the 93rd minute to set up a nervy finale. “I would love to say it is the first time in my life I have been in a situation like that but it happens so often,” Klopp said. “My wife hates it.” The Liverpool manager would not have gone through the wringer if some of his players – Sadio Mané, in particular – had played in a teammate when they ought to have done. If there was one criticism of Liverpool’s best performance of the season it was the lack of ruthlessness and, even, traces of greediness. “It’s not greedy,” Klopp argued. “I want them to score and encourage them to do so. But there are moments when they have to pass.” David HytnerNo more “little old Burnley”, Sean Dyche exuded calm after the defeat against Manchester United before the international break, but there was a shift in the manager’s tone after this latest setback. Reeling from a fourth successive league defeat, in a season that has seen Burnley’s European adventure come to an end before it had a chance to really get started, Dyche admitted “we’ve got a bit of a fog around us at the moment” and implied his players need to change their mentality. “I told them after the game, every year it has been ‘little old Burnley’, but they’re now recognised because of last season. You have to grow with that. It should be something to be enjoyed.” Dyche has his work cut out to turn things around, not least because the malaise is more deep-rooted than some might think – Burnley have won only five of their last 26 league games. Stuart JamesOne of football’s simplest joys is the little guy making undignified fools of men twice his size. Ryan Fraser’s majestic display on Saturday was a custard pie in the faces of Wes Morgan and Harry Maguire, who spent the afternoon running through the gamut of defensive clumsiness: sliced passes, botched first touches, clanging mistimed tackles. Maguire should have been sent off for a pair of lumbering lunges Morgan was handed a red card for exactly that. The Leicester captain could claim both bookings were harsh but his dismissal added to the suspicion that he is on borrowed time, especially with Jonny Evans waiting in the wings. Morgan’s heroics during the title-winning season make him an immortal figure at Leicester but, in a rather more immediate sense, you wonder how much more life he has in him. Alex HessThere were times when Cardiff City had Chelsea worried at Stamford Bridge. They never stopped trying and Neil Warnock was right to say that his players were not intimidated by Maurizio Sarri’s side. Yet Cardiff were punished for minor lapses in concentration after taking an improbable early lead through Sol Bamba. Chelsea punished their mistakes, with Eden Hazard scoring a hat-trick, and Warnock knows that survival will depend on his team shedding their naivety. Hazard equalised when he dodged a poor challenge from Joe Bennett and the game was over as a contest when Bamba conceded a penalty by fouling Willian. “I can’t accept it,” Warnock said after the game. “I’ve got to say to the players: ‘You can make a mistake once, but if you do it twice I’ve got to leave you out.’ If you want to be in the team you can’t make the mistakes. Not at this level.” Jacob SteinbergIn some respects Lucas Digne had a very good game. He had four shots, more than any other Everton player apart from Gylfi Sigurdsson, and he effected four key passes, when no teammate managed more than one. Nor did any Everton player win more than his two aerial duels. Even a quick glance at his defensive stats – seven tackles, four more than any teammate, and two interceptions – suggests a player who was dominant. But the question rapidly becomes why the £18m signing from Barcelona was making so many tackles, and the answer is probably that he was repeatedly caught out of position, his attacking thrusts rendering him vulnerable to Andriy Yarmolenko’s pace and direct running. It’s no coincidence that two of West Ham’s three goals came down his flank. The suggestion was Digne lacked the technical capacity for Barça here it is the defensive side of his game that is being examined. Jonathan WilsonYou knew when Ashley Young got the ball in Manchester United’s win over Watford even without watching the game. The boos that rang out from the home crowd when their former player touched the ball were enough to alert you, which was pretty frequently in the first half, at least. No longer the spry winger of his days at Vicarage Road, Young is a full-time full-back now, and his fine performance in defence meant United didn’t miss the rejuvenated Luke Shaw, concussed on England duty, especially as both goals came directly or indirectly from Young’s set-piece delivery. Still, after the game Jose Mourinho quickly confirmed Shaw would start United’s Champions League opener against Young Boys on Wednesday: a sign of his fresh faith in Shaw, but also proof that while United might have plenty of problem areas, left-back isn’t one of them. Nick Miller“Wilfried Zaha needs more protection from referees,” is a regular grievance from everyone associated with Crystal Palace, including the player. It is a fair complaint because he tends to suffer particularly rough treatment, although not from Huddersfield on Saturday, apart from one late tackle by Mathias Jørgensen. Afterwards Roy Hodgson said Zaha deserved “enormous credit” for insisting on playing so soon after the groin injury that forced him to miss the defeat by Southampton, explaining “he is so determined to get back on the field that the doctors and physios can’t keep him back”. Maybe so, but the manager could keep him back if there are concerns about his fitness. Instead Hodgson said he was “concerned” about the player throughout the game and would have substituted him if Huddersfield had not been pressing for an equaliser. Perhaps it is not only referees who need to protect Zaha more. Paul DoyleRafael Benítez has problems. After trying to sneak counterattacking wins courtesy of smothering tactics, he switched to a high press against an Arsenal defence acclimatising to the stress placed on Petr Cech by Unai Emery’s insistence on routinely playing out from the goalkeeper. Newcastle still lost. They have collected one point – at Cardiff – from five games, equalling their worst start to a Premier League campaign, under Ruud Gullit in 1999. Admittedly they have faced four top-six teams and Benítez’s blueprints ensured no defeat was comprehensive. But Newcastle lack sufficient quality to convert enough chances. Although Arsenal were frequently shaky, inidual talent airbrushed their collective structural flaws. Tellingly, Granit Xhaka altered the narrative with a game-changing free-kick before Mesut Özil’s goal sealed things. “If you have players with quality they can win games,” Benítez said. “Even if something’s wrong.” Louise TaylorWatford’s unblemished start may have come to an end with the 2-1 home defeat against Manchester United, but Javi Gracia is still feeling the positivity that four successive victories bring. “I am sure all of them will stay angry,” the manager said after his side were denied a point by David de Gea in stoppage time at Vicarage Road. “If we lose we have to do it like today – fighting until the end, trying to score until the end, competing until the end. This is our attitude. We don’t have to change anything.” With the rejuvenated Troy Deeney leading from the front, Gracia has every reason to think that his Watford side can maintain their momentum when they travel for the first of three away games to Craven Cottage on Saturday to face Fulham before meetings with Tottenham, in the Carabao Cup, and then Arsenal.

His driving licence was about to expire. He knew the misery that lay ahead: taking time off his property rental business to queue for hours in the muggy heat, facing the chaos in the squalid government office, and finally capitulating to the tout who promised to push through his application – for a price.This time, it turned out to be as easy as ordering pizza.Kumar dialled 1076 and booked an appointment for a person from the Delhi government to come to his home. The two men sat on the sofa of Kumar’s small house in Chattarpur while the representative took down Kumar’s details on a tablet, filled out a form, uploaded his ID card and photograph and took his biometric data. Kumar paid the fee with his credit card.“It was over in 15 minutes. I couldn’t believe how easy it was. In a few days’ time, my new driving licence will come through the post. Dealing with the government has turned from hell into heaven,” said Kumar.Other residents of the Indian capital are equally stunned. The Delhi government, ruled by the Aam Aadmi (Common Man) party, has rolled out a radical scheme, at a cost of 150m rupees (£1.57m), to free the city’s 18 million residents from having to visit government offices – and reduce corruption.Forty services including applications for driving licences, marriage certificates, pensions, and water connections are now being delivered to people’s doorsteps. A battalion of young male and female foot soldiers (“mobile sahayaks”), armed with tablets and cameras, carry out the appointments, whizzing around the city on scooters. The fee is set deliberately low, at 50 rupees (50p), and the service is available from 9am to 9pm, seven days a week. In three months’ time, the list of services will be extended to 100. A private company, VFS Global, which handles visa and passport services, has been hired to run the project.Delhi’s chief minister, Arvind Kejriwal, called the project a “revolution in governance”. His deputy, Manish Sisodia, said the aim was to ease the life of the common citizen.“Usually the citizen goes to the government,” said the minister for administrative reforms, Kailash Gahlot. “We wanted to reverse this and take the government to the citizen. People waste so much time to get simple documents.”On day one, the helpline received 21,000 calls. Of these, only 2,728 were answered, and about 370 home visits were made. The government reacted to what it called the “enormous response” by increasing the number of telephone operators from 40 to 150 and the number of lines from 50 to 200 in two days.Some critics worry that the 50-rupee fee is simply too low to sustain the scheme. Gahlot said that if the costs turned out to be unviable for VFS Global, the government would make up the difference, to ensure the project’s long-term viability.There have been teething problems. Trilok Sharma, a marketing agent in Janakpuri who wanted to apply for a new water connection, found his mobile helpers could have done with more training. “They didn’t seem familiar with the software or the options it kept showing, nor with government rules. I would have preferred more experienced people to handle it. It would be quicker. That said, it’s a wonderful thing to have happened to the city,” said Sharma.Internet problems are also common. When mobile helper Pankaj Khanna turned up at the home of commerce student Riddhima Gauba in Saket to take her application for a learner’s licence, the signal was so poor they had to leave the living room and stand on the balcony. Even then, it took him some time to upload Gauba’s application and credit card payment. And even when the internet is working, the government server can be slow.For Sanjeev Oberoi, a technical manager with a US multinational, visiting a government office was synonymous with torture. It often entailed waiting for hours and reaching the counter only to find the official had gone to lunch or left for the day. But when he applied for a duplicate driving licence sitting in his Greater Kailash home this week, the experience, he said, “was a dream”.Oberoi is one of those who fears the low fee will make the operation unsustainable. “They should charge more so that they can sustain it long term. It’s too good to endanger. It’s a great revolution in our lives and must be protected,” he said.

But Hopkins – who had confused Monroe with the columnist Laurie Penny – refused to back down, resulting in a costly court case, with the commentator forced to pay £24,000 in damages and a substantially larger sum in legal costs.Meanwhile, her mainstream media career collapsed. She parted ways with Mail Online, for whom she had written a regular column, in late 2017, only a few months after losing her LBC radio show when she called for a “final solution” in response to the Manchester Arena terrorist attack. She now works for the far-right Canadian outlet Rebel Media.Hopkins, who has already had to sell her Devon home, applied for an inidual voluntary arrangement (IVA) in May, a filing on the Inidual Insolvency Register shows. Monroe told the  that the agreement, which will allow Hopkins to avoid bankruptcy and manage the long-term repayment of her debts, was recently formally agreed following discussion with creditors.Agreed monthly repayments are paid to the insolvency practitioner, who will deal with the creditors for the lifetime of the IVA. If the payments into the IVA are not enough to repay the debts in full, the rest will be written off. Last year there were 59,220 new IVAs in England and Wales.An IVA is a form of insolvency. It differs from bankruptcy, where assets are transferred to a trustee, who then sells them and distributes the proceeds to creditors. When the bankruptcy order is over you can make a fresh start, usually after a year. Those who declare bankruptcy are allowed to keep certain things, like household goods and a reasonable amount to live on.Hopkins, whose tweets suggested she is on a trip to Poland, did not immediately return a request for comment.“It’s really quite sad – two tweets cost her her house, job, and now her credit rating,” said Monroe, reflecting on the case, which has taken more than three years in total.“I’m supposed to be jubilant and celebratory but I feel quite mixed up. Having been close to the edge of bankruptcy myself, it’s a hideous situation to be in, but it was completely avoidable. Things are in place in that agreement to make sure her children are looked after. I’m a mother myself and I read it line by line to make sure that her children didn’t suffer as a result of what she’s done.”Hopkins shot to fame as a contestant on The Apprentice in 2007, later billing herself as “Britain’s most controversial columnist” and appearing on the US TV network Fox News, during which time then-presidential candidate Donald Trump called her a “respected columnist” for her writing on “the UK’s Muslim problems”.Earlier this year, she successfully won a complaint against the Daily Mirror after its website gave the impression that she was prevented from leaving South Africa for taking ketamine. She said the claim could be damaging to her reputation as, in reality, her passport had been briefly confiscated over allegations she had been spreading racial hatred, rather than for using medically-prescribed drugs.After Monroe revealed the existence of the IVA, social media users drew attention to a tweet Hopkins published in 2014 suggesting that people in debt typically blamed others for their predicament.Monroe warned that Hopkins could be turned into a martyr and pushed further to the extremes by the verdict. “She could have had a glittering career ahead of her,” she said.“I hope this is an opportunity to regroup and reconsider how best to provide for her family without ending up in court or being pushed further to the margins. I don’t know if it’s a fire that’s burning out or a fire that we’re pouring petrol on.“My offer of a cup of tea still stands if she wants to talk about it. I don’t believe that anyone’s so far beyond redemption. Lots of people are celebrating but I’m not.“I have to talk about it because if I don’t people will speculate on what I think. It’s a sad, lonely sort of anticlimax. It’s really crap and I feel really bad it’s all ended up like this. I thought she’d just say sorry.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7cb42c2592fd3dbc5c5fbc1f9af8e102047dec93/100_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=14bfe8475079bcedc418731293b89d54","title":"paul weller webchat true meanings","story":"The prolific modfather joined us on the release of his 14th solo album to answer your questions about new musicians, giving up drinking and how to start a revolutionThanks for all the questions.

It was when Danny Boyle was gonna be directing it but I think he\u0027s dropped out now. Noel wasn\u0027t quite as convinced as me but I think we had a really good song for it. I thought we had a good idea for the song, I wanted someone like Ceelo Green to sing it, but it\u0027s just all in my head.Where in Britain would you like to play, but haven’t?I\u0027ve played everywhere in Britain, pretty much. But there\u0027s lots of places I\u0027d love to go back to but I don\u0027t know if the venues still exist. Malvern Winter Gardens, somewhere like that.What’s your favourite Pixar film?Toy Story - 1 and 2 was good. I\u0027m looking forward to 4 next year.You’ve had such longevity to your career, living through several eras such as punk, Britpop etc - what was your favourite time producing music, either as a band or solo artist?I\u0027ve been very fortunate, I\u0027ve had lots of favourite times. I loved the early days of the Jam before we really made it, driving around in a transit playing pubs, clubs around London, wherever we could get a gig. Great, carefree days. The first couple of years of the Style Council, 83 - 85 probably, great times. No rulebook at all, making it up as we went along - it was like a travelling youth club on the road, that was good fun. Then I suppose the last few years, last 10 years or so - like now is one of my favourite times. There\u0027s nothing I wish for anyway, really. I\u0027m enjoying the place I\u0027m at right now. Nostalgia\u0027s got no future, has it. I\u0027m quite amazed at how nostalgic everyone\u0027s become culturally, in the last 10 years or so. I can only think it\u0027s people clinging to that in uncertain times. Maybe something to do with that. But in the past when we\u0027ve gone through times like this it\u0027s normally thrown up new kinds of music as opposed to looking back - this is probably the first time in my life that we haven\u0027t done that.

Probably Tin Soldier, if I had to really pick one. I just love the arrangement on it, the singing on it is incredible. As a performer, his vocal performance - and I love the structure and the arrangement and the fact it was like a Top 10 hit back in the day with a song and arrangement like that is pretty incredible really.

I like Sunspel, Uniqlo have some good things sometimes. I haven\u0027t really got a favourite shop, I just like wandering around looking in shop windows, picking stuff up here and there.

But palm oil cultivation in south-east Asia is clearing forests and contributing to the decline of orangutans. Here are the key points Think back over the past week in your life. If you’ve applied lipstick, eaten toast or put on a load of washing, chances are, you’ve used a product containing palm oil. Indulged in ice-cream or washed your hair? Palm oil. According to the World Wildlife Fund: “It is in about half of all packaged products sold in the supermarket.” And it’s linked to the destruction of the rainforest and many of the species that reside in it.To stop palm oil being listed as “vegetable oil” or as one of a long list of hard to pronounce synonyms, an EU law was passed in 2014, stating that all food products containing palm oil should be labelled clearly. But the same cannot be said for cosmetics and household products in which palm oil is often used.Indonesia is home to some of the most bioerse areas in the world, including the Leuser ecosystem, the last place on Earth where Sumatran orangutans, elephants, tigers, rhinos and sun bears coexist naturally. The Tropical Heritage Rainforest of Sumatra – of which the Leuser ecosystem is a part – is a Unesco world heritage site, but it’s still in danger from palm oil plantations, pulp production and infrastructure projects. Orangutans are keystone species, which, according to National Geographic, means they help define entire ecosystems. If a keystone species – sea otters, elephants, honey bees, for example – disappears, no other species can fill its shoes, and the ecosystem changes irrevocably. Mainstream media now regularly covers palm oil, campaigns such as Say No to Palm Oil have sprung up and the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil runs a certification system, which aims to ensure all palm oil with its stamp comes from sustainably managed plantations. Genuine change is yet to occur, however, prompting campaigners to put pressure on brands that use palm oil, urging them to use their power to genuinely reform their suppliers.Help create a movement to stop companies using dirty palm oil.

We will bring that back from the EU negotiations and put that to parliament. I think that the alternative to that will be not having a deal.”Tory MPs in the hard Brexit European Research Group (ERG) were quick to voice their objections. Steve Baker, who resigned as a junior Brexit minister over Chequers, said he agreed with a column by Boris Johnson in the Daily  and the UK should instead aim for a Canada-style free trade agreement.Jacob Rees-Mogg, the ERG chairman, backed Baker. He told LBC radio May was wrong to argue the only options available to parliament this autumn would be accepting Chequers or leaving without a deal.“The only reason we have got the Chequers plan is because she didn’t put forward a better one. It’s not this simple eitheror case.”But when May was asked what would happen if parliament rejected the agreement she expects to secure with Brussels, she said: “Do you really think the European Union is going to give a better deal at that point?”The prime minister will visit Salzburg on Wednesday and Thursday to attend an informal EU council of leaders, where she will canvass support for her Chequers plan over dinner on the first night of the summit. It will be a critical test of the credibility of the proposals with EU leaders, a week-and-a-half before the Conservative conference.May also dismissed alternative plans for the Irish border, including the one put forward last week by the ERG.“What many of these other plans are based on is moving the border. You don’t solve the issue of no hard border by having a hard border 20km inside Northern Ireland, or 20km inside Ireland. It is still a hard border,” the prime minister said.“What we’ve done is listen to the people of Northern Ireland … They don’t want a hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland. The only proposal that has been put forward that delivers on them not having that hard border, and ensures that we don’t carve up the United Kingdom, is the Chequers plan.”Johnson had written in his Daily  column that Brexit would be “a total write-off” unless May ripped up her plans for the Irish border. He said the backstop, which would keep Northern Ireland in the customs union and single market if no other agreement could be reached, was “being used to coerce the UK into becoming a vassal state of Brussels”.But No 10 delivered a sharp rebuke to Johnson. “I think it is worth pointing out that Boris Johnson was a member of the cabinet which agreed to the December joint report, including the backstop. At the time he congratulated the prime minister for her determination in securing the deal,” May’s official spokesman said.“He remained in government for a full seven months after the joint report was agreed. And he was also a member of the cabinet subcommittee which agreed the UK’s proposed customs backstop.”May had earlier told the BBC the options put forward by the EU for Brexit were unacceptable.“The European Union had basically put two offers on the table. Either the UK stays in the single market and the customs union – effectively in the EU – that would have betrayed the vote of the British people,” she said.“Or, on the other side, a basic free trade agreement but carving Northern Ireland out and effectively keeping Northern Ireland in the European Union and Great Britain out. That would have broken up the United Kingdom, or could have broken up the United Kingdom. Both of those were unacceptable to the UK.”Ireland’s deputy prime minister, Simon Coveney, is meeting the Northern Ireland secretary, Karen Bradley, on Monday afternoon but progress on the border conundrum is not expected to be made.He is also meeting Michel Barnier on Tuesday but the Irish government is not expecting any significant move from the British until after the Tory party conference at the earliest.However, this does not address the question of where exactly “away from the border” checks would be carried out on goods going into Northern Ireland directly through ports such as Belfast and Warrenpoint.

The British driver took a dominant victory from pole position and his title rival Sebastian Vettel could manage only third, ensuring Hamilton now has a 40-point lead with just six races remaining.Ferrari were expected to be on top at the Marina Bay circuit and they were until Hamilton put in an exceptional lap to take pole. The Mercedes team principal, Toto Wolff, described it as “stardust” and the best lap he had ever seen. Hamilton and Mercedes followed it with a perfectly executed race that Ferrari could not match, their aggressive strategy was unsuccessful and Vettel was unable to challenge.Hamilton has now won four of the last five races and the four-time world champion believed he could keep the momentum going. “We are going from strength to strength in terms of our understanding of the car,” he said. “We are far more comfortable at our job now. Six races ago we were struggling and trying to find that bit of magic, but we have now figured the car out.”He is now firmly on the front foot to win his fifth title. If Hamilton secured second place at the remaining meetings, Vettel would have to win them all to be champion. However Hamilton insisted the aim was to seal the championship as soon as possible.“The focus is intense. It has to remain the same if not more. We don’t have to change our approach,” he said. “I need to win every race and I focus on that. I arrive wanting to win. There will be weekends when we know we will be comfortably stronger, and weekends like this when we know we will be behind but we will still try to win. I didn’t think we would have 40-points advantage. But it’s not the end.”Vettel hit the wall at Marina Bay in practice, ending his running for the session, one of a series of costly errors the German has made this season Hamilton identified as having made a difference. “Vettel damaged the car and lost running that’s not us lucking in,” he said. “I take a lot of pride in making sure I do not put myself in those positions. It is only small percentages that you get wrong and they have bigger ramifications.”Before the weekend began Hamilton had been flying around the world to launch his Tommy Hilfiger clothing range and he had faced questions over whether it was a suitable way to prepare. His results in Singapore he believes emphatically answered them. “The balance that I have in my life, in general is really good. I am glad you have seen this,” he said.Wolff backed his driver. “He was in Shanghai on the cat walk, in New York a couple of days later and he came, rock and roll, and blew everybody away,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c8ee59c95939ca6418b85cad490c6c06dafdcbdb/0_77_4670_2802/master/4670.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=604631d3e28532a67a9e0619cb6ab1f8","title":"rfu re introduce full time contracts england womens rugby union team","story":"The Rugby Football Union (RFU) has announced that it will re-introduce full-time contracts for the England women’s 15-a-side team from 1 January next year – having previously scrapped them in 2017.Under plans agreed upon at an RFU board meeting last week, 28 full-time contracts will be available, supplemented by seven further elite player squad agreements.“We are delighted to be able to offer full-time contracts to our 15s players,” said the RFU’s chief executive, Steve Brown. “This has long been our ambition and demonstrates the RFU’s commitment to growing the women’s game and the belief we have in the future of the sport.“We are at a tipping point for women’s rugby globally and it is our ambition to be world number one and drive growth at every level. As an organisation, from top to bottom, we are very much behind this and want to see the continued expansion and growth to realise the ambitious targets we have set ourselves.”In 2017, there were around 50 players on a mixture of full-time and part-time professional contracts but that was drastically cut after the Women’s World Cup with all the remaining contracts only for sevens players.

Eight grand tour wins later, out of a possible 18, with four different riders, British domination of this side of cycling now seems a given, in the same way that Quickstep Floors are expected to rule the roost in one‑day Classics.In winning the Vuelta by 1min 46sec from the surprise runner-up Enric Mas, Yates has finally confirmed the potential he showed back in 2011. It was a timely leap, as the next generation is waiting in the wings: the American Sepp Kuss, so strong in the first two weeks of his first grand tour, Spain’s Mas, the Colombians Miguel Ángel López and Egan Bernal.Realising potential is rarely as straightforward as a simple improvement graph may suggest, as many can testify, most recently Thibaut Pinot and Romain Bardet. In a three-week tour the transition from targeting a top-10 finish overall, and – as was Yates’s case – the young rider’s jersey to going full-on for an overall win is not to be underestimated. The priority ceases to be that of merely staying in touch but becomes a delicate balancing act: gaining time at key moments while not risking excessive loss, on any given day or in the days that lie ahead.In three months Yates has learned rapidly, given the contrast between the Giro d’Italia, where he signally failed to husband his resources, and the Vuelta, where he managed his strength perfectly for the final week. His ability to read a race and time his move was evident well before he turned professional in 2014 but he has added to that the ability to read himself and his body over three weeks.To achieve this he has had to curb and control the attacking instincts which have made him so exciting to watch over the last five years. “When I find myself on the defensive, it’s quite hard, mentally, to react to people,” he said on Saturday. “You never feel like you have the edge or you get the jump, or you surprise anyone. When you’re more aggressive, and you’re attacking, you get that little bit of momentum, you have that bit of a jump, that bit of surprise, and it makes a big difference.”Compared with this year’s British grand tour winners Froome and Geraint Thomas, Yates has youth on his side, at 26 to Thomas’s 32 and Froome’s 33. Whereas the Team Sky duo can hardly be expected to forge ahead physically now they are entering their mid-30s, Yates should have at least a couple of years before he reaches his potential in 2016 his manager, Matt White, said he expected Yates to improve for perhaps 10 more seasons. Of recent grand tour winners – Fabio Aru and Nairo Quintana, Froome, Tom Dumoulin, Thomas – he is the youngest racing.His Mitchelton-Scott team will also grow stronger the departure of the sprinter Caleb Ewan means they have completed the transition from a sprint and one-day-oriented team into one centred on the grand tours. They will never enjoy Team Sky’s budget, so are unlikely to afford stars such as Michal Kwiatkowski or – in the past – Mikel Landa to use as highly paid team helpers. They will have to keep on boxing clever, and the big test will come when they meet the likes of Dumoulin or Froome on a grand tour course that is less suited to the anarchic racing that marked the 2018 Vuelta.They do, however, have one key asset: Adam Yates. Mitchelton’s masterstroke in the Vuelta was a piece of resource management taken straight from the Team Sky copy-book: the younger Yates twin was allowed two weeks to ride himself into the race following his disappointing Tour de France, and came good just in time to step forward to support his brother in the final few mountain stages.This was the first time the twin double-act had been unleashed on a three-week tour and it worked every bit as well as their performances inidually since 2014 had suggested it would. It has been noted that since they turned professional one twin tends to match, and exceed, any given step ahead taken by the other if this trend is maintained Adam’s big leap forward cannot be far away.Whether or not Adam Yates matches Simon, there is still the prospect of the Bury twins, backed by an Australian squad that boxes clever, taking on Team Sky’s Froome and Thomas and their heavyweight team of all the talents, with Dumoulin and Primoz Roglic waiting in the wings. If it happens in the near future, it will be something to savour.Born 7 August 1992 in Bury, Greater\u0026nbspManchester.Nickname None, although “The Flying Black Pudding” has been suggested.

His outrageous flair, his tenacious captaincy, the fact he refused to wear an alice band. And now, unlike most players-turned-administrators – sorry, Lord Coe and Rob Andrew, but you know it’s true – Pichot is arguably becoming even more likeable in his post as the vice-chairman of World Rugby.Sharply groomed and excellently tailored, Pichot is the Justin Trudeau of sports governance, posting feminist messages on his Instagram feed, flinging himself through the air in martial arts poses while on an official tour of Japan, balancing things on his nose at a board meeting while Bill Beaumont looks on in bovine bemusement. All the while maintaining the renegade spirit that made him such a handful on the pitch.This week he made the drastic and off-brand revelation that the sport he helps oversee is unsustainable in its current form. “The business side of it is not working,” said Pichot. “Is the international game under threat? I think it is.” He signed off with a flourish as dramatic as a Stephen Donald show-and-go. “I’m not going to be an accomplice to rugby’s ruin.”It was typically, irrepressibly honest of Pichot to sever the party line. But it’s no surprise to any contemporary sports fan to hear that the game’s various vested financial interests are encircling the goose that lays the golden eggs with a fistful of cutlery and a greedy look. Or, indeed, that the sport that they love is, quite possibly, doomed.Let’s face it, it’s a rare sport that hasn’t been through an existential crisis in recent years. From athletics to cycling and tennis to Formula One, we’ve seen almost every major sport display some pretty ugly cracks as the direct and indirect result of the massive financial pressures that now dominate the global games. Corruption, doping, match-fixing, exploitation: these are what happens when everyone wants a piece of the action, when victory is so rewarding yet increasingly costly to achieve.Even as the worldwide sports industry has expanded beyond CC Pyle and Kerry Packer’s wildest fantasies, the fight to stake a claim in it has becoming increasingly fraught. The bid for attention and funding – not to mention that all-important “shareholder value” – is as competitive an endeavour as kicking a ball or crossing a finish line. Everyone is desperate to make themselves more attractive to the twin sugar daddies of broadcast rights and brand sponsorship.Cricket, in particular, has been reinventing itself ever since football started cannibalising its traditional summer audience. From the Test championship to day-night games to Twenty 20, the sport has willingly undergone all sorts of cosmetic surgery to keep it young and attractive. It is constantly lopping bits of itself off, making itself leaner, shorter, less intimidating to potential partners.From the alarming messages that both the cricket authorities and some fans like to emit, you could infer that the game was in imminent danger of ceasing to exist altogether – of disappearing into the ether like, say, bar billiards or jousting. Perhaps they picture an apocalyptic horror where players and umpires are suddenly raptured away. And all that is left are a gaggle of groundsmen, memories wiped, drifting slowly around the greensward on their zombie rotavators.But this panic doesn’t exist because the sport is running out of money – it’s richer than it ever has been. And the fact that other sports are undergoing similar, simultaneous identity crises is an intriguing one. Not least, of course, because many have only had pretensions to professionalism in the last half-century. And yet, in that brief time, capitalism’s growth imperative has become central to their self-worth and their perceived value. If a sport is not winning more converts, or at the very least holding on to those it already has, then it is de facto failing.It does make you wonder what all this says about what sport represents in the 21st century. Organised sport has meant a great deal of different things throughout history. In ancient Greece it taught its adherents physical discipline and promoted the concept of excellence. In medieval times sports were war games, preparing soldiers with the skills they’d need for battle. The Victorians used them to spread the gospel of fair play Pierre de Coubertin inaugurated the modern Olympic Games to promote world peace.Modern-day sport doesn’t need to drill us for combat, and this generation has probably seen too much to believe in fair play. But if it is educating its followers in anything, it’s how to manage resources and interpret a balance sheet. It would certainly explain why fantasy leagues are so popular, and why football’s transfer deadline day, and the NFL draft, are as much-hyped as the games they precede.And those aren’t necessarily bad things. It just seems a little ironic that this coincides with a time when sports are contorting themselves in any and every direction to make themselves more appealing and relevant (and, in cricket’s case, more comprehensible) to new “markets”. Because, at times, it can feel like you need a business degree to really understand what’s going on with your team. And that might just be the most offputting factor of all."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/49cf2bf7225bf136c05296a7d2b4cad8a5fb0a12/0_144_3000_1801/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aadb560f6b9dc05011d81eb69869ce12","title":"vontae davis retires halftime nfl scores","story":"The Bills cornerback walked away from a multi-million dollar contract on his own terms: at half-time in Sunday’s lossThe rigors of training camp bring enlightenment for many football players. That’s the most grueling portion of the NFL schedule for veterans who must put their body, year after year, through the grind prior to kickoff.It’s a time when many aging veterans realize they no longer want to sacrifice their bodies after millions earned and plenty of accolades racked up. Some players realize they no longer have the desire to train non-stop and diet after the season concludes.Others make the decision in the summer as camp grows near and they contemplate the gauntlet they’ll have to endure. Vontae Davis walked a very different path to his own epiphany Sunday.Now 30 years old, and armed with a five-year, $1m contract signed with the Buffalo Bills in March, the cornerback suddenly lost his desire to play football and wasted no time. The former first-round pick retired abruptly Sunday. Not before the game. Not after the game. When the clock hit zero to end the second quarter, with his Bills trailing the Los Angeles Chargers 28-6, Davis entered the home locker room at Ralph Wilson Stadium and walked over to his locker. He removed his glossy white helmet with the red buffalo emblazoned on it, shed his shoulder pads, unstrapped his gloves, and quickly changed into civvies. Davis was spent.Before any of his teammates knew what was transpiring, Davis had fled Orchard Park and was headed home.Moments earlier, the former Pro Bowl corner gleefully celebrated a pass breakup. Now, he was done with the game for good.“This isn’t how I pictured retiring from the NFL,” the brother of Washington tight end Vernon Davis said in a statement released on social media.“But in my 10th NFL season, I have been doing what my body has been programmed to do: Get ready to play on game day. I’ve endured multiple surgeries and played through many different injuries throughout my career and, over the last few weeks, this was the latest physical challenge.“But today on the field, reality hit me fast and hard: I shouldn’t be out there anymore.“I meant no disrespect to my teammates and coaches. But I hold myself to a standard. Mentally, I always expect myself to play at a high level. But physically, I know today that isn’t possible, and I had an honest moment with myself. While I was on the field, I just didn’t feel right, and I told the coaches, ‘I’m not feeling like myself.’“I also wondered: Do I want to keep sacrificing?And truthfully, I do not because the season is long, and it’s more important for me and my family to walk away healthy than to willfully embrace the warrior mentality and limp away too late.“This was an overwhelming decision, but I’m at peace with myself and my family. I choose to be grateful to God for allowing me to play the game that I have loved as a boy until I turned 30 years old. I choose to be grateful to God for being a part of the NFL and making lifelong friends over the last decade. There were roadblocks and pitfalls along the way, but I am grateful to God for all of it because he doesn’t promise any of us an easy journey.“Lastly, I am grateful to God for what he has in store for me ahead, in this next chapter of my life.”The question that remains unanswered: why now? Why not wait until the contest ended? For even though Davis says he meant no disrespect to his teammates, that’s exactly what he showed them. And he’ll be hard-pressed to ever be accepted into another locker room if he ever decides to reverse course and pursue another NFL job.“I never have seen that,” said Bills linebacker Lorenzo Alexander, a Pro Bowl selection last season. “Pop Warner, high school, pros – never heard of it. Never seen it.“It’s just completely disrespectful to his teammates. ... He didn’t say nothing to nobody. I found out going into the second half of the game. They said he’s not coming out he retired. That’s it.” Football is a dangerous game, and if your heart’s not in it, the risks only grow. Everyone has the right to walk away on their own terms. But Davis didn’t take into consideration the feelings of his teammates or even the guidelines that dictate basic decency. With increasing frequency, players are hanging up their helmets at earlier career junctures citing the physical toll the gridiron takes on their bodies. The concussion debate isn’t going away – nor should it – and participation in youth football is down across the board.Davis’s abrupt retirement not only caught the ire of his teammates, but also players – but past and present – around the league.But there are surely players out there who are also second-guessing their football futures. And if Davis is willing to walk away in the middle of a contest, it might spur them to retire on their own terms, too.Patrick Mahomes: The second-year signal caller lit up the Chargers in Week 1, and it was no fluke. This guy is for real. He passed for six touchdowns on 23 of 28 passing for 326 yards to lead the Kansas City Chiefs over the Pittsburgh Steelers, 42-37. His 10 TDs in the first two games of the season are an NFL record. And these aren’t simply glossy numbers. It’s the way Mahomes is doing the job. His laser-guided throws are delivered with equal parts zip and accuracy. Mahomes’ field awareness belies his 23 years (and three career starts). He loves to take shots down field and is able to drop passes over defenders into tight windows.With an array of weapons at his disposal – outside speedster Tyreke Hill and All-Pro tight end Travis Kelce over the middle – Mahomes will continue to rack up impressive stats. The No 10 overall draft choice from Texas Tech is a budding star in a quarterback-driven league, and he’s just getting started.19. The mind-boggling amount of field-goal attempts that missed their mark in Week 2. Minnesota Vikings kicker Daniel Carlson could be out of a job after he went 0-for-3, including an errant try from 35 yards that would have topped the Green Bay Packers in overtime. “It feels terrible. Obviously, I let my team down,” said Carlson, a fifth-round pick whom the Vikings traded up to draft in April. “That last one was probably more just confidence after missing twice early. That’s frustrating. That shorter one I should never miss like that.”Zane Gonzalez turned in an even worse performance. The Cleveland Browns kicker yanked two field goals – and two extra points – in a 21-18 loss to the New Orleans Saints.He had a chance to earn redemption, but couldn’t convert a 52-yarder that would have sent the game to overtime. Gonzalez also had a 43-yarder blocked in overtime of Week 1, and the Browns once again remain winless.With quality options like Dan Bailey waiting for a call, it should be a busy week for veteran free agent kickers.Last season, the claim was that the Jacksonville Jaguars won in spite of Blake Bortles. But in a rematch of the AFC championship game from January, it was Bortles who put the team on his back. When the Jags desperately needed a first down to chew clock, there was Bortles breaking out the spin move on a 10-yard scamper as New England Patriots corner Jonathan Jones met him at the sticks. He rushed six times for 35 yards. Bortles was fantastic in the air, too, during the 31-20 victory. He passed for 377 yards with four touchdowns and one interception. Star running back Leonard Fournette missed the game with a hamstring injury, but the offense didn’t miss a beat. If Bortles can continue to conjure up some magic, the Jags and their stingy defense look like an early-season favorite to make the trip to Atlanta come February. “I have so many emotions running through as far as just what a terrible call it was. ... I thought I hit him within his waist, his chest. I got my head across, put my hands down. To call it at that point of the game is just unbelievable.“You see how it changed the game, and I know there’s an emphasis on protecting quarterbacks, but it’s gotten out of control here. I don’t know what else to do.” – Green Bay Packers pass rusher Clay Matthews on the roughing the passer call that gave the Minnesota Vikings new lifeReally, what else could Matthews do? It was far from a violent hit, but referee Tony Corrente saw it differently he ruled that Matthews illegally lifted Kirk Cousins and placed his body weight on the QB.The call negated the interception made by Jaire Alexander with under two minutes remaining and extended the Vikings’ march to tie the game. That’s exactly what Cousins did eight plays later with an incredible touchdown toss to Adam Thielen.• Is Jamies Winston going to be under center when he returns from suspension in Week 4? Not if Ryan Fitzpatrick continues his stunning play. The veteran backup dazzled for the second consecutive week and it led to another upset win for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. FitzMagic passed for 402 yards and four touchdowns in the 27-21 victory over the Philadelphia. Last week, it was the 35-year-old with 417 yards and four touchdowns over the Saints. He sports a near-perfect 151.5 passer rating, and if he can come close to replicating this play in Week 3, Winston might have to grow accustomed to the visor and clipboard look. • The Los Angeles Rams stomped the Arizona Cardinals in a 34-0 shutout. The Cards generated just five first downs along with 137 yards to 432 for the Rams. Todd Gurley’s bunch was pegged as a Super Bowl favorite heading into the campaign, and with Brandin Cooks off to the races in his new uniform, it’s easy to see why.• Jon Gruden, back roaming the sideline for the Oakland Raiders, was sharply panned for his pre-season trade of elite pass rusher Khalil Mack to the Chicago Bears. After another blown lead – and a loss – the criticism is only growing louder. Derek Carr bounced back with a big showing, but the Raiders allowed a last-second field goal from the rival Denver Broncos to lose 20-19."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/06f4504946663fddf9734ca4cb1d8aaad28dc8e3/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=51b1ba083174016cfa7c1cae0ed9e956","title":"rugby union talking points from the premiership weekend action","story":"Exeter’s strength in depth shines through, Northampton loves Taqele Naiyaravoro, and Aled Brew ‘won’t be doing that again’Sunday’s thriller in Coventry had something for everyone, not least those arguing about what constitutes foul play nowadays. The red card shown to the lofty Will Spencer for a high hit on the smaller Tommy Taylor not only changed this game but prompted Leicester’s acting head coach Geordan Murphy to suggest intent should be factored into such judgments. “I’m not sure what players and coaches they’re consulting,” said Murphy. “It’s a gentleman’s sport isn’t it – you know if you deserve a red card, if you’ve done something to really break someone. Across the Premiership every week I see players being hit high and across the shoulder, swinging arms and seatbelt tackles that are sometimes refereed and sometimes aren’t. Consistency is key.” His Wasps’ opposite number Dai Young suspects there will be plenty of other similar incidents this season. “People are training throughout the week to tackle lower, but it’s not going to go away,” said Young. “These incidents are going to happen and unfortunately they will have bearings on games. I am sure there will be times this year when we don’t come out the right side of it.” Robert KitsonNot many sides could cope with losing two England back-rows as comfortably as Exeter made do without Sam Simmonds and Matt Kvesic – both ruled out through illness on Saturday morning – against Sale. It is a measure of the squad Rob Baxter has been compiling at Sandy Park that Sam Lonsdale and Tom Lawday, as comparatively unheralded as they may be, stood up to the task. There were also first starts of the season for the 21-year-old half‑backs Joe Simmonds and Jack Maunder, who was replaced by his 18-year-old brother, Sam, with five minutes remaining. As more clubs are increasingly willing to turn to young players this season – a result of slimmer squads brought about by salary increases – it would appear Exeter are benefiting from having already done so. Gerard MeagherWith eight minutes to go, Chris Cook ran clear to score what seemed at first to be Bath’s sixth try. Several metres behind him, Aled Brew ran a “support line”, which blocked the chasing Nathan Earle. First impressions were that it was fine – Earle was nowhere near and Brew can run in support if he wants. But Brew looked over his shoulder and changed his line according to where Earle was. By the end, the feeling was that Brew’s intervention was so unnecessary and annoying he deserved to be penalised, which he was after a review by the television match official. “He won’t be doing that again,” Todd Blackadder, the Bath director of rugby, said darkly. Michael AylwinThe Northampton crowd quickly took to the Australia wing Taqele Naiyaravoro on his club debut. Standing at a few feathers under 20st, with his first touch of the ball he barged through a challenge before an over-the-shoulder off-load and with his second left Alex Lewington sprawling before Billy Vunipola was dumped to the ground after giving what was by then a runaway dump truck his best shot. Otherwise, Naiyaravoro was unemployed as Northampton struggled to work the ball into space. The Saints’ director of rugby, Chris Boyd, does not want to use the second-heaviest player in his squad as a battering ram, preferring to have room so that he can keep moves alive. Change takes time, but there were signs of Boyd’s influence in Northampton’s first try. It came from a scrum and left the best defence in the league outwitted. The effort is there, but the difference with Saracens was their presence of mind in broken play. PRNew Zealand’s failure to attempt a drop goal in the final minute in Wellington that would have beaten South Africa highlights the declining value of the three points. Freddie Burns kicked the first in the Premiership for Bath on Saturday, one of only four players to kick one in the league last season. There have only been 16 drop goals kicked in the 190 Tests involving tier one nations since the last World Cup, but the drama of Jonny Sexton’s winning drop goal in Paris last February still resonates. Was Beauden Barrett watching?Exeter are at the top of the table after the opening three rounds having, like Saracens, harvested five points from their opening three matches. There is a touch of the All Blacks about the Chiefs, not so much in the way they play the game as in their obsession with tries rather than penalties. Their 16 kicks this season have all been conversions: 17 tries and no penalties. Seven trumps three.Cardiff Blues bubbled with optimism at the start of the season, but their opening three matches have all ended in defeat. They blew leads late on against Leinster, Treviso and Zebre to lose by one, two and two points respectively. They lost their first three last season, but recovered to win the European Challenge Cup."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3e91af8238e2be9ee4d1b7d3d87e09f11441cbed/0_425_4632_2779/master/4632.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=35d99b154372d1945a25d28eef54411e","title":"amazon investigates claims staff are leaking data for bribes","story":"Employees are offering confidential information to sellers, according to reportAmazon is investigating claims that employees have taken bribes for leaking confidential sales information, particularly in China, as it battles to stamp out fake reviews and other seller scams.Employees are offering internal data, via intermediaries, to independent merchants selling their products on the site to help them increase their sales in return for payments, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing sellers, brokers and people familiar with internal investigations.The practice violates company policy and is common in China, where the number of sellers is soaring and Amazon employees are paid relatively small salaries.Amazon confirmed it was conducting a “thorough investigation” of the claims. “We hold our employees to a high ethical standard and anyone in violation of our code faces discipline, including termination and potential legal and criminal penalties,” it said.“In addition, we have zero tolerance for abuse of our systems and if we find bad actors who have engaged in this behaviour, we will take swift action against them, including terminating their selling accounts, deleting reviews, withholding funds and taking legal action.”Brokers for Amazon employees in Shenzhen are offering internal sales data and reviewers’ email addresses, as well as a service to delete negative reviews and restore banned Amazon accounts, in exchange for payments ranging from $80 (£61) to more than $2,000, the Journal reported.It said Amazon was also investigating incidents in the US where employees were suspected of accepting bribes.About half of the items sold on Amazon come from third-party sellers, who compete with Amazon’s own service.

Should everyone just stop scrolling?When 24-year-old fashion blogger Scarlett Dixon posted a picture of herself having breakfast, the internet turned nasty. “The best of days start with a smile and positive thoughts. And pancakes. And strawberries. And bottomless tea,” Dixon wrote on her scarlettlondon Instagram feed, under an image of her looking flawless on a freshly made bed flanked by heart-shaped helium balloons.The sponsored post – for Listerine mouthwash, a bottle of which is visible on the side of the shot – was swiftly reposted on Twitter. “Fuck off this is anybody’s normal morning,” wrote Nathan from Cardiff. “Instagram is a ridiculous lie factory made to make us all feel inadequate.” His post, which has garnered more than 111,000 likes (22 times as many as Dixon’s original) and almost 25,000 retweets, prompted a wave of criticism, with the more printable comments ranging from “Fakelife!” and “Bunny-boiler” to “Let’s pop her balloons” and “Who keeps Listerine on their bedside table? Serial killers, that’s who.”That hostility feels par for the course on Twitter. The social network is a notorious hotbed of abusive strangers hurling abuse at other abusive strangers, who then all occasionally come together to bully a celebrity off the internet over some minor failing, such as being a woman in a Star Wars film. Instagram, by contrast, looks like the friendliest social network imaginable. It’s a visually led community where the primary method of interaction is double-tapping an image to like it, where posts that go viral tend to do so because of positivity rather than outrage and where many of the biggest accounts are famous dogs and cats. What’s not to like?But, for a growing number of users – and mental health experts – the very positivity of Instagram is precisely the problem. The site encourages its users to present an upbeat, attractive image that others may find at best misleading and at worse harmful. If Facebook demonstrates that everyone is boring and Twitter proves that everyone is awful, Instagram makes you worry that everyone is perfect – except you.In the days following her initial Instagram post, Dixon pointed out the irony that this fear – that the unreality of social media is harming people – was itself being used to justify the thousands attacking her.“Each time I refresh my page, hundreds of new nasty messages pour on to my Instagram, Twitter and YouTube, some of which have contained malicious death threats,” she wrote in a follow-up Instagram post, accompanying a picture of her in Venice with an ice-cream. “There are now hundreds of thousands of tweets circling the internet, shaming me.”“My feed isn’t a place of reality,” Dixon added. “I mean who spends their time in such a beautiful city, perched on a ledge, ice-cream in hand and smile permanently affixed to her face? It’s staged, guys.“I personally don’t think my content is harmful to young girls, but I do agree Instagram can present a false expectation for people to live up to.”But whether or not Dixon’s feed is harmful, there is growing support for the idea that Instagram isn’t great for its users’ mental health.In 2017, the Royal Society for Public Health (RSPH), an independent charity that seeks to improve people’s wellbeing, conducted a UK-wide survey of 14- to 24-year-olds, asking them about the big five social media platforms: Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, Snapchat and Instagram. Users ranked how their use of the platforms affected everything from the quality of their sleep to their Fomo – the fear of missing out on what others are enjoying.Instagram came last, scoring particularly badly for its effects on sleep, body image and Fomo. Only Snapchat came close in its overall negativity, saved by a more positive effect on real-world relationships, while YouTube scored positively on almost every metric – except its effect on sleep, for which it was the worst of all the platforms.“On the face of it, Instagram can look very friendly,” says the RSPH’s Niamh McDade. “But that endless scrolling without much interaction doesn’t really lead to much of a positive impact on mental health and wellbeing. You also don’t really have control over what you’re seeing. And you quite often see images that claim to be showing you reality, yet aren’t. That’s especially damaging to young men and women.”The risk of developing an unhealthy body image is often highlighted, but McDade emphasises that this is just one aspect. “Some people may be looking at feeds full of cars, and it’s giving them anxiety and depression as they can’t afford them.”For Stephen, a 24-year-old from London, the unreality led him to develop unhealthy behaviours online. “I was going through a bit of heartbreak at the time,” he says, “and any experience of seeing my ex’s name on Instagram killed me. I was pretty down and found myself predominantly using Instagram to either ‘punish’ myself by looking at my ex, or using the browse feature to distract me. I found myself looking at attractive women a lot when they’d come up in the browse feature, which would then cause more to be shown.“The problem with Instagram is that you, almost exclusively, share content that is meant to reflect positively on yourself,” he says. “On Twitter or Facebook, you see much more content that isn’t, ‘Hey, look at my great life.’”Almost every user adds fuel to the flames. Even as we’re being made miserable by the unreal lives that we follow, we share an unreal version of our own lives. “I have been on Instagram since 2013 and in the beginning I enjoyed it,” says Adnan, a 25-year-old Syrian who lives in Cape Town. “But, as the years passed, it changed from being a friendly environment, where most people posted food pictures, into a competitive social platform where everyone filters out their lives to represent a life that does not exist. Nobody looks good all the time, nobody is always happy. When things get tough, I get really upset when I see other people having the ‘perfect’ life.” And yet, Adnan says, “I am also guilty of trying to show the best side of my life to people.”But Instagram has always been about looking flawless. What has changed to spark such a backlash? Among users I spoke to, one event was cited time and again: the introduction, in mid-2016, of Instagram’s algorithmic timeline. It was one of the largest changes to the platform since it was bought by Facebook in 2012. Rather than presenting users with a cross-section of what the people they were following were up to at any given moment, Instagram began populating feeds with the most noteworthy posts from those accounts, often reaching back days or even weeks to pull in particularly compelling content. In effect, the service began promoting a curated, unrealistic version of an already curated, unrealistic feed.Talya Stone, a parenting blogger at Motherhood: The Real Deal, went cool on Instagram shortly afterwards. “For a long time, Instagram was one of the only places where the interaction felt real,” she says. “Then the algorithm came along and blew that out of the water. The whole point of these social platforms is that they are supposed to enhance social connectivity – yet, bizarrely, they are based on an algorithm that seems to be working against this very notion.”Victoria Hui, who runs the lifestyle blog the Lust Listt, says there is another issue affecting “pro” Instagram users – those who make a living (or hope to) from advertising and sponsorship. “The new algorithm creates a popularity contest between creators, so that they resort to unethical business decisions in order to keep themselves at the top of the food chain.”Unscrupulous creators started buying followers, likes and comments in an attempt to fool the algorithm as Instagram clamped down on that, Hui says, those users formed secret “comment pods” conspiring to share “each and every post with each other in order to generate ‘authentic’ and immediate engagement”.While influencers such as Dixon often get the lion’s share of the blame for the epidemic of unreality on Instagram, it’s just as prevalent at the grassroots as it is among the “Insta-celebrities”.I stopped using the app earlier this year, when I realised that I reliably felt worse after opening it than I did before I started. But my Instagram – a locked account, with just a couple of hundred followers and posts – is almost exclusively for keeping in touch with people I got to know in other ways. The closest I get to following influencers is the pop star Carly Rae Jepsen and an Instagram-famous husky.Still, every time I open the app, I’m presented with an endless feed of my friends and family doing incredible things, having a wonderful time, without me.There’s the friend whose wedding I wasn’t invited to I found out about it through the app. There’s the friend who is looking fantastic after every workout and lets us all know. And there’s the friend who lives in New York, apparently over in London for the weekend without telling me.Meanwhile, I’m doing nothing of note – except sitting on Instagram. At least I don’t suffer the same from the adverts. Because of a glitch in my privacy settings, Instagram believes I am a Bangkok teenager and serves me nothing but adverts written in Thai for acne cures and KFC. This is not a joke.When I tell friends about my dissatisfaction with the app, their responses are mixed. Some cite conventional wisdom, telling me to unfollow the influencers with a commercial imperative to sell me a perfect life and devote the app to keeping up with the friends I care about. Rob, for instance, follows “fewer than 100 people, all family and friends”.But I don’t follow any influencers, and the friends I care about most are the ones most likely to create that familiar pang of Fomo.Others offer exactly the opposite advice, arguing that my problem is not following enough influencers. I should focus less on using Instagram to find out what people I care about are doing and more on using it as a source of information and inspiration. One friend, Lynsey, cites Present and Correct, which sells exquisitely designed office supplies, as her go-to happy place. Another, Marie, recommends her personal mix of “roughly one-third friends, one-third MPs and one-third drag queens”.It’s true that there is a whole world of information best communicated in a visual medium. While some fitness-focused Instagrams leave you feeling like a fat blob of plasticine, others are sources of useful advice, laser-targeted at people in your situation.But I’ve tried that version of Instagram, too, and I worry that it provides only a veneer of engagement, while forever hovering on the precipice of impossibly perfect breakfasts eaten by impossibly perfect people. Even Facebook, Instagram’s owner, warns against using its products in this way. “In general,” the company wrote on its corporate blog last year, “when people spend a lot of time passively consuming information – reading but not interacting with people – they report feeling worse afterward”.Of course, Facebook’s answer was that everyone should post more. But it would say that, wouldn’t it? Another option is to follow the guidance of the RSPH. As part of “scroll-free September” the charity is encouraging users to aim for anything between complete cold turkey and simply stopping at certain times, such as in the bedroom or during meals.There is one final possibility, proposed by a few others when I shared my own Insta-woes: don’t give up on Instagram, just give up on people.There are enough dogs, cats, birds, otters and ferrets to fill a social network of their own – from Jiro the otter to Gotcha the cockatoo – and it’s very hard to scroll through pet Instagram and feel bad about yourself.Though you may start wishing for a more photogenic labradoodle.For more information and advice on issues with social media, go to the RSPH: rsph.org.uk"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cefd3a059cb09c629a09e2cc6e59c05a37b94ddf/0_284_3114_1869/master/3114.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a1ce58d31a3a21e22f42fc0e134a8e85","title":"locals guide to riga latvia 10 top tips biennale","story":"Small, green and beautiful, Riga is big on architectural styles, from art deco to rococo, and edgy art spaces that are currently hosting the city’s first biennale The family-owned Neiburgs design hotel is in a beautiful art deco building on acobbled street in Riga’s pretty old town.

She is willing to do whatever it takes to get her story forth.”Ford’s decision to come forward has plunged Kavanaugh’s nomination into uncertainty. The committee was due to hold a vote on his nomination on Thursday but Democrats have called for a delay. Two Republicans on the panel – Jeff Flake of Arizona and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina – have said Ford should be heard.Flake told Politco he was “not comfortable” voting to advance Kavanaugh’s nomination without hearing first from Ford. His opposition could derail the committee vote.Graham said the vote should not be delayed. “If the committee is to hear from Ms Ford, it should be done immediately,” he said in a statement.In a statement, the Republican chair, Chuck Grassley, said it was “disturbing” that “uncorroborated allegations from more than 35 years ago, during high school, would surface on the eve of the committee vote”. But later on Sunday a spokesman for the committee said the chairman was working to set up phone calls with Ford and Kavanaugh before the Thursday vote.Dianne Feinstein, the ranking Democrat on the committee, said: “There’s a lot of information we don’t know and the FBI should have the time it needs to investigate this new material. Staff calls aren’t the appropriate way to handle this.”Before the accusation surfaced, Republicans had been confident Kavanaugh would sail through the Senate even without support from Democrats.The only outstanding question was the support of two Republicans: Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska. Both have come under immense pressure from liberal organizations who fear Kavanaugh would overturn the Roe v Wade 1973 decision that legalized abortion. How Ford’s accusation will affect their decision remains unclear.Ford, who is 51 and a research psychologist at Palo Alto University in Northern California, came forward publicly on Sunday in an interview with the Washington Post. She described an incident she says happened in the early 1980s.In the interview, she alleges that Kavanaugh and a friend – both “stumbling drunk” – corralled her into a bedroom at a party. Kavanaugh then pinned her on a bed, she said, groping her and placing his hand over her mouth. Ford said she was able to escape only when the friend jumped on top of them.Kavanaugh has “categorically and unequivocally” denied the allegation.“I did not do this back in high school or at any time,” he said in a statement provided by the White House, which has sought cast the judge as a champion for women.As the allegation surfaced late last week, a pro-Kavanaugh letter was published on Friday, signed by 65 women who stated that he had always “behaved honorably and treated women with respect”. The letter appears to have been orchestrated by confirmkavanaugh, a website funded by the Judicial Crisis Network, which relies upon undisclosed donations and has spent millions on campaigns to get conservatives into judicial positions.The friend named in the piece, the writer Mark Judge, said he had “no recollection” of the alleged events.A spokesman for the White House would not say whether Kavanaugh knew Ford.On Monday, White House adviser Kellyanne Conway told Fox \u0026amp Friends she had “spoken with the president. I have spoken with Senator Graham and others. This woman will be heard.”Katz declined to tell NBC whether Ford, registered Democrat, believes Kavanaugh’s nomination should be withdrawn. But she noted that her client had not wanted to come forward publicly and did so only after the accusations began to circulate late last week.“This is not a politically motivated action,” Katz said. “In fact she was quite reluctant to come forward.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b601e790afa54c5677eee4e1cdc49aa9f4ae29ac/0_46_1837_1102/master/1837.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8e90a50a1ae0327555b73cfc56748edf","title":"squirrels tail vets untangle knot rodents wisconsin","story":"Wildlife centre operates to save animals’ tails that became entwined with each other and their nestIt was the worst of times for five juvenile grey squirrel siblings in the US state of Wisconsin when their tails became potentially fatally entangled with grass, plastic and each other.The rodents became trapped in the nest their mother had built, after their tails worked themselves into a giant knot.A “caring finder” found the infants, known as kits, and took them to the Wildlife Rehabilitation Centre at the Wisconsin Humane Society.“You can imagine how wiggly and unruly (and nippy!) this frightened, distressed ball of squirrelly energy was, so our first step was to anaesthetise all five of them at the same time,” the centre wrote on its Facebook page.With the animals out cold, the centre began work to unravel the “Gordian Knot” of tightly tangled tails and nest material.“It was impossible to tell whose tail was whose, and we were increasingly concerned because all of them had suffered from varying degrees of tissue damage to their tails caused by circulatory impairment,” the centre said.After about 20 minutes of careful cutting the knot began to undo and the squirrels were left to recover from their anaesthetic.“Now, one day later, they are all bright-eyed, and three of the five are ‘bushy-tailed’, but we’ll need to monitor all of them for a couple of days to watch for tail necrosis caused by impaired blood flow,” the centre said.Grey squirrels are members of the rodent family can grow up to 50cm (21 inches) in length.

They were allowed to wait in the lobby until the staff ordered them to leave and police forcibly ejected them.Bizarre video footage posted online shows police carrying the group outside, while the son yells in English: “This is killing. This is killing.” Another clip shows the three lying on the ground crying loudly while the mother wails in Chinese: “Save me.”The Chinese embassy in Sweden said on Saturday that China’s ministry of foreign affairs and the embassy had “made solemn representations” to the Swedish government “stressing that what the police had done severely endangered the life and violated the basic human rights of the Chinese citizens.”The incident comes as ties between China and Sweden have come under pressure. The Dalai Lama, the Tibetan spiritual leader who Beijing considers a violent separatist, visited Sweden last week, and China continues to hold Gui Minhai, a Chinese-born Swedish citizen and book publisher, in custody.News of the altercation has attracted widespread attention in China where the search term “Chinese tourists mistreated by Swedish police” has received more than 130m views and 85,000 posts on the microblog Weibo. Discussion of the incident has turned into a debate about the behaviour of Chinese tourists at home and abroad.“This is shameful. The image of China has been disgraced in the hands of these people,” one Weibo user wrote. “The Dalai Lama visits Sweden and the foreign ministry uses this incident as a pretext to make a fuss. That’s more embarrassing than the performance of this family,” another wrote.“These people feel the world should move around them, if not, then they lie down on ground and scream for help,” one commentator wrote in an essay posted on WeChat.Zeng told the Global Times he had asked the hostel to let his parents, who are elderly with health problems, stay until their room was available. The staff refused and called police to remove them.“I broke down and lost my mind,” Zeng said. “I was not able to think whether it was appropriate or not. I just wanted to denounce the police and seek help from pedestrians.”A manager at the hostel told Swedish newspaper, Aftonbladet, the family had arrived the day before their booking and refused to leave. The hostel said staff called police sometime after midnight, when the tourists began to make verbal threats.“We only know that we have done everything we could do for this guest, but at the same time we cannot accept that our staff are exposed to threats and that other guests will suffer from a threatening situation,” the hostel manager said, according to Aftonbladet.Additional reporting by Wang Xueying"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/481defb816bcdceef4bf5dc5998958077eb08f59/0_220_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=93ef147cea2e30c8b71bbbbee062d28c","title":"french elysee shop sells 350000 of goods in three days","story":"Memorabilia includes Macron mugs and bracelets spelling out liberté, egalité and fraternitéAn online shop selling mugs decorated with the face of the French president, Emmanuel Macron, and €250 (£223) bracelets spelling out liberté, égalité, and fraternité has sold about €350,000 worth of memorabilia in just three days.Officials say a total of 7,320 presidential items have been snapped up since the virtual store opened online for business on Friday, making the average spend just under €48.Sales were boosted by the opening of a pop-up shop in the Elysée’s main courtyard this weekend, where more than 200,000 people took advantage of heritage open days to visit the palace.The catalogue of around 60 items ranging from €2 for a postcard of the president to €250 for a “gold-filled liberty bracelet”, includes more than keyrings, pens and postcard portraits of Emmanuel Macron and French flags.A mug carrying the president’s official portrait costs just under €25, a short white T-shirt embroidered with “Première Dame” costs €55 and a sweatshirt emblazoned “Français” or “Française” across the front will set you back €115.Macron has engaged in a spot of not-so-subtle advertising by sporting one of the store’s more expensive items, a €169 LIP watch with blue, white and red strap.The Elysée, which insists at least half the souvenirs cost less than €15, says it has plans to expand its range. “From 2019, products will be developed under licence by French brands and will be available more widely through their network of shops, sellers and their foreign exports,” it said in a statement.“This larger distribution will give greater exposure to the brand name, to the values of the republic, to French culture and its celebrated savoir faire.”Souvenir sales may save the palace but will do little to deflect claims the president is fostering a personality cult more suited to a monarch than head of a republic, particularly the use of some arcane expression uttered by the president during his campaign on T-shirts.“Is this self-mockery or a personality cult?” asked TV station LCI.Officials rapidly shut down a row over presidential mugs wrongly stamped “Limoges porcelain”, by announcing they were dropping the company selling them.As often with the France’s “cultural exception”, French media insisted the online shop was all in the best possible taste and suggested there was no place for “la camelote” (tat).“If our English neighbours are fond of plates bearing the likeness of Prince Harry, in this case there is, a priori, no kitsch,” LCI’s website said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/82759a4f111eeeb51a2095eb474f58f4a3e61cbc/0_161_3990_2395/master/3990.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5fac860008fce3243693f51a44a43f80","title":"lisbon museum plan stirs debate over portugals colonial past","story":"‘Museum of the Discoveries’ would glorify slavery and other historical abuses, critics sayA campaign pledge to build a museum in Lisbon dedicated to Portugal’s colonial history has sparked a debate over Portuguese national identity, the nature of historical memory and the question of collective guilt.The controversy centres on the so-called Age of the Discoveries – the period starting in the 15th century when expeditions by Portuguese navigators helped the country lay claim to territories stretching from Asia to South America.The period is widely regarded as both the apex of Portuguese history and the bedrock of national identity. But a growing chorus of critics has begun to question it, drawing attention to the crimes committed in the service of Portugal’s colonial project.The current row has its origins in last year’s mayoral campaign, when Lisbon’s incumbent mayor, the socialist Fernando Medina, drew up a list of 25 tasks he hoped to accomplish if re-elected. The list included the idea of building what was initially dubbed the Museum of the Discoveries. The document provided few specifics, giving neither the location nor exact content of the future museum and saying only that the space was to cover the “most and least positive aspects” of the Age of the Discoveries and “include an area dedicated to the topic of slavery”.The proposal went largely unnoticed until April, when more than 100 Portuguese and international academics released an open letter criticising the proposed name as an “obsolete, incorrect expression, filled with wrong-headed meanings”.That letter, which appeared in the Expresso weekly, opened the floodgates for a slew of opinion pieces and TV roundtable debates, with participants coming out for and against both the proposed name and also the very principle of such a museum.“It would only reinforce Portuguese colonial ideology, which portrays that period as heroic and simply glosses over the glaring issues of slavery, mass killings and other abuses,” said Joacine Katar-Moreira, a researcher at the University Institute of Lisbon and co-author of an open letter criticising the proposal that was signed by 100 black activists. “There are already so many statues and monuments paying homage to that moment in history. We don’t need another one, which, like the others, would be an instrument for stroking national self-esteem.”Katar-Moreira and other activists would like to see funds earmarked for the museum put instead towards a monument honouring the victims of slavery.Portugal was the leading player in the Atlantic slave trade, its galleons thought to have transported nearly half of the total 12.5 million enslaved Africans. (The British were a distant second, trading 3.2 million people.) Portugal has, however, long cast itself as the “bom colonizador”, or good coloniser, citing the fact that inter-racial relationships flourished in Brazil and Cape Verde as proof that its colonial practices were somehow “softer” than those of other European powers.Historical evidence refutes such a reading – a point stressed by those who oppose the proposed museum. Other commentators have bristled at the suggestion that Portugal has anything to be ashamed of.“It’s not possible to erase history,” the columnist João André Costa wrote last month in Público newspaper. “It happened. It existed. We can’t go back in time … and we don’t have anything to beat ourselves up about, kneeling for 100 years, with downcast eyes and hearts.”Even the prime minister, António Costa, whose family has its origins in Goa, Portugal’s former colony in India, weighed into the debate. He said in a recent interview: “We mustn’t have a complex, but rather pride in being able to deal, in Portugal, with that period in history when we undoubtedly made our biggest contribution to the world.”The Lisbon authorities have maintained a low profile throughout the debate, except, according to local media reports, to float potential alternative names, said to include the Museum of the Discovery – without the plural – Museum of the Expansion and Voyage Museum. Requests for an interview with Medina went unanswered.With the fate of the museum still unclear, the argument looks likely to continue, stoking a debate many regard as long overdue.“I think it’s a useful debate but I think it needs to happen in a measured way, and not harden into the extreme positions we’ve seen on both sides,” said the director of Público, Manuel Carvalho, who in June wrote an opinion piece entitled The Heavy Burden of Being Portuguese.“I’m completely in favour of us talking about the dark side of the Age of the Discoveries, about the things that weren’t taught to us in school, where we only heard about the heroic side. But you can’t demand a society to change overnight.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f58d669e793a785270ee33c4965bf6b748d18e23/0_0_3500_2330/master/3500.jpg?width=1010\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3bf9903ff186146e2c42edad2e7f26a1 1010w","title":"typhoon mangkhut in pictures","story":"The strongest tropical storm of the year lashes the Philippines and now heads towards China’s southern coast"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3625831.1536683327!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"is ireland a better place to live now than 20 years ago","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t Dublin Port Tunnel: it erts thousands of trucks every day from Dublin city centre Do you think Ireland today is a better place to live than the Ireland of 20 years ago? That was the question Pricewatch asked of Twitter users last Saturday night.We asked it because sometimes reading commentators – professional and otherwise, across all media platforms – you would be forgiven for thinking that things have taken a dramatic turn for the worse in recent years, with vast swathes of society thrown under the bus in the name of progress.By some accounts the late 1990s was a magical time when all was well with our world in terms of healthcare, housing and happiness. Or at least more was well with it than is the case today.But Pricewatch well remembers the 1990s, and it was a long, long way from amazing. By almost every measure Ireland today is a more inclusive, progressive and safer place to live than it once was, and the oppressive control exerted by church and State have been dramatically lessened. People live longer, cars are safer, roads are better, homes – if you are lucky enough to have one – are warmer and food is better and cheaper than it was.All told, our Twitter poll attracted 3,344 votes in just 24 hours. While it was neither scientific or representative it was interesting all the same, and suggested that a significant majority believe things are better now than they once were, with 64 per cent voting yes and 36 per cent rejecting the notion.When we were done with the polling we turned our attention to ways things have improved and ways things have worsened. Here are just some of those ways in absolutely no particular order.Plus: A couple of weeks ago both the north- and south-bound lanes of the Dublin Port Tunnel – it runs under the city from close to the airport to the docks down by what was once known as the Point Depot – were closed after a truck shed its load. Within an hour the city centre was gridlocked as hundreds of articulated lorries – erted from their usual underground route – made their presence known along the quays. It brought back memories of Dublin in the rare auld times when such gridlock was a daily occurrence and heavy goods vehicles were an ugly – and sometimes a lethal – menace. The motorways that snake their way across the State have also made travel faster and safer.Plus: Supermarkets in the 1990s were drab and dull, own-brand products were revolting, and there was literally no chance you would ever find some class of weird flamethrower kit for sale in the middle aisle. Everything started changing in 1998 when Lidl moved into the Irish market. A year later do did Aldi. Growth was slow in the early days as a distrustful nation proved reluctant to swap the branded products they had been reared on for unfamiliar labels. Yet the discounters stuck with it, and built better relationships with Irish suppliers and we are the better for it. Today more than 20 per cent of shoppers go through their doors regularly, and while they are not without their critics they have saved us a lot of money.Plus: Online booking was a thing of the future in the late 1990s and cheap travel was a Superbus to London. Flights to London from Ireland cost £200 (or €450 in today’s money) compared to less than a tenner now. We were under the thumb of travel agents, and had to rely on tiny thumbnail pics in glossy brochures to make our holiday decisions. Today online booking platforms, Trip Advisor and Airbnb have given budget-conscious consumers enormous control of travel plans and prices have tumbled as a result.Minus: More than 10,000 people are homeless. and almost 150,00 children are living in poverty.Minus: A recent Daft.ie report found that average rent in the Republic is €1,304, which is over €560 higher than in 2011 and more than 26 per cent higher than the high point during the Celtic Tiger years. Rents grew by 12.4 per cent in the year to June as stock remains the lowest on record. In Dublin rents are 34 per cent, or almost €500 a month, higher than the previous high. While figures from the Residential Tenancies Board are less gloomy, showing average rents nationally at €1,060 per month, up by just over 7 per cent year-on-year and €1,527 in Dublin, up 7.7 per cent year-on-year, they are still incredibly bleak.Minus: Airbnb might be great for finding holiday homes on the cheap but it is exacerbating the rental and homelessness crisis. The company recorded 640,000 “guest” stays in Ireland during the summer, which it said would bring in about €57 million to the Irish economy. But with so many properties across Ireland, especially in urban areas, used exclusively for short-term Airbnb rentals, medium and long-term renters are struggling to get a look-in. How bad is it? Very bad. According to daft.ie more than half of the available rental properties in Dublin are being listed as short-term tourist lets. In May the site said it had 1,258 properties available for long-term rental. On the same day, the independent monitoring website Inside Airbnb showed the stock of Dublin properties to let on Airbnb from professional listers, as opposed to people temporarily renting their own homes, stood at 1,419. The Government has promised to introduce some kind of regulation or licensing of short-term renting – such as via Airbnb. Cities such as Berlin and Amsterdam already limit the amount of time for which properties can be rented on such short-term arrangements.Plus: All told, 89 per cent of the Irish population now have access to broadband, with the vast majority using smartphones to go online, according to recent figures from the Central Statistics Office (CSO). While the number of households with an high-speed internet connection is unchanged from 2017, it is a 17 per cent jump since 2010 and a jump of around 100 per cent since 1998. When asked what they do online most people say they use the internet for finding information on goods and services, followed by email and reading or downloading online news and accessing social networks. Weirdly, no one in Ireland is looking at pornography, at least according to the CSO figures.Plus: With Spotify, Apple Music, Tidal, Netflix, NowTV, Amazon Prime, Audible, legally grey set-top boxes and plain illegal downloads at our fingertips, we have never had so much music, films, television and literature available to us at such a low cost.Plus: Everything from concert tickets and holidays to clothes and food can now be bought in the virtual space. Irish people spent over €5 billion online in 2017, with the spending set to grow to €14 billion by 2021. The choices available to consumers are unparalleled. And the value to be found can be amazing. The ability to take our business elsewhere has also put manners on many retailers who were happy enough to gouge Irish consumers in the past. Not only can things frequently be bought for less online, consumers who shop online have considerably more rights when it comes to returns than those who conduct their business offline.Minus: Of the €5 billion Irish consumers spent online last year, €3 billion was spent overseas. Overseas websites do not employ Irish people, they do not pay taxes here and they contribute nothing to local communities. They also put huge pressure on actual bricks and mortar retailers in the Republic, and if current trends continue more such retailers will have to shut up shop, which could turn our town centres into wastelands.Plus: The popularity of cycling has surged over the last decade and the number of commuting cyclists in Dublin has more than doubled since 2006. That was the year they were at their lowest level since city officials started recording data in 1980 The numbers on their bikes in 2006 was 4,839 compared with 12,447 last year, up 3 per cent on 2016 figures. The numbers in private cars fell 3 per cent last year, according to the National Transport Authority and Dublin City Council’s annual traffic count. The figures also showed that more commuters were using public transport and other “sustainable” transport modes – cycling and walking – than any time since the records began, with a total of 70 per cent of all inbound trips crossing the canal made by sustainable transport. This compared to 61 per cent in 2006.Plus: Public transport-use in Dublin has reached a record level with more than half of all city commuters using buses, trams or trains last year, the highest proportion since records began 40 years ago, and since 2006 car-usage has declined by almost 20 per cent. The Leap card which integrated all public transport has certainly made commuting life easier for people who would rather leave their cars at home.Minus: While many people have managed to escape from the economic calamity that was brought upon us by banks and policy-makers more than a decade ago, many more remain mired in the debt swamp. Tens of thousands of people are in long-term mortgage arrears and continue to be harassed by banks who are unwilling to cut them any slack. The banks are, however, willing to flog many of the most distressed loans at massive discounts to so called “vulture funds”. Last May, David Hall of the Irish Mortgage Holders’ Organisation warned that a “tsunami is coming” with 17,000 mortgage holders vulnerable to having their homes repossessed because of the intransigence of banks and the “cancer” of vulture funds.Minus: A report, released by the Department of Finance last week, projected huge increases in age-related costs in the absence of major policy changes and talk of a pension timebomb grows louder and louder. Rising life expectancy, greater numbers of older people and a fall in the rate of economic growth mean total age-related expenditure will increase significantly and could lead to a rocketing of Ireland’s national debt. It is estimated that just 35 per cent of private sector workers have made any financial provision for their retirement and the rest are relying on the State pension which will involve a dramatic fall in their standard of living when they stop working.Plus: On the plus side people are living longer and healthier lives than at any time in our history, so that has to be a good thing, right?I think the Ireland we love went when the banks took over and put these pawns in place. Leo, Coveney and all that lot. Paul CallianLads, when you look back nostalgia takes over, for all Ireland’s modern day problems (and there will always be problems) we are no longer beholden to the church, the Troubles are gone \u0026amp we are a progressive nation...we just need a new impetus in politics,something fresh and new. Diarmuid McCarthyPeople don’t talk anymore and don’t live beyond their phones, also people get offended to easy. I miss Sundays when everything was closed and you just hang out with family. Slow down and take off the blinkers. Peter Phillips8th repealed, gay marriage, church in retreat, more heterogeneous society, Dublin turning into a real European capital, better infrastructure, awesome hurling, great coffee, superb food. Sean FinlayToo much stress and pressures on people now than ever. People lead superficial lives and social media has a lot to answer for the pressure. Sadly suicide is the highest killer in Ireland today. Better yes in some ways, but I think it’s a lonely place too. Johanna WhyteNo, people cared more for each other, community meant more. Ciaran GogginsNo, it feels more unsafe for some reason, higher crime, city less safe to walk around. Maybe it was because I was young \u0026amp naive. Olga CarryOn the whole it’s better, we still have poverty and inequality and gobshite politicians, but nothing quite as bad as the pre-millennium was, but give it time. Paul BissettWe’re wealthier, more liberal and church influence has declined significantly, housing is better, technology has made our live easier. Proinsias O FoghlúIt is much better in many ways, more modern, nicer food, better coffee, but I can’t afford to live here any more. The rent takes up nearly all my income. Roos DemolI think it’s mainly better because of better technology. Nothing to do with how the country operates. Hospital crisis, homeless crisis, so-called middle and lower class incomes being squeezed into poverty. Colleges fees, national debt, corruption. I’m sure most of this was here before but nowhere on this dreadful scale. Imagine selling extremely badly needed potential social housing but selling them on the cheap to foreign interests at a cost to a taxpayer and then buying them back at a profit to the foreign interest and at a further cost to people. Eugene Mc HughIt’s worse, the people have changed, there’s a feeling of hostility around. No one is allowed to be in the middle, you have to be completely left wing or right wing, and then we have housing, healthcare, banking, crime. Anna JoyceNo....20 years ago I was just out of uni, working, renting and saving with a realistic chance of buying my own house. Didn’t have to go through teen years with cyber bullying, unrealistic insta expectations of what life should be etc. Would not want to be 20 something nowadays. Olivia KingToo few characters to reply but I’ll try: free third level education – didn’t exist when I went to college, I got the grant. Without it I would never ever had had a third level experience. Virtually full employment – I took me 18 months of looking to get my first part-time job. Greater availability of opportunity, greater awareness...I think it’s a pretty good time to be alive. I’m much happier raising my two girls today than if I’d had to do it 20 years ago. I’m 41.

Minister for Foreign affairs Charlie Flanagan will attend the event on Thursday. Minister for Agriculture Michael Creed is also expected to attend.Tickets for the ploughing championships can be purchased upon arrival. Adult tickets cost €20 each while senior citizensstudents cost €15. Children under 12 go free when accompanied by an adult.The main exhibition area at the championships will be open from 9am-6pm each day while the ploughing competitions run from 10.30am-2.30pm. There will be three fashion shows running at 11.30am, 1.30pm and 3.30pm each day of the festival.Highlights over the three days will include sheep shearing, live tractor build, sheep dog trials, loy digging, the meggars competition and the national brown bread baking event. There will also be a junior baking event and funfair for children.Former Great British Bake Off judge Mary Berry will be attending the ploughing championships on Wednesday, September 19th, as a guest judge at the National Dairy Council’s afternoon tea competition. She will sample the baking expertise of three finalists – a home economics teacher, a cardiac physiologist and IT specialist – who will present their cakes to Ms Berry for her assessment.The Department of Foreign affairs has invited visitors to stop by the DFA stand where they can learn about Ireland’s work in the EU, the Irish Aid programme, the consular and passport service and Ireland’s trading relationships overseas.Visitors will be able to apply for a passport direct from the Ploughing with free digital passport photographs available, while there will also be a special section with information on preparations for Brexit. The stand will also mark 25 years of diplomatic relations between Ireland and South Africa.Visitors are advised to travel to the championships by train and walk the 10 minutes from Tullamore train station to the site where a shuttle bus will drop you at the entrance gate. The shuttle bus costs €5 child return, €9 adult return and €20 family return (two adults and max three children).Drivers should factor in at least double the normal journey time due to heavy volumes of traffic. Gardaí have designated eight colour-coded routes to help visitors get to and from the championships. Those travelling northbound on the N8 from CorkMunster should exit at junction 6 and proceed towards Screggan. Visitors on this route will park in the designated blue car parks on the left and right hand sides beside the event grounds.Traffic coming from the south east should travel along the N77 via Durrow and Abbeyleix before arriving in Portlaoise. From there vehicles will be directed through Clonminham, onto the N80 towards Mountmellick and through Rosenallis and Clonaslee. Visitors on this route will park in the designated grey car parks.Traffic coming from the south east will take the N80 towards Portlaoise and will be designated the yellow car park beside the grounds at Screggan. Traffic from Limerick, Kerry and the southwest should take Junction 26 on the M7 and proceed towards Borrisokane and on to Cloghan where they will park in the brown car park.Traffic from Dublin will be designated to the purple car park and traffic from the north will go in the pink car park. The Green car park will cater to visitors from western counties and the orange car park will hold spaces for vehicles travelling from Kildare.There will be wheelchairdisability parking spaces allocated in all car parks as close to the event entrances as possible. Bus parking facilities will also be provided at the event.The site of the ploughing championships is 110km from Dublin, 210km from Cork, 272km from Belfast and 163km from Rosslare.Visitors are also advised to dress appropriately (ie warmly!) for the event and to wear suitable footwear for rough terrain. They can also download the ploughing app for live event and traffic updates.Wet and windy weather is expected to hit the country over the coming days as the downgraded tropical storm Helene crosses over Ireland. Tuesday will begin with sunny spells but rain will extend across the country throughout the afternoon. It will become blustery with moderate to fresh and gusty winds and temperatures of 17 to 20 degrees.Wednesday morning will be wet and windy however the rain is expected to clear through the afternoon.

Photograph: Dara Mac DónaillAs a child, Temera O’Brien dreamed of becoming a teacher. By the time she approached her Leaving Cert, however, the 17-year-old Traveller didn’t think it was going to happen.“The points were too high and I didn’t have higher Irish. I also thought no one of my background would get into teaching, anyway,” she says.Now, thanks to a new access programme, she has been admitted to a third-level teacher-training course.It could see her become one of the first ever primary school teachers from the Travelling community in what research shows is a mostly “white, female and middle-class” profession.She is taking part in Maynooth University’s “turn to teaching” programme, which aims to dismantle barriers faced by marginalised students such as migrants, lone parents and students from disadvantaged schools in entering teaching.“I’m hoping I’ll be a role model for other Travellers,” says O’Brien, from Bray, Co Wicklow. “If I can do it, then other Traveller children will think, ‘why can’t I do it as well?’”Simply getting this far has been an achievement in itself. Travellers are up to 50 times less likely to complete secondary school than the wider community. But for Temera, education has always been seen as a vital stepping stone.“It’s down to my mother and father. Education always came first,” she says.Maynooth University lecturer and former access student, Dr Katriona O’Sullivan, said the programme, along with others, can help “change the face of the Irish classroom”.“Kids dream when they’re four or five. If you’re a young student from a migrant or Traveller background, or go to a Deis school or live in Ballymun, you don’t see anyone like yourself in the classroom. It limits what you think you an do. It’s really important that students see people like themselves.”Entry to the programme involves what Dr O’Sullivan describes as a “rigorous evaluation process” which explores candidates’ academic potential, capacity to communicate, as well as their resilience and motivation.“Everyone that comes on this course has demonstrated high potential and great motivation,” she says.Entrants must complete a year-long foundation course before they take on the four-year primary teaching degree.O’Brien is one of a group who has also completed summer-long grinds in Irish.The road to qualifying as a teacher will be long and challenging – but O’Brien feels she is up to the task.“I’m excited... I’d like to change how teaching is done,” she says. “If there are students from Traveller backgrounds or other minorities, I want to make sure they enjoy school and make sure no one is left behind.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3631963.1537192662!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit tech not on agenda to resolve border impasse says coveney","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe Border problem remains the biggest obstacle to a Brexit deal at a special summit scheduled for mid-November.Brexit negotiators are not contemplating using technology to solve the Border problem, but its use to help simplify checks between Britain and the island is a “different question”, said Tánaiste Simon Coveney on Monday.He was speaking after media reports suggested Brussels is discussing plans to put British officials – rather than EU inspectors – in charge of checking goods heading to Northern Ireland, as part of an attempt to restart stalled talks on the “backstop” plan for the Border.EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier is reported to be looking at the option as part of a move to “de-dramatise” the Border row. It is this issue that remains the biggest obstacle to a Brexit deal at a special summit scheduled for mid-November, according to reports on Monday.Mr Barnier said this month he is willing to consider new ways to solve the problem. This included technical checks aboard vessels or in ports outside Ireland.But Mr Coveney said the discussions were not about using technology to solve the Border question.“Whether technology can help east-west trade is a different question to making the checks as simple and as de-dramatised as possible. But that is a matter for the negotiating teams,” he said. The Tánaiste added that he would not give credit to every report of Brexit developments “because there are lots of different interests competing in relation to the outcomes of these negotiations”.Mr Coveney said “we take our lead from the British prime minister. She has been clear that technology does not solve this problem just like we have been clear that it doesn’t, just like the Brexit committee in Westminster has also been clear that there is no technological solution to the Irish Border question.“From an Irish perspective our position has been very, very clear for the last 12 months and it’s not going to change now.”Meanwhile, British prime minister Theresa May meets the leaders of the other 27 EU member states in the Austrian city of Salzburg this week in an attempt to map a path to an eventual Brexit deal as officials work behind the scenes to resolve the Northern Ireland issue.Mr Barnier will brief ministers of the remaining 27 member states on Tuesday on progress in the negotiations, a note prior to the meeting indicated.“Some parts of the draft withdrawal agreement have already been agreed in principle by the UK and the EU negotiators, although nothing is agreed until everything is agreed,” it said. “There are still parts of the withdrawal agreement that require further negotiation. One of them is the issue of how to avoid a hard Border between Ireland and Northern Ireland.”Under the proposal British officials would carry out limited checks at ports on the UK mainland to reassure Brussels that goods heading to Northern Ireland meet single-market rules. Checks could also be carried out on ferries or at factories on the mainland under “trusted trader” schemes.Mr Barnier told British MPs this month: “We are open to discussing other backstops, so we can discuss this text, we can make changes to it.”Brussels diplomats say Mr Barnier could drop the EU proposal for a joint EU-UK service in Northern Ireland to carry out further checks, relying instead on British officials.At the heart of the discussions is the need to avoid any physical infrastructure to conduct customs and other checks on the Border after Brexit, a move seen as a step backwards in the Northern Ireland peace process.Downing Street is seeking a political declaration on the future EU-UK relationship that states the Irish backstop plan will never be needed and that both sides will negotiate a free-trade area between the EU and the whole UK.However the declaration would not be legally binding. And officials are searching for a legally operative backstop in case no free-trade area is agreed.Britain has proposed a backstop that would keep the entire UK in a customs union with the EU for a limited period, but that has so far been rejected by Brussels.In a tangential development Downing Street has reproved Boris Johnson following his warning that Britain is heading for a “spectacular political car-crash” if the government sticks to Mrs May’s Brexit plans.The former foreign secretary’s warning came as Mrs May gave one of her most positive forecasts yet for Britain’s future after the country’s EU departure. “I believe that our best days are ahead of us,” she told the BBC.Asked in an interview for Panorama why she thought Brexit would be good for Britain, she replied: “It gives the United Kingdom opportunities as an independent and sovereign state to build a better future for all our people.”But Mr Johnson warned that unless Mrs May’s Chequers plan was dropped, Britain was “heading full throttle for the ditch with a total write-off of Brexit”.Requirements for a backstop arrangement at the Border, contained in December’s agreement between Mrs May and European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker, would leave the UK a “vassal state” of the EU, warned Mr Johnson.In his Daily  column Mr Johnson claimed that he and others had been “taken in” over the EU’s fallback option, having been privately assured at the time that it would never be invoked.But Number 10 said Mr Johnson had himself signed up to the joint report agreed by Mrs May and Mr Juncker, including the backstop provision. Moreover, he had remained in government for a further seven months afterwards. – Additional reporting The Financial TimesDeal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

He was proposed by Fianna Fáil.After the meeting Mr Casey said he was confident of getting the necessary three other councils to support him. He also said he was not running to lose and was prepared to spend up to the cap of €750,000.“I didn’t stand to lose. I believe I have a very good platform,” Mr Casey said.There were three nominees. Gemma O’Doherty was proposed and seconded by Sinn Féin William Delaney was proposed by an Independent and seconded by Sinn Féin.Other councils have already nominated three candidates to stand in the election: businessmen Seán Gallagher and Gavin Duffy and Senator Joan Freeman.Sinn Féin MEP Liadh Ní Riada will also be nominated following her selection at a party meeting on Sunday.This means at least four candidates will compete against the incumbent, President Michael D Higgins, who holds a commanding lead in the polls.Candidates can be nominated by 20 Oireachtas members or four county councils. There are still 19 councils who have yet to nominate anyone.Earlier artist Kevin Sharkey, who dropped out of the presidential race last night, denied his campaign was a promotional tool for his painting career.Announcing his withdrawal, Mr Sharkey called the process of trying to secure support from four county councils a “circus” and a “farce”. His statement also provided details of an exhibition showcasing his paintings entitled, The Presidential Collection 2018, as well as a music single he intends to release.“I make no apologies for being a businessman,” he told The .He said at no stage during his campaign did he “mention or even allude” to his career as an artist.Earlier this month in a presentation to Kilkenny County Council Mr Sharkey, who is black, said he has sold 10,000 paintings and if he had “red hair and freckles” he would have had a statue erected in his honour.Asked why he is withdrawing, Mr Sharkey replied the process was a “pantomime” and “a waste of time”.“It’s bad enough to waste taxpayers’ money with this nonsense, but to waste my time as well!” he said.He cited the example of some candidates who have been nominated by councils despite not making presentations to them. Mr Sharkey said the process was so flawed you might as well “rip up the Constitution”. He said the consequence is a narrow field of candidates, including three wealthy businessmen and a Senator.Mr Sharkey’s platform included a call to bring back the death penalty for attacks against elderly people in their homes. He also criticised how motorways have cut off small rural towns and suggested opening Famine villages to draw tourists.All villages should have a girl with red hair playing a harp in the corner, someone cooking cabbage or someone burying someone outside like they used to do in the old days, he said. “This is a gold nugget that we are sitting on.”He is the first potential candidate to withdraw from the race. He has asked councillors who supported him to transfer their allegiance to journalist Gemma O’Doherty who is running on an anti-corruption platform.“She is a woman of huge integrity and is currently bravely shining a light on the rampant corruption that is destroying our beautiful country and democracy. And she needs to be heard and listened to,” said Mr Sharkey.Four county councils are to meet on Monday to decide on whether to nominate further candidates for the presidency.The majority of councillors on Louth County Council on Monday voted not to nominate someone for the election.However, given the vote was not unanimous, next Monday was earmarked for the required special meeting of the council in case any of the councillors wished to nominate someone before the deadline of September 26th.A number of councillors congratulated Mr Duffy, from Drogheda, on securing a nomination.Alan Sherry, senior executive officer with the council advised the members still had time if they wished to nominate somebody and reminded them that three clear days’ written notice was needed for the required special meeting and next Monday was suggested for it.Initially Cllr Thomas Byrne, said he wanted to nominate Peter Casey although he later withdrew that.When Cllr John McGahon proposed the motion that the council not nominate anybody, there were a number of seconders.Sinn Féin members abstained on the vote while three councillors voted against it.Most of the main Oireachtas parties have said they will support Mr Higgins’s candidacy. However, there are enough independent TDs and Senators to nominate one other candidate if they can agree one.Councillors in Kilkenny and Westmeath are also expected to vote today on whether to nominate one of the remaining hopefuls.Mr Gallagher and Mr Duffy have asked the remaining councils to back other candidates as both have already secured nominations.Among the hopefuls still vying for a nomination are businessman Peter Casey, journalist Gemma O’Doherty and musician Jimmy Smyth. None have received any council nominations so far.Last Thursday Dublin City Council refused to nominate any candidate. A meeting to hear from potential candidates ended in farce following a presentation by satirical candidate “Bunty Twuntingdon-McFuff” who called for, among other things, burning the dead as a source of fuel.“I’m protesting against the quality of candidate,” she said afterwards.According to a poll published in the Sunday Business Post yesterday 67 per cent of people would re-elect Mr Higgins. His closest opponents are Mr Gallagher at 15 per cent, Mr Duffy at 6 per cent and Ms Freeman at 3 per cent.Those who said they would vote for a Sinn Féin candidate amounted to 7 percent."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3624754.1537194419!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"presidential round up 17 local authorities decisions so far","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tJoan Freeman (left), Sean Gallagher (centre) and Gavin Duffy are among some of the future President of Ireland hopefulsSeventeen local authorities have met to hear from or vote on would-be presidential candidates.

Three councillors voted for Senator Joan Freeman, and two voted for Gemma O’Doherty. One councillor abstained and two were absent.Joan Freeman received her third nomination to contest the presidential election on Monday afternoon when Fingal County Council endorsed the independent senator.Ms Freeman and businessman Gavin Duffy were the only two candidates to have their names put before the council after Sean Gallagher withdrew his name from consideration.Ms Freeman won the contest by 14 votes to five.Dun Laoghaire Rathdown County Council has decided against holding a special meeting to nominate a candidate for the presidency.The council’s Organisation, Procedure and Protocol committee recommended that members should hold a special meeting if they wished to nominate a candidate.However, a full meeting of the council on Monday night decided not to proceed with the nomination process.South Dublin County Council agreed to invite prospective candidates seeking a nomination to a public meeting to address councillors on Thursday, September 20th. Councillors agreed they would take a vote on whether the local authority would nominate any candidates after the meeting next week.Sean Gallagher visited the council headquarters in Tullamore along with candidates William Delaney, Peter Casey and Gemma O’Doherty on Monday.Mr Gallagher thanked the eight Fianna Fáil members who had offered him their support but asked them instead to leave the field open for other candidates.The council’s three Sinn Féin members will support their own candidate and its three Fine Gael Councillors are due to abstain. It’s unclear how the three Independent and Renua Ireland councillors are intending to vote.In the last council meeting of a busy day in the presidential nomination trail, Wicklow County Council voted to give Gavin Duffy his third nomination.Kerry County Council gave businessman Peter Casey his first nomination.

We want everyone to travel safely, so the advice is - stay safe, stay back.Highways England has launched a campaign named Don\u0027t Be A Space Invader, which is based on the popular arcade game.The campaign is supported by Formula 1 world champion Nigel Mansell, who described tailgating as a driving habit I utterly deplore.Venezuelan firemen face 20 years in prison for donkey video mocking MaduroRussia is meddling in Macedonia name-change referendum, US defence chief warnsLondon theatre: the best plays and shows on nowDozens buried in Philippines landslide triggered by Typhoon MangkhutEn Marche MP resigns from \u0026#39Titanic\u0026#39 party as Macron disillusionment growsWarmest April day in 70 years caused spike in deaths, ONS figures reveal Comment: Nick Clegg\u0026#39s sanctimonious opposition to Brexit reminds us why voters long ago lost faith in himFears of copycat cases as Australian police say a needle was found in a banana after strawberry scareComment: End the chaos?

Shortly before attacking the unarmed police officer, Masood killed Kurt Cochran, 54, Leslie Rhodes, 75, Aysha Frade, 44, and Andreea Cristea, 31, when he ploughed an SUV into pedestrians on Westminster Bridge.Speaking at the inquest, Mr Ellwood MP said: “I know that official advice is to step back, report it. “But I find myself countering that somewhat, because if more of us do step forward as we saw in the Manchester attack, London Bridge and Westminster Bridge as well, the message gets though that no terrorist is going to win.”Tobias Ellwood arrives at the Westminster terror attack inquestMr Ellwood, who served in the Royal Green Jackets, told Monday’s inquest that he refused to stop giving Pc Palmer CPR until a doctor gave him the final order. He said: “I have seen some horrific injuries ... and I was going to continue working until the doctors thought otherwise.Mr Ellwood then told of the “eerie silence” in Parliament when he was left alongside Pc Palmer’s body with one other person as doctors moved on to assist other causalities on Westminster Bridge. He said: “We both then tidied up the body as best we could, closed his eyes and I said, ‘I am sorry.’“It was very, very silent. It was a strange end to a very dramatic four or five minutes, to suddenly be left alone with just one other person.” Mr Ellwood became emotional as he shared his account of trying to save Pc Palmer’s life, telling the coroner: “Forgive me, it’s sometimes easier to do the helping rather than to talk about it afterwards.”82 seconds of hell | How the terror attack unfolded across Westminster BridgeRecollecting the moment he knew that something serious was unfolding in Westminster that day, the MP for Bournemouth East said he “heard a significant crash followed by screams” before “waves of people” started running towards him. He said: “They were not screams of pain or injury, but screams of shock. That made me aware that something out of the ordinary was starting to happen.“I have never seen so many officers with their weapons out in the Houses of Parliament.”Mr Ellwood admitted to being previously concerned about the lack of armed officers in Westminster, but challenged suggestions that security should be ramped up, urging that “we must not be so risk adverse and so reliant on our security forces.”He agreed that “sensible and practical protective measures” should be enforced but not at the cost of Parliament’s transparency, adding: “We must not lock ourselves away.” The MP told the inquest that he visited the exact place where he attempted to save PC Palmer’s life before attending court this morning. He said: “I felt obliged to go and visit the spot and I was pleased to see that the level of security we now have in place. I am not sure we can do much more.”London theatre: the best plays and shows on nowDozens buried in Philippines landslide triggered by Typhoon MangkhutEn Marche MP resigns from \u0026#39Titanic\u0026#39 party as Macron disillusionment growsWarmest April day in 70 years caused spike in deaths, ONS figures reveal Comment: Nick Clegg\u0026#39s sanctimonious opposition to the Brexit is breathtakingly hypocritical Fears of copycat cases as Australian police say a needle was found in a banana after strawberry scareComment: End the chaos?

They then saw a high-speed flare get thrust out, escaping from the rim of the black hole. Scientists have seen black holes killing and swallowing stars. And the jets have been seen before.But a new study shows the first time that they have captured the hot flare that comes out just afterwards. And the flare and then swallowed star have not been linked together before1724 Dog-sized horned dinosaur fossil found shows east-west evolutionary ide in North AmericaA British scientist has uncovered the fossil of a dog-sized horned dinosaur that roamed eastern North America up to 100 million years ago. The fragment of jaw bone provides evidence of an east-west ide in the evolution of dinosaurs on the North American continent. During the Late Cretaceous period, 66 to 100 million years ago, the land mass was split into two continents by a shallow sea. This sea, the Western Interior Seaway, ran from the Gulf of Mexico to the Arctic Ocean. Dinosaurs living in the western continent, called Laramidia, were similar to those found in Asia1824 \u0027Male and female brains\u0027 aren\u0027t realBrains cannot be categorised into female and male, according to the first study to look at sex differences in the whole brain.

The discovery, made using graphite that was trapped in ancient crystals, could mean that life began almost instantaneously after the Earth was formed. The researchers behind it have described the discovery as “a potentially transformational scientific advance”. Previously, life on Earth was understood to have begun when the inner solar system was hit by a massive bombardment from space, which also formed the moon\u0027s cratersNasa has announced that it has found evidence of flowing water on Mars. Scientists have long speculated that Recurring Slope Lineae — or dark patches — on Mars were made up of briny water but the new findings prove that those patches are caused by liquid water, which it has established by finding hydrated salts.2124 Earth could be at risk of meteor impactsEarth could be in danger as our galaxy throws out comets that could hurtle towards us and wipe us out, scientists have warned. Scientists have previously presumed that we are in a relatively safe period for meteor impacts, which are linked with the journey of our sun and its planets, including Earth, through the Milky Way. But some orbits might be more upset than we know, and there is evidence of recent activity, which could mean that we are passing through another meteor shower. Showers of meteors periodically pass through the area where the Earth is, as gravitational disturbances upset the Oort Cloud, which is a shell of icy objects on the edge of the solar system. They happen on a 26-million year cycle, scientists have said, which coincide with mass extinctions over the last 260-million yearsChinese scientists have created genetically-engineered, extra-muscular dogs, after editing the genes of the animals for the first time. The scientists create beagles that have double the amount of muscle mass by deleting a certain gene, reports the MIT Technology Review. The mutant dogs have “more muscles and are expected to have stronger running ability, which is good for hunting, police (military) applications”, Liangxue Lai, one of the researchers on the project. Now the team hope to go on to create other modified dogs, including those that are engineered to have human diseases like muscular dystrophy or Parkinson’s.

The scientists tracked a star about as big as our sun as it was pulled from its normal path and into that of a supermassive black hole before being eaten up. They then saw a high-speed flare get thrust out, escaping from the rim of the black hole. Scientists have seen black holes killing and swallowing stars. And the jets have been seen before.But a new study shows the first time that they have captured the hot flare that comes out just afterwards. And the flare and then swallowed star have not been linked together before1724 Dog-sized horned dinosaur fossil found shows east-west evolutionary ide in North AmericaA British scientist has uncovered the fossil of a dog-sized horned dinosaur that roamed eastern North America up to 100 million years ago. The fragment of jaw bone provides evidence of an east-west ide in the evolution of dinosaurs on the North American continent. During the Late Cretaceous period, 66 to 100 million years ago, the land mass was split into two continents by a shallow sea. This sea, the Western Interior Seaway, ran from the Gulf of Mexico to the Arctic Ocean. Dinosaurs living in the western continent, called Laramidia, were similar to those found in Asia1824 \u0027Male and female brains\u0027 aren\u0027t realBrains cannot be categorised into female and male, according to the first study to look at sex differences in the whole brain. Specific parts of the brain do show sex differences, but inidual brains rarely have all “male” traits or all “female” traits. Some characteristics are more common in women, while some are more common in men, and some are common in both men and women, according to the study1924 Life on Earth appeared hundreds of millions of years earlier than previously thoughtLife may have come to earth 4.1 billion years ago, hundreds of millions of years earlier than we knew. The discovery, made using graphite that was trapped in ancient crystals, could mean that life began almost instantaneously after the Earth was formed. The researchers behind it have described the discovery as “a potentially transformational scientific advance”. Previously, life on Earth was understood to have begun when the inner solar system was hit by a massive bombardment from space, which also formed the moon\u0027s cratersNasa has announced that it has found evidence of flowing water on Mars. Scientists have long speculated that Recurring Slope Lineae — or dark patches — on Mars were made up of briny water but the new findings prove that those patches are caused by liquid water, which it has established by finding hydrated salts.2124 Earth could be at risk of meteor impactsEarth could be in danger as our galaxy throws out comets that could hurtle towards us and wipe us out, scientists have warned. Scientists have previously presumed that we are in a relatively safe period for meteor impacts, which are linked with the journey of our sun and its planets, including Earth, through the Milky Way. But some orbits might be more upset than we know, and there is evidence of recent activity, which could mean that we are passing through another meteor shower. Showers of meteors periodically pass through the area where the Earth is, as gravitational disturbances upset the Oort Cloud, which is a shell of icy objects on the edge of the solar system. They happen on a 26-million year cycle, scientists have said, which coincide with mass extinctions over the last 260-million yearsChinese scientists have created genetically-engineered, extra-muscular dogs, after editing the genes of the animals for the first time. The scientists create beagles that have double the amount of muscle mass by deleting a certain gene, reports the MIT Technology Review.

It was announced her contract with the Mail Online “was not renewed by mutual consent” last November. This came months after Hopkins agreed to leave her job as a host on LBC radio in May last year after she tweeted a call for a “final solution” to Islamist terrorism in the wake of the Manchester arena attack.\u0026nbspShe left The Sun in 2015 after writing a column that compared migrants to “cockroaches” and ”feral humans” and said they were “spreading like the norovirus”. The Devon-born columnist became the subject of a petition calling for her to be sacked.Hopkins now works for far-right Canadian website The Rebel Media, where Tommy Robinson, the former English Defence League leader, was previously\u0026nbspa contributor.\u0026nbspMonroe, who is from Leigh-on-Sea, Essex and identifies as non-binary, announced Hopkins had entered into an IVA on Twitter.“I can confirm today that following that landmark libel case, Katie Hopkins has entered into an IVA to avoid bankruptcy,” the food writer tweeted.“I knew for a while but could not say anything for legal reasons. The arbitrary defender of free speech didn’t want anyone to know, ironically...”“...I have been paid in full, but many of her creditors, including my lawyer, will not be paid what they are owed. For the want of an apology, a house, a job, a column, a radio show, and now financial solvency, were lost. It’s all very sad, actually.”She continued: “I’m not cruel nor celebrating – that case cost me 18 months of sanity and work, and I think neither of us wanted it to turn out this way. (I can recommend an excellent budget cookery book or three, for getting back on your feet, though)”.Monroe initially asked for Hopkins to apologise and donate £5,000 to a migrants’ charity,\u0026nbspsaying that otherwise she would sue.\u0026nbspHowever,\u0026nbspHopkins did not retreat, prompting the expensive court action.After Monroe tweeted about the solvency agreement, social media users honed in on a tweet fired off from Hopkins’ account back in 2014 suggesting people in debt tended to blame others for their plight rather than taking personal responsibility.Hopkins – who was refused permission to appeal in the legal battle in January – was forced to cover the complete costs of the libel case. This included £24,000 in damages to Monroe and £107,000 to her lawyers.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log in"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/08/29/17/brexit-so-far.jpg  width= 2500  height= 1875  layout= responsive  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/08/29/17/brexit-so-far.jpg","title":"brexit michael gove chequers no deal plan theresa may brussels","story":"Created with Sketch.\u0027There\u0027s one critical thing, a future prime minister could always choose to alter the relationship between Britain and the European Union\u0027Click to followIndy PoliticsMichael Gove says future PM could change Theresa May\u0027s deal after BrexitMichael Gove has said Theresa May’s Chequers blueprint for Brexit is the “right one for now” but that a future prime minister could alter the UK-EU relationship if they desired.\u0026nbspThe environment secretary – one of the most prominent Leave campaigners during the referendum – gave his lukewarm backing for Ms May’s plan as he admitted he himself had “compromised”.\u0026nbspBut speaking on Sunday, he refused to say whether the plans thrashed out by the prime minister and agreed by cabinet would be “permanent” and said her successor would have the ability to change it.It comes as the prime minister faces escalating pressure from members of her party to ditch the blueprint that is despised by dozens of hard\u0026nbspBrexiteers, or face a challenge to her leadership.\u0026nbspAsked on the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show whether the prime minister’s Chequers plan for Brexit was a “temporary” or “permanent” solution, Mr Gove replied: “I think it’s the right solution for our country to leave the European Union on the basis of what we’ve negotiated, and I think it’s absolutely right because we would be outside the single market, we would be outside the customs union.\u0026nbspPressed again, he added: “No, I think it’s the right answer. But, there’s one critical thing, a future prime minister could always choose to alter the relationship between Britain and the European Union, but the Chequers approach is the right one for now as we’ve got to make sure we respect that vote and take advantage of the opportunities of being outside the EU.”\u0026nbspDuring the appearance, Mr Gove also urged Brussels to compromise in the negotiations. “I’ve compromised,” he said. “I’ve been quite clear that some of the things that I argued for in the referendum passionately, as a result of Chequers I have to qualify one or two of my views.Brexit talks: Top issues facing UK on leaving EUworkers sorting radishes on a production line at a farm in Norfolk.

asking the party’s annual conference to back either a general election or a fresh public vote on the final Brexit deal.It comes after one of Labour’s most powerful figures, Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, called for another\u0026nbspvote on Brexit, insisting there are now just two possible outcomes for the UK in the negotiations – either a bad deal, or a no-deal.\u0026nbspIt is likely to pile

Labour’s position on Brexit, with other issues including the party’s stance on antisemitism, welfare, government contracts and schools.On Monday, the party’s conference arrangement committee will sift through the raw motions and decide which ones to put forward to Labour’s conference in Liverpool next week.Each Constituency Labour Party (CLP) has the opportunity to propose a “contemporary motion” for discussion at conference and campaigners for a new public vote claim the number of motions supporting the idea will dominate.One motion from Camberwell and Peckham, the constituency of the party’s former deputy leader, Harriet Harman, notes the “Chequers deal is dead” and calls for both a meaningful vote in Parliament and UK-wide referendum on the final terms of Brexit.\u0026nbspA substantial amount of the motions, however, are based on the left-wing statement backed by Another Europe is Possible and Labour for a People’s Vote.\u0026nbspAs well as calling for a fresh vote, it also says Labour should “form a radical government – taxing the rich to fund better public services, expanding common ownership, abolishing anti-union laws and engaging in massive public investment”.\u0026nbspOne of the national organisers at Another Europe is Possible, Michael Chessum, said: “If we don’t have a manifesto commitment for a fresh referendum, we will end up going into an autumn election either promising a ‘bespoke Labour Brexit’ which we have no time to negotiate, or offering a Norway-style deal which is straightforwardly worse than EU membership and will leave Corbyn with no seat at the European table.“Of the options, soft Brexit is the least popular with the electorate,” he added.\u0026nbspBrexit Resignation: July 10th 2018 Maria Caulfield MP Conservative

Turkey\u0026nbsphas amassed armoured vehicles, artillery guns, and tanks along the border with Syria, with some equipment moving across the frontier, according to Turkish news outlets and video footage posted to the internet.It has transferred arms and ammunition to its Free Syria Army (FSA) rebel allies, pro-Ankara newspapers reported, though some experts say the distribution of weapons won’t affect the outcome of any conflict. \u0026nbspIdlib province on 11 September in anticipation for an upcoming government forces offensive (Getty)Turkey has also begun to bolster a dozen outposts it operates in and around Idlib with additional troops and military vehicles.

But Turkey’s moves have upped the geopolitical cost of any attempt to take Idlib by the pro-Assad camp that includes Russia, Iran, and the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah, as well as Iraqi Shia militias backed by Tehran.Around three\u0026nbspmillion Syrians live in Idlib province, a hilly agricultural region by\u0026nbspthe Turkish border. Many of the displaced have resettled in the province from other parts of the country or were forcibly relocated there from opposition enclaves recaptured by Damascus.Turkey, the primary patron of the Syrian opposition and the host to 3.5 million displaced Syrians, has vehemently opposed the regime offensive to retake Idlib. The US and Europe have urged a political solution over Idlib and warned against the military campaign. US envoy to the UN Nikki Haley repeated warnings that any use of chemical weapons by the regime would trigger a response by Washington.The UK on Saturday warned of an impending humanitarian crisis amid reports of attacks on hospitals and clinics in rebel-held territory. “The UK has been clear that a man-made catastrophe in Idlib is entirely avoidable,” Alistair Burt, Middle East minister, said in a a press release. “We support the urgent diplomatic efforts being made by Turkey and the UN.”Ankara worries in part that another bloody confrontation in Syria could flood Turkey and Europe with hundreds of thousands of fresh refugees.Airstrikes in in Idlib, northwestern SyriaAlready, thousands of displaced Syrians have relocated from the southern edges of Idlib and northern Hama province to the Turkish-controlled Afrin district adjacent to the border, said a source in Afrin. On Friday, Turkey hosted a meeting of French, German\u0026nbspand Russian officials ahead of a possible meeting of those countries’ leaders over Idlib.In addition to a possible confrontation between pro-Assad forces and Turkey, Idlib could be the flashpoint for a conflict with jihadi forces that dominate parts of the province. In recent days, al-Qaeda’s international supporters on social media have also blasted fellow jihadis in Idlib for allowing Turkey to dispatch armoured vehicles and trucks carrying tanks into Syria, as depicted in videos posted on social media.A 13 September statement signed by 15 prominent al-Qaeda supporters questioned Hayat Tahrir\u0026nbspal-Sham (HTS), the jihadi group that is a dominant player in Idlib, for granting Turkey access to the province.Mr Oliver suggested Turkey could be bolstering the observation points for fear of attacks by jihadis as well as to stymie Damascus’s offensive. “The internal problems for Idlib are huge,” he said. “We are talking about an area that has FSA factions, HTS, you have Isis\u0026nbspcells, you have other small entities.”For now Turkey’s moves have complicated plans to retake Idlib. Syrian civilians have begun to mass around the bolstered observation points in hopes that they won’t be struck by government and Russian warplanes. Thousands of Syrians who have fled the attacks of the regime and Russia are settling in the areas where the Turkish army\u0027s military posts are, because they think it is safe, the pro-government Vatan newspaper reported, publishing photos showing people purported to be sheltering near the outposts.On Friday, for the second week in a row, thousands of Syrians in the province took to the streets in peaceful, colourful demonstrations that recalled the first months of the 2011 uprising against the Assad family’s decades-long dictatorship. “For the time being, everything is postponed,” Mr Oliver said. “There is no final agreement and no final disagreement.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/1/183x122/1018522_1.jpg","title":"brexit latest news britain european union withdrawal agreement irish border","story":"Senior Government officials and diplomats in Brussels, the UK, and other European Union capitals have said the deal will be presented at a yet-to-be arranged summit in the Belgian capital before Christmas.According to respected political website Politico differences still remain between the two sides, particularly on how to solve the Irish border issue, but the diplomats claimed that if a deal is clinched, it will be quickly approved by EU27 leaders.It would be seen as a pivotal moment for under-fire Prime Minister Theresa May, with the step up in momentum helping her force the deal through Parliament before opponents can challenge it in any great detail.Britain and the EU are now working closely to get the deal over the line, intent on avoiding any issues that critics could potentially pick apart and delay the process further.                EU to secure May\u0026rsquos leadership with MAJOR Brexit concession                 Fishing boss says Michael Gove has been BRAINWASHED by Theresa MayOfficials claim the withdrawal deal is close to completion, with the final push focusing on the \u0026ldquopolitical declaration, the document outlining the framework of the relationship that will accompany the withdrawal treaty.Politico said that according to the EU 27 officials and diplomats working on Brexit, the final compromise will reflect some aspects of Mrs May\u0026rsquos much-criticised Chequers proposals and will remain specifically vague to reduce the potential of more challenges.One EU diplomat said: \u0026ldquoThe more generic it will be, the easier it will be for May to keep together the different souls of the Tories.According to a senior UK official, one proposal being put forward to avoid any debate over this vagueness is to make the final document a combination of \u0026ldquohigh-level aspiration in certain areas and \u0026ldquoincredibly detailed agreement in others.Brexit: A deal has been reached and will be unveiled in November, according to a report (Image: )Another EU official said that during a meeting on August 22 with the EU\u0026rsquos chief negotiator Michel Barnier,\u0026nbspSecretary Dominic Raab called for a legal guarantee on the future framework to be implemented into the Withdrawal Agreement, both on the process and the outcomes of it.But the official said this was \u0026ldquonot possible while a second idea to be put into the political declaration could be that of \u0026ldquoreview clauses, which would enable London and Brussels to agree potential problems with the agreement can be settled at a later date.A senior official told Politico these clauses should not give the impression of \u0026ldquoperpetual orce but could help calm any fears from Brussels that Britain could emerge with \u0026ldquocompetitive advantages.Both sides have now agreed on the need for a future \u0026ldquopolitical joint committee, which would be staffed with officials from both sides and sit under a joint ministerial committee that would meet regularly to help solve discrepancies.                BREXIT SPLINTER: May faces SPLIT as Tory MPs plot RIVAL CONFERENCEBrexit: Dominic Raab wants a legal guarantee on the future framework to be implemented into the deal (Image: )Despite the positive signs that a deal could be agreed following one-last marathon meeting in November, there are still a number of hurdles to overcome.On Thursday, Mr Barnier will brief EU leaders at an informal summit in Salzburg, Austria where the political declaration will be discussed in detail for the first time.

Heres what you need to know.After a marathon session of talks at Chequers on July 6, Theresa May managed to secure a Brexit plan which will be assessed by the EU.Her Brexit plan will see the UK remains closely tied to the Brussels.It also includes the creation of a new UK-EU free trade area for goods, with a common rulebook.This rulebook could limit the UKs ability to strike trade deals with countries such as the US, for whom securing market access for American farmers would be a big prize.Mrs May has agreed to an amendment that would stop Britain being tied to Europes customs union after we quit the EU.In dramatic scenes in the House of Commons on July 17 2018, Mrs May managed to see off a damaging attempt, winning by just six votes.Mrs May was then defeated on a separate amendment to her flagship Trade Bill, which will require her to seek continued UK participation in the EUs system for regulation of medicines after Brexit.Now her Cabinet is required to ensure that the UK can continue to participate in the regulatory network operated by the European Medicines Agency.Mrs May hopes to get an agreement hammered out at a series of summits with EU leaders this autumn, and bring it back to Parliament for approval.A deal on the UKs withdrawal agreement was expected to be agreed in time for the summit in October, along with a statement from both sides on the future relationship.However, a number of senior figures have said this deadline may slide into November.Once a dead has been agreed, MPs will be asked to approve it.The former Foreign Secretary claimed Mrs Mays disastrous plans for the Irish border would leave Britain at a loss.Boris Johnson said the European Unions fallback position for the Irish border would mean Northern Ireland was annexed by Brussels.Opposition to the plan in the Conservative Party centres around the European Research Group of hard - Brexit supporting MPs led by Jacob Rees - Mogg.His voice had been among the loudest voicing their objection to the plan and he urged MPs “chuck Chequers”.Up to 80 Tory MPs are prepared to vote against Theresa Mays Chequers plan, Steve Baker, a former Brexit minister and ERG backer has warned.A group of about 50 Tory MPs have met to discuss how and when they could force her out of her job, the BBC reported.Also voicing his opposition to the Chequers deal has been former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson.He said Theresas Mays had wrapped a suicide vest around the British constitution and handed the detonator to Brussels.Along with former Brexit secretary David Davis and Mr Johnson resigned in protest following the Chequers meeting.Several other MPs also quit their ministerial posts over the issue, including Steve Baker, Maria Caulfield, Ben Bradley and Robert Courts.The party will vote down any Brexit deal brought back from Brussels by Theresa May, according to shadow Foreign Secretary Emily Thornberry.The Corbyn ally said the party will oppose it to try to force an election by Christmas.Speaking to the FT she said a deal which meets her party’s tests was “not going to happen”, and therefore the Prime Minister would be forced to quit.Without the support of the opposition party, it would need just a handful of Tory rebels to vote against her to see it defeated.Theresa Mays initial plans brought her on side with those Conservatives who favour a soft Brexit.The Prime Minister has also been seeking grassroots Tory support for the plan.Among those voicing support for the Prime Minister has been Environment Secretary Michael Gove, who was a prominent member of the Leave campaign.He said he was confident that the Prime Minister will go into the Conservative Party conference and beyond, securing a good Brexit deal for Britain and continuing to ensure the country enjoys good economic growth and we take advantage of Brexit.     A plan may have been cooked up but it still needs to get past the EU — and the continent’s leaders are showing no sign of compromise.Angela Merkel is already rubbishing our proposal.The Napoleonic Emmanuel Macron thinks he’s a political messiah, and he’d rather see us punished than give up on his federalist promised land.And Michel Barnier’s dangled “concessions” amount to a demand for total UK capitulation.With that level of zeal and stubbornness, it’s no wonder we voted in our millions to leave.We must now go to Brussels with an offer that guarantees control of our borders and sign our own trade deals.But we mustn’t for a second think that they’ll just say yes to it, nor can the PM let them fatally weaken it.It is galling that ministers have spent more time fighting between themselves than preparing for a “no deal” exit.But it isn’t too late.New technology can ensure that Whitehall and our borders are ready for a clean break, which considering the strength of our economy and our companies is nothing to be scared of.The PM has dumped many of her earlier Brexit slogans. But she should remember one in particular now.No deal really is better than a bad deal, and we must still prepare for it."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/NINTCHDBPICT000433237387.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"sun says conservative party theresa may","story":"No new leader could change the fact this Government has no majority.

It will also make le more dficult in innumerable ways - affecting driving licences, passports and phone bills.Today is just a cynical ploy by the Government to make whatever pathetic little deal they bring back from Brussels look less bad in comparison.Emmanuel Macrons Europe minister warned that Eurostar trains and planes from Britain will be turned away from France in the event of a No Deal Brexit.In comments that came just an hour after the Government papers were published, Nathalie Loiseau insisted it was not Le Project Fear to warn of travel chaos that but it “would happen – among other examples”.Asked about the issue following a speech in London, she said: This is the reason we need to prepare for a No Deal because we cannot wake up and say to our citizens and businesses we thought it would never happen so we are not ready.Cabinet ministers met this morning to discuss the No Deal contingency plans which are designed to ensure Britain is ready for the possible collapse of talks with Brussels.Speaking before the plans were published, Dominic Raab warned rebel MPs they will have no choice but to back Theresa May - or risk Brexit chaos.He said Brexit rebels would have to be responsible and rubbished the idea they can force through an alternative plan by next March.Tory MPs from all sides of the Brexit ide have called for the PM to chuck her proposals set out at Chequers.But the Brexit Secretary said it would be impossible to replace Mrs Mays blueprint with a dferent type of trade deal.He told the BBCs Today programme: When push comes to shove it will be a binary choice between the deal we bring back and No Deal, and I think that will focus minds.Colleagues will look at the choices theyve got and theyve got to be responsible for that.During the interview he also hit out at firms such as John Lewis which blame their economic troubles on Brexit.Mr Raab said: I think there will be the temptation from some businesses that arent doing so well to blame Brexit and I think thats a mistake.He confirmed that we wont pay a £39billion orce bill  we dont manage to secure a withdrawal agreement.Mr Raab said: Its not a threat, its statement of fact as part of our No Deal planning.We would be mindful of our strict legal obligations, but the amount and the phased way it is set out in the withdrawal agreement would fall away because there would be no deal.DOZENS of Brexit-backing Tory MPs are furious with Theresa Mays Chequers plan, which would see Britain following EU rules for goods even after weve left.They have launched a huge campaign to persuade the PM to drop her proposals and replace them with a looser free-trade deal.Some hardliners are even trying to ditch Mrs May altogether - convinced that only a Brexit true believer can truly carry out the will of the people.But both efforts are massively complicated by the fact that we have just six months before Britain officially leaves the EU.Senior Brexiteers are in despair about the leadership chatter, warning that  the PM was forced out Remainers would seize the opportunity to delay or even overturn Brexit.And as Dominic Raab points out today, the short timeline makes it dficult for any plan other than Mrs Mays to take shape.If Britain and the EU do thrash out a withdrawal deal later this year, it will almost certainly be based on the PMs Chequers deal.MPs will have a straight choice when it comes to a Commons vote - support the deal as it stands, or back No Deal.Ministers are gambling that enough Tories will lose their nerve and vote with the Government to outnumber the rebels who team up with Jeremy Corbyn to try and defeat it.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

You know youre stealing?The 400-mile-wide hurricane had already splintered buildings, trapped hundreds of people and swamped entire communities along the Carolina coast by Friday.After the raging storm hit, more than 70 people had to be rescued from a Jacksonville hotel when its roof started to collapse leaving le-threatening structural damage.Firefighters - who found a basketball-sized holes in the hotel wall and roof - had to force their way into flooded rooms to get to those trapped inside.The terried guests staying at the Triangle Motor Inn were later moved to a local hurricane safety centre to ride out the storm as parts of the ruptured hotel were sent flying through the air.But hardest hit by the storm - described as catastrophic by the National Weather Service - was the besieged town of New Bern, where more than 360 pleaded for emergency crews to rescue them from the dangerous deluge.Local officials revealed they had earlier urged residents to take shelter at the highest points of their homes, including rooftops.North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper: Its an uninvited brute who doesnt want to leave, adding that Florence is a thousand-year rain event.He added: The sun rose this morning on an extremely dangerous situation and its getting worse.The hurricane was wreaking havoc and could wipe out entire communities as it makes its violent grind across our state for days, the governor said.He said parts of North Carolina had seen storm surges the bulge of seawater pushed ashore by the hurricane as high as 10ft.Wilmington Police Chief Ralph Evangelous told ABC News: I see a biblical proportion flood event thats going to occur. I see the beach communities being inundated with water and destruction that will be pretty, pretty epic in nature.The city of Wilmington has been completely cut off from from the rest of North Carolina after heavy floods put the city without power.After reaching a terrying Category 4 peak of 140 mph earlier in the week, Florence made landfall as a Category 1 hurricane at 7.15am at Wrightsville Beach.Firstly they carry within their structure supercells - which are rotating well-organised thunderstorms.Hurricanes also bring with them warm, moist air which causes an instability in the atmosphere.This takes the form of a layer of warm air with slightly colder and less-moist air above it.It becomes hugely unstable because the warm air wants to rise, since it is less dense than the cooler air.Finally, hurricanes create abrupt changes in wind speed and direction - which form swirling air patterns, called rolls.These vortices can then flip vertically to create their own tornadoes.One family told CNN how they barricaded themselves into their eastern North Carolina home as the waters steadily rose.Annazette Riley-Cromartie held back tears describing the scene, saying: While we were still waiting, my husband kept hearing people yelling for help.You just keep hearing people yelling, and you cant do anything. Its the worst feeling in the world.US President Donald Trump is expected to travel to the areas hit by Hurricane Florence next week.The storm will be a test of his administration - less than two months before the mid-term elections.The delay in the travel is to ensure it would not disrupt and rescue or recovery efforts, according to the White House.The town of Oriental, North Carolina, got more than 20 inches of rain just a few hours into the deluge, others got well over a foot.For people living inland in the Carolinas, the moment of maximum peril from flash flooding could arrive days later, because it takes time for rainwater to drain into rivers and for those streams to crest.Preparing for the worst, about 9,700 National Guard troops and civilians were deployed with high-water vehicles, helicopters and boats that could be used to pluck people from the floodwaters.Authorities have also warned of the threat of mudslides and the risk of an environmental disaster from floodwaters washing over industrial waste sites and hog farms.Florence was seen as a major test for the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which was heavily criticised as slow and unprepared last year for Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico, where the death toll was put at nearly 3,000.The National Hurricane Center said Florence will eventually break up over the southern Appalachians and make a right hook to the northeast, its rainy remnants moving into the mid-Atlantic states and New England by the middle of next week.Meteorologist Ryan Maue of weathermodels said Florence could dump a staggering 18 trillion gallons of rain over a week on North Carolina, South Carolinas, Virginia, Georgia, Tennessee, Kentucky and Maryland.Thats enough to cover the entire state of Texas with nearly 4 inches of water, he calculated.Giant storm: About 400 miles wide, with hurricane-force winds stretching across a 160-mile spanHeavy rains: Parts of the Carolinas could see 20 inches to 30 inches with isolated areas getting 40 inchesStorm surge: up to 13 feet , and seawaters could push inland two milesThe intensity: Winds of 90mph below the 111mph threshold for a major hurricane but still very dangerousGoing dark: More than 320,000 outages, mostly in North CarolinaPopulated coastline: 11 million Americans live in areas under storm watches and warningsGrounded: Nearly 1,200 flights cancelledPotential losses: Meteorologists estimate up to £40 BILLION in economic damagesNorth Carolina alone is forecast to get 9.6 trillion gallons.On Friday, coastal streets in the Carolinas flowed with frothy ocean water, and pieces of torn-apart buildings flew through the air.The few cars out on a main street in Wilmington had to swerve to avoid fallen trees, metal debris and power lines.Traffic lights out of order because of power failures swayed in the gusty wind and roof shingles were peeled off a hotel.The Wilmington airport had a wind gust clocked at 105 mph, the highest since Hurricane Helene in 1958, while airlines cancelled more than 2,400 flights through Sunday."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/NINTCHDBPICT000433620436.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"the sun says russia lies assassins","story":"Admittedly it’s hard not to mock the absurdity of claiming two State assassins armed with Novichok were actually cathedral-loving tourists.But Dawn Sturgess died.

The ­family’s beloved pet dog was also killed by deranged Michael Stone.Josie herself was left with such severe head injuries that medics at she scene thought she was dead before finding a faint pulse.This little girl was a fighter.It must have been horrendous for both of them.Josie couldn’t speak for a year after the attack, had to have an operation to put a titanium plate in her head and her recovery was slow. It was all about small ­victories, and it was down to the tenacity of a little girl who just wanted to live a normal le.Now she is flourishing.Josie has become a successful artist, is engaged to her soul mate Iwan Jones and recently bought the family home in Wales where she spent her early childhood before they all moved to Kent where the attack happened.The house is full of happy memories and Josie dwells on events like her mum bringing home Rosie the pony when she was just five years old and teaching her to ride.Rosie is now a grand old lady of 27 and one of the most ­important things in Josie’s le.The feisty little pony is a link to her mum and little sister and played a massive part in her recovery. Learning how to ride again gave her confidence and a sense of freedom.Josie graduated with a degree in graphic design in 2009 and built up her own art business, first by selling handmade cards at fairs and now producing beautul ­textile landscapes.I’ve met Josie several times over the years, most memorably shortly after the accident when she was still coming to terms with the double tragedy of the death of both her mum and sister.She was shy and wary but gradually I gained her confidence and we spent a lovely afternoon together with her dad Shaun and Rosie the pony.I caught up with her again this week, and I’m always struck by her positivity and her refusal to be thought of as a victim.She very much lives in the moment and always tries to seize the day and be positive.Josie is a walking testament to the power of the human spirit and her mum would be very proud of her beautul, talented, happy daughter.LOTS of speculation already over who will be heading Down Under for I’m A Celebrity in November.Names being bandied around include EastEnder Danny Dyer, Corrie’s Michael Le Vell and former Strictly pro Brendan Cole.GMB’s Kate Garraway is keeping mum about rumours but she would be a hoot, although the person I’d really like to see there is my pal and TV colleague Dr Hilary Jones, who we’ve mocked up in the jungle, pictured.A team player and an action man, he also has a filthy sense of humour, doesn’t suffer fools gladly and would dispense medicine and advice when the insects start to bite and tummies get upset after being fed a diet of ostrich bum.And at the risk of objectying the good doctor, I would pay good money to see him in his skimpies having a shower at the famous waterfall.The ambitious project was first discussed in 2004, when I was rector of Dundee University. It’s wonderful to see it spring to le.Inevitably, costs spiralled. But hopefully the increase in tourism, business and the jobs created will more than offset the £80million price tag.As a proud adopted Dundonian, I want the V\u0026ampA to be a museum for everyone. I hope schoolchildren will enjoy the exhibits, friends will meet there for coffee and everyone in Dundee will think of it as their own.It’s here and I can’t wait to celebrate.IT’S a bit icky – and frankly unbelievable – that Corrie has Jim McDonald pretending his current girlfriend is his dead daughter in order to wreak revenge on his clan.More Game Of Thrones than a game of dominoes down the Rovers... and I can’t take it seriously., so I am. I’ve missed him bellowing “ELIZABETH!” and talking about being in the big house, so I have.I just wish they hadn’t oversensationalised his  because the character is big enough not to need such an OTT comeback.It did get me thinking as to who else I would like to see back in Soapland.And one fab character sprang to mind. I’m sure you recall Emmerdale’s Paul Lambert, who made a huge impact during his five years in the Dales.Paul was played by the ridiculously handsome Mathew Bose, who must have a painting in the attic because he hasn’t aged a day since leaving school.Surely his  is long overdue. His family are still in Emmerdale, including dad Rodney Blackstock, auntie Diane Sugden and his half-sisters. There are lots of layers to Paul, too.His alter-ego is drag queen Thelma Louise, while he and his boyfriend Jonny were the first characters in a primetime drama to have a civil partnership, back in 2008.Surely such an interesting character should be welcomed back to Emmerdale with open arms.We will know more tomorrow night, but I’m spending far more time than is good for me speculating about how it’s all going to be resolved.IT’S been a long time since I considered Jacob Rees-Mogg an amusing anachronism, a bit like a pocket watch.Behind this softly spoken throwback to the Victorian age is a flinty hard-liner who would deny a raped woman the right to an abortion.He’s hell-bent on a rock-hard Brexit, and he doth protest too much about not wanting to be Prime Minister for it to ring true. So it’s fair to say I’m not a fan.But I was appalled by the rude, ignorant mob of “class warriors” who heckled his kids and their elderly nanny outside the family home this week.It was cruel, savage and out of order. Rees-Mogg has chosen to be a politician and is used to being barracked.His children, however, are NOT public figures. They are little kids, who looked scared by the thuggish behaviour of the idiots, who did their cause no good at all.They were there to protest about the minimum wage, and one of them shouted at the children that their nanny, Veronica Crook, wasn’t paid very much to “wipe their bottoms”.Veronica, who has been with the family for half a century, was not best pleased by this, and in a brisk, no-nonsense way defended her boss and ushered her charges indoors. You got the feeling she would dearly have loved to give the protesters a very hard stare and sit them on the naughty step.Politicians from all sides expressed their disgust but those responsible don’t think they have done anything wrong.The minimum wage is well worth fighting for, but not like this.The demonstrators managed to humanise Rees-Mogg, and gained him bucketloads of sympathy.

May needs them to say or, preferably, do something that shows her plan is making headway and is a realistic way forward.“The Government has got to show that it is making some progress,” admits one leading Cabinet minister.No one in Downing Street is expecting a dramatic breakthrough at this summit, though.Theresa May told the Cabinet this week that Salzburg would be a “staging post” on the way to a deal.The British hope is that on Thursday, the EU will announce a special November meeting to discuss Brexit. That, combined with the October EU Council, should provide time for a deal to be done.But, in a sign of how the timetable could slip further, one Downing Street figure close to the negotiations has told influential Europeans that  a deal was done in December, the Government could still get it through parliament in time for Brexit day.Others in No10  are insistent that the withdrawal agreement needs to be done by November. What May needs to judge though is whether the EU is serious about engaging with her Chequers plan or not.Influential Cabinet ministers are worried that the EU will never formally kill off Chequers but will not ever really take it seriously. Then at the last, May will be left with only two options when it comes to  getting a withdrawal agreement.She would either have to leave Northern Ireland in the customs territory of the EU — a ision of the UK that May has repeatedly said is unacceptable.Or, sign the whole of the UK up to a customs union with the EU, which she has, again, said she does not want to do as it would deny Britain an independent trade policy.If she does not want to take either of these bad deals, she would be left with No Deal.The Government still hopes that the member states, who are accountable to their electorates for the consequences of no deal, will tell the Commission to be more flexible as the clock ticks down.  But Chequers, which was sold to the Cabinet on the basis it was “negotiable”, has not yet made the progress many in Government hoped it would.If this does not change soon, it will be time for Mrs May to change tack. At the same time, the Government must step up its preparations for le outside the EU.“Project After” is looking into how Britain can benefit from the freedoms it will have once it has left. But ministers tell me that it “needs more work”.This should be a priority for the Government. For Brexit does not guarantee this  country’s success or failure.  It is what we do after Brexit with our new-found  flexibility that will ­determine that.The Government must be ready to seize this moment.PHILIP HAMMOND has twice had to be slapped down by the Chief Whip in Cabinet this week.On Tuesday, he talked about how there would be a lot of “squealing” about universal credit. Julian Smith, the chief whip, then picked him up on his language.He said that talking about “squealing” doesn’t help. .Those sympathetic to Hammond say that he was talking specically about Labour when he used the word “squealing”. But it is another reminder of his political tin ear.Then on Thursday, Hammond raised the prospect of delaying Brexit day. After the ­legislative timetable for getting ready for “no deal” – which is tight –  had been outlined, Hammond pointed out that the Government has the power to put the Brexit date back.But doing this would be politically explosive.No one else present supported Hammond’s point and the chief whip shot it down, saying they would get all the legislation through in time.Theresa May then explicitly ruled out delaying Brexit day. Allies of Hammond say that he was only talking about an administrative pause of a few weeks.They argue that he only made the point after Andrea Leadsom, the leader of the House of Commons, raised concerns about there not being enough parliamentary time to get everything in place.But Any delay in exit day would cause a massive political crisis. No10 ­sources are adamant that there is “zero chance” of Brexit day not being March  29, 2019.But there is a major problem for the ­Government when the Chancellor, one of the three most senior figures in it, has such a political tin ear that he raises the prospect.This date would make things all too easy for the Government’s critics. It would be “The Zombie ­Budget”, “Hammond’s ­horror show”, “The bloodsucking Budget”.So, a Halloween Budget is out. No final date has yet been agreed for it. But the aim is for the Budget to take place before the special November EU Brexit summit.The Government does not want to risk the Budget ­getting caught up in the row over Theresa May’s ­negotiating position.So keen is the Government to keep these two events separate, there is even talk of breaking with tradition and possibly ­holding the Budget on a Monday .WHILE Boris Johnson has been keeping up a regular verbal barrage against Theresa May’s Chequers plan, she has not given it the hard sell.There has been no national tour, no fireside chat with the country or impassioned speech.But next week, Theresa May will try and make the case for her plan in an extended interview with Panorama. The BBC show was even allowed to film the start of Thursday’s “no-deal” Cabinet.Number 10’s view is that most voters don’t know what the Chequers plan means. They think that a lot of those who are hostile to it, particularly on the Tory side, are more aware of the row over it –  and particularly the resignations of Boris and David Davis – than the details of the plan.If the Prime Minister  though is going to persuade sceptical voters of the merit of her approach, she needs to admit that something has changed and explain why.It won’t work  she simply says she’s stuck rigidly to her red lines.Instead, she needs to ask voters to put themselves in her shoes, to under­stand why she has made the trade-offs that she has.Mrs May must treat the electorate like grown-ups.James Forsyth is political editor of The Spectator. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

In his very first disastrous Budget he tried, and failed, to raise National Insurance for self­-employed strivers. Has he learned? No.Now he intends to scrap a tax cut for White Van Man and a scheme helping hard-up Brits to start a business. He is plotting to hit drivers with the first fuel duty rise in years.

The next it’s sugar. Then carbs. A few weeks later, sugar is back on the naughty step.It’s the same with alcohol. Until recently, a glass of wine a day kept heart attacks at bay. Last month, we learned that NO amount of alcohol is safe. Then this week our new goal, apparently, should be two teetotal days a week.It’s hard to keep up — and no wonder many people ignore all the reports. Who wants to be told what to do by a bunch of scientists who can’t make up their mind?But the latest news from Public Health England should give us all pause for thought, because British women now have some of the lowest le expectancies in Europe.Girls born in the UK today can expect to die three-and-a-half years earlier than girls in Spain, the country that comes out top in this report. The reasons? Rising levels of obesity and poor cancer survival rates.British women also fare badly when it comes to premature deaths — defined as before 75.Many are caused by cancer, heart disease, stroke and type 2 diabetes, which are linked to smoking, alcohol and junk food.France, home of Michelin star chefs, is also way down on the list. And so is Italy.My supporting evidence is that I live with an Italian, who would be more likely to attend a funeral in a jester’s hat than eat a bag of crisps.Clearly, we all need to take a leaf out of the same book.The prevailing wisdom is that it’s more expensive to eat healthily. But that’s not true.A recent report from the Institute of Economic Affairs shows it’s possible to have your five-a-day for less than 30p — and a nutritious,  plain, diet can be bought for less than £1 a day.Meanwhile, the cheapest adult meal in McDonald’s is about £4.50, for which you could make a fresh vegetable curry for the whole family.So it’s not about money. Why, then, do us British women fare so badly?I wonder  we are so daunted by images of women airbrushed to perfection, in adverts and on social media, we feel we can’t compete. So we give up, eating what we like and not exercising.Because keeping really fit takes serious work.The latest insight into this is from movie star Mark Wahlberg who shared his daily schedule this week.He’s in bed by 7.30pm then up at 2.30am for the first of his two daily workouts. His fitness schedule only allows for two hours’ “work” a day — and thus it becomes clear his job is, in fact, his physique.Since most of us spend at least ten hours a day working and commuting, you can see why it’s often easier not to bother.But it’s not just our health that’s in peril. It’s also that of our children, for whom we are the primary role models.Not about vanity, but good healthI have evidence in the form of my best friend, who is a marathon-running exercise junkie — as is her daughter.I, on the other hand, although not proud of this fact, do no exercise — and my daughter doesn’t enjoy it as much as her friends.Getting fit and losing weight can feel impossible.But look at Labour deputy leader Tom Watson, who this week announced that he has lost 7st and put his Type 2 diabetes in remission, which is pretty inspiring.So let’s choose to make this bad news story into a positive and use it as inspiration for change.Let’s aim for two booze-free days a week.And maybe ditch the biscuits for a bit and make some other small, sustainable changes that will leave us able to go for a brisk walk without fearing a heart attack.This is not about vanity, it’s about good health. Because the alternative is sobering.When it started off 18 years ago it was innovative and exciting TV. But now it’s degenerated into a hotbed of fame-hungry wannabes pitted against each other and behaving horribly as a result.Now it’s been axed. About time, too.I BELIEVE in people’s right to protest – of course – against political views they disagree with. But, Ian Bone, the protestor who assailed Jacob Rees-Mogg and his children on their own doorstep has crossed a line.“Your daddy is a horrible man,” Mr Bone told Mr Rees-Mogg’s bewildered-looking children, who will likely be traumatised by the incident – and will certainly not forget.MPs are already putting a lot on the line to serve their country. Many endure threats of violence or even death – and just look at what happened to Jo Cox.Yes, it’s fine to disagree with politicians and to protest. But taking it out on children and trying to make them feel bad about their father is bullying behaviour that is wholly unacceptable.Speaking to LBC afterwards, Mr Bone, who is 71, said that he saw no problem with involving children in his protest.But despite being happy to bring Mr Rees-Mogg’s offspring into the argument, he refused to speak about his own five children, and repeatedly refused to answer  he would have been happy for them to be treated in the same way.Talk about hypocritical.EVERYONE praised as progress the BBC’s “solution” to the inequality on comedy panel shows, which has been to ensure there is at least one woman on every show.But then we hear from Sandi Toksvig that their contributions are often edited out.The QI host told the Radio Times: “There are panel shows that struggle to get women on, and that’s because . . . in the edit they are often seen just laughing at the boys and not saying anything at all, even though I know for a fact in the recording they were clever.”Turns out that turning up and being funny isn’t quite enough,  you are a woman, to be given the same air time as men. How annoying.MY Woman of the Week award goes to Carol Vorderman who, at 57, is clearly in her absolute element and loving le.She looks healthy and oozes confidence, especially in these skin-tight jeans.She told ITV’s Lorraine this week she’s happy being single and is not looking for a “keeper” or another intense relationship.In fact, she said she “couldn’t think of anything worse”.How refreshing. And what a great role model she is for women in their fties and beyond.WATCHING the video of a homeless man being sprayed with paint in Middlesbrough made my blood boil.The poor man – who was found dead just days later in a cemetery – is filmed sat against a wall, covered in paint, as a man brags: “This is how we dealwith the beggars on the street.”This disregard for another human being’s dignity is obscene and the yob should be made to volunteer helping homeless people.Until he sees that dehumanising this man who had hit troubled times was the lowest of the low.DID you see Madonna’s daughter, 21-year old Lourdes hitting the runway for the Gypsy Sport Spring Summer 2019 showcase at New York Fashion Week?It’s so dispiriting, isn’t it, that the headline news about her appearance, which could have focused on so many dferent things – her incredible confidence, for one – was that . . . she hadn’t shaved her legs, top.I guess true equality will have been achieved when a woman’s hairy calves go unmentioned and are seen as neither here nor there.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

There is no legal obligation to pay anything at all.This has been established by the House of Lords and no credible authority has questioned their Lordships.If we pay £40billon we must get something clear in , not just wishy-washy promises.Taxpayers would be outraged  it were otherwise.Any agreement on immigration must be examined with great care.We will doubtless be told that free movement has ended but, as Shakespeare wrote, “what’s in a name? that which we call a rose by any other name would smell as sweet”.There ought to be no preferential terms for new arrivals from the EU above those offered to other nations and no access to state benefits.There must be a clear dferentiation in their rights after we have left and admission must be subject to a work permit scheme focused on skilled rather than unskilled labour.The solution to the Irish question is a further area where Brexiteers must be alert. Last week the European Research Group, which I chair, produced a paper explaining how it could be answered on the EU’s terms.Obviously the UK could simply say that there will be no physical infrastructure at the border but  instead we examine what the EU does on its other borders, and see  those precedents could be followed, then no reasonable person would think a “hard” border were necessary.So far the inevitable attacks on our reports have been mere rudery. No one has found fault with facts.If Ireland were used to justy the major concessions the Government is giving then we would know the deal is a bad one based on a false premise.It would be better than any other which the EU has so far agreed but Ireland is supposed to make it impossible.The issue has been used by those who are fearful of leaving the EU to keep us bound by its rules and regulations.Inevitably these complex machinations have led to some gossip about the leadership.These stories come from all wings of the Party with pro-Europeans such as Tom Tugendhat and George Freeman suggesting it is time to move to a new generationHowever, it is worth remembering the Prime Minister’s virtues.She is determined, thorough and dutul, and in my view duty is an heroic virtue.This gives her great strength and without a clear Parliamentary majority it is not obvious that anyone else could steer the negations to a conclusion.Pitt the Younger was hailed as the pilot who weathered the storm.

The majority, of course, have been a boon for Britain.But successive governments have ignored concerns about the population explosion and its resulting social costs, relying on high immigration to keep the Treasury’s coffers pumped up.That’s why only 13 per cent of voters believe our politicians tell the truth about immigration.About time MPs start to listen.A spokesman for British Future said participants were questioned on the level of trust in the government to manage immigration.He said distrust had been building for almost 20 years thanks to previous governments failure to predict the large migration flows from countries like Poland, Romania and Bulgaria.Despite the low levels of trust in the present Governments ability to manage immigration, it found the majority of those involved held a more balanced view on the issue than is reflected in the media.They found almost two thirds agreed “It is better when migrants commit to stay in Britain, put down roots and integrate,” compared to 39 per cent who agreed “It is better when migrants come here to work for a few years without putting down roots and then  home.Dubbed balancers, these respondents felt immigration brings economic and cultural gains to the UK, but also worry about control, fairness and pressures on public services.The research found 65 per cent of people thought migrants bring valuable skills for the economy and public services such as the NHS, while 59 per cent believed ersity is a good thing for British culture.But more than half of respondents said public services are under strain as a result of immigration, and a further 52 per cent believed migrants are willing to work for less - putting jobs at risk and lowering wages.On Brexit, four in ten of those who took part in the ICM poll were willing to keep the current free movement rules  it meant a better deal for British business.But 33 per cent of respondents felt that the UK should not offer a preferential immigration deal to the EU, even  this limited the trade deal that the PM could strike.Some 53 per cent of Leave voters believed Theresa May should not offer a preferential immigration deal to the EU, even  business would lose out, compared with 16 per cent of Remain voters.Conservative voters, older people, those without higher level qualications and those who live outside big cities were also more likely to favour this option.Rosie Carter, of Hope not Hate and the reports co-author, said: Immigration is a national issue, but people see it through a local lens.Where people live, and their living conditions, makes a real dference - that includes the perceived impact of migration on their community, broader grievances about economic insecurity and levels of contact with migrants and ethnic minorities too.An official National Conversation on Immigration would give people a chance to express their concerns in a constructive debate, so anxieties are not driven underground or exploited by those seeking to stoke ision.Jill Rutter of British Future and co-author of the report, said: “The lack of trust we found in the Government to manage immigration is quite shocking. People want to have their voices heard on the choices we make, and to hold their leaders to account on their promises.“While people do want the UK Government to have more control over who can come to the UK, most of them are ‘balancers’ – they recognise the benefits of migration to Britain, both economically and culturally, but also voice concerns about pressures on public services and housing.“Most people are pragmatic and have constructive ideas about the choices we face. They want a system that manages the pressures to secure the gains of immigration – but right now they don’t trust the government to deliver it.”Leading Tory Brexiteer Jacob Rees Mogg told The Sun: The message from this troubling survey is that whatever conclusion we come to as we leave the EU we must tell people the truth.

I came here when I was 30 and opened a strip club but I had been trying to get out of that game, I wanted to do something dferent.“One night I had been drinking with some friends and they said St Robert was like the armpit around here. I said it should be called Uranus.“We made a few jokes about it but I kept the idea“Now people love it. Nobody changes in the US. They see the funny side. This takes a thick skin, though. Ten per cent of the people are offended . . . but who cares?“I am the only person who currently lives in Uranus but we want to make it bigger.”With a straight face, he adds: “Uranus is always expanding.”Louie’s original plan was to sell T-shirts with pun-laden slogans but, frustrated by slow progress, decided to earn his chocolatier licence.Some months later he had closed the strip club and opened the Uranus Fudge Factory And General Store.One sign there reads: “The best fudge comes from Uranus.”Shop workers greet every customer with their two favourite phrases — “welcome to Uranus” and “thanks for picking Uranus”.The store sells dozens of flavours of fudge, mugs, T-shirts, handguns, rles and crossbows. A sign on a door reads: “Restricted employees only or Scarlett Johansson.”Amanda Miller, 38, who has worked behind the counter for 16 months, said: “Since the strip club closed the place is family friendly. We have so much fun stuff to do here now.“The people that come here love it — you need a sense of humour. Seeing people’s expressions is amazing.”A staggering 30,000 visitors each month arrive to sample the fudge, view the “world’s largest belt buckle” and try the town’s other experiences, including Escape Uranus.For 25 , punters can spend an hour trying to flee from one of two locked rooms — a twisted doctor’s office and a room dedicated to Italian painter Leonardo da Vinci — by solving a series of riddles before time runs out.The Sun chose a third option and was given ten minutes to escape from handcuffs behind the bars of a locked prison cell, eventually doing so with just seconds to spare.After our successful escape we proudly held up a sign saying: “Cracked it in Uranus.”We toured its other attractions too, including a sideshow museum that features pickled animals in jars, including a two-headed bull shark, Cyclops pig with a fth leg on its head, a three-legged chicken and a two-headed snapping turtle.In a dark corner of the museum, which is not allowed to be photographed, performer Katya Kadavera swallows 20in swords and performs card tricks.There is also an electric chair near ieties of snakes and a capybara called Peanut, billed as the largest rodent in the world.Louie regales The Sun with his plans for an on-site brewery, a new 50ft rocket ship welcome sign and a wedding chapel, and says: “Who doesn’t want to get married in Uranus, right?”For now, the current collection of oddities in Uranus seems to be pulling people in.Karen Ferrantella, 61, was driving from Chicago to Kimberling City, Missouri, with friend Tracey Pickford, 60, when they spotted Uranus.They ended up buying a bagful of goodies, including magnets and corn relish which said it was “fresh from Uranus to the table”. The pair were drawn in by the welcoming signs and another which implores visitors to “help keep Uranus clean”.Karen, a dietician, told The Sun: “We started laughing hysterically when we saw the road sign. We could not believe it was actually a place. They are obviously playing along with this idea and it is great. It is a brilliant marketing ploy.”Though not everyone has been having fun in and around Uranus, especially after last week’s closure of the Daily Guide — a paper in the city of Waynesville, around six miles away.The Guide’s former editor, Natalie Sanders, 42, was approached by Louie to start the Uranus Examiner.But despite the potential openings Uranus is now offering in terms of jobs, former teacher Luge Hardman, the mayor of Waynesville, said: “I’m sorry but the innuendo of that title puts my city up for public ridicule and I will not be a part of it.”Darrell Todd Maurina, who runs a rival online publication, added: “That name does not indicate a serious newspaper.”But mum-of-nine Natalie, who has edited two papers in the past, tells The Sun that despite its comical name, she intends to run the 24-page publication as a proper tabloid with a full staff.It will go out free to 15,000 homes in the area next month and, thanks to the publicity of the name row, businesses are calling from far away as Australia to place adverts.Natalie says: “My husband joked that I was the most famous newspaper editor in the world and I didn’t even have a newspaper yet.“But to me the name doesn’t really matter. There are a lot of stories around here and we get serious crime.I am an experienced journalist and am good at my job.”Amid the innuendo and sniggering, Natalie makes a serious point about the decline of local newspapers. She says: “Small towns and small places really need a newspaper. You need someone to keep track on what your city council is doing and what the school board is doing.”In a rare introspective moment, Louie adds: “What people need,  they want a big strong community, is a big strong newspaper.”But he can’t be serious for long and adds: “We are going to probe Uranus with your newspaper. Get to the bottom of things. I’m a cub reporter today but someday I will be a crack reporter.”While not all locals are fans of Louie’s town, few could argue that Uranus has a certain ring to it.GOT a story?

Nobody wants it.But this self-described “bloody dficult woman” believes she alone can ram it through.Either she knows something nobody else does . . . or her fabled “polished turd” is about to hit the fan.On tonight’s BBC’s Panorama, Mrs May spells out the formula she thinks propelled her to the top: “You bide your time and you are bloody dficult when it really matters.”Others fear a dferent characteristic has defined her political career, especially as Home Secretary.“She is mulishly stubborn,” says a former ally.“Once she digs her heels in, nothing can sht her — right or wrong.”They fear she will stick defiantly to her half-baked plan until she runs out of road and is forced to choose between an EU fudge or defeat in the House of Commons.The Chequers deal is flawed by the fantasy we can follow an EU rule book on free trade and regulation while reserving the right to duck and e.Outside Cabinet, Tories on all sides — Brexiteers and Remainers — insist it is unworkable.“It fails to take back control of our laws, borders, money and trade,” writes ex-Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith.“We would be out of Europe yet still run by Europe.”EU negotiator Michel Barnier fears it endangers the whole EU project, which is already threatened by tensions over mass immigration, the Euro and jobless school leavers.Special treatment for the UK would instantly trigger demands from other member states for their own tailor-made deals, unravelling the drive for ever-closer union.Mrs May claims there is no alternative to Chequers.But there has to be — and Britain is already working on it.Despite Chancellor Phil Hammond’s blundering interference, preparations for a clean break are in train, covering everything from free trade to the vexed border with Northern Ireland.It may be pitched as a last-ditch option, only to be deployed in an emergency.But since Chequers is universally seen as a non-starter, free trade automatically becomes the only viable plan on the UK table.New Brexit minister, karate black belt and rising star Dominic Raab, is making this vividly clear in Brussels.He alarmed Downing Street by threatening to withhold the EU’s £40billion ransom  they push us too far.And he has told Barnier to do his own dirty work and impose a border in the Irish Sea  he dares.This is music to the ears of Tory MPs who desperately yearn to see some fighting spirit.They hope against hope Mrs May secretly has a cunning plan, ready to roll out at the right moment as she suggests, calling Barnier’s bluff.But there is another red card on the table, face up and flashing danger to our EU neighbours.Do they want to humiliate the PM to the point where she is defeated in Parliament and pushed into a second catastrophic election?EU leaders can read the polls which put Labour in front.They will also be horried to see ex-Tory vice-chairman Jeffrey Archer unhelpfully saying he would vote for Corbyn  he were a Northerner.And we should all be alarmed by David Cameron’s Goldman Sachs-trained Treasury minister, Jim O’Neill, saying: “I find myself struggling to be that scared by the prospect of a Corbyn government.”The EC has enough on its plate with the growing explosion of anti-Brussels populism across Europe. The last thing it wants any time soon is a hard-left Labour government led by lelong EU-haters Jeremy Corbyn and Marxist Chancellor John McDonnell.It might be the one bargaining chip that makes Michel Barnier blink first.For a Bank of England governor, his forecast of a 35 per cent crash in house prices verged on the hysterical.Project Fear has lost the power to shock, but it won’t stop trying.Aircraft will not fall from the sky, the Channel Tunnel will stay open, NHS patients will not starve or die from lack of NHS drugs.Not only have Carney’s nightmare scenarios of slump and mass unemployment proved false, the reverse has happened.Young workers are flocking to the UK for jobs. Wages are rising. Growth is strong.Now we see French companies such as Chanel stampeding to invest billions here.

Im going to do them.Im not setting a time horizon.I think it would be foolish to do so with so much uncertainty flying around.Pressed on being at the helm at the time of the next slated general election in 2022, he said: 2022 is a long time off, I think its improbable, actually, that I will be leading us then.Lord Campbell told the Daily Mirror: You know when youve run out of road.I think he can see the end of the road.Hes given it his best shot.He has brought stability, which was necessary.Sir Vince said the Lib Dems were talking to disillusioned Labour and Tory MPs, but he insisted setting up a new party is not going to happen.

woodland creatures were found in a potentially fatal pickle in the US state of Wisconsin.Their mother had used grass and plastic to build her nest, but what was supposed to protect her little ones almost killed them as the five became intertwined.Luckily, a concerned animal lover found the animals before it was too late and told The Wisconsin Humane Society, who dubbed the saga the Tale of Five Tails.The Wildle Rehabilitation Centre wrote on Facebook: “Their tails had become entwined with long-stemmed grasses and strips of plastic their mother used as nest material.“You can imagine how wiggly and unruly  this frightened, distressed ball of squirrelly energy was - so our first step was to anaesthetise all five of them at the same time.”The grey squirrels were sedated before the wildle workers began the procedure of untangling their tails.The post continued: “It was impossible to tell whose tail was whose, and we were increasingly concerned because all of them had suffered from ying degrees of tissue damage to their tails caused by circulatory impairment.”After about 20 minutes, the wildle workers were able to cut away at the grass-and-plastic knot with scissors, being very careful to make sure we werent snipping anyones tail in the process.The WHS said on Friday the squirrels were bright-eyed and three of the five critters were bushy-tailed, while the other two seemed to have a little less fur.Workers said theyll continue to monitor the squirrels to make sure their tails have sufficient blood flow.The wildle centre raised more than £380 to rescue the squirrels.The incident is not the first of its kind, as there have been several recorded instances of squirrels and other rodents getting their tails tangled together in this way.The phenomenon is known as a “rat king” and the number of rodents joined together can range from a few to dozens, with the earliest reported instance being in 1564.Specimens of purported rat kings are kept in some museums, with one in Germany featuring 32 mummies rats.The entanglements are often blamed on material like hair or sticky substances like sap or gum."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/NINTCHDBPICT000434629045.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"uk weather 25c heat storm helene","story":"Todays sunny weather in the south east will be blown away by 70mph winds overnight as the storm moves in from the west coast.London is expected to hit highs of 25C today which is very unusual for September.Storm Helene will then take hold of most of the country, causing yellow weather warnings to be issued for Monday and Tuesday.Commuters and motorists have been warned to prepare for disruption in the wake of the powerful storm.A Met Office spokesperson said: Expect potential for delays to road, rail, air and ferry transports.Buses and trains could also take longer.The Met Office had issued warnings mostly for the west coast of England, but updated warnings this morning now cover all of Wales and the Midlands too.The main concern is that trees uprooted by Storm Helene may cause some areas to have face power outages in addition to travel problems.The Met Office said: Power services are perhaps a bit more vulnerable because we’ve got trees that are still in-leaf and wind speeds of a certain magnitude can have more of an impact on trees when they’re in-leaf.That can be a hazard because  you have trees in full-leaf then they can be more affected by the wind because it’s more like a sail.And when they come down they can obviously affect power supplies.The storm is expected to affect the East and West Midlands and the east of England.A separate windstorm later in the week on Wednesday will continue to batter the west coast even after Storm Helene clears.The Met Office said: In some ways the winds from that look as though at the moment that they could be a bit more signicant than Helene.We are looking at a potential warning for that.Between Storm Helene tonight and the further winds on Wednesday, most of the country will have a wet and blustery week.Rain is forecast to fall tomorrow from Cornwall to Yorkshire though temperatures will remain mostly in the teens and low 20s.The Met Office say that Helenes tropical hurricane origins made forecasts late last week look more serious than the latest data now suggests, but a larger area will be affected by the storm.Helene was downgraded from a hurricane to a tropical storm by meteorologists who have tracked its progress across the Atlantic.The met office said: Probably the most noticeable thing really is the warm air."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/NINTCHDBPICT000434568271.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"freshers week 2018 students party too hard","story":"Heavy-drinking

My ten-year-old found the first after biting into one and brought the rest to me.“I was shocked to see a pin sticking out of the one she bit and decided to squash the others in case and that’s when we found two others.Earlier this month, Hoani Hearne, 21, was rushed to hospital with severe abdominal pain after swallowing half a needle inside a strawberry.He and friend Joshua Gane bought a punnet of strawberries from a Brisbane branch.Other pins were found inside more strawberries, Mr Hearne alleges."},{"url":null,"title":"madrid tube blast commuter tablet explodes","story":"The incident occurred when a commuter’s computer tablet exploded and terrorism has been ruled out.The blast occurred on a Line 9 train travelling towards Paco de Lucia at Principe de Vergara tube station in the Spanish capital.At least six people have reportedly been hurt including the owner of the tablet and travellers sitting nearby.The device is believed to belong to a woman who had it in her bag.Local reports said the blast caused scenes of panic among commuters who mistook it for a terror attack.Police and paramedics have been sent to the scene.Large amounts of smoke was seen coming out of the carriage after the explosion.Commuter Juan Teixera tweeted: “A tube was evacuated because a tablet exploded.

The moment I started cooking I was in tears. I didnt know why though. I was just excited to be back in the kitchen again.Word started to spread the mums from my sons school came along and they told their friends, too.

The Cowgirl Cafe - made headlines with a photo of Jesus face miraculously appearing in a pancake in 2014.Christ has also been spotted in bird poo, an MRI of a mans heart, and several frying pans.Not to mention the countless times hes appeared in toast.Miraculous icons bearing the faces of Jesus or the Virgin Mary are known as acheiropoieta, meaning icons made without hands.These are images which are approved of by Christians as authentically showing the holy figures.Famous examples of such icons include the Image of Edessa and the Veil of Veronica.But as well as those with the seal of Christian approval, there are plenty of less well-attested examples of Jesus face appearing in odd objects including buildings, rocks, and food.The scientic explanation for many of the sightings people claim to have had of Jesus is due to a phenomenon called pareidolia.Pareidolia describes the brains over-sensitivity to finding patterns in completely random information, such that faces can sometimes be seen on inanimate objects."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/NINTCHDBPICT000434623003.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"lib dems brexit referendum","story":"The party voted to adopt a new policy which would see the Government tell the EU we no longer want to leave in March next year.The controversial plan emerged as anti-Brexit campaigner Gina Miller told Lib Dem activists that quitting the EU is like WW2.The party’s longstanding policy is to fight for a second referendum on Brexit which could overturn the result of the 2016 vote.But at the Lib Dem conference in Brighton, party members voted to adopt a more radical policy which might see Brexit reversed on the say-so of Parliament -

Dividing the opposition – as the SDP did in the 80s when they cemented Maggie Thatcher in No10 – would be a fresh gt to the Tories. Listen for two minutes to the Labour kamikazes hell-bent on destroying their left-wing leader. It becomes clear some so-called moderates would prefer the Tories to Jeremy Corbyn as Prime Minister. In Brighton this week, Vince Cable’s shop-soiled Liberal Democrats seem so contaminated by the disastrous ConDem coalition they have nothing to lose from starting again. But let nobody be under any illusion – the governing party would immediately benefit from what would be billed as a realignment of politics. Conservatives understand that they rule by sticking together. A party that last split in 1846 over the Corn Laws is the most likely to survive Brexit basically intact.  Labour malcontents such as Chris Leslie and Chuka Umunna – who are part of a dozen-strong group toying with following Thatcher-admiring maverick Frank Field out of the party – are mistaken  they think the grass is greener on the yellow side. Cable enjoyed more parties than Katie Price before settling on the Lib Dems. Behind his lugubrious air of a funeral director officiating at his own burial he is trying to recruit a Labour terracotta army to guard his tomb. I fail to see how a new Liberal-SDP Alliance could deliver what evaded the originals in the 80s. Then the Gang of Four, who led almost 30 defectors from Labour, were substantial politicians. No disrespect intended to Umunna or Leslie, but they are not a Roy Jenkins, Shirley Williams or David Owen. Bill Rodgers perhaps – the one everybody forgets.

The second EU referendum backer also trashed a leading campaign for a second EU referendum, saying she doesn\u0027t like its name. Ms Miller spoke to journalists today after her speech to the Lib Dem conference in Brighton - where she called for a public vote on Britain\u0027s Brexit deal to stop the lies and the deceit. During her speech to hundreds of activists, Ms Miller told them their reasonable voices against leaving the EU were being drowned out and suppressed. But afterwards she was careful to distance herself from all main political parties, people who want to stop Brexit, and a leading campaign for a second EU referendum .  I\u0027m not aligned to any party and I don\u0027t intend to be, she said - adding she would speak at other conferences too  she could. It comes after the activist, who won a Supreme court battle which gave MPs the final say on triggering Brexit, posed atop the White Clfs of Dover and launched a fact-checking website called End The Chaos. Wearing an end the chaos! badge, she was asked today how she would encourage people who want to stop Brexit. But she told journalists: I wish you would all stop saying this. You know, it\u0027s really not helpful. All of you around here, stop saying \u0027stop Brexit\u0027. It\u0027s really not helpful! What you should be talking about is the fact we\u0027ve got 10 weeks to come up with a deal. And  we don\u0027t come up with a deal, the government should put it back to the people. Despite her comments, Ms Miller said she would back a referendum with three options - the government\u0027s Brexit deal, no deal, and remaining in the EU.  She added the EU had already rejected the Chequers deal, which is not viable, and she would remain and reform inside the EU  she had her way. However, Ms Miller did not support the phrase People\u0027s Vote, which is the name of a leading campaign for a second referendum backed by several MPs. She said: I don\u0027t like the phrase. Also, I don\u0027t know how they can tell it\u0027s not going to be a general election. It\u0027s sort of almost presuming you understand the political landscape and exactly what will happen next. From my view, it\u0027s not defined enough.

Clare Foges, David Cameron\u0027s ex-speechwriter, declared the lefties have a point that Universal Credit leaves people in debt, depression and anxiety about whether children can be sustained on sliced bread alone. And she warned further screw-ups could turn into poison and tragedy for the Conseratives in the next election - not to mention a tragedy for the millions of Brits struggling to claim it. The benefit once trumped by Mr Cameron - in his speeches, no less - has replaced six payments for more than a million people and will ramp up its rollout in January. But experts and Tory founder Iain Duncan Smith warn it does not fulfil its aim of making work pay after billions were slashed from its budget. It has been blighted by delays and evidence soaring numbers of families need foodbanks, fall behind on rent and struggle to pay the gas bill.  The National Audit Office has sounded the alarm while the Resolution Foundation think tank has warned 1.8million working families will see incomes drop.  Ms Foges, who joined Mr Cameron in 2008 and was nicknamed the PM\u0027s larynx, broke ranks today after UC was slammed by Jeremy Corbyn and the Archbishop of Canterbury.   Taking aim at Tory welfare chief Esther McVey , she branded ministers tin-eared for allowing the system to pick up speed even as the engine splutters.  She wrote in The Times: Political etiquette suggests we pick a side and stick to it. Heckle those on the other team and back-slap your own. Sorry, no can do. On this the lefties have a point.  The government must listen to sense on Universal Credit, show some humility, and delay the national roll-out of the benefit until its current problems are resolved. She predicted thousands more left in limbo, falling into limbo, heading to the food bank in a year\u0027s time in what would be poison to [Tory] electoral chances and a political tragedy. Work and Pensions Secretary Esther McVey previously outlined several reforms to Universal Credit, including reducing the waiting time from six weeks to five and improving housing transition payments.

Glamour girl Taylor Rose, 26, has taken to Twitter to tout her old breast implants after inflating her latest pair to a whopping 30H. And she hopes that she may be able to partly cover the cost of her recent operation after dedicated fans filled her inbox with cash offers. Currently, the highest bid is \u0026pound1,500 but the auction is set to continue for a further week.  Phone-in star Taylor, of Northamptonshire, said: “I wasn’t planning to do this at all. I had no idea people were interested in things like this. “But when I said I was going to have another operation, I started receiving offers. “So I thought, why not?” Taylor was a 30G but wanted to go even bigger and when she mentioned it to her fans online, several asked  they could buy her old implants when they were removed.  She went under the kne last week and told her doctor of her plans. He agreed to save the manky old silicone enhancements, but only  the adult star signed a form confirming that she wanted to keep them. Taylor said: “I think he thought I was mad. “But when I woke up, he had cleaned them and wrapped them in packages.  “He’d even labelled which one was my left and right implant.” The popular cam girl hopes to be able to sell the implants for thousands, but insists she will throw in postage and packaging for free. And her friends and family think her latest stunt is hilarious. Taylor joked: “They think its funny but they’re not surprised by it. “I’m quite a spontaneous person so when someone got in touch and asked  they could buy them, I just thought ‘why not’.

The retired agent doubts that the two Russian suspects, using the aliases Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Bochirov, are plausible as killers. The pair, who are suspected of poisoning the Skripals, were spotted numerous times on CCTV and entered the country on Russian passports. Choosing to remain anonymous, the ex-spy said the two men, who claimed to be visiting Salisbury as tourists, could have been “watchers”. In this case, their role would have been to report on security around the Skripal family home before passing information to the real hit squad.  Petrov and Bochirov used Russian passports to fly to Britain and were spotted by a host of cameras while on their intelligence mission, according to reports. But the former Russian spy said the GRU, Russia\u0027s spy unit, would not have sent assassins to Britain using Russian passports, according to newspaper Moskovsky Komsomolets. Nor would the real liquidators have been so inept at avoiding CCTV cameras. “Nowadays it is no problem to make a high quality foreign passport for any country,” he boasted. “If it had been needed to send real liquidators for a serious task, then, for example, a citizen of Latvia and a citizen of the Dominican Republic would have entered the country.  “And when the task was completed, the citizen of Hungary and a citizen of Puerto Rico would have left the country.” The GRU - which is part of the Russian defence ministry - always had “strict rules” on assassinating enemies, said the former agent. “Each liquidation operation is designed in detail,” he explained. “Several options for escape are worked out.” Schemes for “liquidating unlucky liquidators” were also drawn up. He insisted: “There is an option that Petrov and Boshirov were not liquidators - but performed some minor task.” They might have “kept an eye on the area and passed information to the real liquidators”.  His account is likely to be dismissed by Britain as another bid by Moscow to muddy the water amid overwhelming evidence of the links of Petrov and Bochirov to the GRU. Moscow has already come up with dozens of versions, according to the UK. But unusually the former GRU staffer conceded that the Russians use death squads, and might have done so in the Skripal case. “Of course, such people exist, not only in the Russian secret service but in any other too,” he said. He also claimed that the pair seen on CCTV may have been replaced by actors for the stilted RT broadcast last week when they went public to deny any involvement. He said the main question about the suspects is  they are really Petrov and Boshirov.  “It might well have been like this: the British secret service located two people and considered them to be liquidators. “And the Russian authorities quickly found two similar looking guys and ‘appointed’ them Petrov and Boshirov.” Unimpressed with their performance, he said: “Somebody just did not spend much time searching - and first two suitable guys from the service were taken… “They are soldiers and could not disobey the order.” The pair in Salisbury should have been taught to watch out for CCTV cameras and mask their traces, he said. “The problem is that in England, as far as I know, the density of such cameras is very high. “So at the stage of preparation the task had to be dferent – not to avoid the cameras but to mask well. “How to hide traces?

The footage shows JJ bolt upright in his bed as strange noises can be heard in the background and an orb arcs across the screen.  The Staffordshire bull terrier sometimes refuses to sleep in his bedroom and will cower in the hall so owner Gary James Park set up the camera to watch over him.  After capturing the strange footage, Gary, 30, from Widnes, Cheshire, says he wants a spiritualist to come out and check his home.  He and 12-year-old JJ live in a \u0026pound145,000 property that he bought brand-new just 18 months ago. The home is on the site of an old sorting depot with no reports of deaths, he says. Gary, a route planner at a chauffeur company, posted the video to social media with the caption: “So JJ sometimes gets scared and won’t sleep in his bedroom. “I wondered why so I put a memory card in his doggy camera then looked back at it on Monday night.” In the clip, JJ can be seen ruffling a duvet in an attempt to put it in a more comfortable position. His pushes the duvet to one side before he starts to scratch it trying to pull it back.  The dog finally finds a comfortable position where he is seen sitting down and a weird growling noise is heard in the background. JJ is then seen pricking his ears and turns his head to the side and a subdued voice can be heard saying what may be the word “out”. White orbs can just be seen floating around the dog. He then slightly ducks his head and his ears go back into a defensive position as  it is trying to find the cause of the strange noise. The white orbs soon disappear after the weird noise has left the room and JJ makes a slight whimper before he goes back to fixing his bed. Gary said: “For a few months on some nights JJ would get scared and not sleep in his room.  “On Monday, September 3 he got scared and wouldn’t sleep in his room so the next day I looked back and just as he got scared there was a bang in his room. I didn’t think anything of it as it could have been anything. “Last Monday, I had just gone to bed when I heard JJ get up again so the next day I watched the video back and heard the voice. My heart nearly stopped when I heard it. “I’ve tried everything to figure out what it was without success, I have checked the exterior CCTV and no one was walking past, there were no windows open and it isn’t adjoined to any houses. “I have noticed every time I look back when something has happened there has always been those white orb things flying around.  On nights when nothing has happened there are no orbs, the room is completely clear. “I was thinking about sleeping in the room but I’m already freaked out enough.” Gary was told by someone who saw the video the orbs that can be seen floating around him are good orbs that are protecting him. He added: “I am trying to find someone who does spiritual readings to come round and give a reading. I’m not going to mention anything first to see  anything is said about it. “I don’t know about getting it blessed. I don’t know  I believe in ghosts, I’m 50/50 on it.

I bring the handset to my ear again and hear his dads groan: “Oh Gosh, they killed him, I hear him say, “They killed my Kyron”.   Then more cries. My brain is trying to process the words I seem to be hearing over and over again.    Kyron’s dad’s voice seems to be in a distance, its fading away. I cannot hear him anymore. In fact I cannot hear anything. I look at the television I see the lips moving but hear no sound. I think I may be going into shock.   Everything is spinning I stand up. I hear my voice. \u0027Where is he? What hospital is he in?\u0027 Still in disbelief I await a response. Nausea is rising.   There was no answer just screams tears wailing. I ask again irritation now forming: “What hospital is he in?” he is speaking now I take down the name, Manchester Royal infirmary. With a muttered thank you.   I hang up, frozen in shock I start to call the hospital in Manchester’  She then recounts her trip from London to Manchester\u0027s Royal Infirmary were medics were treating her son.  After what felt like forever, I arrive. They are waiting for me outside Two plain-clothes police officers, a male and female officer, stood looking at me, concern already on their faces. I felt as though I had stepped out of a patrol car into an episode of Law and Order. My body shakes as I walk towards them. They began to speak   Your son has been stabbed” the lady officer says.   How many times?” I ask,   Just the once” she replies.   “Where?” I brace myself for her response.   “The heart” she says then continues with her update.   I cannot hear them. Tears have escaped my eyes “Sorry” the female officer says, as she strokes my arm.   She realises her words are ripping my heart into a thousand pieces. I fade in and out. A doctor is in front of me, when did he arrive? Then like I had been given a shot of adrenaline, I was brought back into the moment as he says….   ‘”Kyron has been stabbed in the heart. He arrived with a faint pulse, he was found groaning, unable to speak and has lost a lot of blood.   “ Paramedics did all they could. His heart stopped upon arrival, he went into cadiac arrest. We opened him up in A\u0026ampE, but it took us 40 minutes to get his heart started again. We rushed him to theatre, but then he had another cardiac arrest, lasting 20 minutes.    “His brain was starved of oxygen for over an hour. We are still working on him, but we fear he is brain dead and we cannot stop the bleeding. He is very critical with a one per cent chance of survival. If he does pull through, I am sorry, your son will be severely brain damaged.”   They speak to me alone to spare those in the waiting room from hearing the devastation. Again, I am screaming, I cannot breathe. I am crying, I am falling, I am becoming dizzy. I fall, it\u0027s dark.   My older sister Glenna is here, I call to her distraught all I can say is her name. I call her over and over again, it is becoming dficult to breathe, I am hyperventilating. Glenna holds onto me, no more words. We hold each other tightly and we cry.   October 18, 2017   I make my way to the side of the bed and whisper into his ears “Mummy is here now darling, sorry I took so long. Sorry I was not there to hold you. I am here now, wake up and I promise I am going to take you home. You can have whatever you want, just please wake up”.   I kiss Kyron on his forehead, it felt strange, he feels cool and clammy. There is swelling to the left side of his head which is surrounded by an aggressive bruise. “Did they hit him?” I ask the nurse. “No, that bruising is from the blood loss” she casually says as she continues to write her reports.   Kyron looks really tall, I do not remember him being so tall.   Kyron’s dad is standing on the other side of the bed. “Papa” he says, his voice shakes, he leans forward, kisses his son “Papa” he says again, and then come the tears, he sobs.   His dad is broken, weakened by his sorrow, unsure what to say “Papa” his voice is breaking. He punches the air, looks over at Kyron, looks at me then sobs uncontrollably. His anguish triggers my tears. I join him, lower my head and cry. Please wake up Kyron, I am here to take you home.

She is a woman not only out of her depth, has not only floundered for more than a decade, but has no idea where she\u0027s gone wrong. It\u0027s hard to see her without thinking of a fly batting itself against a window until it expires, able to see the fresh air but unable to find it.  If she reads this - which she might, because she defines herself only by what others think of her - she\u0027ll assume I\u0027m a Left-wing liberal about to rail against her Right-wing freedom of speech. No, Katie. Someone who knows more than you is going to explain how the hatred has suffocated you.  We both have epilepsy - mine very mild, hers very severe. The condition strikes in her sleep, led to her being expelled from Sandhurst, to break vertebrae and frequently dislocate her shoulders. She recently had brain surgery that ended the seizures but left her with a hole in her skull and needing to re-learn how to climb stairs.  She blames the medication she has needed since young for the fact her oldest daughter is autistic and her youngest was born with a deformed hip that required many surgeries to correct. Those would be enough disability for most people to deal with. But Katie has an extra one - a mistaken belief that she\u0027s a journalist.  Let\u0027s not be precious about the Street of Shame. It is a trade, not a profession, and the only qualication necessary is a level of enthusiasm bordering on mental illness. But somewhere along the line most journalists get training. They get it from a practical degree, a vocational course, or at worst from paying attention to people who\u0027re doing it already.  Katie became a journalist because first she became a media star, and she managed THAT with what she called being outspoken and everyone else called being a right cow.   On The Apprentice in 2006 she hogged the camera by making amusingly-nasty remarks about maternity leave, fat people, and fellow contestants. She resigned at the end of the penultimate show citing childcare concerns, which others mocked because she had known what she was getting into.  But it\u0027s perhaps worth noting both that her concerns were for two disabled daughters, and also that she was mocked mainly because she\u0027d been so happy to mock others.   Katie sold her story for six-figure sums, had celebrity spats, and was pictured in flagrante in a field with someone else\u0027s husband. She got a regular column in her local paper the Exeter Express \u0026amp Echo , but it ended after an online poll found 84% of the readers wanted her fired. It was a hint she did not take.   She was invited onto TV as a guarantee of ratings. Three years ago Buzzfeed reported a former staffer at This Morning said she was always willing to cause controversy from the word go.  Such programmes involve a chat with a producer in advance, and Katie would immediately come up with a firm line on something, and then wheeled on-air to spout it with little thought from either her or producers about where it would end.  So in 2013 when she told Philip and Holly she wouldn\u0027t let her children play with someone called Tyler or Chardonnay or named after geography, it was pointed out one of her children was called India and the clip went viral.   Katie learned to make money by being rude and unapologetic, and the media learned to shore up their audience figures with a wingnut. Inevitably, she was offered a national newspaper column, a place in the Big Brother house, and more opprobrium as the hate multiplied. In 2015 she used her column to denounce migrants as cockroaches, and it quietly disappeared before she popped up at another website which racked up \u0026pound150,000 damages plus costs for her groundless claim that a pair of Muslim brothers banned from travelling to Disneyland were linked to al Qaeda. She met holocaust deniers, tweeted about being with crew of a Save the Children ship she didn\u0027t board, and had repeated applications to join UKIP rejected.  She made a habit out of getting it wrong. She moved on to LBC, left after calling for a final solution to Islamic terror, was questioned but not charged over alleged hate crimes, and more recently staged a picture with children at a school without their parents\u0027 or teachers\u0027 permission, a gross breach of journalistic ethics. She has her own website and, one hopes, has invested in some defamation legal insurance.   Now she\u0027s been sued over a defamatory tweet, lost her home, and had to enter an agreement with her creditors. All of it is due to the simple fact that she attempted to be a journalist without any of the necessary skills.   If Katie had experience of working in the media before she became its favourite monster, she\u0027d have known that what you don\u0027t say is just as important as what you do. By all means say you\u0027re snobby about the name Charmaine, but it might be an idea to know Shakespeare was happy to use it for one of his characters.  If you make a habit of racking up legal bills for your employer, be careful with what you publish on social media. If you are caught lying, stop doing it. Steer clear of people with swastikas in their Twitter handles and  you don\u0027t know what defamation is, look it up.  But more than anything else the lesson that Katie needed to learn was this: that becoming a hate figure is a viable but short media career. She chose a path that was an ever-decreasing spiral of bile, and it was only ever going to lead her into peril. I\u0027m not sure she knows how she got there.  She started out as entertainment, and ended up with the twin Pyrrhic victories of being praised by Donald Trump and winning an IPSO ruling against the Daily Mirror about the fact she was not detained for taking ketamine in South Africa, but for spreading racial hatred.  Now she\u0027s broke and the only people still paying attention are creditors and knicker-snfing Nazis.  Katie was not a journalist but a controversialist - built and brought down by her ignorance of how journalism works.  Her name is flung at others who make a much better fist of it, along with accusations they all want to be like her. Nothing could be further from the truth - journalists, above all things, want to be right. Katie was just a story, and it\u0027s a sad indictment of the media that it relied for attention on a sick woman spouting proto-fascist lies.   But the principle blame is on Katie herself. She had enough clues, from as early as her first interview after leaving The Apprentice when Nick Hewer said her new brand had made you famous, but it\u0027s made you loathed. And where\u0027s it going to take you now? She never seems to have asked where it would lead.  Even with training, she would never have made much of a journo. She has a thick skin and bloody-mindedness, but seems to lack empathy, accuracy, self-doubt or persuasiveness. She is a curiosity, but doesn\u0027t have any. The first rule of journalism is \u0027never become the story\u0027. Not just because it\u0027s professionally embarrassing, but because all copy finishes the same way - with the word \u0027ends\u0027.   * Fleet Street Fox\u0027s new book, A Bluffer\u0027s Guide To Journalism, is published in March.

Gerry McCann, 50, accepted the interview to tackle the taboo surrounding men with mental health issues. The eminent cardiologist has said that he will discuss his torment in honest, personal and sometimes painful terms for the Radio 4 show. The programme is set to feature Pearl, by Simon Armitage, a modern translation of a medieval poem about a father\u0027s grief after losing his daughter. Gerry said: As a family we\u0027d worked with Simon Armitage before, and know what a sensitive, thoughtful writer he is.  When I read the Pearl poem, I could see echoes in it with Madeleine\u0027s situation and our loss. I decided it was a good opportunity to say something about the special bond between fathers and daughters, thinking that speaking openly might help other men in similar positions. It feels like the right time. Simon Armitage said: Pearl is one of the most moving poems in the language, written by a man grieving over the loss of his young daughter. While translating it into modern English I kept thinking of the McCann family and their daughter Madeleine.  I\u0027d written a poem for the family to mark the one thousandth day of her disappearance, spending some time with Kate and talking to her about le without Madeleine and the campaign to find her. He added: Gerry\u0027s voice hasn\u0027t been heard as much, and after reading the poem he agreed to give an extended interview, to tell his side of the story in terms of how men deal with loss and grief in a world where they\u0027re usually expected to stay strong and silent.  The couple promised never to stop looking for their little girl, who would now be 15, after her sudden disappearance sparked a worldwide search in 2007. Kate and Gerry had ed to their apartment in Algarve\u0027s Praia da Luz after having dinner in a nearby restaurant when they found her bed empty. Their twins, Sean and Amelie, who were toddlers at the time, remained in their cots. Her whereabouts still remains a mystery despite a \u0026pound12million police investigation. They also set up a \u0027Find Maddie Fund\u0027 and have raised around \u0026pound750,000 in a bid to find her.

Marc Caulton, 33, left the defenceless child with the horric injuries after attacking him on several occasions. A court heard the distressed youngster was rushed to Nottingham\u0027s Queen’s Medical Centre with a limp arm in October 2017. An x-ray confirmed his arm was badly fractured while further scans confirmed another seven breaks in both of his arms and legs.  Doctors concluded the injuries had occurred on more than one occasion and were a result of blunt force trauma, police said.  Caulton, of Stapleford, Nottinghamshire, was arrested and gave a series of excuses for the child\u0027s broken bones. These were all rejected by paediatric experts. He eventually admitted causing the injuries and pleaded guilty to grievous bodily harm, causing a child to suffer serious injury and child neglect in July this year. On Friday, he was jailed for four years, handed a letime restraining order and ordered to pay court costs at Nottingham Crown Court.  Detective Constable Chris Taylor, of Nottinghamshire Police\u0027s Child Abuse Investigation Unit, said after the case: There’s something to be said for a man who chooses to abuse a child so defenceless, a child so young they haven’t even developed the ability to ask for help. “Caulton is manipulative and has caused a cascade of devastation and confusion for the child’s family. “They now have to move on from this without any explanation as to why their son suffered such horric injuries, but I hope knowing that he is behind bars will give them some closure.

The UK has seen increased interest in \u0027Flat Earth\u0027 groups - where members insist that our planet is shaped as a disk rather than a spherical globe.  Some even claim that we have been \u0027lied to in the worst way\u0027 about its shape. The Flat Earth concept goes back to ancient Greece, but the outmoded thinking has undergone a mini revival thanks to the power of the web. Groups cropping up across the country apparently agree that \u0027mistrust\u0027 of authority and the Internet are a factor in their growth.  They also believe the Earth is not set within an infinite universe , but is completely alone, Chester Live reports   Members of Chester Flat Earth Group, who attracted 25 people at a recent public meeting, say that it is the ability to interrogate online information provided by organisations like NASA that has presented their big opportunity to challenge the ‘lies’. Some believe Earth may be covered in a glass or plasma dome with ice walls around the edge to contain the oceans. They claim Space, the planets, the stars, rockets, the moon landings and the International Space Station  are all fake, but presented to the public as real. Theories as to how this is done include the use of computer generated images, filming in secret studios and even underwater shoots. Flat Earther Vic Button, 75, from Farndon, Cheshire, believes it’s one way in which the powerful maintain control. “It’s to make you feel as though you are unimportant, a little speck in a massive universe,” says Vic. “My aim now, for le, is to awaken people to what I see as the truth because they have been lied to, deceived on a massive scale.”  A signicant piece of evidence as far as Flat Earthers is concerned is their claim the curvature of the earth is not borne out in reality. An electrical engineer by trade, Vic said: “When you went to school – this is why I can get angry at it – there’s a ball, a globe in the classroom and they never said ‘Oh, also it could be flat or whatever’. They let it go into your head that it was like that and all the books around you. You go home and you watch Star Wars and all that and rockets going up. Now that’s all in your head. “When you research it you think rockets can’t do 25,000 mph, seven miles per second, it’s just ridiculous. They have to say that for the distances they’re saying they’d have to go. What about the fuel for it? And how can we get past the Van Allen belt, all scientists agree there’s a Van Allen belt, with fantastic temperatures. How do they get through that?” But haven’t we got pictures of the moon landings and of views of the earth taken from the moon and the International Space Station? “From the ISS, which is fake, they’ve a got a picture of the earth, which is fake, moving round but there are no images of the earth spinning round in space at all,” said Vic.  ”Lots and lots of people come to us knowing we didn’t go to the moon – that’s silly. For anybody to look at the information for five minutes would know. It’s nonsense. It’s become an absolute joke – from hammering in the plaque, the shadows are wrong. You can go on and on and on.” Vic and his fellow Flat Earther John, 49, who does not wish to give his full name, offer the following claims: ■ A photo of a moon buggy is fake because it is dust free and ‘clean as a whistle’ ■ Videos in the International Space Station are made in a secret studio ■ Footage of astronauts outside the ISS are actually made under water – with one clip accidentally revealing a man wearing a snorkel and scuba tank ■ Video shot through the ISS window appears to show a fly buzzing around in space ■ An astronaut’s hand and objects disappear in videos revealing flaws in the faked footage ■ The moon exists but isn’t a solid object ■ Our sun is not 93m miles away but much closer – and could be manmade Chester Flat Earthers believe scientists and the 500-plus people who have been to Space are part of the conspiracy. They claim these people have had to sign the Official Secrets Act and been paid to keep quiet.  Vic even alleges some astronauts have actually been killed because they ‘knew too much and were going to spill the beans’. The pair believe space disasters were faked to finesse the illusion. They claim the Space Shuttle Challenger was blown up deliberately in 1986 but with nobody on board and reckon all seven crew members are alive and well to this day. “Michael J Smith, who was allegedly on board, he now currently works for some university in America under the same name. He even looks the same,” claims John, who prefers to trust his own senses and instincts rather than what he is told. The Flat Earthers, who hold monthly meetings and street stalls in Chester city centre, get constantly ridiculed but John, who works part-time laying on activities for older people, doesn’t care. “I get laughed at. I get called an idiot. But these people are just showing they are messed up in their head, he says. Meanwhile, a Flat Earther who believes that we don\u0027t live on a globe is touring the country - to spread the truth in a secret location.

The Duchess of Sussex made several secret visits to the area before her wedding to Prince Harry, and met a group of women who came together to cook for friends, family and neighbours whose lives had been torn apart by the disaster. When she discovered they could only offer the Hubb Community Kitchen service two days a week because of funding, she suggested they released a cookbook to raise extra cash. Now the idea has become a reality, and Meghan has today released details of the book - Together: Our Community Cookbook - including a three minute video of her cooking in the kitchen with the women. She says: Together is a cookbook, but it\u0027s also the story of a west London community who gathered together in a kitchen and discovered the healing power of sharing food.  In January 2018, as I was settling into my new home in London, I met a group of women whose lives had been affected by the Grenfell fire. They had decided to get together to cook fresh food for their families and their neighbours. And so, for two days every week, these women were able to cook and share their delicious recipes together.  I\u0027m proud to be supporting this cookbook Together. We hope you enjoy it as much as we do. The book, which is supported by The Royal Foundation and published by Penguin Random House companies,showcases over 50 recipes from women whose community was affected by the Grenfell Tower fire. In the book\u0027s foreword she writes: I immediately felt connected to this community kitchen it is a place for women to laugh, grieve, cry and cook together. Melding cultural identities under a shared roof, it creates a space to feel a sense of normalcy – in its simplest form, the universal need to connect, nurture, and commune through food, through crisis or joy – something we can all relate to…  Through this charitable endeavour, the proceeds will allow the kitchen to thrive and keep the global spirit of community alive. The duchess went to meet those affected at least twice at the beginning of the year, including a trip to the Al Manaar community mosque, which lies in the shadow of the charred shell of Grenfell Tower. She was without Prince Harry but was accompanied by a royal protection officer and one of the prince’s aides. The visits were compared to many made by her late mother-in-law Princess Diana, who often carried out charity work in secret. Speaking at the time, a leading Grenfell community member said: Meghan\u0027s visits mean so much to us. She has a special place in our hearts. A royal source added: Ms Markle has regularly been making private visits to organisations as she gets to know the charity sector.

Worry set in after a screenshot of a Facebook post, which seemingly belongs to a Slimming World consultant, was shared on Twitter. The post in the group, titled \u0027Zoes Loughborough SW\u0027 reads: a 175g pot of Mullerlight  will be 1 syn. The popular yogurts, which come in a iety of flavours, have previously always been \u0027free\u0027 on the Slimming World plan. This meant dieters could eat them without having to worry about subtracting numbers from their daily allowance of up to 15 Syns.

Contact nicola.oakley@mirror The post also revealed that instant mashed potato and tinned pasta shapes in tomato sauce  will be increasing in Syn value. The Slimming World plan works by allowing its users to eat from a whole list of foods which are classed as \u0027free\u0027. They also have allowances for \u0027healthy extras\u0027 every day and encourage \u0027speed food\u0027 - fruits and vegetables - to get the right amount of nutrients in members\u0027 diets. Treats are still allowed in moderation. Foods have a \u0027Syn\u0027 value and people following the Slimming World plan can eat between 5 and 15 \u0027Syns\u0027 per day and still expect to lose weight on a weekly basis. Anyone eating a \u0027free\u0027 Muller Light every day will now have to lose 1 Syn from their daily allowance.  A Slimming World spokesperson said: “Our nutrition team routinely review our Food Optimising eating plan to ensure it’s up to date, in line with the latest guidance, and to take into account feedback from our 5,000 Consultants and 900,000 Slimming World members. “As part of this process, we’ve been looking at how to give our vegan members more choice, and we’re delighted that a number of vegan foods, including canned jackfruit and plain and unsmoked seitan, can now be enjoyed freely by slimmers following our plan. “In addition, a number of products – fat-free flavoured yogurts, tinned pasta shapes in tomato sauce and instant mashed potato – that were previously Free on our plan, meaning they could be eaten without weighing, counting or measuring, will now have a small Syn value .

Lorna Webb was married, had children and was once flush with cash, before her \u0026pound600-a-day drug habit took hold. She has shared her heartbreaking story with the Cambridgeshire Live . Lorna clearly attempts to keep up a good appearance despite having slept outdoors in all weathers for many years. Now she struggles to eat but she once she owned two properties in Cambridge and worked in catering for many years in Wolfson College and other kitchens.  Several years ago - Lorna can\u0027t quite remember - she inherited \u0026pound250,000 from her family. This was to be spent on drugs - and Lorna\u0027s innate generosity and kindness meant that she spent a lot of her inheritance on other struggling addicts.  She once was flush with cash and was spending almost \u0026pound18,000 a month on drugs or \u0026pound600 a day. Lorna now had the inheritance and started to spend. She said: When I got the money I was living locally, staying round friends and everything. My mates are all addicts so there was no way that I was going to leave them without. If I could have balanced it a bit more I would have done something with it. I am glad the money went to the area. The dollar has got invested. I don\u0027t mean any disrespect to my family. I lost a lot of weight and had a nervous breakdown. The heroin stopped me eating. It\u0027s very painful when you put weight back on your body and then you lose it. When you have a nervous breakdown it is very painful to your body. Lorna said she then attempted to rent a home in Cambridge but even with a small fortune in the bank she said no-one would let a property to her.  She said: I am an addict myself and I was dossing around dferent places. I tried to get a place but they weren\u0027t having none of it. That\u0027s what I don\u0027t understand. I had local connections and I was trying to rent a place. I had money to buy. I would have got a boat. Somebody must have been using my ID, plus the fact that I am adopted which doesn\u0027t help. Lorna spent most of her inheritance on feeding her habit and giving money away to addicts. She has little to show for it now and lives a hand-to-mouth existence. And in a heartbreaking moment, Lorna admitted her regret in not giving more of the money to her daughters and how she longs to see them again. The day before she spoke to Cambridgeshire Live she thought her daughter had driven past the spot in Mill Road where Lorna can be found on most days. She said: I guess I bought a few little bits and pieces - some jewellery. I bought both my girls some school kits. I love my girls. I have heard that they are doing really well. I hope so. I haven\u0027t seen them. I don\u0027t know  that was my daughter that I waved to the other day. I am not sure where they are. I would just like to see that they are safe. Sasha will be coming up to her mid-twenties and Faith eight years behind. They are both firing on all cylinders. They have all their pistons.  Lorna spoke of her le on the street and the camaraderie she felt with other rough sleepers. And she told of how many of her pals had been lost to drugs and violence. She said: It\u0027s not too bad on the street. We have a good crew around and we all look out for each other. Everyone has their own situation but no one will let anyone down. We\u0027ve all got each others backs here. We\u0027ve just lost some friends recently, but there\u0027s no way anyone is going to go unnoticed. No chance. That\u0027s not happening. Lorna also knew Peter Anderson, also known as Blue, who died from multiple stab wounds after being attacked on Stourbridge Common on July 25. Two London men have been charged with murder. Lorna said Blue was a gentle man and was shocked when she learned he had died. She added: I knew Blue. It is surreal to me like it hasn\u0027t happened. It\u0027s just surreal. I don\u0027t get it. And she spoke of the trouble in Mill Road and how traders wanted to clean up the area. She said: I score here but I\u0027ve not noticed much trouble. It\u0027s probably other people getting involved and other people coming down here  the truth be known. I know people locally and there are things that they go through. But I think it\u0027s other people getting involved. Asked  she would have done things dferently, she said: I had wanted to bless my children. I wanted something for them. Lorna has been through the courts over the years. In March 2012 armed police were called in after Lorna was seen carrying a kne by an ambulance crew. She was jailed for eight months after Cambridge Crown Court heard she had armed herself for protection before a confrontation with another woman.

Cory Lloyd\u0027s son Jack developed the skin condition at just three months old, before it become so severe she stopped taking him out due to hurtful comments from strangers. The little boy, now three, suffered such severe dry and cracked patches of skin he needed to wear a special moisturising suit under his clothes virtually around the clock. But his le changed, according to his mum, after Cory was tagged in a Facebook post about skincare brand Childs Farm, tried it and saw his skin clear within a week. Play centre worker Cory, 23, from, Darwen, Lancashire, said: “I was sceptical as we had tried so many things, but literally a week after trying it, his skin was clear.  When Jack’s eczema was really bad, I had to stop taking him out as much as I wanted, as instead of enjoying our mother and baby bonding time, I’d be so conscious about people staring at him. “Once a lady said to her friend, ‘Look at that little boy, he’s had a terrible fall, his mum must not have been looking after him.’ I just went home and cried. “All people saw was a young mum and they judged me, but they weren’t there for the sleepless nights and countless hospital appointments. I was doing everything I could and getting nowhere.” Cory, who has another son, Alfie, one, with her joiner partner Ben Holmes, 23, said Jack seemed perfectly healthy until he reached three months, when crusty patches began to spring up on his forehead. Has your child faced a similar issue? Email webnews@trinitymirror  Thinking it was just standard dry skin, she applied special baby moisturiser – but it made little dference. Then, when the patches also began to weep, Cory consulted a doctor, who diagnosed eczema. “Within a couple of months, the eczema had spread all over Jack’s body,” she recalled. “I’d be coating him in moisturiser five times a day and tried so many dferent creams, steroids and antibiotics that the doctor prescribed, but nothing seemed to help. “He’d wake up every morning with blood on his sheets from where his skin had cracked in the night. “Eventually, I reached my wits end, went to the doctor and said, ‘I’m not leaving until I have a referral to a specialist.’”  Thankfully, when he was around 18 months old, Jack was referred to a dermatologist, who prescribed a special suit designed to keep moisture in and stop his clothes from absorbing the creams Cory was applying. Required to wear it every day under his clothes, it meant he did not want to play with the other children at nursery, as he knew running about would irritate his skin. In addition to the suit, Cory bandaged Jack’s legs and arms, in a bid to keep the moisture in. “I could bandage his limbs, but his torso was the worst place for eczema, she said. “It felt like sandpaper. He literally looked like a burns victim.” Desperate, Cory even asked doctors for an allergy test to see  something in Jack’s diet was triggering the agonising outbreaks – but a cause has never been found.

Muscly Jack Moore, 21, was dozing in a park with girlfriend Vicky Clarke when the tyres of the two-ton vehicle rolled across them. Jack suffered horrendous internal injuries including broken ribs, a collapsed lung and liver damage. But medics said the keep-fit fan – who turned to exercise and diet at 17 after hitting an obese 16st – could have been killed had it not been for his ripped washboard stomach. Jack, whose six-pack was cut away to be replaced with an 8in scar and tyre tread mark, said: The doctors said I was lucky I had more muscle otherwise I would probably have suffered more injuries. “They said I was very healthy and that was also a big factor in my recovery.”  Jack and Vicky, 19, had just cuddled down on the grass beside a river in Earlham Park, Norwich, and shut their eyes when horror struck in June 2017. The Toyota Hilux, which was going round emptying litter bins, went over both of them as onlookers screamed. Jack recalled: I opened my eyes and the truck was about a foot away from my head. I had no time to react and I just had to watch it happen. The front wheel crunched over my stomach which was really mentally distressing. It was the last thing I expected to happen and I think adrenaline kicked in so I did not feel the pain immediately. Then it drove over Vicky, stopped on her and started to reverse. I pulled myself back out from underneath it before it could run over me again. Then my stomach felt extremely painful and I knew something was seriously wrong with my body.  I pulled up my t-shirt to look at it and it was really deformed and disfugured. My belly button was not in the centre anymore, it had been pushed off to the left. The thread details of the tyre were etched into my skin and the right side of my stomach was very red. Then the pain really kicked in. I tried to scream but my lung was punctured so I couldn\u0027t really do it. A little girl was the first person who rushed over to me, bless her heart, followed by her dad. Then about 10 people were around me, telling me to breathe and stay conscious. They were asking me what my name was and what day it was. It was dficult to speak and I just wanted to curl up in a ball alone with the pain but the people around me would not let me move. I\u0027m lucky they were there because I probably would have lost even more blood internally  I had moved. Someone had called an ambulance and although it felt like an eternity waiting on the grass, it was actually really quick, we were lucky that the hospital was just one quarter of a mile away.  The truck had punctured my lung, tore my kidney in two places, tore my liver, broke two ribs and I lost one litre of blood through internal bleeding. I lost so much blood that I started slipping in and out of consiousness. I remember the police arriving and a police woman standing over me, blocking the sun from my eyes. And I vaguely remember the ambulance arriving and the paramedics giving me an epidural and gas in the park before I passed out. Jack was rushed to hospital for emergency le-saving treatment. Jack said: My next clear memory is waking up in a hospital bed. My stomach was extremely painful. I pulled back the covers and saw a huge scar running from under my nipple to my groin.  I had tubes all over me with about six cannulas in just one hand. I had a big needle in my spine for the epidural and I had another tube coming out of my arm. I panicked. I did not know what happened. Was my partner ok? My mum was by my bed and she told me Vicky had been hit but she was alive. I think I was pretty out of it with all the painkillers but then it all started flooding back to me like a dream after you\u0027ve just woken up. Jack, who is being represented by personal injury specialist Slater and Gordon in a civil case, recovered after a hospital stay but was left with problems including not being able to use the loo properly.  He was also diagnosed with PTSD.  He said: I still have abdominal pain and I was diagnosed with PTSD. Recovering psychologically has been more dficult than the physical aspects. I still get flashbacks of the moment I saw the wheel on my right side and watched as it drove over me. It was really traumatic. The park was a place where I always felt safe before. I\u0027ve gone there for years walking my dog and there are always families and children there. It’s really knocked my confidence but I\u0027m determined to get better again. I feel lucky to be alive and I hope that I can heal.” Vicky suffered broken vertebrae, a broken collarbone and a fractured sternum in the horror crush. She was admitted to hospital for treatment alongside Jack but she has since also been released.

Ami Roberts, 29, originally set up her blog Through Ami\u0027s Eyes as a way to empower other women and fight the taboo around breastfeeding in public. But after creating her website, she began to receive sexual comments on social media \u0027praising\u0027 her breasts and even had inappropriate messages from adult baby lover fetish groups. Ami, who doesn\u0027t give away the identity of her children, said: “What I don’t understand is,  there is a newspaper or magazine with page three content on it, people don\u0027t bat an eyelid. “As a society we’re used to seeing boobs used for advertisements but when they’re seen being used for the most natural reason some people don’t like it. “They get uncomfortable and feel they have a right to comment. “Then at the other end of the scale there are men who comment on my social media channels saying ‘I love your boobs’.  “I’ve written back to these men, many of whom have partners and children, asking them how they expect me to reply, should I say, ‘thanks, I’m so glad you like my boobs’? “What do they expect to achieve from this apart from making women feeling embarrassed and that they shouldn’t be feeding in public? “I’ve even had a man send a picture of himself wearing an adult diaper. I replied to him that that wasn’t the purpose of the post and then I blocked him. “I’m headstrong and very confident about feeding in public but  another mum who wasn\u0027t as confident posted pictures and received messages like that it could really put them off and that’s not fair.” She decided to blog about her breastfeeding experiences after she was shamed for feeding her son \u0027Smidge\u0027. Ami said: “I was feeding Smidge behind a partition in the caf\u0026eacute area of the gym while my other son was at a swimming lesson three months ago. “There was another group of people sat five tables away and a guy in his fties looked over, tutted and said ‘they shouldn’t be allowed to do that in here where people are eating’ and moved away. “That was my first ever negative comment and I didn’t know how to deal with it. Now I look back and wish I’d said ‘I’m not squirting it on your toast, how can you feel that you can comment on this?’ “Three months down the line this experience has spurred me on not to cover up, especially with the hot summer we’ve just had. “Putting a cover over him as he fed would have made us both hot and sweaty.  “I want women to know their rights. It’s a woman’s right to feed her baby, we’re not doing anything wrong. “If you saw a man walking down the street with no shirt on and his nipples out no matter what that man looks like nobody says anything. “Why should we as women doing something completely natural have to hide away? We shouldn’t. It’s not wrong, there’s no reason to feel any shame. “I want to help women and that’s why I’ve shared breastfeeding pictures on my social media channels to show women there’s nothing to hide. “I’ve since received comments from blog readers saying that after seeing my photos it gave them the confidence to feed in public which is great.” But sharing this empowering breastfeeding advocate message on social media has attracted unwanted attention from men who sexualise the images.  Ami said: “Since sharing these pictures there’s been a big influx of men to my Instagram account sending messages every other day who feel it’s ok to comment on my breasts. “I think sometimes it’s to try and embarrass me but 80 percent of the time it’s sexual. I don\u0027t know what they are trying to achieve other than make me sick. “I’m not putting these pictures on Instagram to display myself. I’m not wearing sexy lingerie, I’m wearing a nursing bra and I’m doing it to raise awareness of breastfeeding in public, something I’m really passionate about. Typical comments Ami receives include: ‘Nice big tits babe, keep up the content’ and ‘I want to get to know you better’. One of the more bizarre messages was from a self-professed ABDL who wrote: “I grew up home schooled my entire le in a very nurturing household. “I joined the army at 18, it was an eye opener. Now that I’m older I’ve reverted to being a little ABDL for comfort not in a sexual way, pls pls [sic] don’t take it this way. I’m just seeking somebody mature that might understand.” Ami said: “When I\u0027ve replied to people their responses have been mixed. One said ‘well I really like them and I can’t help that’ and thought that was acceptable. “Another apologised and said he didn’t think I’d read it – my argument is why send it in the first place?  “Some make excuses and say ‘sorry I didn’t mean to offend you’ whereas the adult diaper guy was told that it wasn’t what the post was about and I blocked him. “Nine out of ten of the people behind these comments wouldn’t say anything to your face but think it’s acceptable when they do it from behind a computer screen, it’s disgusting.” Ami’s husband business manager John Roberts, 29, said he was repulsed by the vile comments she was subjected to. John said: “It’s disgusting, it just shows what people expect to get away with. “They don\u0027t seem educated enough to respect women like my we who are trying to do the best by their kids.” Ami, who is a Lansinoh ambassador, said she wants to support all mums – who either choose to bottle or breastfeed their children.

Noor Nawab, from Saltley, Birmingham, claims nine-year-old Adam was left embarrassed after being singled out in front of his classmates.  The 31-year-old security worker says Adderly Primary School gave Adam the edict in front of the entire school, Birmingham Live reports.  And, he alleges, staff even made him stand up. “If there was a problem with my son’s hair, why not tell me about it or send a letter home?” said Noor.  “If they told me, I’d just ask ‘Why?’ He added: “Yes, I’m angry, but getting angry at staff gets you nowhere. He is shy and upset about it. They made him stand up in front of classmates and humiliated him.” The school says it has a clear policy on school unorm on its website. Adam has not had a haircut for years, his dad admits, and it is now beyond shoulder . “At the front, his hair is past his nose, at the back it’s beyond his shoulders,” said Noor. “It’s a fashion thing and I can’t see a problem. He has nice, long, thick hair.” He has vowed that Adam will not be visiting the barbers.  On its website, Adderley Primary describes itself as “rights respecting”. The school unorm policy states: “Whilst we respect the backgrounds, cultures and beliefs of all our families, we expect all pupils to maintain an appropriate and sensible haircut which is at the discretion of the Headteacher and School Leadership Team. “Pupils are not permitted to have any kind of patterns or lines cut into their hair. This includes ‘v’ cuts or ‘Mohican’-type styles. This also extends to patterns on eyebrows. Neither are they allowed to have articially coloured hair. It continued: “Pupils will be continually made aware of this through assemblies and ongoing school unorm monitoring by all staff. Parents will be reminded of this through newsletters and conversations with staff.

Mum-of-four Callie ed to the address alone in the early hours of July 2 this year after she was separated from Mr Murray, and awoke on a sofa in his living room. Tim Evans, prosecuting, said: She remembers Hinde and her partner Quayle at the living room door. They came at her and dragged her around like a rag doll. She ended up on the floor. Both of them were kicking her repeatedly to the head and body. She felt kicks to her face and stamping on her head. She cannot recall how it came to an end or the defendants\u0027 leaving so her belief is that she blacked out.  Her partner Jack came into the living room and asked what had happened. She told him it was Hinde and her partner. Callie was then taken to hospital and has to have an operation on her nose early next month, the court heard. Mr Murray confirmed he had asked the two women - who lived nearby - to look after his dog and had told them there was a key under the bin  they needed to gain access to his home. The court heard that Hinde had later told her boss at a local taxi firm, Stephen Brew, that she had \u0027battered Callie Rogers\u0027 head like a football\u0027. He asked her why she had hit someone and she laughed and said \u0027well, she laughed at me, but it went a bit far, added Mr Evans. She also said: \u0027We acted le wild animals\u0027, and said that police would not find anything forensically as she had burnt the clothes and trainers they had been wearing. We know that Miss Rogers had been left bleeding in the attack. Hinde, who had 38 previous convictions for violence and multiple offences, then tried to intimidate her former boss to change his statement, warning him that she would put it on Facebook in a message to his former partner.

The Met Office has issued a \u0027yellow\u0027 warning for road, rail, air and ferry delays and power cuts as winds of up to 60mph batter parts of the UK. Millions of people across Southwest England, South Wales and Central and Northern Central England are set to be affected. The warning starts at 9pm on Monday night with the disruption set to last until Tuesday at 6pm. A Met Office spokesman said: Although now expected to bring less strong winds, the remnants of Storm Helene will move northeastwards across Wales and England during Monday night and Tuesday. A spell of strong winds is expected, initially mainly in the far southwest of England and across west and south Wales. The strongest winds then transferring across the Midlands and parts of northern England during Tuesday morning and into the afternoon. Winds are likely to gust 40-50 mph quite widely across the warning area whilst some coasts and hills of southwest England and Wales could have gusts of 55-60 mph.    The Met Office has warned to expect...  Some damage to trees is possible, for example large branches or trees falling in a few places. Some delays to road, rail, air and ferry transport are likely Probably some bus and train services affected, with some journeys taking longer Delays for high-sided vehicles on exposed routes and bridges likely Some short term loss of power and other services is possible  However, forecasters expect temperatures to remain high - with a sultry 24C in some areas. Warm and humid air from the continent, combined with a tropical flow from the remnants of Helene, should lt temperatures between 21 to 24C in southern regions, but into the mid to high teens across the north.  Tuesday should start dry and sunny for England and Wales, according to forecast models. However, it will become overcast with moderate to heavy rain for south-west England, Wales, Ireland, north-west England and Scotland with fresh to strong and gusty southerly winds through the afternoon and evening. Gusts could reach 60mph in isolated spots. Heaviest rain looks likely to be across western parts, with the southeast perhaps staying dry and very warm.

Rio Bailey, 25, says the disturbing effects of the drug made him hear voices in his head and turned him into a paranoid wreck, the Stoke Sentinel reported .  The once-promising athlete was introduced to the drug last year but has vowed to never take it again as he prepares for the birth of his first child. Rio, who lives in Madeley, Stoke on Trent, said: “Since I was 18 I’ve taken MDMA and cocaine, but it’s only in the last year I’ve started experimenting with monkey dust.  “I knew someone who dealt in drugs. I got told it was like cocaine but it lasts 10 times longer. I was using it for escapism and that’s the go-to drug because it lasts so long. I would say it is 10 times stronger than coke. “There’s a euphoria to it. I’m fully aware of what I was doing when I’ve taken it, but you’ve got so much energy you just want to keep moving.  “It’s highly mentally addictive. You can start hearing voices with it. “It’s like any drug though - how it affects you depends on the person taking it.”  Staffordshire Police has revealed officers have dealt with 950 incidents associated with the drug in just three months. Meanwhile paramedics say they are regularly called to deal with users who have taken the substance, which can be bought on the streets of Stoke-on-Trent for as little as \u0026pound2. Rio said he was surprised by the number of people that were taking it, and believes it is so popular because it\u0027s so cheap. He said: “You smoke it, and it costs a couple of quid for a hit. “I would go two months without taking it, then go on a bender for a week. I’ve got anger issues and when that got triggered I would take it. “Dealers will give people their first hit for free, just so they can get people hooked. It’s so cheap.” Rio was a keen athlete before going to Manchester politan University to study sports management. He found it too expensive to continue to compete, but graduated with a degree and moved back to the area when he was 22. Monkey Dust, also known as MDPV, causes hallucinations and paranoia. People on the drug, which looks like an off-white powder, have been known to climb trees and buildings and attack people who come near them. It\u0027s from a family of drugs known as cathinones as can be bought for as little as \u0026pound2. Monkey dust can be swallowed, injected or snorted and it dampens perceptions of pain. It can also cause powerful hallucinations which lead to severe paranoia. The use of monkey dust is on the rise because of its low cost and its effects can be felt after ingesting small amounts - as little as 3mg. While Staffordshire is a known epicentre for the drug, West Midlands Ambulance Service said it has dealt with cases across the region. Paramedics have been called to 178 incidents since April involving money dust — 131 of them in North Staffordshire.    Now, he is due to become a dad in three months, and says that has been the catalyst that\u0027s made him want to change his ways. He said: “I’m not going to take it again. It would be selfish  I did, with a kid on the way. “If I was giving advice to someone thinking of taking it, I would say don’t. It’s not going to resolve any issues you have, when you come down from it your issues are going to be ten times worse.” Rio’s dad, Baz Bailey, said seeing the effect monkey dust had on his son was ‘heartbreaking’. The 48-year-old dad-of-four said: “At one stage he would be okay, then just go missing for a fortnight.

Flower headdresses and suspenders were among the items party-goers donned at the Defqon.1 festival in Sydney, Australia. Some decorated their bodies and faces with paint, while others went for masks, wigs and fancy dress costumes. Many women were pictured in bikinis and men in swim shorts. People were photographed enjoying themselves with groups of friends, but the event ended in tragedy.   Two people died, a dozen more were taken to hospital and hundreds others sought medical assistance after suspected drug overdoses at a music festival in Sydney, the police said.  A 23-year-old man and a 21-year-old woman died on Saturday after collapsing at the Defqon.1 festival, the police said. Two of the 13 hospitalised people remain in critical condition, while about 700 sought assistance on site.  The police has charged 10 people with drug supply offences, including two teenagers who allegedly carried 120 capsules to the festival, held at the Sydney International Regatta Centre.   I\u0027m absolutely aghast at what has occurred, I don\u0027t want any family to go through the tragedy that some families are waking up to this morning, it\u0027s just horrible to think about, the premier of the Australian state of New South Wales, Gladys Berejiklian , said.   This is an unsafe event and I\u0027ll be doing everything I can to make sure it never happens again, she added. Ms Berejuklian denied cancelling the event would force it and others to go underground, and said pill-testing at music events was not a solution. Anyone who advocates pill-testing is giving the green light to drugs. There is no such thing as a safe drug and unfortunately when young people think there is, it has tragic consequences, she said. In 2013 and 2015, two men in their 20s died while attending the festival, both of suspected drug overdose.  The festival, an annual event held in Australia since 2009, has been organised by Q-Dance Australia, part of the Dutch event organiser Q-Dance. On Sunday, the organisers said they were deeply saddened by the deaths. We are disappointed at the number of reported drug-related incidents, we have a zero-tolerance policy in relation to drug use at the festival, Defqon.1 said in a statement published by the Sydney Morning Herald. In total, 69 people were found in possession of drugs at the festival held at Sydney International Regatta Centre.  Local detectives have formed a new police strikeforce, dubbed Highworth, to investigate the two deaths. About 30,000 revellers attended this year\u0027s event. New South Wales Police Acting Assistant Commissioner, Allan Sicard, said police had done everything they could to ensure the event was safe.  What we can\u0027t do is be in people\u0027s heads, be in people\u0027s decision-making processes when they decide to take illicit drugs, he said, according to ABC.  Police can only do so much.

The Buk missile was built at a plant near Moscow during the Cold War and delivered to Ukraine in 1986 when it was a Soviet republic, the Kremlin claims. A team of international investigators has pointed the blame at Moscow, saying videos and other evidence show a missile launcher being secretly transported into territory held by Russian-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine. The investigators claim a Russian-made Buk missile brought down the jet and the launcher used in the air disaster - which killed all 298 passengers and crew onboard - belonged to Russia\u0027s military.  But Russia\u0027s Ministry of Defence claims those videos have been manipulated, and denies claims that Moscow was involved in the July 2014 tragedy of the flight from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur. At a news conference on Monday, Russia\u0027s military provided an audio recording which it claims is proof that Ukraine was involved in the air disaster. It claims that the missile used to bring down the jet was no longer in its hands.  Russian officials claim serial numbers found on missile fragments show the weapon was built in 1986 and it was owned by Ukraine when the jet was shot down. General Nikolay Parshin told reporters that the missile was sent to Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic military unit 20152, which is now the 223rd anti-aircraft defence regiment of Ukraine\u0027s armed forces. The general claims that unit was involved in Ukraine\u0027s offensive against Russian-backed separatists in the Donetsk region in June 2014, just weeks before the airliner was shot down.  In May, the international team of investigators, led by the Netherlands, said Russia\u0027s armed forces supplied the missile launcher that fired a Russian-made Buk missile at MH17 over the war zone. Wilbert Paulissen, head of the Netherlands\u0027 national police crime squad, said the missile was fired from Russia\u0027s 53rd Anti-Aircraft Brigade. Moscow is not involved in that investigation, and claims the probe is biased.

I did feel it for the rest of the game but being at a new club you just want to show up well in your first game.“If I’d been here a couple of years I would have come off but, because it was my first game, I stayed on and probably made it worse – I woke up the next day and it was agony.“The result was five weeks out and that wasn’t ideal but it’s in the past now and I’m raring to go.”What he isn’t doing is expecting to walk right back into the team and he knows, in the shape of fellow left-back Jamie Robson, he’s facing strong competition for that defensive berth.“Jamie has been doing really well, he’s a good player and it’s good to have competition. There are a few boys still out and they’re coming back, so there’s going to be even more and that can only be good for the squad.“I feel that, when we have everyone fit, we have a very strong squad and it’s just going to be a case of getting everyone fit and keeping it that way. There are always injuries, though, it’s part and parcel of football.”His mission now is to help however he can as United look to keep picking up points to mount a strong promotion challenge.The aim today is to pick up three points. He knows that will not be easy against a Morton side who will be something of an unknown quantity after their recent change of manager.It saw ex-United boss Ray McKinnon quit after just three months in chare to take over at Falkirk and former Rangers star Jonatan Johansson replace him.“Any team that gets a new manager, they usually take a couple of weeks to implement what the new man is trying to do. This is Johansson’s first game in charge so we are not really too sure how they’ll set up.“One thing we know is they have good inidual players and experience in there as well in the middle of the park.“It’s going to be a tough game and they are a good side. They’ve had a good couple of seasons where they’ve always been in or close to the play-offs and done well in a few cups.”For United the aim is to build on a three-game unbeaten run that’s seen seven points taken from the last nine, though Booth believes it should have been a full house.“We are going not too bad but,  we want to be winning the league, we have to be holding on to results like the one we should have had at Alloa last time out.“We didn’t play great but 1-0 going into the last 10 minutes, we should have seen the game out.

We’ve been rehearsing and have just played at the Glenfiddich Festival Experiment so we’re on a roll. We can’t wait to play for everyone.”Dundee two-piece St Martiins are next up, performing a set at 12.40pm. Featuring Katie Lynch and Mark Johnston, they claim to have crafted a “unique sound” through music “laced with dark tones”.Katie said: “The V\u0026ampA is bringing something new to the creative scene here in Dundee, which has been needing a good refresh. We’re extremely lucky as a band and I want to see more people get the chance to get involved in the music business. Today’s going to be great – we’re so happy that we were asked.”At 1.30pm is Andrew Wasylyk, the alias of Dundee writer and producer Andrew Mitchell.He describes his work as being “cinematic nostalgia” with “elements of Baroque pop and the influence of classic 1970s songwriters”. Andrew said: “It’s a privilege to be involved and to play a small part in the opening of this new chapter for the city. I’m a fan of Kengo Kuma’s architecture and I’m excited to see the V\u0026ampA evolve and grow with the local communities. I’m really looking forward to performing with a nine-piece ensemble.”Kyle Falconer  – frontman of The View – is the most familiar name on the bill and he will appear on-stage at 2.30pm. The Dryburgh lad has been on tour promoting his debut solo album No Thank You of late, and is expected to perform hits from that LP along with a few well-known tunes from the band that made him famous.Another familiar face appears at 3.30pm in Be Charlotte  – the stage name of local singer Charlotte Brimner.She continues to make a name for herself, having signed a record deal earlier this year and performed last night before Primal Scream on the first day of the 3D Festival.Rounding the day off will be Danny Wilson icon Gary Clark, who’ll play a solo set to his hometown from 4.30pm before being joined by Sistema – the children’s schools orchestra – at 4.50pm to bring the festival to a close. Gary found fame with hits like Mary’s Prayer – which is expected to get an outing today.Organisers say the festival is all-standing and entry is via two gates on Thomson Avenue.Those attending aren’t allowed to take food or drink but outlets will be available.There will be a host of other activities taking place at Slessor Gardens, including a special event involving The Beano – where children can complete a comic cell in an attempt to break a world record.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/09/VA-Dundee-promo.jpg ","title":"va dundee huge queue as museum opens to wider public after debut weekend","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA large queue of eager visitors has formed as people aim to get their first glimpse of the V\u0026ampA Dundee.After a weekend of celebrations and exclusive access to lucky ballot winners, the museum opened its doors to the general public.The iconic building officially opened at 10am today.\u0026mdash Mary\u0026#39sChapelProject  September 17, 2018Shortly after the opening time, a large queue had formed \u0026#8211 stretching past the RRS Discovery.The iconic £80 million museum welcomed thousands of visitors over Saturday and Sunday.

They worried that the business case for the cinema and hub was not sufficient and risked adding to the number of empty buildings in Cromarty.Others argued that the project would be out of keeping with Cromarty\u0027 historic architecture.A report which went before this week\u0027 committee said that Cromarty Community Council had taken a neutral stance over the proposals, but that a consultation it held with the public found that, out of 63 residents who responded, 37 supported the plans and 26 were opposed.Recommending approval council planners said existing paths through the site would be maintained and added that the location within an area that is already fenced off meant there was a \"perceptible distinction\" between the yard site and wider Links area.They added that the film society had looked at other existing venues for a possible cinema and found none were suitable, and added that Cromarty Estate had argued there was \"a demand from local groups and businesses for office space\".Voting unanimously in favour of the plans, a number of councillors on the committee said it was an exciting project but also acknowledged some of the local reservations over the business case.Dingwall and Seaforth councillor Margaret Paterson said that while some in the community had doubts over the cinema\u0027 financial viability, she stressed that \"the film society is active and forward-thinking and they will get the people\".Wick and East Caithness councillor Raymond Bremner also acknowledged local fears that the community might be left with \"dficult buildings\"  the development didn\u0026rsquot \"quite work\" but praised the application and gave his support to it.And Dingwall and Seaforth councillor Angela Maclean said she believed the hub and cinema was \"a venue that can be used by lots of dferent groups in the community\" and would boost the neighbouring Slaughterhouse Cafe.\"This is an exciting development for Cromarty \u0026ndash it\u0027 a cosmopolitan and very artistic community,\" she added.Monday 17 Sep 2018 3:36 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117443.jpg","title":"Family support group lends a helping hand","story":"\u0026nbspTHE family of a Black Isle father-of-three who took his own le after he struggled to cope with depression believe they are now helping others to handle their grief.More than 80 people so far have attended Patrick and Wendy Mullery\u0027 suicide support group, which was founded in memory of their son James.The 28-year-old car salesman died last October.The Mullerys, of Bayview Crescent, Cromarty, together with James\u0027 long-term partner Jodie, who is the mother of his three children, run the monthly meet-up at Mercure Inverness Hotel, paying the heavily-discounted room hire cost out of their own pockets.Mr Mullery , a commercial waste manager for Highland Waste Services in Invergordon, said he was surprised at the group\u0027 high turnout, which is now gearing up for its sixth session.\"It\u0027 more than we expected which just shows there is a need,\" he said.\"People come along and just share their experiences.

Additional allowances are also paid for summer holidays, Christmas and birthdays.Foster carers do not have to own their own home and do not need to be married. They can also be single or living with someone, including in a same-sex relationship. They can be from any ethnic background.Training and support is provided.For more information on fostering, contact 01463 702743 or email fostering@highland.gov.ukMonday 17 Sep 2018 3:36 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117425.jpg","title":"Gay parade plan for Inverness prompts petition","story":"\u0026nbspHUNDREDS of people have signed a petition opposing a planned parade in Inverness city centre to celebrate gay culture, describing it as unsavoury and deeply offensive.The organisers of Proud Ness, set to take place on October 6, have applied for permission to stage a march along High Street to Eden Court Theatre.But Donald Morrison, a home mission worker with the Free Church of Scotland , has gathered about 600 names on a petition opposing the parade on moral, religious and biblical grounds and also written a letter to Highland Council.Mr Morrison, of Old Edinburgh Road, Inverness, claimed in gay marches elsewhere members of the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender  community flaunted their immorality in the most extravagant ways imaginable.\"This becomes evident especially in city centres when they thrust lewdness in the faces of men, women and children alike by frolicking unashamedly on rainbow-coloured floats making obscene sexual gestures,\" he said.\"If this unsavoury event is given planning permission then these desperately sad scenes are now likely to be witnessed very tragically in Inverness on October 6.\"Mr Morrison said the city streets were public places and should be kept child-friendly, family-friendly and people-friendly but maintained this was not the case when immoral behaviour and lestyles were promoted in their spaces.The petition includes signatures from across the region including Ullapool and Skye,\u0026nbsp although Mr Morrison said most were from Inverness and included Christians and non-Christians.

The competition is free to enter and all shops who enter will also be promoted to consumers through an online Indie Retail Directory.Shopkeepers can nominate their businesses until Sunday September 9 via bestsmallshops. A shortlist of 25 of the most impressive applications will be shortlisted by a panel made up of established representatives from the independent retail industry.The judges will be looking for evidence of a small shops\u0026#8217 entrepreneurial spirit, ways that they have been innovative in their business and what they have done to have a lasting positive impact on their community.The shortlisted small shops will be invited to a parliamentary reception on November 13 to meet their Member of Parliament and find out who will be crowned Best Small Shop 2018.Argyll and Bute has an amazing array of small shops which help support our rural economy and I would love to see them recognised.Brendan O\u0026#8217Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute.Sir,Since when is it okay for a man to stand in a layby and urinate in broad daylight?It has become more noticeable in recent years and is never a pleasant sight. It strikes me this sort of selfish attitude is something that may also be contributing to the growing problem of drivers throwing rubbish out their windows on Argyll\u0026#8217s road network.If you can\u0026#8217t find a public toilet, at least find a tree to hide behind when you\u0026#8217re caught short \u0026#8211 and a bin to chuck your rubbish in.Name and address supplied.Sir,At Royal Mail we never forget that we form an essential part of the UK’s social fabric.We know our postmen and postwomen are valued members of the local community as they deliver letters and parcels six days a week \u0026#8211 in all weathers. We’re also continually looking to make our services even better to give customers greater convenience as they shop online.I’d like to make your readers aware of a few changes to their doorstep deliveries so there are no surprises.Customers expecting tracked items from large retailers are among those to benefit from these changes. If they are not at home when we deliver, they will now receive email/SMS notications on the whereabouts of their delivery. For customers who have provided their contact details, the notications will confirm when their items have been delivered to a neighbour, as well as specying the neighbour’s address.The \u0026#8216Something for You\u0026#8217 card is also going digital, making it easier for customers to retrieve their item  they are not at home when we deliver.

Customers will no longer need to go home to collect the physical card \u0026#8211 which we’ll continue to post through letter boxes.And finally customers taking pre-paid parcels  to selected Royal Mail Customer Service Points will receive an acceptance scan as soon as they drop off their item thanks to new scanning technology.Gerry McAuley, delivery director, Glasgow Mail Centre.Sir,The Supreme Court appears to have come to a sensible decision for the terminally ill in its landmark right-to-die ruling.One year ago my adult children and I watched helplessly as a most loved, mentally alert member of our family, with terminal cancer, suffered a needlessly horrible and prolonged death.This, after the patient had pleaded, for two weeks, with family doctors and religious leaders to end the constant suffering by requesting some form of assisted dying.This Supreme Court decision has come too late for our loved one but hopefully Westminster and Holyrood will now each consider and pass a bill to allow assisted dying and prevent suffering for current and future patients.Gordon Caskie, Muasdale.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures week 32","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 12/08/18, 3:16 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to ?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowSomething slightly dferent in this edition.

I foolishly stood up too soon approaching the Kilmartin stop and fell forward, landing head to door and feet in the air.Thank you to the doctor who checked me over, and to the driver and passengers who waited until I had been checked.Janet Jardine, KilmartinSir,I would like to give thanks to Tarbert Festivals Committee for all their hard work in organising the very successful Seafood Festival.Tarbert Festival Queen 2018 Chloe MacDonald with her Princesses Cara and Kaitlyn were beautul and a great credit to the festival.My thanks again to everyone who helped in any way to make this year’s festival such an amazing event and to the very many people who visited the village for the occasion.Councillor Anne Horn, TarbertEditor\u0026#8217s note: With apologies to Councillor Horn for the delay in publishing this letter, originally submitted in July.Sir,The closure of the tourist centres at Tarbert and Inveraray is very worrying and I can’t understand why VisitScotland, backed by the Scottish Government, came up with such a decision.Tourism is extremely important to Argyll and Bute, and all agencies should be working together to assist the tourists that come to this area.Tarbert is in my council ward and I know how valuable the centre there is. The wealth of experience and knowledge of the staff cannot be replaced.I would certainly support a trust taking over the service, but firstly I would ask VisitScotland and Scottish Government to reconsider their closure plans.Councillor Robin Currie, Kintyre and the Islands wardSir,I am extremely disappointed over the proposed closure of the VisitScotland iCentre in Tarbert.Michael Russel MSP, Tarbert and Skipness Community Trust and myself have had frequent discussions regarding the issue and I am hopeful that the interested parties will be able to offer a proposal that ensures continuity in the service, although perhaps in a dferent form.Councillor Anne Horn, Kintyre and the Islands wardSir,Deputy First Minister John Swinney is now requiring local authorities to devolve powers and budgets to local schools. If councils do not respond within the next year, he has vowed to legislate for improved school governance across the country.The fear of making mistakes has led to an unwillingness to experiment and a total absence of ersity to suit inidual communities. Local authorities have prevented head teachers and staff from running their schools and classes in their pupils’ true interests.Councils have failed to recognise the very signicant contribution which broadly constituted and empowered school councils could make to the overall education system. Schools have had little incentive to cut back wasteful expenditure.The shortage of resources being allocated to education is, of course, partly to blame for the mess we are in, but it is by no means the whole story.We now have an ideal opportunity to introduce governance reforms to ensure that policies are shaped to local circumstances otherwise we could all well end up with more direction from St Andrew\u0026#8217s House.Is it too much to hope that councillors and education officials in every education authority will now play their part in restoring Scotland’s state schools to their once iconic world status?Angus Tulloch, Longniddry, East LothianSir,Through your newspaper I would like to thank the staff Alex, Mark and Alex  from the George Hotel in Inveraray.Two guests staying at my holiday cottage in Cairnbaan lost their car keys while on a day trip to Inveraray.

I also met with the Islay Book Festival team and heard from my constituents from across Islay, Jura and Colonsay about numerous local issues, all of which will addressed.A huge thank you to all the hard-working volunteers who helped make this year\u0026#8217s show possible.Councillor Alastair Redman, Kintyre and the Islands ward\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 33","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 19/08/18, 2:04 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to ?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.There has been talk of a new rugby pitch for a while, but plans presented to community councillors on Monday go further than that.We hope everyone involved is as enthusiastic as Mid Argyll Rugby Club and more power to their elbow.This year\u0026#8217s has to go down as one of the best Mid Argyll Shows in recent times.The weather helped bring out the crowds in big numbers, but the real credit must go to the volunteers who organise the show.

Macmillan is there to help people with cancer live le as fully as they can.Offering a broad range of cancer information and support services \u0026#8211 including a free support line and a community of over 7,700 healthcare professionals \u0026#8211 demand for Macmillan’s services is constantly growing, but we rely on the generosity of the public to provide this support.Macmillan’s Coffee Morning takes place on Friday September 28 \u0026#8211 but people can host whenever they want. Whoever they invite and whatever they serve, people are highly encouraged to host a Macmillan Coffee Morning in a way that suits them.If people can’t bake, that doesn’t have to stop them.

The kids have had a great time with their teams playing well, building team spirit and creating a positive impression of the soccer centre and Lochgilphead.The Red Star 2007 team as well as regularly taking part in the Oban Primary League has travelled to Mossend, Oban, Crieff, Campbeltown and Helensburgh.  The kids are really developing and getting ready to move up to nine aside from now and then eleven aside in August 2019. The 2008 team has been to Mossend, Oban, Ardencaple, Campbeltown, Helensburgh, Finnart and Airdrieonians and have also been taking part in the Oban Primary League.The 2009s, 2010s and 2011s have been on trips to Oban, Campbeltown and Helensburgh. The kids played four and five aside as well as being committed to regular additional training sessions. The future looks good for when they step up to seven aside.Finally the girls team took part in both Oban and Campbeltown festivals. The enthusiastic girls have developed enormously in the last nine months. It\u0026#8217s great to see such an active group of girls growing from around eight girls this time last year to nearly 20 now.The action continues with teams due to take part in Haldane and Lochnell festivals in September.

Jemma won the two-lap race in 25.7 seconds and placed highly in another three events. Beth won the high jump clearing 1.14m and the long jump and Kirstie had an outstanding run to win the four-lap race in 55.5 seconds. The other event winner in this contest was Jemma’s twin sister Jorja who won the javelin throwing 14 metres.Local girl Neve Bowden was the under 9 champion thanks to wins in the four-lap race and long jump. Scarlett Speirs from Inveraray was runner-up winning the high jump and two-lap race. Carla Renton from Campbeltown won the javelin in this age group.Violet Campbell from Glenbarr dominated in the under 13’s contest winning all five events including a 6.49 metres throw in the shot putt. Emma Plumber from Tayvallich was runner up with Kyra Robertson from Ardrishaig in third place.Karis Kidd from Ardrishaig was the under 15 champion, winning the two running events and the long jump and finished 1.5 points ahead of Amy Gibson from Bunessan on Mull who won the high jump with a 1.40 metres clearance. Caryn Kerr from Campbeltown was third on overall points and won the shot putt with a 6.67 metres throw. The previous week Caryn won the junior shot putt at Oban Highland Games.Three girls tied on points in the under 7’s competition and the final placings were decided on the most inidual wins which resulted in Cara Green from Ardrishaig the winner ahead of Zara Whyte and Chloe Hill.Ruairidh Charnock from Lochgilphead was the boys under 7 champion just one point ahead of Olly MacVicar from Tighnabruaich. Ruairidh won the two-lap race and long jump while Olly won the four-laprace and javelin throwing nine metres.Local boy George Balkeen dominated in the under 9’s with a clean sweep of wins which included impressive performances in the two-lap race recording 27.9 seconds, four-lap in 61.6 and a 10.50 metres javelin throw. Luke MacVicar from Tighnabruaich was second overall and Ciaran Johnstone from Oban was third.Roan MacVicar from Tighnabruaich was the under 11 champion thanks to wins in the two running events and finished four points ahead of Sam Gillespie from Lochgilphead who won the high jump and javelin throwing an impressive 14.25m. Third placed Robert Kerr from Campbeltown won the long jump in this section.Two Kintyre boys excelled in the under 13’s with Lewis Gilchrist from Tayinloan champion thanks to wins in the two-lap race in 22.9 and four-lap race in 48.2 seconds. Runner-up Ruaridh Campbell from Glenbarr won the shot putt throwing 9.76 metres and third placed Murray MacDonald also impressed winning the high jump with 1.31 metres and long jump.The entry was disappointing in the two older age groups where Finlay MacLean from Oban won the under 15’s ahead of Ewan Ferguson from Lochgilphead. Finlay won four events and Ewan won the high jump.Jake Gillespie from Lochgilphead was the under 17 winner ahead of Shaun Doy from Kilmichael Glassary.

What’s more, even  they don’t mutate as occurred in the case outlined here,  released into the wild either by design or mistake these foreigners can cause havoc to local ecosystems.In a letter to the scientic journal Nature in 2003, a group of German scientists began ‘it has been rumoured that an unidentied crayfish…of marbled appearance and uncertain geographical origin that was introduced into the German aquarium trade in the mid 1990s, is capable of unisexual reproduction ’.The authors ended by warning that: ‘This crayfish…could become a menace to European freshwater systems, as the release of even one specimen into the wild would be enough to found a population that might out-compete native crayfish’.Now, 23 years later, this all-female crayfish has escaped into the wild.  Identied as a descendent of the fresh water slough crayfish from Florida, it is now called the marbled crayfish or Marmokrebs. So far it has invaded the waterways of at least nine European countries as well as Japan and Madagascar. Unravelling its origin reveals that a unique macro-mutation must have occurred in a single slough crayfish egg probably caused by heat or cold shock whilst in transit from Florida to Germany for the pet market.The resulting female hatchling possessed three sets of chromosomes per cell  and the ability to produce clones of itself without a mate and at very high frequency.Because of its warm climate and abundant freshwater habitats, Madagascar has seen the most rapid colonisation with Marmokrebs. Millions of the animals have invaded the countries lakes, rice paddies and swamps and are threatening its seven endemic crayfish species.It is only a matter of time before this scenario is repeated in other locations, destroying valuable ecosystems and eliminating indigenous species.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures week 36","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 09/09/18, 7:01 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to ?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe photograph this week was taken by Colin Cameron of the Argyllshire Advertiser.It was captured on a Huawei P9 mobile phone, and Colin said: \u0026#8216I just spotted the bee while out on the hill walking the dogs.

Both crews compete in the 1600 class.This was Jamie\u0026#8217s second outing in the car. In what was a wet and slippery day, only the first stage was completed in slightly drier conditions which made tyre choice dficult.Stage two was better, after a change of tyres. There were several incidents on stages throughout the day which caused delays. Jamie and Ian stopped to help on stage three when a car rolled. This caused them to lose a lot of time but priority was to ensure the other competitors were safe.By stage seven, the \u0026#8216red mist\u0026#8217 had set in on Jamie and he had a battle with a mk 2 Escort.Jamie said: \u0026#8216This is a good event, but the class in front have a phenomenal pace to compete against, although I still enjoyed it.\u0026#8217Jamie\u0026#8217s next event is Leuchars, Fe, in November which will be the final round of the STRC.

On stage two they went through a fence in slippery conditions costing them around 35 seconds.Back to service, it was a change of tyres. The new tyre choice proved to be working well back on stage and they began climbing their position and setting impressive times.On stage seven, their car stopped within inches of a concrete block.At the end of a long day rallying, Jamie and Ian finished 46th overall and 14th in class, while Donald and Paul finished 7th overall with 1st in class and 1st FWD car setting a fourth fastest stage time.Donald said these were his best results so far since he started his hobby.

As pupils had brought a iety of instruments, including saxophones, flutes, guitars, accordion, trombone and, of course, tuned percussion, they were surprised that the day started with just rhythmic clapping.Alison and Felix both demonstrated playing techniques on their specialist instruments. For Alison, with a few flautists in the group, this was very informative. Scary soundtracks with special string techniques was Felix’s forte.We were split into two groups with each group composing three short melodies in the style of Steve Reich. These were developed using minimalist techniques such as addition, subtraction, stretching, interlocking, shting and phasing with each melody sounding very dferent depending on the instruments within the group. We performed and gave positive feedback on each other’s work.After lunch we got together to compose a third section in the style of John Adams with input from everybody. Techniques used here included gradual transformation and even sparkles.By the end of the day we were able to put our melodies together and we performed our unnamed minimalist composition. The event involved us interacting with each other, meeting new people and learning interesting skills that will be beneficial for our exam next year. We are all thoroughly delighted to have been a part of what was a great experience. We are now looking forward to the SCO American Minimalism concert in Helensburgh on Wednesday September 19.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"cakes and coffee make a zambian difference","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 14/09/18, 3:04 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to ?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowZamScotEd, the Mid Argyll-based charity that supports education in Zambia, is close to achieving three of the UN’s sustainable development goals in Lusaka, where its secondary school is steadily growing.If you pop in to ZamScotEd’s next coffee morning in Lochgilphead Parish Church Hall, you will help to put the icing on the cake of St Columba’s third classroom block – the science building that will enable pupils to forge ahead and gain qualications to work in their country’s industries and professions.ZamScotEd founder, Marian Pallister, was back in Zambia this summer to check on the progress of the much needed secondary school the organisation initiated in one of the poorest communities on the fringe of Lusaka.She said: \u0026#8216Progress has been amazing. St Columba\u0026#8217s Community Secondary Day School opened in January 2016 with one classroom block match funded by Missio Scotland.Last year, with the help of the Spanish organisation Manos Unidas, the second classroom block opened and there was an amazing 100 per cent pass rate for the important Grade 9 exam – roughly equating to our Nat 5. Now, with funding from another Spanish organisation, Africa Directo, the science block has been built and ZamScotEd is committed to completing the interior and providing the furniture and equipment.\u0026#8217Marian added that Manos Unidas have just agreed to fund the fourth and final classroom block.There are now 190 pupils at the school, which is run by ZamScotEd\u0026#8217s Zambian partners, the Teresian Sisters, and there are 95 boys and 95 girls.\u0026#8216Our aims are to meet three of the UN\u0026#8217s sustainable development goals,\u0026#8217 Marian continued. \u0026#8216Goal number four is quality education, and head teacher Sr Veronica Nyoni and her team  are achieving that.\u0026#8216Goal number five is gender equality – and we\u0026#8217re spot on there.

I worked extremely hard to buy my farm, not being able to piggyback on my forebears’ efforts, and I didn’t ‘blow-in’, it took two forty-foot pantechnicons four days.It is clear he has an interest in wind turbines, and no doubt with a pair of wellies, a fish farm or two. His blinkered refusal to accept the huge body of evidence regarding fish farm contamination suggests he has an investment and it needs protecting. But only, of course,  you don’t have a commercial interest.There is a huge amount of evidence that mechanical kelp harvesting does irreparable damage to the sea bed. Could I draw your readers\u0026#8217 attention to the Facebook page \u0026#8216Stop Mechanical Kelp Dredging\u0026#8217?The sea bed can’t be seen, but a bank statement can. No prizes for who is the loser. The 600 jobs in aquaculture will not last long  mass kelp harvesting is allowed to decimate sub-sea environments and the only jobs on fish farms will be pushing barrows of diseased and dead fish.I’ve no doubt he knows that wind turbines have a 25-year le span and then the hugely disruptive process will start again  an alternative has not been discovered. It has been calculated that the energy costs of a wind turbine will never be recovered during its lespan, but those receiving grants really don’t care.Why, given the amount of rainfall in Argyll, are hydro schemes not pursued? It used to be a mystery, until one looks at the vast sums of subsidy given by a gullible government to so called ‘alternative energy sources’, which actually means ‘alternative revenue sources’.There are any number of pretty glens that could be dammed, providing an extra environmentally-friendly leisure resource, create an opportunity for aquaculture and would not require a replacement somewhere down the line.Alexander Hamilton, Tayvallich.Sir,With reference to James Lithgow’s letter of September 7, it is important to make a couple of points.Mr Lithgow is right to say kelp has been sustainably harvested in Argyll for generations. There can be no comparison, however, with the current proposal to mechanically dredge up entire stands from the seabed together with all the fragile le that depends on them. This is not sustainable as evidenced in the few countries which have allowed this practice to take place.  Seaweed cultivation, on the other hand, is sustainable and more can be found on this through the Scottish Association for Marine Science.The 2018 parliamentary inquiry into the environmental impact of salmon farming warned current methods could cause \u0026#8216irrecoverable damage\u0026#8217.  This is deeply concerning to those of us who live here, raise families and rely on the sea for our creel fishing, shellfish and tourism businesses. We also all have an inherent responsibility to care for our environment and there is increasing urgency to do this.Enterprises do need to be encouraged to grow and to provide opportunities and employment. This, however, must be done responsibly and with thought for the long-term viability of our communities.The profits of the predominantly multi-national salmon farming companies, who benefit from current loopholes in our environmental regulations, are well able to fund a responsible and researched approach for sustainability and erse employment opportunities. Norway, for example, is encouraging its salmon farmers to adopt closed containment and these methods are working well in a number of other countries, including the USA.The council has a legal responsibility for the environment and needs to take precautions for the future of Argyll, not just for job numbers today.If short-term interests are prioritised, all of our futures will be much the poorer.Will Self, on behalf of Friends of the Sound of JuraSir,Most schools in Scotland have pipers and drummers within their pupil population.Schools in Argyll are probably no exception. May I please ask your readers to seek out their pipers and encourage them to represent their school as a piping quartet,  not as a full band, at the next Scottish Schools Pipe Band Championships?The championships are organised annually by the Scottish Schools Pipes and Drums Trust. The next championships will be held at Inveralmond Community High School, Livingston, on Sunday March 10 2019.More details are on our website \u0026#8211 www.thechampionships.Last March, 145 schools from Scotland and two from England were represented at the championships, with a category for all standards of playing.Five years ago we introduced a new category of \u0026#8216freestyle\u0026#8217.  The aim of this is to provide an opportunity for schools to showcase their other musical skills alongside those of their pipers.The Scottish Schools Pipes and Drums Trust  hopes many young pipers and drummers from Mid Argyll \u0026#8211 with other musicians too  entering the freestyle event – will participate in next year’s championships.Patrick Gascoigne, administrator, Scottish Schools Pipe Band Championships.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13243376.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_lhr_ayp_260418funky.jpg","title":"ayrshire clubbers could tv club","story":"NewsAyrshire clubbers could be on TV with Club MTV filmingMTV have launched a new channel - Club MTV - that films at the best clubs across the country.Share\u0026nbspByLochlin Highet11:58, 14 SEP 2018NewsFurys nighclub in Ayr \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribingSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailClubbers in Ayrshire will have the chance to show off their moves to the world.

Debby McKenzie had been diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis with a future that looked downhill all the way. She admits not in her wildest dreams could she have imagined her le now. Debby, who turned 50 on Tuesday, is just back from a three-month odyssey to Uganda. It was her first visit after setting up the charity McKenzie Clinic which focuses on children with the worst medical conditions. Some remote parts of the country she went to were a 10-hour drive over pot-holed dirt roads from her base in the capital Kampala. And she found herself packed in the back of overcrowded people carriers, with chickens running loose at her feet. Debby, who grew up in Prestwick but now lives in Ayr, said: “It is not very nice to be perfectly honest. It is a country with nothing. “It was always my dream to go to Africa and do some volunteer work, but it has escalated into a full blown charity which I registered in May 2017.” She has used her networking skills to bring volunteers together and they fund operations and aftercare for the children. Uganda was declared independent from Britain in 1962 and is landlocked, though you would not realise it, as the vast Lake Victoria straddles half its southern border. The great lake is 85 per cent the size of Scotland. The population is about 42 million and seems to attract dictators – Idi Amin during the seventies the most notorious. And it is dirt poor, says Debby, with lost of aid going to line the pockets of the rich. She flew into Entebbe and then headed to her host family in the capital where she stayed. From there, she visited ious organisations in all parts of the country. Debby, a orced mum-of-one, revealed: “The roads are a nightmare and I always went by public transport. You get chickens at your feet and chickens on the roof. “It is very backward and for a couple of years I had been supporting charities there and they invited me over, so I decided I would go.” It is estimated some of the charities Debby was donating to were only able to get 30 per cent of funds to the people who needed them, the rest going to buy luxury goods for the elite. Debby said: “The aftercare is so important, I didn’t want them to be operated on then we walk away. “They have no le, no food and are malnourished. So I find sponsors to get them food weekly, mattresses and try and get them schooling. “We have just enrolled a girl into college who wants to be a hairdresser and we have paid the first year’s fee and accomodation. “People are joining the charity all the time as they want to help and I have been able to build a medical team on the ground in Uganda. “I have a huge online team of volunteers.” Debby was an independent financial adviser but eventually had to give up the business when she was diagnosed with MS 19 years ago.  She said: “I spent years not being able to see out of my right eye, I couldn’t speak, I lost my  co-ordination and I was paralysed down my right side.  “I was bed-ridden for a good couple of years.” She buried herself in research, went on to natural medications, exercised and changed her diet. Combined with a positive mental attitude it actually worked – and she is now sympton and fatigue free. Debby went on: “I really thought my le was over. But it is not, and it is now my time to help others.” The charity has seven acres of ground and the next project is to build a medical village and eco farm. Volunteers pay to get themselves out to Africa, but the charity pays for accomodation, transport and food. Debby added: “My big thing at the moment is we dont just want to operate or treat the children, we want to make sure they are going to be ok. “Everywhere you go you see horric surgical cases, some of it is mind-blowing. “Most of the time I just have to step over them and walk away because I cannot help everyone. That is the hardest part.” Debby’s daughter Jessica,28, said: “Mum found an African surgeon, Dr Allan Lubiite, who also was deeply concerned about the conditions that Ugandan families were living in. “Mum’s work has helped save many children already and is funded solely from 15,000 people who are part of her Facebook groups. “She calls herself the voice of the voiceless and I am so proud of her.” A fundraiser is being held at the Berkeley Hotel in Barns Street, Ayr on Monday September 17 in the shape of a psychic and BBQ evening. It is being held to cover the expenses of volunteers while they are part of a dentistry team heading to Uganda at the end of the year.

Jockey Oisin Murphy has made this year his own, riding the crest of the proverbial wave to land another Group 1 victory. It was always the worry that enigmatic HARRY ANGEL would lose his race in the stalls which he sadly did. It was a proper thrill to watch last years Arc winner ENABLE  to the track after a y absence with a decisive victory over CRYSTAL OCEAN. The John Gosden trained filly is now as short as 9/4 to retain her crown at Longchamp on October 7. With five Group 1 victories to her name you have to fancy her chances. For most of us the daily commute to work is no more hazardous than the annoyance of a late bus or a car that won’t start. Few will use a single engine plane or helicopter. It may look glamorous from the outside but for top trainers and jockeys who are engaged at two tracks on the same day it is an essential form of transport. The perils involved were highlighted on Saturday when trainer Richard Hannon’s plane collided with another on landing at a rain sodden Haydock. Mercully the only damage was to the clipped wings of the aircraft. Lets not always envy those who look as though they are living the high le. The climax to four days of racing at Doncaster comes this Saturday at 3:35pm in the final Classic of the season. Early in the week Aidan O’Brien’s KEW GARDENS was a rock solid favourite at 5/4 with LAH TI DAR  a remote second. The money has come for the Andrew Lloyd-Webber owned filly who is now favourite at 15/8 while KEW GARDENS can be backed at 2/1. LAH TI DAR  is three wins from three starts. The latest of which, the Sir Henry Cecil Stakes at York’s Ebor Festival, was a 10  rout.  In the St Leger fillies are in receipt of a 3lb weight allowance against the colts in this 1 mile 6 marathon. It is a race that John Gosden excels in  having won it four times previously. Connections are confident the step up in trip will suit her strong galloping style and that any ease in the ground will suit the daughter of DUBAWI. With just one race this summer she should arrive at post on Saturday fresh as a daisy. In contrast this will be KEW GARDENS\u0027 fth engagement of the campaign. One we like and who has stamina in abundance is KEW GARDENS\u0027 stablemate SOUTHERN FRANCE at 14/1. Lightly raced, this son of GALLILEO has caught the eye on more than one occasion despite running a touch green in second behind KEW GARDENS in the Queen’s Vase at Royal Ascot. SOUTHERN FRANCE  looks the value each way bet. In a tactical race he may be up in the vanguard keeping LAH TI DAR honest, forcing a true gallop. If there is a flaw to be found in the new favourite as she steps up in trip and in to Group 1 company for the first time, SOUTHERN FRANCE will be sure to find it. It is a tactic that will suit KEW GARDENS whose best performances have come under a patient ride. Perhaps our selection will outstay them both. Stranger things have happened.  @RacingJulie Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnRoyal AscotAyr NewsAyrRacing tips"},{"url":null,"title":"innerleithen-pipe-band-championships-to-be-held-on-saturday","story":"THE best\u0026nbspPipe Bands from all over South East Central Scotland will descend on Innerleithen this Saturday  for the annual Innerleithen Pipe Band Championships.\nThe event will be held in the grounds of St Ronan\u0026rsquos School in\u0026nbspInnerleithen, with the bands battling it out\u0026nbspto see who will triumph supreme.\nAllan Johnston, the Secretary of St Ronan\u0026rsquos Piping Society, who runs the competition told us:\u0026nbsp\u0026ldquoThe contest will feature over 25 performances with bands from Grades 2, 3, 4, Novice Juvenile and a Juvenile and Adult Drum Majors completion.\n\u0026ldquoThere will be something for everyone and at the end of the day we will be handing out a fine array of trophies and prize money amounting to over \u0026pound2000 to the successful bands.\nIn addition to the fine Pipe Band music there will be an array of stalls, a face painter, pony rides, snack bar, plus\u0026nbspa bar.\nAllan added: \u0026ldquoOur Chieftain this year needs no introduction to the Innerleithen music scene David Lindsay, Davy to his many friends has been involved the St Ronan\u0026rsquos Silver Band for over 53 years.\nAnd David Lindsay spoke of his honour of the role as Chetain.\nHe said:\u0026nbsp\u0026ldquoMusic has been a large part of my le, but as part of a dferent genre to pipe bands.\n\u0026ldquoI am an avid member of the now world-famous St. Ronan\u0026rsquos Silver Band based here in Innerleithen, however this has never dampened my enjoyment of pipe bands and I particularly enjoy the massed bands elements of Games Week.\n\u0026ldquoI am highly honoured to be Chieftain of this year\u0026rsquos Innerleithen Pipe Band Championships and I would like to commend the outstanding efforts of the Piping Society who have built up this competition to be one of the most highly regarded competitions in the piping and drumming calendar.\nDavid will take over the Chain of Office from 2015 Chieftain, Norman Scott who is standing in for last year\u0026rsquos Chieftain John Connor.\u0026nbsp\nDavid will take the salute from the massed bands along with a prizegiving at 4.30pm and  and will later\u0026nbspbe saluted by the participating bands as they parade at around\u0026nbsp5.15pm from St. Ronan\u0026rsquos Road, Queen Street, Horsbrugh Street and High Street to fall out in Hall Street.\nAs an added attraction to this year\u0026rsquos event the RSPBA Lothian \u0026amp Borders Branch will be crowning their \nChampion of Champions\n\u0026nbspthe bands who have won overall during the competitive season.\nEntry to the event will be \u0026pound3 per person , \u0026pound1 for children over five years.

delivering increased free childcare has come in for criticism by inspectors.\nLanglee Primary School Nursery is one of seven early learning centres across the Borders trialling an increase in funded early learning and childcare from 600 to 1140 hours.\nBy 2020 the additional hours should be available across the whole Borders.\nEducation bosses at Scottish Borders Council believe Langlee Nursery is capable of catering for up to 100 three-, four- and eligible two-year-old children.\nBut experts from the Care Inspectorate found the centre, which is part of the new \u0026pound10 million Langlee Primary School, is struggling to cope.\nInspectors weren\u0027t happy with the lay-out of the new nursery and highlighted the \u0027high number of accidents\u0027 that had happened as well as a shortage of staff.\nA spokeswoman for the Care Inspectorate said: \"Providing lunch for a large number of children provided a signicant organisational challenge and resulted in a poor experience for children.\n\"Staff tried hard to make lunch positive and did ensure children had something to eat and drink but opportunities for independence and children\u0027s choices were limited.\n\"On the day of our visit it was apparent that the space allocated to the nursery was not working well.\n\"The quality, layout and aesthetic appeal of play activities for children over three needed to be signicantly improved.\n\"There had been a high number of accidents in the nursery and we asked senior staff to audit these to see  there was a pattern to time, event or children involved.\"\nLanglee Nursery is made up of two classrooms and a central atrium area.\nAnd most children have access to an outdoor play area as well.\nParents praised staff in their responses to questionnaires sent out by the inspectors.\nBut the inspectors also found problems with the turnover of staff and the need for bank workers to fill in.\nThe spokeswoman added: \"There were acknowledged challenges in the staff team.\n\"The nursery had increased in the number of children quite signicantly in the last year and the staffing had lacked continuity.\n\"Additional staff needed to be employed to ensure the children\u0027s needs could be met and this was being addressed.\"\nWhile previous inspections of Langlee Nursery by the Care Inspectorate led to gradings of either \u0027very good\u0027 or \u0027good\u0027 the latest inspection found the quality of environment, of staffing, and of management as only \u0027adequate\u0027 with only the level of care and support still deemed \u0027good\u0027.\nA spokesperson for Scottish Borders Council said: \"The council has already taken signicant steps following the care inspectorate visit and has addressed a number of the matters raised, for example improving lunch routines.\n\"SBC takes very seriously any recommendations made during these inspections and regularly monitors progress.\n\"We are confident that the matters raised

which means that the theatre now has the budget to transform its auditorium.\nThe revamp forms phase one of the \u0027Building on success\u0027 strategy to develop the building and make it more customer friendly and fit to meet increasing demand.\nIf the plans go to schedule, by the end of summer 2019 the auditorium will be developed to designs by Simpson \u0026amp Brown Architects.\nA raft of improvements will be made, including existing retractable seating replaced with new, better padded seats and increased legroom, plus aisle seats fitted with hand grabs, to help customers move up and down the steps more easily.\nThe current balcony seats that provide a restricted view of the stage will be replaced by around 24 new seats on diagonally stepped platforms.\nThey will offer a full view of the stage when two sections of solid balcony are replaced with steel rail and glass panels.\nAlso, new swivel stools, in the section of the balconies closest to the stage, will allow the theatre to offer some seats at a reduced ticket price.\nLow level safety lighting will be introduced into the new side balconies, and new heating ducts will be installed to deliver hot air at floor level.\nSir David Younger, chair of the Eastgate board of directors said: \u0026ldquoThe Board would like to thank most sincerely the Eastgate staff, the Friends of the Eastgate and all donors who rose magnicently to the challenge of raising a sizeable sum of money in a very short space of time.\n\u0026ldquoThe theatre was first developed in 2004 by the efforts of the local community and it is heartening for all of us to realise that all these years later it is still so valued.\n\u0026ldquoBy levering the European Leader grant the local fundraising has made a huge impact locally.\n\u0026ldquoThis, combined with the success of general manager Caroline Adam in attracting other signicant capital grants will help to ensure that the people of Tweeddale and much further

by council planning officers.\u0026nbsp\nRobin Purdie, of High Cross Avenue, Melrose, wants to convert 37 Bank Street into a mortgage shop, but has been refused permission despite the building laying empty for the last two years.\nThe property is currently categorised as a retail or food outlet, and converting the shop into a financial services outlet would require planning permission for a change of use.\nMr Purdie has now appealed to the Scottish Borders Council\u0026rsquos local review body, where councillors will be asked to either refuse the application or overturn the planning department\u0026rsquos decision.\u0026nbsp\nIn his request for a review, Mr Purdie wrote: \u0026ldquoMy company has had an offer accepted to purchase 37 Bank Street, which has been empty and on the

currently based in Edinburgh, but I am a born and bred Borderer who has been arranging mortgages around the Borders for the last 18 years.\u0026nbsp\n\u0026ldquoThus fair, change of use has been declined even though: the property has been empty and on the market for two years at least one local person will be recruited upon us arriving we will bring an awful lot more footfall than the shop

next-door property.\u0026nbsp\n\u0026ldquoThis company appears to be a one-man business, and that property was on the market for a lot less time than number 37.\n\u0026ldquoAs it stands, we find the refusal to be, at best, strange given the point above and, at worst, borderline discriminatory against professional services businesses.\u0026nbsp\n\u0026ldquoIt does not really give the impression that Galashiels is open to inward investment from businesses that want to relocate there.\nFootfall in Scottish Borders town centres has fallen dramatically over the last decade, leading to an increase in empty shops.\nGalashiels has been especially hard hit, with a recent retail survey showing that 37 retail units are currently standing empty in the town centre.\nRecently, the council agreed to relax restrictions on businesses opening up in Galashiels as part of a retail pilot aimed at reversing the decline in footfall and occupancy rates.\nLeisure businesses, professional or financial services and non-residential institutions will now be tolerated along the town\u0026rsquos two main shopping streets, and businesses such as tattoo shops and travel agents will be able to open providing they can prove they will generate footfall for the area.\nIn explaining their reasons for refusing Mr Purdie\u0026rsquos application, planning officers stated: \u0026ldquoAny continued

the HMS Platypus Cup became the club\u0026#8217s mixed doubles championship\u0026#8217s coveted trophy and names began to be inscribed.As with any weather dependent sport there were years when the championship was not played, or perhaps there were not enough ladies and gents to run a mixed doubles competition.If the teams were always picked from a hat, the method used currently, it would explain why partnerships did not endure, unless by luck, though one strong player may win successively.The cup\u0026#8217s first winners in 1919 were: Mrs Chapman and Mr R. Y. Maxtone, the following year Mr Maxtone partnered Miss B Strang.1921 must have been a strange year for mixed doubles. The winner is inscribed as P. S. MacNair without a partner. Sometimes it can be a struggle to get teams, so perhaps MacNair played singles against a doubles pair.In 1922 honours were taken by Miss C. K. MacNish and Mr E. Armour. In 1923 a dferent pair emerged Miss J. I. McKersie and Mr A. G. MacKelvie.Miss B. Strang ed, partnered by Mr L. Edwards in 1924. In 1925 a christian name is inscribed for the first time, when, Bella Strang, taking her third win, was partnered by  Mr C. MacTaggart.Mrs W. McKersie and Mr C. McTaggart won in 1926 and Miss S. Colville and Mr R. W. Greenlees in 1927.Mrs Mary MacFadyen, was the next winner to gain the christian name honour in 1928 and she did not have take three wins.The first and possibly only gentleman to see his christian name used, was the prolic 1950\u0026#8217s winner, Rev.

ICOL wants to build a substation, which will bring energy from an offshore windfarm onshore and into the National Grid, on the former power station footprint.  The application has been opposed by local community councils and the council, who believe it is not the best use of the site, which was bought by East Lothian Council from ScottishPower in March and is subject to an ongoing masterplan process for its future.  However, within weeks of the council buying the site, Scottish Ministers called-in the only lodged application for the land, from ICOL.  They said the move was because it was of \u0026ldquonational importance and denied any link to the fact that First Minister Nicola Sturgeon was on a state visit to China \u0026ndash whose state-owned company Red Rock own ICOL \u0026ndash at the time of the announcement.  The reporter appointed to investigate the application carried out a site visit at the start of this month.  Following that visit, it was announced a hearing into the plans would be held and Allison Coard was named as the appointed reporter who would oversee the hearing and report back to ministers.  Ward councillor Lachlan Bruce welcomed the announcement.  He said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom glad that there is going to be a hearing on this application.  \u0026ldquoI, of course, would prefer  members of the public could also speak at the hearing to give their views and opinions but I do think that community councils being invited is a welcome step.  \u0026ldquoOf course, this is again ening the process of the application out. If it had been left by the Scottish Government for East Lothian to make a decision we probably would have had an outcome by now and members of the public would also have had their chance to have a say.  \u0026ldquoI am confident that the hearing will be a further step in helping to convince the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos independent reporter that the current Inch Cape application is wrong for the site and wrong for the people of Cockenzie and Port Seton and Prestonpans.  Invitations have been sent out to Prestonpans and Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Councils inviting them to be represented at the hearing, along with East Lothian Council and representatives of ICOL.  All four have confirmed they will be attending the hearing.  In a statement following the visit, it was announced: \u0026ldquoThe reporter considers it would be helpful to have some wider community participation at the hearing and suggests that these views might be represented by one or both of the local community councils.  A spokesperson for East Lothian Council said: \u0026ldquoThe appointed Reporter has decided that a hearing should be held on certain matters to help her consider the application, and the council has confirmed in writing that we will participate in this procedure. The council welcomes the Reporter\u0026rsquos decision to invite both Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council and Prestonpans Community Council to participate in the hearing.  A preliminary date for the start of the hearing has been announced as Tuesday, October 2, with a venue and more details of those attending to follow.  A spokesperson for ICOL said: \u0026ldquoWe welcome the announcement that a hearing will take place on the planning application for the proposed substation, in line with planning guidance for schemes of national importance. It is important that the local community has its say and we look forward to engaging with this process."},{"url":null,"title":"work-on-flats-at-former-musselburgh-tesco-set-to-start-in-spring","story":"  Plans were approved by East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos planning committee nearly a year ago.

The Association for the Protection of Rural Scotland  told East Lothian Council the plans to build next to medieval Dirleton Castle, which dates back to the mid 13th century, were too \u0026ldquomodern and suburban.  The association said the new development,\u0026nbspproposed at Castlemains Farm immediately to the east of the castle, would \u0026ldquoirreparably damage the setting of Dirleton, destroying the important edges that define the village and separate it from the surrounding countryside.  And at a meeting of the local authority\u0026rsquos planning committee in Haddington, councillors voted by seven to four to reject the plans, which had been recommended for approval by their own officers.  Local ward councillor Jane Henderson said that the intervention from APRS had been \u0026ldquocritical as she criticised Historic Environment Scotland, which is responsible for Dirleton Castle, after it\u0026nbspfailed to formally object to the proposals.  The public agency, who were consultees on the application, told the local authority that while they acknowledged the development might have an impact on the castle, which is a scheduled monument, they considered the proposals\u0026nbspnot to have an impact of \u0026ldquonational signicance.  Councillor Henderson said: \"I am particularly disappointed in Historic Environment Scotland. How they can hold that name and come through so weakly on the setting of a castle, you have to ask questions about that.  However, the agency said it had already responded to a previous application for housing on the same site which had later been withdrawn.  They said: \u0026ldquoWe were consulted by East Lothian Council on the planning application for Castlemains Farm in January 2018, on the potential impact of this application on the setting of Dirleton Castle and Gardens which is a scheduled monument.  \u0026ldquoThis second planning application addressed the concerns that had been raised when the first planning application was submitted, primarily the impact of the development on the relationship between the castle and the land to the south and east. As a result, we did not object to the application.  \u0026ldquoWe did, however, highlight a risk of impact from landscaping and lighting, and have recommended further mitigation.  Developers Queensberry Properties told the committee they had held extensive consultations with council planners and the local community but they admitted they had come to an impasse with Dirleton Village Association and had to \u0026ldquoagree to disagree.  Their spokesman told the committee that while they wanted the new houses to face outwards on the edge of the village instead of presenting visitors with a view of \u0026ldquogarden sheds and trampolines, the village association wanted the houses to \u0026ldquoturn their back on the outside world.  Architect John Finlay, who helped produce the Dirleton Expects document outlining the village association\u0026rsquos vision for its future, said: \u0026ldquoThe design is as alien as  it had landed from outer space. It even has a suburban road, with all the clutter that entails, in the forefront of the castle.  Martin White from Gullane Area Community Council said the group was opposed to the development because \u0026ldquoyou do not hide castles.  He said: \u0026ldquoDirleton Castle is one of East Lothian\u0026rsquos top five visitor attractions. It may not be of national impact but it certainly matters in East Lothian.  The council received 71 written objections and only one representation supporting the development, which cited a need for affordable housing in the village.  Dirleton Castle is a medieval fortress which dates back to the mid-13th century and has been at the centre of numerous sieges. At one point it was owned by the Ruthvens, who were involved in several plots against Mary Queen of Scots and King James VI.  Councillor Stuart Currie, planning committee member, raised concerns that the development appeared to bear little resemblance to the original development brief for the site that the local authority had consulted on with the community.  However, planning convenor Councillor Norman Hampshire said the fact those opposing the development did not have the support of Historic Environment Scotland and the council\u0026rsquos own heritage officer led him to back the planning officials\u0026rsquo recommendation to approve it.

The cake was 3ft4in\u0026nbspwide, and 8in\u0026nbsphigh, and is an exact replica of the building near Tranent High Street.  Using vanilla sponge sandwiched with buttercream, former architect Michelle carved the cake into shape before covering it in a sugar paste fondant.  She then printed the exterior of the shop onto edible paper, placing it onto the skeleton on the building.  For the finer details, Michelle used a sugar paste which she sculpted by hand.  The cake itself was crafted in Hayward\u0027s Heath, West Sussex, and then driven to Brighton, where Tranent-born George works.  \"He wanted to help revive the centre of town, so he\u0027s taken on a derelict building, and he\u0027s totally restoring it,\" said Sharon.

Then I realised it was actually a cake, and to see the level of detail and quality in doing something like that, it\u0027s quite fantastic.  \"I could take it home, put it in the building, and people would actually think it\u0027s an architect\u0027s model.\"  Sharon confirmed: \"George was absolutely blown away by the cake. He didn\u0027t want to cut it and was desperately trying to find a way to get it back to Scotland.

Amelia\u0026rsquos mum Kathryn Tait is one of those who will be climbing the 86 steps inside the lighthouse before slowing making a 121ft descent back to solid ground on Saturday, September 22.  She said: \u0026ldquoIt was Amelia\u0026rsquos gran, Shirley Dinning, who had the idea.  \u0026ldquoShe wanted to do the abseil from the Forth Bridge but they already had their charities and so she could not do it for the cystic fibrosis charities. That is why she decided to do it at the lighthouse.  \u0026ldquoI have never done anything like this.  \u0026ldquoI would not say I am looking forward to it but I am looking forward to raising money for the charities.  \u0026ldquoAmelia is going to need help the rest of her le and it is nice to give something back.  The youngster, who turned one last month, was born three weeks early at the Birth Centre in the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh .  It was three weeks later, following a routine heel prick, that it was discovered she had cystic fibrosis.  The genetic condition affects more than 10,400 people in the UK.  People with cystic fibrosis experience a build-up of thick, sticky mucus in the lungs, digestive system and other organs, causing a wide range of challenging symptoms affecting the entire body.  Kathryn said: \u0026ldquoShe had her heel prick test at five days old and then everything was fine.  \u0026ldquoThen, when she was three weeks old, we got a call from the Edinburgh Sick Kids Hospital to say we needed to go up because they had to discuss her results with us.  \u0026ldquoI phoned Amelia\u0026rsquos dad, Darren, at his work and said we needed to go there.  \u0026ldquoThey said she had cystic fibrosis and explained all about it \u0026ndash all about the genes, why she had it and that sort of stuff obviously it was a lot to take in.  Kathryn, who previously worked at Leuchie House, near North Berwick, as a care assistant, told the Courier she had heard of the condition but did not know a lot about it until speaking to the doctors.  Since the diagnosis, Amelia, who Kathryn described as \u0026ldquoalways smiling and [who] loves attention, has had regular trips to the Sick Kids to be checked over by doctors, nurses, physiotherapists and dieticians.  Kathryn, 23, of Dovecot Way, Haddington, said: \u0026ldquoAmelia has twice daily physio which she does not enjoy.  \u0026ldquoLuckily her pancreas is sufficient and she does not have to take enzymes to help her digest food.  \u0026ldquoWhen she does have an infection, it is quite an intensive course of antibiotics, three or four times a day.  \u0026ldquoIt is just the little things we have to watch for, like spraying deodorant because, obviously, you do not want her breathing that in and dust and things.  Now friends and family members, including Amelia\u0026rsquos older sisters Laura and Abby, are getting ready to give back to the two charities.

Dr Gordon Rintoul, director of National Museums Scotland, invited members of the public to attend either of the two public consultation events.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe are about to begin consultation on our plans for the next stage of development at the National Museum of Flight and warmly invite members of the public to come and hear our plans and tell us what they think.  \u0026ldquoWe are working with Hoskins Architects to design an entirely new hangar to be built on land right next to the museum\u0026rsquos home at East Fortune Airfield.  \u0026ldquoThis would provide a permanent home for the museum\u0026rsquos star attraction, Scotland\u0026rsquos Concorde, and help us protect other historically important aircraft which are currently at risk because they are displayed outdoors.  \u0026ldquoThe new building would enable us to signicantly improve the experience for visitors to the museum by creating a new entrance with better public facilities.  \u0026ldquoIt also presents us with the opportunity to rethink and enhance the presentation of the historic Second World War airfield, which is an important artefact in its own right.

The girl and the boy were trapped in the locked vehicle and were only rescued after passers-by heard the traumatised girl screaming \u0026ldquohelp, save us.  The concerned passer-by contacted the police and managed to calm the distraught children down by waiting by the vehicle while it was parked in a lay-by near to Prestonpans last year.  Yorkston, who was in charge of the children\u0026rsquos welfare, eventually appeared about 30 minutes later claiming he had \u0026ldquoonly been five minutes and had been relieving himself.  The 28-year-old then jumped into his car and drove away from the lay-by, leaving the police to launch a hunt for him and the two children.  Yorkston had previously admitted abandoning the children in the car last August when he appeared at Edinburgh Sherf Court earlier this year and he was due back in the dock last Wednesday.  Solicitor Cameron Tait, defending, said that his client had not attended court but asked Sherf Adrian Cottam to deal with the case in his absence.  Mr Tait added that the care of the children was now under supervision of the local social work department.  Sherf Cottam agreed and decided to admonish Yorkston on the charge of abandoning the children.  Previously, the court heard that the two children were spotted within the locked vehicle parked at a lay-by on the B1361 at about 5.30pm on August 16 last year.  Fiscal depute Mark Keane said: \u0026ldquoWitnesses were out for a walk and they observed a stationary car in the lay-by and saw two children within the car who very distressed.  \u0026ldquoThe girl was shouting \u0026lsquohelp, save us\u0026rsquo.  When asked where the person looking after her was, the girl pointed to an opening in the trees.  The fiscal added that \u0026ldquothe car was locked and the windows were fully up and it was \u0026ldquoa hot day.  \u0026ldquoThe witnesses became concerned about the children\u0026rsquos welfare and decided to phone the police and stay with the car for about 25 minutes, the fiscal added.  Solicitor Lesley Cunningham, defending, told the court that Yorkston had stopped for a toilet break as he took the children to a McDonald\u0026rsquos restaurant.  Ms Cunningham said that her client had \u0026ldquoan underlying drug problem at the time of the incident which was \u0026ldquonow resolved.  She added: \u0026ldquoMr Yorkston was taking the children to a McDonald\u0026rsquos and stopped by the side of the road for the toilet. He admits now this was foolish in the extreme. Fortunately there was no harm done to the children.  Yorkston admitted to being responsible for two children and wilfully abandoning them by leaving them alone within a locked vehicle while windows were fully closed in hot weather conditions at a lay-by on the B1361 near to Prestonpans on August 16 last year."},{"url":null,"title":"popular-former-musselburgh-church-minister-is-remembered","story":"  The American-born clergyman served Musselburgh Congregational Church, on Links Street, for 41 years after being inducted as its minister in 1968.  A bachelor, he retired to Gford in 2009.  With the help of neighbours and friends he remained at home until April, when his growing frailty led to him being admitted to Midlothian Community Hospital.  Just two weeks before he died, Mr Lindgren was moved to Herdmanflat Hospital in Haddington until a permanent home could be found but he passed away on July 18.  Mr Lindgren was born in Lynn, Massachusetts, on May 28, 1930 his father Raymond was Swedish and his mother Effie was a Macleod from the isle of Skye.  Mr Lindgren was ordained into church ministry in 1957 at the age of 27, holding a list of degrees including a Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Theology, Master of Theology and PhD.  He was inducted into the Ministry of Genoa Congregational Church in Nebraska, where he served for six years.  With practical experience under his belt, he went on to complete a post-graduate degree at New College Edinburgh before arriving in Musselburgh, where he took an avid interest in community le.  The Rev Janice Andrews, minister at Musselburgh Congregational Church, said: \u0026ldquoHe was one of the longest-serving members of Musselburgh Rotary Club.  \u0026ldquoWhen Musselburgh hosted the district conference he was charged with preaching to 1,000 delegates \u0026ndash an onerous task but members had complete confidence in his ability to speak to such a large audience, he was so very competent.  \u0026ldquoFor over 20 years of his ministry he served as chaplain to the 297 Musselburgh Squadron RAF Air Cadets.  \u0026ldquoHe had a keen interest in antiques and collected old postcards.  \u0026ldquoHe used this collection to publish an illustrated history of the towns and villages of East Lothian and the city of Edinburgh, evidence of his sincere interest in this beautul and historic area of Scotland.  She added: \u0026ldquoDonald handled the Gospel with truth and diligence. His sermons were always topical, he was knowledgeable, articulate and had the ability to keep his hearers engaged.  \u0026ldquoHis ministry was inclusive. He made everyone welcome whether they came regularly or very occasionally, he was always encouraging and approachable.  \u0026ldquoHe procured a beautul organ built by George Holdrich in the late 1800s for a church in Appleby in the Lake District which was due to be scrapped.  \u0026ldquoDonald had it restored and installed in Musselburgh Congregational Church, where it continues to rouse worshippers today.

The restricted service was only for general advice, which makes up about a quarter of the total bureau work, but paid staff were still available for case work and outreach services as normal.  Claire said: \u0026ldquoI think a lot of people don\u0026rsquot know that CAB is a volunteer-based charity, so we do rely on volunteers to be on reception, to become general advisers and also some of them do administrative work as well.  She said that volunteers were often people who were retired but wanted to keep mentally active, those who were between jobs and wanted to build new skills, and law students looking for experience.  Claire, who also handles financial capability issues at the CAB, started out as a volunteer adviser.  She said: \u0026ldquoWe always need volunteers, who are the leblood of the CAB.  \u0026ldquoWe have about 30 [volunteers] at the moment and 12 members of staff.  \u0026ldquoWe put a lot into advisers and helping them but not everyone makes it at the other end.  \u0026ldquoAs volunteers they can also take holidays whenever they want or attend appointments but it is important that we get a certain level of commitment.  She added: \u0026ldquoGeneral advisers deal with everything from the dog next door barking too loudly to entitlement to benefits.  \u0026ldquoThey also deal with dismissal cases, as well as helping people to make phone calls and write letters.  \u0026ldquoAround 35 per cent of the cases will be about benefits and about 20 per cent on debt followed by employment, housing, customer and local issues.  The CAB\u0026rsquos other volunteer support officer, Magdalena Szulc, who also began as a volunteer, agreed with her colleague.  She said: \u0026ldquoWe need people who can commit for six to seven hours\u0026rsquo volunteering each week and the training programme, which can take six to eight months.  \u0026ldquoThey also need good listening skills, to work well in teams, be open-minded, don\u0026rsquot judge people or their circumstances and enjoy helping people.

It is set amongst the fields which surround this old former mining village. The graveyard is reached taking a short walk which follows an old rail line. The surviving gravestones are not so old, yet I felt an immediate aura of antiquity as I entered the place.  As I wandered there I knew nothing of its past. I had stumbled upon it during a short walk from the village. I always explore when I get the chance, never knowing what I might find. It seemed neglected and strangely positioned, away from the village and no evidence of a kirk nearby. I assumed it to be connected to nearby Elphinstone Tower.  Yet soon afterwards I discovered that on the north-west of the graveyard there had indeed been a kirk a medieval pre-reformation chapel no less. Its foundations remain buried under the surface, its stones yet to tell its stories.  However, that is just one layer of this graveyard\u0026rsquos history, for it is described as overlying a prehistoric site of \u0026ldquonational importance by Ancient Monuments UK. I had been walking within an ancient fort, possibly as early as the late Bronze Age or early Iron Age. While visible evidence of this is now all gone, I can testy to the aura of antiquity which hangs there. Historic sites are often not just what you can see, but what you can sense and feel.  But the graveyard was not why I was in Elphinstone that day. I had taken a trip to this village to visit Meg\u0026rsquos Chuck. It\u0026rsquos a \u0026lsquobullet stone\u0026rsquo set in the village.  There is more than one story about this stone. One tale tells us that an elf is trapped within it. According to this story the elf was a servant of an Elphinstone witch called Meg.  One day the witch travelled in her carriage to a nearby burn and there had eaten food, refusing to share it with her elves. While she was having a post-scoff snooze, an elf snuck into her carriage and took the leftovers. The angry witch incarcerated the elf within the stone as a punishment.  The primary school have a version of this story painted in the playground and the children there are best to tell that tale! It\u0026rsquos a story which suggests a reason for the village name: \u0026lsquoElf in Stone\u0026rsquo!  But as is often the case, there is also an older folk tale about the stone, mentioned well over 100 years ago by P M\u0026rsquoNeill in his fascinating book of the traditions of the area. In this tale Meg is also the main character. Here is my re-telling of this old story:  The stone which now stands in Elphinstone village once stood by the smiddy. It was owned by a well-kent witch of the village called Meg. She was not the only witch in the area, for she had many friends who were also witches. They were all married women, with heavy domestic duties to perform and little time for themselves during the day.  However, as night fell and their \u0026ldquoauld gude men lay soond asleep at hame, this happy group of witches would meet up at Harry\u0026rsquos Burn, a short distance from the village but far enough away to be out of earshot of a sleeping husband.  Here the sisterhood would have witchy fun and play games. Meg would bring the bullet stone for a game of chuck , a game in which four stones are laid on a surface while one is thrown in the air. The player must pick up all the four stones, then catch the thrown stone as it falls back to the ground.  Perhaps this huge stone was actually the one thrown into the air. After all, they were witches and so a normal game of chuckie would have been a bit mundane. I do not know exactly how heavy it is but it would defeat anyone trying to lt it without magic or machinery.  In fact it would have been a fair challenge to carry from the village to the burn, even for a witch. And that is why Meg didn\u0026rsquot carry it to her liaisons. She used magic, of course. As her husband snored in the house she would creep out to the stone and turn it into a horse. I can visualise her mounting this confused beast in the light of the moon, then riding speedily with joyful laughter towards Harry\u0026rsquos Burn to meet her friends and enjoy the short time of freedom from domestic duties.  There at Harry\u0026rsquos Burn she would dismount and greet her friends. No doubt they all had dferent and novel methods of travel to get to their location: a flying sieve, riding a wolf, even a husband changed into a horse are all possibilities according to the beliefs of the time!  Upon her arrival Meg would lead the horse to the burn to drink. As soon as it had quenched its thirst, Meg changed it back to a stone. And so the heavy stone was successfully transported so the witches could play their game.  Then, when the fun was over, Meg turned the stone back into a horse for the  journey, carefully dismounting at the end of her journey on the same spot by the smiddy, and then transforming the poor creature back into stone.  And so the bullet stone remains in the village after Meg\u0026rsquos final journey. It can be found opposite the primary school and is called Meg\u0026rsquos Chuck. As far as I know it hasn\u0026rsquot been a horse since the last time Meg changed it into one, so it will be desperate for some exercise by now.  There is no reason not to believe that Meg also trapped an elf within the stone, as the later tale suggests. She was, after all, a witch with powerful magic.  So  you sit on it, be careful about the words you mutter. You might just accidentally say the spell that transforms it into a horse, and then you\u0026rsquoll be off on a terryingly wild ride to Harry\u0026rsquos Burn, possibly in the company of a hyperactive and by now very hungry elf.  Or maybe that would be fun! I wonder what the spell was. Maybe the children in the school have an idea?"},{"url":null,"title":"youtube-and-wikipedia-edit-a-thon-event-for-preston-tower","story":"  Dig It!

One of the two reactors at the power station, to the east of the town, is being taken offline.  The programme means hundreds of extra workers will join the 750-strong regular workforce for the maintenance period, known as a \u0026ldquostatutory outage.  Robert Gunn, station director, said: \u0026ldquoIt is Torness Power Station\u0026rsquos 30th birthday this year and this is the 22nd statutory outage we have carried out at the station.  \u0026ldquoWe are very well practised at them and over the years we have built great relationships with the extra workers who come and support us during the outages.  \u0026ldquoThese workers will be staying in local hotels and B\u0026ampBs, eating in the area\u0026rsquos restaurants and using taxi firms.  \u0026ldquoIt is great that our investment in the power station can also benefit our local community just as the peak tourist season is coming to an end.  \u0026ldquoWe carry out maintenance and inspections on the units that generate the electricity all-year-round but a statutory outage gives us the chance to carry out pieces of work that are not possible when the reactor is operating.  Philip Mellor, chairman of Dunbar Trades\u0026rsquo Association  and owner of the Dunmuir Hotel, was delighted with the news.  He said: \u0026ldquoIt is very positive news.  \u0026ldquoI am delighted to welcome people to Dunbar and certainly as we move into the quieter season, as the holidaymakers have left, it is the ideal time for EDF to run this type of project.  \u0026ldquoIt will massively benefit the community as a whole.  EDF Energy carries out a statutory outage on each of its reactors once every three years.  These are planned in advance with the National Grid to ensure that there is no impact on the national electricity supply.  The other reactor at Torness is due to continue operating normally throughout the period.  During the outage workers will carry out more than 12,000 separate pieces of work \u0026ndash each carefully planned during the last two years of preparation.  The biggest projects include fitting of additional reactor gas temperature instrumentation, exchange of the turbine intermediate and low-pressure rotors, and replacement of auxiliary cooling water pipework systems.  Torness Power Station\u0026rsquos two nuclear reactors generate enough electricity to power more than two million homes and started operating in 1988.  The station employs more than 500 full-time staff and about 250 full-time contract partners.

Forensic examinations carried out by the authorities in Egypt reported the cause of deaths as being linked to E.coli bacteria, however this was dismissed by the couple\u0026rsquos daughter Kelly Ormerod last week.  Solicitors acting for the family said on Monday further Home Office post mortems had proven \u0026ldquoinconclusive but further tests will be carried out.

Perth Sherf Court was told on Wednesday that the assault conviction was likely to lead to his dismissal from his job driving vulnerable people for the local authority.  Solicitor Jamie Baxter, defending, said: \"He has held employment with Glasgow City Council as a driver for children with special needs for 19 years.  \"As a consequence of this it is likely that his job will be terminated. He is already suspended and subject to an ongoing investigation.\"  Sherf Gillian Wade, who found McIntosh guilty of assault after a trial, fined him \u0026pound750.  She told him: \"It was a most unfortunate incident to have taken place and you are now suffering the consequences of having a conviction for assault on your record.  \"This will be very much felt by yourself. It is important you put this behind you.\"  McIntosh was driving a coach full of Celtic fans which crashed into a car in a road rage incident on the A9. He then parked and got out to punch Mr Wall, from Uphall, in the face.  Mr Wall told the court: \"My we Alexa was asleep. The bus sped up as I was braking. The chevrons were coming up and the lanes were merging.  \"The bus was driving right behind me. I saw him gesticulating at me. I thought it was some sort of road rage about something.  \"He was hooting his horn and flashing his lights and my we woke up. I thought I should slow down in case anything happened.  \"I was frightened. My we was frightened.\"  He said the bus pulled out into the oncoming carriageway to overtake but cars appeared travelling towards them and McIntosh swerved the football coach back in.  \"The bus pulled over and hit the rear of my car. I was trying to keep the car straight on the road. The car bounced. I felt it shudder.  \"It was quite clear we had been hit at about 50 miles per hour. My hands were shaking,\" Mr Wall said.  He pulled into a layby and was followed in by the bus full of Celtic fans ing from their match against Ross County in Dingwall.  As the supporters got out and urinated, McIntosh stormed past Mrs Wall and punched her husband in the face and knocked off his glasses.  Mr Wall said: \"I looked up to see the bus driver standing over me. There was a look of anger and the fist came down like a hammer. I saw his raised fist above me and he banged it down on my temple.  \"I hammered backwards into the car. I saw a white light.

McIntosh, Stewart Crescent, Barrhead, was found guilty of assaulting Mr Wall on the A9 by punching him on the head to his injury on 16 April 2017.

His determination to clear his name of allegations of sexual impropriety has the potential to tear the Scottish Government and the SNP apart. The two most important politicians in the modern history of Scottish nationalism have been pitted against each other at the very moment the party needs to unite over the future of independence.  We\u0027ve had the extraordinary spectacle of the former First Minister, and SNP leader, conducting a war of legal words over social media with the current First Minister, and SNP leader. In y posts, Nicola Sturgeon defended the anti-sexual harassment procedures she introduced in January, and insisted on fairness for the complainants. Alex Salmond has condemned that due process as an unfair kangaroo court. Worse, he\u0027s accused the Scottish Government of leaking salacious details of the allegations to undermine him. Mr Salmond has even raised an action against the Scottish Government in the Court of Session.  For their part, Scottish Labour say that Nicola Sturgeon should already have suspended her predecessor from the party. That she has failed to follow the precedent set by the expulsion of the former Children\u0026rsquos Minister, Mark Macdonald. No formal complaint been lodged, however, with the SNP that could trigger such a disciplinary procedure. But to the dismay of many members, Ms Sturgeon has pointedly failed to rule out Mr Salmond\u0027s future defenestration. She can\u0027t.  The FM faces an acute dilemma. Under the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos procedures, complaints against former ministers are assessed by the civil service. If the result is problematic it is handed to the First Minister, \u0026ldquoin their capacity as party leader, so that the FM \u0026ldquocan take action to secure the highest standards of behaviour in the current administration. It\u0027s not clear what actions should be taken here, but you can be pretty sure critics will insist that suspension from the party is one of them. The allegations have been serious enough to be handed to the police.  However, the usual resignation argument that a minister cannot do their job properly until they\u0027ve \u0026ldquocleared their name does not apply. Alex Salmond sits in no parliament, holds no senior position in the party and is merely a sometime television presenter.  Labour\u0027s Rhoda Grant called for Mr Salmond to be suspended in order to create \u0026ldquoa safe space for his accusers \u0026ndash the two women who have made complaints. But it\u0027s not at all clear what kind of threat he is supposed to present to these women, or how removing Mr Salmond\u0027s membership card would make the space they occupy any more safe. The implication that Alex Salmond is some kind of crazed sex criminal, who cannot be allowed to walk free, is appalling. He\u0027s been found guilty of no improper conduct whatever.  Of course, the real damage was done by whoever leaked the confidential details of the allegations that he sexually assaulted two women. This vastly increased pressure on the First Minister to suspend Mr Salmond for the duration. He strenuously rejects the allegations and says he\u0027s been denied the right to see the evidence. That\u0027s assuming there is any concrete evidence.  Police and government agencies tend to work nowadays on the supposed Macpherson Principle that \u0026ldquovictims should always be believed, which is sometimes taken to mean that actual evidence is superfluous. Following a succession of miscarriages of justice, the politan Police has now abandoned this inversion of the presumption of innocence, and changed its guidance to say that accusers should be \u0026ldquolistened to rather than their allegations automatically accepted as fact. But it may be too late for Alex Salmond. In politics, you are now guilty until proven innocent. All the parties have tended to suspend politicians when allegations become public.  Many in the SNP are dismayed that Ms Sturgeon did not, at the very least, give her former mentor some kind of positive character reference last week, and then refuse to comment further. The First Minister placed herself at the forefront of the controversy, declaring that she was \u0026ldquo100% behind the Permanent Secretary, Leslie Evans, whom Mr Salmond\u0027s supporters believe has acted as judge and jury. Her remark that the complaints couldn\u0027t be \u0026ldquoswept under the carpet sounded damning.  The unalloyed glee among opposition politicians at what they see as the final humiliation of their greatest former foe is matched in the SNP by a kind of existential despair. It is hard to convey just how important Alex Salmond is to the independence movement. Political journalists and Women for Independence may regard the former leader as a hangover from alpha male politics, but for many ordinary nationalists he has hero status, comparable to that of Charles Stewart Parnell, the 19th century Irish Nationalist with whom Salmond used to compare himself. Unfortunately, that career ended with a sex scandal, too, over Parnell\u0027s adultery.  Irish nationalists always believed that Parnell was brought down by Establishment dirty tricks. There is an unshakeable conviction among many in the SNP that today\u0027s scandal must be,  not the work of M15, then a move by the deep state to silence an influential voice on the eve of a possible announcement of a second independence referendum. Salmond promised in his so-called Morningside Declaration in May to  to front line politics as soon as indyref2 is announced.  But  this is an establishment plot, then the unfortunate reality for Nationalists is that Nicola Sturgeon finds herself at the apex of it. As the new parliamentary term begins she\u0027ll come under intense pressure to suspend Mr Salmond from the party, or be accused of favouritism and hypocrisy. But  Alex Salmond were expelled on the eve of the most crucial SNP conference in years, the consequences would be unimaginable. The SNP has not just been rocked by this development it has been traumatised \u0026ndash and it may never be quite the same again."},{"url":null,"title":"leading-academics-question-scotlands-flagship-free-education-policy","story":"  A series of leading voices raised concerns about the policy which sees Scottish students attend university without paying tuition fees as their counterparts do in the rest of the UK. There were also concerns raised about the overall level of funding for higher education.  One senior academic, who is part of the executive team of one of the nation\u0026rsquos leading universities, described the policy as a \u0026lsquoprop for the middle classes\u0026rsquo, and added that free university education was a \u0026lsquosacred cow\u0026rsquo in Scottish public le that could not be openly challenged.  :\u0026nbspNew industrial revolution means workers may never retire, warns Mark Carney  They also called for a \u0026lsquonational debate\u0026rsquo on the issue. They added that there was concern about the current system preventing the widening of access to higher education for those from low-income homes due to the limit put on the numbers of Scottish students at university.  The principal of another leading university, speaking on condition of anonymity, said: \u0026ldquoThe current funding model is unsustainable  we are going to get the level of investment we need to compete at the highest levels internationally and make sure we can take as many young Scots into higher education as possible in order to create a skilled population.\u0026rsquo  Free access to university puts an effective cap on the number of Scottish students that the sector can take in order to keep within Scottish government budgetary guidelines. In England and Wales, fees are around \u0026pound9,000 a year.  \"Funding is putting us in a dficult position,\" the university principal said. \"There\u0026rsquos been low investment from the Scottish government for over a decade now. It is time to look at a gradual increase in tuition fees for Scottish students - or at least consider it. A national conversation is needed.  \"It is dficult to have that conversation without it being politicised, and that dissuades constructive debate. We need to find a \u0026lsquosafe space\u0026rsquo where we can explore the pros and cons.  \"Is free education a good thing? Yes,  it is affordable, but no,  it is a challenge to sustain. A new model would mean more staff, more students and a better Scotland. Universities are places of innovation and we need innovation on this issue now.\"  Peter Mathieson, principal of Edinburgh University, said there was a \u0026lsquorisk of politicising education\u0026rsquo, adding: \"When it comes to the debate around tuition fees, my view is:  you want high quality education then it\u0026rsquos got to be paid for as it is expensive. Whether it is paid for by tuition fees, governments or loans, that is a debate we can have in society.  Mathieson said that the \u0026lsquorole of tuition fees versus other means of funding is very personal for me as I was the first member of my family to go to university\u0026rsquo. His father died young and his family did not have a lot of money, he said, adding that  there had been \u0026lsquotuition fees in my day then I think it less likely I would have gone to university\u0026rsquo.  Mathieson said he did not want the fear of debt to deter students from higher education. However, he said: \"The idea that we\u0026rsquove got to make sure higher education is attainable - for me that doesn\u0026rsquot immediately translate into an ideological argument over tuition fees.  He went on: \u0026ldquoWhen I was a school leaver my ability to tolerate debt was very limited, the reality for a lot of school leavers now is that  they are going to go to university they need to be able to tolerate debt. I think that\u0026rsquos an issue we can\u0026rsquot hide from.  He added: \u0026rsquoI think university education without realistic estimates of what it costs is counter-productive. The idea that Scotland doesn\u0026rsquot want tuition fees I can live with, as long as there is a recognition that the money has to come from somewhere. What I don\u0026rsquot accept is that education is free, as it is not.\"  Mathieson said he wanted to see the contribution from the Scottish government increased. \"If we want more Scottish students at university and they aren\u0026rsquot going to pay tuition fees then that level of income needs to be increased.\"  He mooted more sponsorship from industry - including the armed forces. \"In own my field, medicine, the armed forces sponsor some students so you can have army-sponsored medical students who then commit to working with the armed forces after graduation.\"  Jim McDonald, principal of Strathclyde University, said that his institution delivered \u0026lsquosix times the investment from the government back into the Scottish economy\u0026rsquo, adding: \u0026ldquoI am sure the Scottish government understands the value of the higher education sector but  you look internationally there are many of our competitors both in Europe, America and Asia, which are really ramping up investment in higher education as they see it as a key component of growth.  \"This means in order to attract and retain the best academic talent and best students from home and abroad, we need to make sure that higher education is properly funded.  Professor Sir Anton Muscatelli, principal of Glasgow University, said he supports the current policy by the Scottish government. Muscatelli said tuition fees are a \u0026lsquosocietal choice. \"What we see is that in developed countries, some chose to keep education free - like Scotland, Germany and Scandinavia. What you have to do is invest in the cost of higher education, and frankly we are happy with the investment that we are receiving from the public purse to educate home students. He said Scotland, Germany and Sweden all had \u0026ldquogreat universities. I think you have great publicly funded systems around the world that work very well.  Muscatelli, chair of the Russell Group of leading universities and a prominent economist internationally, added: \u0026ldquoOther countries, such as England, have gone another way, but let\u0026rsquos not kid ourselves, you see the debate in England - fees were introduced and now people are saying perhaps some of this should be publicly funded. Society will periodically go through this debate, but as long as universities are properly funded through the public purse I am perfectly happy with the situation.  John Swinney, the deputy First Minister and education secretary, said he \u0026ldquolooked at tuition fees through the lens of values. The values I associate with education is that society should benefit from collective investment in the educational development of our population - that is the moral purpose of education.  He added: \u0026ldquoWhat comes with that is a commitment to make sure that universities are properly and effectively funded, and that is the very firm commitment we have given to our institutions.  On comments that the effective cap on Scottish student numbers limited access to university for poorer students, Swinney said: \u0026ldquoI don\u0026rsquot accept that point. What is important is that we make sure there are no barriers in the way of young people from a range of backgrounds gaining access to university education.  :\u0026nbspThe Mackintosh Building will be rebuilt - Muriel Gray on the Glasgow School of Art\u0027s plan to restore the the iconic building  He also reiterated the government\u0026rsquos commitment to the policy, saying: \u0026ldquoWe are absolutely committed to the policy of no tuition fees approach to university for Scottish students and that will remain the commitment of the SNP government.  Mary Senior, the University and College\u0026rsquos Union Scottish official, said Scotland should not go down the same route as England when it came to tuition fees, and added that the effective cap on Scottish students was a \u0026ldquopressure that needed to be addressed."},{"url":null,"title":"herald-on-sunday-diary-grunts-screams-and-funny-names-it-must-be-the-work-of-the-hand-of-god","story":"  Watching last weekend\u0026rsquos US Open tennis final, the loud grunts coming from the players as they served and ed the ball sounded like two disgruntled jungle primates preparing to have a square go. However,  you were a mammal vocalisation researcher listening in \u0026ndash yes there are such people! \u0026ndash you would have been able to tell whether the winner was going to be Novak Djokovic or Juan Martin Del Potro and put your money on Novak to beat the bookies\u0026rsquo odds.  We know that grunting can distract an opponent \u0026ndash one Dutch player was once docked a point for counter-grunting \u0026ndash and can also help a player to hit signicantly harder, but predicting the outcome by grunt? Apparently so. Last year three such researchers at the University of Sussex published a paper in the journal Animal Behaviour entitled \u0026ldquoTennis Grunts Communicate Acoustic Cues to Sex and Contest Outcome. The conclusion was that, when winning, players\u0026rsquo grunts are lower pitched and losers pitch higher.  So  you\u0026rsquore a grunt aficionado you\u0026rsquod be able to confound the Ladbrokes algorithm and cash in. The lead researcher, one Jordan Raine, analysed 394 ying grunts from Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic in the 2011 Wimbledon final and built his research from there. Nadal\u0026rsquos grunt apparently reveals \u0026ldquodeterministic chaos, akin to a motorbike erupting, while Djokovic\u0026rsquos ies a lot, but the one constant is something that sounds like a stled sneeze.

SCREAMS AND ARROWS OF OUTRAGEOUS FORTUNE  Still in the strange but true and absolutely irrelevant category, going up to 11 on the Richter scale of sound effects, is the Wilhelm Scream, the most famous and most-used one in movie history, ululating in more than 370 films to date, from Toy Story to Star Wars \u0026ndash where Luke Skywalker shoots a Stormtrooper on the Death Star who falls off the edge \u0026ndash to Lord of the Rings and Reservoir Dogs.  The effect was called Wilhelm after the on-screen name of an actor who gives it out as he is hit by an arrow in the 1953 Western Charge at Feather River. But it was actually created two years earlier in a Raoul Walsh oater, Distant Drums, starring Gary Cooper, where a soldier is dragged underwater by an alligator and as he goes lets out the bellow. It was dubbed-on in post production by the musician and actor Sheb Wooley who was working on the film as a voice extra.  Wooley has never received proper credit for the scream, nor, I doubt, residuals for re-use. And he certainly shouldn\u0026rsquot get any credit for bringing out possibly the worst-ever song in popular music, The Purple People Eater. It was covered by our own teen pop star in a kilt, Leith\u0027s own Jackie Dennis, in 1958. And by Judy Garland.

She went on: \"I have to say that that choice of language is completely inappropriate.  \"I was Home Secretary for six years and, as Prime Minister for two years now using language like that was not right and it\u0027s not language I would have used.\"  The PM was once described as \"bloody dficult woman\" by former Cabinet minister Ken Clarke, and later claimed the description as a badge of honour.  She told the programme that person was \"still there\" but there was a \u0026ldquodference between those who think you can only be bloody dficult in public and those who think actually you bide your time, and you\u0027re bloody dficult when the time is right and when it really matters.\""},{"url":null,"title":"a-good-week-for-the-eu-with-its-stance-on-hungary","story":"  Prime Minister Victor Orb\u0026aacuten of the ruling Hungarian Fidesz party came to Strasbourg to debate the criticisms in a resolution drawn up by Dutch MEP and my group colleague Judith Sargentini. If anyone needs a refresher it is worth remembering this is a man who has called migrants poison, referred to \u0026lsquomuslim invaders\u0026rsquo and peddled anti-Semitic myths about George Soros. His government, democratically elected it has to be said, has forcibly retired judges, banned international NGOs from working in Hungary, built a fence to keep out refugees and lots more besides.  As one academic succinctly put it this week \u0026ldquothe EU is like a club with a strong bouncer, but little security once you\u0026rsquore inside the venue. The present Hungarian government has not been abiding by the values that make up the EU, and the EU, slowly, had got round to acting. The Parliament, for the first time ever, was to debate the triggering of Article 7 proceedings, effectively putting Hungary in a sin bin cutting funding, limiting voting rights and other measures until it plays by the rules.  On the day he simply fell back on tired rhetoric asserting that the report \u0026ldquoinsults the honour of the Hungarian nation whilst feeding a victim complex that the Parliament had already made up its mind. He fell back on anti-immigration rhetoric repeatedly talking about migrants whilst ignoring all other criticisms proudly proclaiming that \u0026ldquothe Hungarian people have decided not to be a nation of migrants.  Remember, Hungary signed up to the values of the EU when it joined and these values are part of the organisation. These include the rights of iniduals and the EU institutions must defend them where possible, particularly in the face of the threats we now face. Europe is a continent of migrants and  our history shows us anything it is that narrow minded anti-immigrant rhetoric always ends badly.  Unsurprisingly his speech fell flat. MEPs from the centre right EPP, the centre left S\u0026ampD, the liberal ALDE and Green groups all stood one by one to condemn his government\u0026rsquos actions and at the end of the day with 448 votes in favour the European Parliament voted to recommend the initiation of Article 7 proceedings. This is a real strong sign that EU values must be respected and could result in Hungary being stripped of its right to vote in the Council of the European Union.  The details of the resolution that we approved are grim reading. The Budgetary Control Committee recommends deduction of EU funding to Hungary over concerns that much of it ends up in the pockets of his cronies the Culture Committee condemns attacks on academic freedom the Constitutional Affairs Committee condemns infringement of judicial independence the Committee on Women\u0026rsquos Rights condemns reversals on gender equality.  This week\u0026rsquos debate got to the heart of what the EU is for. To what extent should the sovereign EU states be able to pick and choose from the common rules they all voluntarily signed up to? To what extent should the rest of us be able to call them on it? Can solidarity be imposed?  None of these have simple answer, and in the EU everything is connected to everything else, that\u0026rsquos the point. Recently, in Greece a profligate series of Greek governments tipped their economy into chaos, and it was only EU support that avoided a worse disaster. But could, should, the EU have been gentler with the Greek people themselves? I would say yes, but then, why should my taxpayers in Scotland pay for irresponsible profligacy at the other end of the continent?  Catalonia too has shown that the EU is ultimately a club of member states and there is work to do. There\u0026rsquos a democratic discussion that needs to be promoted between Barcelona and Madrid and the EU has not stepped up, though I hope it may yet. At least on Hungary, this week the Parliament has stood up for democracy and the rule of law.  However, in the face of this overwhelming display of what the EU can be, there were still 197 members of our European Parliament that opposed taking action against Mr Orb\u0026aacuten. My greatest shock comes not from UKIP and the Front National, you\u0026rsquod expect it of them, but from the UK Conservatives who were the only governing right-wing party to support him.  They voted to support the policies and the man, in the face of everything he stands for. My most charitable explanation is that this shows the chronic weakness of the UK post-Brexit as its government desperately cuddles up to anyone who might provide some help irrespective of morals or long-term strategic cost. At its worst this is a sign that the Conservative party is shting hard to the right and anything goes.  I think it is the latter and increasingly I do not think you can describe the Conservatives as a centre-right party. The clues are in the company they keep. It was because of an ill thought out commitment to appease the right in David Cameron\u0026rsquos 2005 leadership campaign that the party left the centre-right EPP group of the parliament and set up their own. Earlier this year they invited the anti-migrant Swedish-Democrats to join them. Yes, the party that was the focus of so much concern in last weekend\u0026rsquos Swedish election are happy members of the same Group as Mrs May\u0026rsquos Tories.  Unfortunately, the rhetoric of our Prime Ministers also fits with that of the hard right. David Cameron talked about \u0026ldquoswarms of migrants. In the debate this week Mr Bay of the French Front National said that \u0026ldquothe EU promotes multiculturalism, against out values. How is that so dferent from Mrs May\u0026rsquos \u0026ldquo you believe you are a citizen of the world, you are a citizen of nowhere?  I fear for the Tories and for what they may turn into. I fear for what that means for the rest of us  we\u0026rsquore stuck in a brexit Britain run by them. Right now there is a fight going on in constituency branches across the UK. This is a fight for the soul of their party and I fear the old fashioned \u0026lsquosmall c\u0026rsquo liberal Conservatives are losing. There are still those fighting but they are increasingly cast out or in a minority. The MEPs Richard Ashworth and Julie Girling voted against Orb\u0026aacuten but they have already felt the need to leave the Conservative group in the Parliament. Only one actual Tory MEP voted against Orb\u0026aacuten and I want to end by praising Nosheena Mobarik, Conservative MEP for Scotland. She not only voted with us and her conscience, she defied what I\u0026rsquod guess was a pretty tough London imposed group whip as well. I hope her colleagues across the UK will look to her action, ask themselves some hard questions and set about challenging those who are changing the Tory party into something they find unthinkable. Their silent acquiescence has implications for all of us."},{"url":null,"title":"scottish-high-streets-in-the-running-to-be-named-best-in-the-uk","story":"  The retail hotspots are all in the running to win a \u0026pound15,000 prize as part of the Great British High Street Awards 2018.

Newport-on-Tay is also in the running for the rising star award, as well as Prestwick Main Street and Ayr High Street.  The categories will now be put to a public vote, which counts for 30 per cent of the final score, before being looked at by a judging panel.  High Streets Minister Jake Berry MP said: \u0026ldquoCongratulations to all 38 high streets shortlisted for this year\u0026rsquos Great British High Street Awards.  \u0026ldquoThe awards celebrate the great work that is being done to revive, adapt and ersy the nation\u0026rsquos high streets and the quality of entries this year has been outstanding.  \u0026ldquoOver the next six weeks they have the chance to impress an expert judging panel as they also battle it out in a public vote for the title of Britain\u0026rsquos best high street.  \u0026ldquoThis is a great opportunity to show your support for all the hard work taking place on our high streets, so get voting.  The shortlist comes after recent research by credit card firm Visa, which sponsors the awards, showed signs of renewed confidence in the country\u0026rsquos high streets despite a challenging retail environment.  The findings revealed that more than a third  of Scotland\u0026rsquos independent high street retailers are optimistic about the future of their local high street, while almost four out of five  Scottish shoppers claim they would miss their local high street  it was no longer there.  Sundeep Kaur, head of UK \u0026amp Ireland Merchant Services at Visa, said: \u0026ldquoAt a time when the nation\u0026rsquos high streets are transforming, this year\u0026rsquos Great British High Street Awards shortlist contains some fantastic examples of high streets and merchants which are evolving and embracing change to attract visitors.  \u0026ldquoIt is genuinely heartening to see so many businesses and communities that are harnessing their adaptability, resilience and creativity to offer the services and experiences that today\u0026rsquos shoppers want.  Author and TV presenter Simon Reeve, who will act as a judge, added: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquove spent the last couple of months visiting independent high street retailers across the UK and I\u0026rsquove been blown away by the passion and commitment shown by shopkeepers to keep their high streets alive, especially in this challenging climate.  \u0026ldquoThe best examples are those that are listening closely to their customers and innovating to meet their demands. These are the shops and high streets that will stand the test of time.  A total of 38 high streets have been shortlisted for the 2018 awards, which are organised by the Ministry of Housing, Communities \u0026amp Local Government.  The public and the judges will select an overall UK winner, as well as a winner from England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland for each of the two categories: the Champion and Rising Star awards.

For example, step forward Jo \u0026ldquosoon to be the next party leader, possibly, perhaps, Swinson, who claimed the yellow peril \"lost too many arguments\" when hooked up to the terrible Tories and the compromises they agreed to simply \"sucked\".  \u0026ldquoWhen they fought dirty, we were too nice, declared the champion from East Dunbartonshire.  \"And austerity left behind people who Liberals are in politics to protect.\"  Yet, the Coalition knight from Kingston, Sir Ed Davey, the former Energy Secretary, popped onto the press room to tell the small but perfectly formed merry band of hacks attending conference what a wonderful experience the Lib-Con partnership had been and he was \"deeply, deeply proud\" of the \u0026ldquoamazing things achieved during that golden period.  Elsewhere, the nice, happy-clappy Army of Lib Dems, wearing EU-starred berets, yellow T-shirts and even yellow shorts \u0026ndash I kid you not \u0026ndash gathered for Uncle Vince\u0026rsquos fireside chat.  One question echoed Ms S\u0026rsquos point: are the Lib Dems too nice?  Uncle Vince admitted niceness was a \u0026ldquotemperamental failure we all have and agreed with Ms S that perhaps the Lib Dems could have been \u0026ldquonastier and more aggressive with the Cameroons. Surely not.  But he said that the best way to deal with the likes of Brexiteers such as Jacob Rees-Mogg was not to imitate them. \u0026ldquoGod forbid, we should engage in that kind of crude gutter populism, declared the big V.  He insisted part of the yellow peril\u0026rsquos appeal was that it rejected that \u0026ldquosimple-minded approach to politics, that looks for scapegoats.  He then declared, ironically, to loud applause: \u0026ldquoWe shouldn\u0026rsquot be betraying our values simply to make a big noise.  Also during the Q\u0026ampA, Uncle Vince was asked  the Lib Dems should think of getting into bed again with the Tories or Labour. The party leader didn\u0026rsquot blink before insisting to cheers: \u0026ldquoThe simple answer is no.  Noting how the current iding line between his party and the Corbyn comrades and the May marauders not just on Brexit but a whole range of issues was \u0026ldquoenormous.  \u0026ldquoYou have a very right wing authoritarian Conservative Party - and that\u0026rsquos ignoring the extremes - and you have the Labour Party, which is in this absolutely appalling state, where even many of its own MPs dissemble.

Whether the earth will move in Brighton during this week\u0026rsquos conference is a moot point but  the party is to rise up the polls, perhaps those nice Lib Dems will finally have to engage in some political rough and tumble."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/7797102.jpg?type=article-full","title":"majority-of-scots-want-holyrood-to-control-immigration","story":"  A poll shows that 64% of Scots back immigration devolution for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland giving them powers to decide how many visas are issued for people who want to work there.  A new report says just one in ten Scots think that the UK government has managed immigration competently and fairly and the authors say urgent action is need to restore public trust. Across the UK they are slightly more supportive with only 15% backing Britain\u0027s handling of immigration.  The figures come from the largest-ever public consultation on immigration, ahead of the independent Migration Advisory Committee\u0026rsquos immigration report on Tuesday expected to be pivotal to shaping Theresa May\u0026rsquos post-Brexit immigration policy.    Nicola Sturgeon has made repeated calls for a Scottish-specic immigration system in the aftermath of the Brexit vote.  But the Home Office believes that applying dferent immigration rules to dferent parts of the UK would complicate the system, harming its integrity, and cause dficulties for employers who they say need the flexibility to deploy their staff to dferent parts of the UK.  It says that it will engage with and consider the views of the Scottish Government and businesses when deciding on any action over the MAC findings.  The new report from the National Conversation on Immigration, co-ordinated by think tank British Future and anti-prejudice campaigners HOPE not hate, said that even the English agreed that Scotland should take control.  Some 55% across the UK said the devolved governments should have powers over immigration. The policy is also supported by half of those who live in the Midlands  and the south east  and by Leave  and Remain  voters.    Stuart McDonald, the SNP spokesman on immigration, asylum and border control said: \u0026ldquoThe support for devolution of migration powers recorded by the National Conversation is hugely signicant and welcome. Not only in Scotland, but across the UK, people have had enough of one-size-fits-all migration rules and do not believe that the UK government will deliver competent or fair migration policies.  \u0026ldquoIt is more urgent that ever for the UK government to devolve migration powers to the Scottish Parliament, so we can build a system that is designed to meet Scotland\u0026rsquos needs and aspirations \u0026ndash for example, a post-study work visa, rules that allow families to stay together, and visas that encourage people to work, start businesses and invest here.  The First Minister has argued that Scotland needs power over immigration to attract more people north of the border where there is a rapidly ageing population.    But earlier this month, CBI Director-General Carolyn Fairbairn, one of the most influential figures in British industry said that businesses are not ready for a separate Scottish immigration system.  Earlier this month, the Home Secretary unveiled a pilot scheme that will allow fruit and vegetable growers to recruit non-EU migrants as seasonal workers - but critics say it goes \"nowhere near\" far enough to plug a recruitment crisis in Scots fruit-picking industry.  The new report calls for an annual \u0026lsquoMigration Day\u0026rsquo in Parliament, where ministers are held accountable for their performance against a three-year immigration strategy that it says should replace the annual net migration target, and would have input from the devolved administrations.    Jill Rutter, director of strategy for British Future and co-author of the report, said: \u0026ldquoThe lack of trust we found in the government to manage immigration is quite shocking. People want to have their voices heard on the choices we make, and to hold their leaders to account on their promises.  \u0026ldquoWhile people do want the UK Government to have more control over who can come to the UK, most of them are \u0026lsquobalancers\u0026rsquo \u0026ndash they recognise the benefits of migration to Britain, both economically and culturally, but also voice concerns about pressures on public services and housing.  Rosie Carter of HOPE not hate, co-author of the report, added: \u0026ldquoImmigration is a national issue, but people see it through a local lens. Where people live, and their living conditions, makes a real dference \u0026ndash that includes the perceived impact of migration on their community, broader grievances about economic insecurity and levels of contact with migrants and ethnic minorities too.  \u0026ldquoAn official National Conversation on Immigration would give people a chance to express their concerns in a constructive debate, so anxieties are not driven underground or exploited by those seeking to stoke ision.    The research by ICM for the National Conversation, which polled 700 people in Scotland also found Scots were more positive about integration with 69% agreeing \u0026ldquoit is better when migrants commit to stay in Britain, put down roots and integrate, compared to 61% UK-wide.  And just 31% in Scotland agree that \u0026ldquoit is better when migrants come here to work for a few years without putting down roots and then  home\" against 39% UK-wide.  But the report also uncovered some dissenting voices in citizens\u0027 panels held across Scotland.  In four of the five citizens\u0026rsquo panels in Aberdeen, Dumfries, Edinburgh and Paisley \u0026ndash some participants felt that international students were taking the place of Scottish students.  \"This view was more surprising, given that these four citizens\u0026rsquo panels held many positive views about other forms of migration,\" said the report.  Students who live in Scotland or are from EU countries do not have to pay tuition fees in Scottish universities.    \"This seems to have fuelled a belief that Scotland\u0026rsquos universities prioritise international students from outside the EU over Scottish students for financial reasons,\" said the report.  \"However, our nationally representative ICM survey did not indicate any statistically signicant dference in the desire to reduce the number of international students in Scotland  compared with all of the UK .\"  And some over two out of three Scots were happy for the numbers of international students to be increased or remain at the same level.  The Home Office said: \"Our immigration system is designed to work for the whole of the UK. We have no current plans to introduce a devolved immigration system.  \"Scotland, as well as other devolved governments, have dferent ways available to encourage more iniduals and families to move to their part of the UK.  National Conversation on Immigration researchers held over 130 meetings in 60 locations across every nation and region of the UK, with citizens\u0026rsquo panels, recruited to be representative of the local population, in each place alongside meetings with local government, businesses, faith and civil society groups.  In Scotland, panels were held in Aberdeen, Dumfries, Edinburgh, Lerwick and Paisley.  Nationally representative research by ICM polled 3,667 people across the UK and an open online survey was completed by nearly 10,000 people.  Other Scottish findings  \u0026bull 62% agree that migrant workers support the British economy by doing jobs British people don\u0026rsquot want to do  \u0026bull 51% agree that public services are under strain because of immigration  \u0026bull 64% agree that migrants bring valuable skills for our economy and public services like the NHS  \u0026bull 51% agree that migrants are willing to work for less money so put jobs at risk and lower wages  \u0026bull 80% think the number of high-skilled migrants from the EU should remain the same or increase while 11% say they should be reduced.  \u0026bull 47% would like the number of low-skilled workers from the EU to be reduced while 34% think they should stay the same and 9% would like more.  \u0026bull 63% agree that the public should be consulted more on important national issues, like immigration.  Analysis:\u0026nbspScottish public are balancers  by Jill Rutter, Director of Strategy for British Future and co-author of the National Conversation on Immigration final report.    Immigration was one of the biggest issues of the EU referendum, but the public have not had a chance to say what should happen next.  The National Conversation on Immigration, jointly conducted by British Future and Hope not hate, is the largest ever public consultation on immigration.  Holding sixty citizens\u0026rsquo panels across the UK, including five in Scotland and a mixed English-Scottish panel in Berwick, it was a chance to hear the public\u0026rsquos voice.  These real-world conversations were constructive and pragmatic, in sharp contrast\u0026nbspto the more polarised online debate. We heard dferent views across Scotland: in Paisley, local faith and political leadership had shaped a public discourse that was more sympathetic to refugees and migrants than in similar places south of the border.  In Aberdeen, awareness of migration\u0026rsquos contribution to the oil industry was mixed with concerns about pressures on school places and housing. The Berwick citizens\u0026rsquo panel showed that views on migration can be toughest in places of low ersity and least contact.  Scotland has a distinctly more positive national immigration discourse. The Scottish public are balancers, seeing the gains of migration for the NHS and economy and wanting practical plans to manage the pressures too.  Asked to rate the overall impact of immigration on a 1-10 scale, the most common Scottish response is six out of ten, with a modest dference between the Scottish  and UK-wide  averages.  Views about whether Scotland should have more control over immigration policy often ided along independence referendum lines. There was more support in Paisley, while citizens in the Shetlands were firmly opposed.  But the sense that Westminster is distant and unlikely to consider Scotland\u0026rsquos needs transcends the independence question: a pro-Union panel in Edinburgh felt the City of London would dominate in decisions about future policy.  So 64% of Scots support devolving immigration powers, according to the survey that formed part of the National Conversation.    While political, business and civic society stakeholders saw a clear demographic need for immigration in Scotland, it was striking how the public were barely aware of the debate about future population needs. Scotland\u0026rsquos immigration \u0026lsquobalancers\u0026rsquo will be ready to hear that case, but a sustained national conversation on Scotland\u0026rsquos demographics will be needed for elite debate to be converted into a public one."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/1934845.jpg?type=article-full","title":"students-backlash-over-call-to-make-scots-pay-for-university-education","story":"  A university principle, speaking on condition of anonymity, said \u0026ldquoit is time to look at a gradual increase in tuition fees for Scottish students - or at least consider it, as the current funding model is \u0026ldquounsustainable.  But Liam McCabe, the president of the National Union of Students in Scotland,\u0026nbsp said there should be more not less support for Scotland\u0026rsquos students, so that they are not burdened with debt.  Mr McCabe said:\u0026ldquoNUS Scotland has and always will assert that education is a right, not a privilege. It should be ability that determines how far students go in education, not the depth of their pockets - and it\u0026rsquos right that the Scottish Government remains committed to free tuition.    \u0026ldquoUniversity bosses would do well to join NUS in making the case for increased government investment in Scotland\u0026rsquos students, especially those from the poorest backgrounds, rather than burdening them with thousands of pounds of new debt.  Scottish students get free university tuition in Scotland, as do students from other EU countries, but those from England, Wales and Northern Ireland have to pay to study there.  In February, the Scottish government extended the guarantee of free tuition for EU students to those starting in the 2019 to 2020 academic year.  Eligible students will have their fees met for the duration of their studies, even after the UK leaves the EU.  In England the fees cost up to \u0026pound9,250 per year, making it the most expensive place to study in Europe.  Now academics have publicly stated that Scottish society should be open to debating university funding.  Elizabeth Smith, the Scottish Conservative education spokeswoman, said: \u0026ldquoI am not surprised by these calls, particularly at a time when there are many issues about the SNP\u0026rsquos \u0026lsquocapped places\u0026rsquo policy.  \u0026ldquoWe are seeing increasing numbers of well qualied, domiciled Scots not being able to get into Scottish universities of their choice even when places on the relevant courses are still available.  That cannot be right.  \u0026ldquoIf Scotland\u0026rsquos universities are to maintain their competitive advantage at the same time as enhancing academic standards and widening access, they require additional levels of income.    However, Colin McAllister, a special adviser to Nicola Sturgeon, said the Scottish Government was told that free tuition was \u0026ldquounsustainable when they last had the debate ten years ago.  \u0026ldquoDespite UK austerity and a recession we sustained it and Scottish universities remain world class, he said.  \u0026ldquoHow will pro-fee voices explain that away I wonder?  Peter Mathieson, the principal of Edinburgh University, said fees might have deterred him from attending university in his youth but acknowledged high-quality tuition is \u0026ldquoexpensive.  \u0026ldquoWhether it is paid for by tuition fees, governments or loans, that is a debate we can have in society.  Mathieson said he did not want the fear of debt to deter students from higher education.  However, he said: \u0026ldquoThe idea that we\u0026rsquove got to make sure higher education is attainable - for me that doesn\u0026rsquot immediately translate into an ideological argument over tuition fees.  He added: \u0026ldquoWhen I was a school leaver my ability to tolerate debt was very limited, the reality for a lot of school leavers now is that  they are going to go to university they need to be able to tolerate debt. That\u0026rsquos an issue we can\u0026rsquot hide from.  Jim McDonald, principal of Strathclyde University, said: \u0026ldquoIn order to attract and retain the best academic talent and best students from home and abroad, we need to make sure that higher education is properly funded.    Professor Sir Anton Muscatelli, the principal of Glasgow University, said \u0026ldquosociety will periodically go through this debate about free tuition, but warned the majority of Scots are unlikely to back a change in policy.  \u0026ldquoLet\u0026rsquos not kid ourselves, you see the debate in England - fees were introduced and now people are saying perhaps some of this should be publicly funded, he said.  Professor Muscatelli insisted Scottish universities are in \u0026ldquogood company with leading European countries in giving free tuition to home students.  \u0026ldquoOur sector is highly competitive given the substantial investment from the Scottish Government and leverages additional economic benefits for Scotland, he said, adding that an important thing for the sector is \u0026ldquosustainability of funding\".  John Swinney, Deputy First Minister and Education Secretary, said he \u0026ldquolooked at tuition fees through the lens of values.  \u0026ldquoThe values I associate with education is that society should benefit from collective investment in the educational development of our population - that is the moral purpose of education, he said.  \u0026ldquoWhat comes with that is a commitment to make sure that universities are properly and effectively funded, and that is the very firm commitment we have given to our institutions.  He rejected claims that that the SNP has \u0026lsquocapped places\u0026rsquo for Scottish student numbers \u0026mdash a policy which is said to have limited access to university for poorer students.    \"What is important is that we make sure there are no barriers in the way of young people from a range of backgrounds gaining access to university education, he said. \u0026ldquoWe are absolutely committed to the policy of no tuition fees approach to university for Scottish students and that will remain the commitment of the SNP Government.\""},{"url":null,"title":"snps-brendan-ohara-calls-on-chancellor-to-continue-duty-freeze-on-scotch-whisky","story":"  Nationalist MP Brendan O\u0026rsquoHara, who chairs Westminster\u0026rsquos all-party parliamentary group on scotch whisky, echoed industry concerns, saying it was vital that businesses and sectors were protected and not burdened with a counterproductive and unnecessary tax hike.  He said: \u0026ldquoScotch whisky is one of Scotland\u0026rsquos major assets and a global success story. At a time of continued Brexit uncertainty and instability, we cannot risk or undermine our whisky industry by increasing the tax liability on our producers who are already contributing so much.  \u0026ldquoDespite the Treasury predicting lost revenues of \u0026pound225 million from the November duty freeze, they actually rose by \u0026pound113m. By contrast, when the Treasury increased revenues the previous March by 3.9per cent, revenues dropped by 7.2 per cent. Scotch whisky cannot be forced to bankroll the UK\u0026rsquos failing economic strategy, declared the Argyll and Bute MP.  \u0026ldquoFor too long the Treasury has viewed the industry as a \u0026lsquocash cow\u0026rsquo, as evidenced by last year\u0026rsquos counterproductive duty hike. That approach must come to an end and I call on the Chancellor to rule out unnecessary tax hikes and instead take heed of the economic reality and retain the duty freeze on scotch whisky to ensure that this vital Scottish industry continues to grow, he added.  The SNP stressed that scotch whisky was responsible for approximately a fth of UK food and drink exports and recently reported record numbers of visitors to distilleries and tourist centres. The industry supported more than 40,000 jobs directly and through its supply chain, it noted.  The Scotch Whisky Association \u0026ndash the sector\u0026rsquos trade body \u0026ndash has already said that a continued freeze would \u0026ldquonot only deliver greater revenue for the Treasury but also help to support an industry that has invested more than \u0026pound500m in capital projects over the last five years.  The Budget date is not yet known and it is thought Mr Hammond is waiting to name a date until there is clarity over the success or otherwise of the Brexit talks. This means that the economic statement might not come until the end of November or the beginning of December."},{"url":null,"title":"lib-dems-urge-corbyn-and-leonard-to-follow-khan-and-back-peoples-vote","story":"  But the conversion of the London Mayor to supporting a second referendum drew criticism from Michael Gove, the Environment Secretary, who claimed holding such a vote would throw the whole Brexit process into \u0026ldquochaos.

As the town continued to expand so, too, did the print industry, alongside the trade in American tobacco and cotton, and Caribbean sugar.  The city had its first newspaper in late 1715, when the Glasgow Courant opened for business. In 1783 came the weekly Glasgow Advertiser, which in 1805 changed its name to the Glasgow Herald.  Now all of the city\u0026rsquos newspaper, book and commercial printing history has been assembled in the Glasgow Print Trail, a booklet and -  there is sufficient interest - a guided, physical trail for visitors to follow.  Maps in the booklet show the geographical spread of printing businesses. Many were clustered in the city centre. Among them were the Foulis Press, 18th century publishers to Glasgow University, in Shuttle Street, and Bell \u0026amp Bain, book and periodical publishers, which was established in Glasgow Cross in 1831 and would later spend a century in Mitchell Street.  But many others were to be found outwith the city centre, including John Cossar \u0026amp Co, in Govan.  Edinburgh\u0026rsquos printing industry pre-dates Glasgow\u0026rsquos by at least a century. A Print Trail has already been published, covering the capital.  The booklet is the work of the Scottish Printing Archival Trust, with funding from the Watson Foundation, which was established by John Watson OBE, who for more than half-a-century ran the well-known printers, John Watson and Company.  \u0026ldquoI would say that during the era of Glasgow being the Second City of the Empire, printing was the third or fourth largest industry in the city in terms of numbers employed, he said. \u0026ldquoIt was a huge employer in those days. You had McCorquodale\u0026rsquos, which opened a print works here in the 1870s, and Robert MacLehose, who was appointed printers to the university in 1872.  \u0026ldquoThere was such a number of printers. There were many small family businesses, certainly, but you had the big boys as well.  Among the newspapers represented on the Glasgow Trail are the Glasgow Herald and Evening Times, the Daily Mail, and the Daily Record.  Mr Watson describes the booklet as a labour of love.  \u0026ldquoHaving spent my entire working le in printing I wanted to make sure that the rich history of printing in Glasgow was not forgotten. It is a story undoubtedly worth telling, he said.  \u0026ldquoMost people involved with the printing industry would generally agree that there have been more fundamental changes in the last 50 years than in the preceding centuries since Johannes Gutenberg invented printing from movable type back in 1450.  \u0026ldquoThe pace of change has been unrelenting, and with technology and new processes, the ways of communicating the printed word have changed out of all recognition. Sadly the industry has, too, and many of the companies mentioned in the booklet have fallen by the wayside.  \u0026ldquoNowadays there are so many ways of viewing or receiving information rather than from books or newspapers.  He added: \u0026ldquoFor me, the print trail is a walk down memory lane and an attempt to ensure the history of printing is not lost as the years roll by. It really was crucial to the commercial success of Glasgow and I don\u0026rsquot want that strong heritage lost in the mists of time.  \u0026ldquoIt is worth remembering that Glasgow boasted the largest book printers in the world with William Collins \u0026amp Son printing many bestsellers, including the Bible in no fewer than 42 languages. It is well known in the printing industry that every second person one who lived in Bishopbriggs worked for Collins.  Mr Watson added: \u0026ldquoThe idea is that,  there is enough interest in the Glasgow trail, we will run a guided tour, probably starting in Buchanan Street, where the Glasgow Herald was based for many decades until 1980.  Fittingly, the print-trail booklet was printed, free of charge, by Bell \u0026amp Bain, one of the oldest surviving printers in the UK, which is now based in Thornliebank.  * The booklet, researched by archivist Helen Williams, is available via www.scottishprintarchive.org for \u0026pound5."},{"url":null,"title":"Marianne Taylor  Times are grim enough    let s not scrap free university tuition","story":"  There are bound to be feelings of excitement and trepidation for students and their parents as the academic semester begins, with the high cost of studying in 2018 doubtless contributing to worries for both parties.  Most families have to think hard about how to meet immediate expenses, while weighing up the long-term consequences of paying back loans when the average Scots student finishes their degree \u0026pound12k in debt.  Thankfully, however, indeed crucially, they are spared the distress of having to factor in the \u0026pound9,000 a year fees students in England have to pay, thus landing them with an eye-watering average loan of \u0026pound32k.  The Scottish Government has always robustly resisted calls to introduce a similar scheme, despite opponents arguing the position is hypocritical, since further education places have been cut to fund the policy. Critics also say it puts Scots universities at a disadvantage in terms of funding, restricts their ability to invest and forces a cap on student numbers.  And, as front page of the Herald on Sunday highlighted yesterday, it seems a number of senior Scots academics agree with this view.  The Principal of one university, who did not wish to be named, decried \u0026ldquolow investment in higher education from the Scottish Government for a decade and called for a gradual increase in fees for Scots students. They also lamented the \u0026ldquolack of a safe space to even explore the pros and cons of such a move.  Another executive team member at a top institution anonymously described free higher education as a \u0026ldquoprop for the middle classes and called for a national debate on how we fund our universities.

But their reluctance to be open about their identity suggests an acute awareness of just how unpopular any change in the status quo would be.  And little wonder since a free university education is not only a principle that many Scots hold dear, but one of last crumbs of comfort Scottish families can rely on in these grim and uncertain times.  Normally I\u0026rsquom all in favour of national conversations, especially about the things that really matter. But in this case, I find myself drawn to the opposite response: now is definitely NOT the time to be having this particular debate.  At a time when many of us are already losing sleep over the potentially horrying economic ramications of Brexit, having suffered years of pitul wage growth and the chipping away of conditions that followed the financial crash, do parents really deserve the worry of an additional \u0026pound36k in fees should their children be bright enough to be offered a place at university? Young people, too, have enough on their plates dealing with the already costly chaos passed down by their parents\u0026rsquo and grandparents\u0026rsquo generations.  And make no mistake, before long \u0026pound9k a year  would be the reality. Those in favour of fees talk of a very gradual introduction at a low level, but as English students learned so brutally, such promises are easily thrown out with the bathwater alongside the principle of free education.  The fee brigade in Scotland  often talk of the continuing and shameful lack of young people from deprived backgrounds going on to university, and how free higher education subsidises the middle classes.  But it\u0026rsquos impossible to see how introducing \u0026pound9k a year fees will help these young people, especially when you look again to the experience of English students: despite a massive hike in course fees over a short period, in 2016 maintenance grants for the poorest were replaced with, yes, you guessed it, loans. I speak from experience as the first person in my family to go to university and the recipient of a full grant . I may still have decided to study had fees been in place, but I doubt I would have felt free to chose the academic path I did, one that enabled me to enjoy education for its own sake but also led me to the career I love.  I am very grateful for the opportunity I was given what right have I to tell others they should not have the same? I don\u0026rsquot have kids, but I\u0026rsquom more than happy for my taxes to be used for other people\u0026rsquos to receive the same free education I benefitted from.  After all, free university education is not a subsidy but rather a societal choice that represents an investment in young people to be paid back over the long term in many ways, not just economically, but intellectually and socially, too. The whole of society benefits, as the likes of Germany, France and Denmark agrees, even  the rest of the UK doesn\u0026rsquot.  So, no, let\u0026rsquos not have this debate right now.

In further extracts from her interview, Mrs May was pushed on whether or not she had ruled out giving a special immigration arrangement for EU citizens and replied: \"What we will be doing is putting forward a set of rules for people from the European Union and people from outside the European Union.\"  She went on: \"Parliament will vote for a deal because people will see the importance of a deal that maintains a good trading relationship with the EU but also maintains good co-operation in other areas but gives us the freedom to take the benefits and opportunities of Brexit.\"  The PM cast doubt on whether or not the EU would offer a better deal  MPs were to reject her final proposal, adding: \"I believe we\u0027ll get a good deal we\u0027ll bring that back from the EU negotiations, put that to Parliament.  \u0026ldquoThe alternative to that will be not having a deal because a I don\u0027t think the negotiations will have that deal, and b we\u0027re leaving on March 29 2019.\"  But Sir Nick Clegg, the former Deputy PM, accused Mrs May of presenting Britain with a \"con trick\" choice on Brexit.  He explained: \"It is a deep disservice to our democratic traditions to have a Prime Minister now saying: \u0027You\u0027ve got no choices left, it\u0027s my fudge or the abyss\u0027 that is not true. We always have more choices  only we are prepared to take them.  \"Of all the con tricks we have been subject to in this whole sorry Brexit saga - from the lies in the referendum to the so-called virtues of what is nothing more than an inelegant fudge in Chequers - the worst is now to come, declared the former Liberal Democrat leader, who will be back in the spotlight today as he addresses a fringe event at the party\u0026rsquos annual conference in Brighton.  Mr Clegg said: \"We\u0027re now going to be told: \u0027It\u0027s my way or no way\u0027 it\u0027s either the Chequers fudge or a sort of cataclysmic clf-edge.  \"The idea that the only thing this country should accept is a fudge or the abyss is not only an insult to the intelligence of British voters but it\u0027s simply not true.\"  Sir Nick insisted that his experience as an MEP taught him that Britain would be given more time by the EU to reflect on what it wanted to happen ahead of the slated withdrawal date of next March.  \u0026ldquoThe clock is ticking but the clock can definitely be changed, he declared. \u0026ldquoOne thing that is very elastic in Brussels is time. They\u0027ve got a name for it. It\u0027s called \u0027stop the clock\u0027 and it is provided for in the EU treaties.\"  The former DPM said the UK could tell Brussels: \"\u0026rsquoI\u0027m sorry, we\u0027ve got a bit stuck here, we need more time to straighten ourselves out and decide what we want to do next.\u0026rsquo\"  He called for a pause in the withdrawal process so that the UK could hold a \"People\u0027s Vote\" on Brexit.  Sir Nick was scathing about the current Brexit situation, saying: \"It\u0027s the equivalent of leaving your home, locking your front door, chucking your key away and having absolutely no idea where you are going next.\"  The former party leader, who lost his Sheffield seat at the 2017 General Election, said he had been holding talks with European leaders on the Brexit situation to ensure the UK had more choices on what to do about its relationship with the EU.  In her BBC interview broadcast tonight, Mrs May also said she gets \u0026ldquoirritated by the debate about her leadership and criticised Boris Johnson\u0026rsquos controversial \u0026ldquosuicide vest comment.  Britain is heading full throttle for a total write-off of Brexit  it continues with Theresa May\u0027s disastrous plans for the Irish border, Boris Johnson has claimed.  The former Foreign Secretary launched another broadside against the PM\u0026rsquos Chequers Plan, saying the Irish border backstop deadlock was being used to force the UK into becoming a vassal state and that the talks were on course to end in a \"spectacular political car crash\".  Mr Johnson argued that the EU\u0026rsquos fall-back position for the Irish border would mean Northern Ireland being \"annexed\" by Brussels.  Alternative plans set out by Mrs May would \"effectively\" keep Britain in the bloc, he declared.  However, the PM has said the counter-proposal to her Chequers plan is \"still a hard border\" and hers is the only way that does not \"carve up the United Kingdom\".  His comments came as reports suggested the EU was preparing to accept the use of technology to avoid the need for new border infrastructure.  Mr Johnson has backed proposals by the pro-Brexit European Research Group that physical checks can be done away from the border, without keeping the UK or Northern Ireland tied to EU customs rules.  Writing in The Daily , he said: \"If the Brexit negotiations continue on this path they will end, I am afraid, in a spectacular political car crash.  \"If we are to get out of this mess and get the great British motor back on track, then we need to understand the Irish backstop and how it is being used to coerce the UK into becoming a vassal state of Brussels.  The former Cabinet minister claimed the EU\u0027s backstop would leave a border down the Irish sea while the UK\u0027s proposal left it \"volunteering\" to \"remain effectively in the customs union and large parts of the single market until Brussels says otherwise\".  Both versions of the backstop were \u0026ldquodisastrous,\" argued Mr Johnson. \"One threatens the Union the other version - and its close cousin, Chequers - keep us effectively in the EU, as humiliated rules-takers.  \"We need to challenge the assumptions of both these Irish backstops, or we are heading full throttle for the ditch with a total write-off of Brexit.  \"We are straining at the gnat of the Irish border problem - in fact we haven\u0027t even tried to chew the gnat - and we are swallowing the camel of EU membership in all but name,\" he added."},{"url":null,"title":"birthday celebration for charity knitter iris","story":"        A Rothienorman woman who knits items for charity is preparing to celebrate her 98th birthday.

A language that official bodies such as the UNESCO insist has been dead since the 1800\u0026rsquos.\u0026ldquoIt wouldn\u0026rsquot be the first time UNESCO has prematurely pronounced a language as dead. Back in 2009 UNESCO declared Manx extinct despite there being over 1500 speakers of Manx.\u0026ldquoUNESCO was forced to change its classication of Manx from \u0026ldquoExtinct to \u0026lsquoEndangered\u0026rsquo after a group of school children wrote to them in Manx asking what language they were writing in  Manx didn\u0026rsquot exist.\u0026ldquoThe more people I talked to the more I came to find that Norn isn\u0026rsquot dead, it has just become lost in our English.

Copies of the series have sold as far away as America and Sweden.\u0026ldquoIt was just after the publication of Norn Min buk two that I received an email from the University of Bari in Italy as their Minority Languages department was interested in Norn.\u0026ldquoThey asked  they could use the Norn Min series to create an Italian-Norn phrasebook.

Westminster itself would see its total number of MPs cut from 650 to 600.One ramication includes the expansion of the Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross seat, which has Mr Stone of the Liberal Democrats as its sitting MP, to include a part of Lochaber.Mr Stone said: \u0026ldquoThese changes would make our constituency a monster in terms of size.\u0026ldquoPeople have a right of access to their local MP but that representative can only do so much and only drive so many miles to serve the electorate.\u0026ldquoThe journey from Evanton in the south-east to John O\u0026rsquoGroats is 103 miles. It takes two hours and 49 minutes to drive the 115 miles from Lochinver in the south-west to Wick in the north-east.\u0026ldquoMy constituency covers 3675 square miles. We could fit all 73 London constituencies in my constituency, and have room left over around the sides.\u0026ldquoThe proposed changes are simply an example of the Boundary Commission running mad and it undermines democracy.\u0026ldquoWith the best will in the world, it is very hard to cover the communities within my constituency, even when driving hither and thither.\u0026ldquoThe point is that constituencies and communities have a right of access to their elected member.\u0026ldquoDespite doing what I hope is my best,  there is a shortfall in what I can do in terms of reaching out, why would I not suggest that there is a slight democratic deficit?\u0026ldquoWhen an idea is stark raving bonkers, like this one, it just has to be said loud and clear.\u0026ldquoI will, of course, contest the seat at the next election. I may not hold the seat, as I may be voted out, but whoever represents the seat will have a very dficult time representing those good people  the constituency gets any bigger.SNP MSP Gail Ross, who holds the Holyrood seat of Caithness, Sutherland and Ross, stated that the proposed changes were unacceptable even though they could in theory help her party to win Mr Stone\u0026rsquos seat.\u0026ldquoThat will be up to the electorate but I would rather we win a seat by having a good candidate and policies that appeal to voters than because the seat has been given extra territory, she said.\u0026ldquoI share Jamie\u0026rsquos concerns as my own ward for Holyrood is a massive challenge for me to get around it.\u0026ldquoDespite all the technology in place, such as Skype and WhatsApp, you need to visit all the parts of your constituency to see what is going on and to properly speak with constituents face to face.\u0026ldquoI have colleagues who hold seats in urban areas who are shocked by the amount of travelling I have to do to meet and listen to constituents.\u0026ldquoWe need more representation and smaller wards so that the electorate can be properly served by their MP and MSP.\u0026ldquoAs for the proposed name change of the Westminster seat to \u0026lsquoHighland North\u0026rsquo, that will see Caithness taken off the political map.\u0026ldquoIt will also be name that\u0026rsquos misleading as to how big the constituency is.

Local resident and self-professed \u0026ldquoTrinkie lover Bryan Newlands welcomed the group\u0026rsquos formation, underlining that the pool harboured a lot of memories. \u0026ldquoI used to go there a lot... Even though I lived on the other side of town, every summer myself and a friend would go \u0026ndash even when it was raining, he said. \u0026ldquoIt was a great place as the town didn\u0026rsquot have an indoor swimming pool until 1994. Many people learned to swim at the Trinkie.While a slideshow showed images of how the pool used to look and how much Wickers got from it, other more contemporary images show a dilapidated ruin \u0026ndash a far cry from the hustle, bustle and smiles of yesteryear.The new group was formed with a mission to \u0026ldquobring the pool back to le and a number of office-bearers were proposed and elected.James Bremner was elected chairman with other roles going to William Macdonald , Catherine Patterson  and Garance Warburton .Seven committee members were also elected: Fiona Bremner, Trudi Mcalpine, Davina Lyall, Fiona McPhee, Leslie Grant, Roddy Mackay and Councillor Willie Mackay.Ms Patterson underlined that it was going to be no easy fix as \u0026ldquothere are holes in the wall at the deep end, which also has cracks that go right down to the ground.\u0026ldquoThe previous group... had the holes patched up, but they kept reappearing, she said. \u0026ldquoThe wall itself is also crumbling and the bridge that ides the deep and shallow ends has had its fixtures corroded. Also the south access road that leads the public to the pool is in poor nick.She stressed that volunteers to patch things up and general goodwill is always welcome, \u0026ldquobut [often] their help only scratches the surface of what needs to be done.She added: \u0026ldquoMajor investment is needed along with a report from a structural engineer to see how much damage there is, what can and cannot be done, and to get an estimate of how much the restoration will cost.Mr Newlands \u0026ndash committee member Ms Lyall\u0026rsquos son \u0026ndash stressed that the Trinkie added tremendous character to Wick.\u0026ldquoPut it this way, with the summer we\u0026rsquove had, that pool would have been full had it been in use, he said.Other memories came from Wick Society chairman Iain Leith. \u0026ldquoGoing there was a popular pastime in its day with adults and kids from all over Pulteneytown flocking to it, he said.\u0026ldquoRestoring it could be a big boost to the town\u0026rsquos economy by making it a tourist attraction as well as giving back the town a much-loved landmark.Ms Patterson emphasised that the Trinkie had the potential to be an asset to both locals and tourists.\u0026ldquoBut we need investment because  nothing gets done the pool is on its way out.Monday 17 Sep 2018 3:39 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117364.jpg","title":"New service gives job hunters a Fair Start","story":"\u0026nbspScottish Government ViewpointFAIR Start Scotland is the country\u0027s new devolved employment support service.It is focused on supporting unemployed people who have challenges in accessing the labour market for whom work is a realistic prospect.Launched in April, earlier this year, it is an example of one of the first uses of newly devolved powers under the 2016 Scotland Act.The service will run until 2023 and aims to provide tailored, flexible and person-centred support to at least 38,000 people across Scotland who want help to find work, and stay in work.Fair Start Scotland is distinctive in that participation is purely voluntary.This means that people have everything to gain and nothing to lose \u0026ndash choosing to participate will not affect existing benefits or be driven by fear of benefit sanctions.The service is delivered locally, meaning that no participants are left without the support they need.Delivery is over nine geographic areas including the Highlands and reflects local area economies, meeting the needs of employers, disabled people and those at risk of long-term unemployment.Jamie Hepburn, Minister for Business, Fair Work and Skills, said: \"What\u0027s crucial about Fair Start Scotland is that it treats people with fairness, dignity and respect and that it is focused on the needs of the inidual.\"We are dedicated to delivering a high quality employment support service that will lead to real and sustained job outcomes and help people to achieve their full potential.\"As well as meeting the needs of unemployed people, Fair Start Scotland also seeks to help businesses find the skilled and committed employees they need to thrive.\"One of the many now benefitting is Highlander Alan Cairns .He has not worked for over a year and his biggest barriers to work have been low confidence and computer skills but now he has secured 16 hours of work per week.Alan started on the Fair Start Scotland service in the middle of May and has been attending the service for the past 12 weeks.

Like that earlier work, The Katanes Saga is told in an unpretentious, engaging, sometimes blokey style. From the drunken arguments to the devious plots to the mutilations and killings, Cassells tells it like it is.\u0026ldquoThe Raven Banner was basically a guide to Norse Caithness with a little bit about each area and what I thought were the main things that happened in Norse times, he explains. \u0026ldquoThe Katanes Saga is far more in-depth.\u0026ldquoThey were people like you and me. They had the same faults. You could meet three Vikings in the pub any night.\u0026ldquoOne word I would use to describe the Norse is pragmatic. They were really pragmatic people. If that\u0026rsquos the way it works, that\u0026rsquos the way it works \u0026ndash  it doesn\u0026rsquot, I\u0026rsquoll do it my way.\u0026ldquoI do mention that of all the Norse earls of Orkney only a handful actually died in their beds. Most suffered violent deaths. One was killed with contact poison from his own auntie and mother on a shirt.Cassells  is a retired Royal Mail manager who previously worked as a lighthouse keeper on Muckle Flugga and Stroma. Those experiences inspired two other books, No More Paraffin-Oilers and A Light Walk.The Katanes Saga sees him ing to a theme that first sparked his interest at an early age. Born in Barrow, he moved to Thurso in late 1950s when his father came to work at the Admiralty test establishment.\u0026ldquoI always liked Greek and Roman mythology and I started reading about Norse mythology as well, he recalls. \u0026ldquoAs a young boy I lived in Sweyn Road in Thurso and I wondered who Sweyn was. A pal of mine said, \u0026lsquoAch, that\u0026rsquoll be Sweyn the pirate.\u0026rsquo So for about a year I had this happy vision of a Pugwash-type character that the street was named after. I then discovered Sweyn Aslearson.Swyen , iously described \u0026ldquothe last of the Vikings and \u0026ldquothe greatest troublemaker in the westernlands, had an estate at Duncansby and was renowned for raiding, plundering and pillaging. One of the many who suffered at his hands was Frakokk, who had featured in the poisoned-shirt incident: she was burned to death in her farmhouse at Helmsdale, along with other members of her faction, in a revenge attack led by Swyen.It\u0026rsquos an example of the way in which many of the strands are intertwined, as Cassells points out.\u0026ldquoI read the sagas and I started taking a look at place names, he says. \u0026ldquoFor a long time I lived at Scrabster \u0026ndash Skarabolstadr, the \u0026lsquohomestead of the sea-mews\u0026rsquo.\u0026ldquoAnd the stories were interesting to read. They were intriguing.\u0026ldquoYou try and unravel it and it\u0026rsquos just more or less two families feuding all the way through it. That goes right to the very last act of the local earl being kned in a beer cellar in Thurso.One of the most shocking events is the burning to death of Bishop Adam by a mob in Halkirk in a dispute over a butter tax.\u0026ldquoHe got a bit greedy, Cassells says. \u0026ldquoThey complained to the earl at the time who more or less said, \u0026lsquoDamn the bishop, you can burn him as you please,\u0026rsquo so they took him at his word.\u0026ldquoBishops crop up a couple of times. There was lot of enmity between the local Norse earldom and the Scottish king over bishops. A bishop got his eyes put out in Scrabster.\u0026ldquoAfter the bishop was murdered at Halkirk, the Scottish king came up here and carried out what was, for want of a better description, pure genocide of the people from the Halkirk area. I believe they were all massacred round about where the Pennyland estate is now in Thurso. Hundreds of people were killed there.\u0026ldquoIn those days you just didn\u0026rsquot go burning bishops \u0026ndash they\u0026rsquore going to come down heavy on you.\u0026ldquoRavenshill Road used to be known as the Gallows Hill, before the atomic houses were built there, so that has been a place for judicial executions for quite a long time.From the machinations of the \u0026ldquofemme fatale Ragnhild at Murkle to the murder of Earl Rognvald at Forsie to the Battle of Clairdon Hill outside Thurso, the power struggles and manoeuvrings come thick and fast. It\u0026rsquos a rapid-fire history lesson, but more than anything Cassells simply wants people to enjoy the stories.\u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a thing I never learned in school here. It was never mentioned, he says. \u0026ldquoThis is our own local history, and I just hope people think it\u0026rsquos a good read.The Katanes Saga  is self-published and is on sale in Caithness Horizons, newsagents in Thurso, and Wick Heritage Museum.Monday 17 Sep 2018 3:39 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"Open evening in Thurso for potential Childrens Panel members","story":"AN open evening is taking place next week with the aim of attracting volunteers for the Children\u0026rsquos Panel in Caithness.Tuesday\u0026rsquos event in Thurso will allow members of the public to find out how they can play a part in the children\u0026rsquos hearings system \u0026ndash helping others and giving something back to the community in the process.Volunteers from all walks of le make le-changing decisions that create a dference in the lives of many, and this is very true for children, young people and families in Caithness and across Scotland within the children\u0026rsquos hearing system.It relies on the voluntary involvement of around 2500 people who are willing and able to give their time and commitment to serve as Children\u0026rsquos Panel members.A number of agencies work together with the system to deliver protection, care and support to families, children and young people.

He was a third-year medical student who played rugby with the cycling trio and was also a talented musician. He had also been suffering from depression.The idea of cycling from John O\u0026rsquoGroats to Land\u0026rsquos End came to the trio after they had learned that Marcus had previously done the y cycle, not once but twice.Fenn, a final-year maths student from Sheffield, said that Marcus\u0026rsquos sudden death was a huge shock to us all at the rugby club,and for everyone that knew him.\u0026ldquoHearing the news that he had been suffering from depression was a surprise to all his friends and family, he said.\u0026ldquoIn light of this, Marcus\u0026rsquos family have set up a fund in his name \u0026ndash Marcus in Mind \u0026ndash to raise awareness and prevent this sort of tragedy happening to more young men.Giles, a marine and offshore engineering student from Bridgnorth, Shropshire, added: \u0026ldquoThe three of us felt compelled to do something to help raise awareness of depression and mental health.\u0026ldquoAfter learning at his funeral that Marcus had completed this very cycle ride twice, we knew it would be an appropriate challenge.\u0026ldquoWe are using the social media hashtag #ItsOkNotToBeOk and we\u0026rsquore hoping to remove some of the stigma and get blokes like us opening up about mental health.Given Marcus\u0026rsquos and the trio\u0026rsquos links with rugby, clubs around the UK have been aware of the mental health awareness drive that they\u0026rsquore undertaking,Alex, a marine engineering student from Porthlevan, Cornwall, said: \u0026ldquoWe have been in touch with rugby clubs up and down the country.

Without the support of the Youth Achievement Group I would never have had the confidence to apply for such an important opportunity.”Maureen Herdman  said: “We are delighted for Hope as this is a great opportunity for her to further advance her skills and confidence and represent young people on a national stage.

This has made her challenge to find a way to climb the sea stack all the more unique and has presented a series of challenges in the planning stages.She will take on the climb in aid of the Calvert Trust, which supports people with disabilities through outdoor adventure.Asked why she had picked the Old Man of Hoy, Michelle laughed: \u0026#8220Because it\u0026#8217s the biggest sea stack going. I\u0026#8217d had the idea that I wanted to climb a sea stack before I was injured. It hadn\u0026#8217t really crossed my mind that I would ever be able to climb the old man of Hoy because it is notoriously dficult. I thought one day I would get it done but then I fell and I thought it\u0026#8217d never happen.\u0026#8220A friend came to me during rehab and said I needed to start setting myself goals and challenges but all my interests were based around climbing, which I didn\u0026#8217t think I could do anymore. It felt like that was totally ruled out – how can you climb without legs?\u0026#8220But they sent me some links to some really inspirational paraplegics, who were during climbing but in an adaptive way. Ordinarilly, climbing with two legs is like puzzle solving where you pick a route and decide what will work for you and that\u0026#8217s what I used to love.\u0026#8220When climbing in an adaptive way, you don\u0026#8217t get any of that puzzle solving and when people first spoke to me about climbing in that way I thought it wasn\u0026#8217t really the same so I wouldn\u0026#8217t want to do it. For me it was never about getting to the top of something, it was about the journey and figuring stuff out.\u0026#8220Climbing something in an adaptive way uses a pulley system and you haul your weight up. I thought there was no puzzle to that \u0026#8211 how wrong I was. I\u0026#8217ve not even attempted this climb yet and it\u0026#8217s been the biggest puzzle in the world. Creating the equipment has been the biggest challenge and finding people who have the ideas to make the equipment, it\u0026#8217s a never-ending puzzle.\u0026#8221To donate or find out more about Michelle\u0026#8217s challenge visit the website www.routetothesky\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

While this may not achieve the same speeds as some other options, it may at least offer the benefit of a solution in the nearer future.“I welcome the fact that BT has agreed to investigate the practicalities of installing radio links and hope that this can play a part in helping deliver the improved broadband services that communities across Orkney desperately need to see.\u0026#8221\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Since then, the band has played at ious local venues supporting charities and community projects.On September 21, the BYOB charity dance from 7pm until 11pm will benefit the nearby Groam House Museum, an outstanding centre for Pictish and Celtic art.Tickets, which cost \u0026pound10 for adults and \u0026pound5 for children aged 16 and under \u0026ndash or \u0026pound25 for a family of four \u0026ndash may be bought in advance from Groam House Museum and Rosemarkie Spar shop or on the door on the night.The event is one of a series being organised by the volunteers of Groam House to raise funds for ongoing repairs and renewals following the rapid decline in Highland Council support.The unique display is focused on 15 carved Pictish stones which all originated in Rosemarkie, an important centre for early Christianity. The pride of the permanent display is the magnicent Rosemarkie cross slab, decorated with Pictish symbols and Christian crosses.Monday 17 Sep 2018 3:40 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

The findings from these will be fed into the on-going options investigation study, which is expected to report in the autumn of 2018 on ways to improve the junctions to help reduce the risk of accidents.\"Road safety is a priority for the Scottish Government and we understand the concerns of the community. We have undertaken to update stakeholders on progress and would like to take this opportunity to reassure the community that the A9 at Tain remains a trunk road safety priority.\"In 2015 Transport Scotland\u0026rsquos operating company for the region, Bear, carried out a number of works on the A9 at the Tain north junction, including new signing, extended central hatching and high friction surfacing on the local road approach to the A9.Have you been involved in an accident or near miss in the area?

The Milnfua Rt Raft crew took third place. The Mermaids may have been pipped at the post but made a splash all the same as fancy dress winners.The RNLI all-weather Trent Class leboat then vividly displayed the challenges crews face when undertaking a rescue with a vessel aground during exciting demonstrations.A craft village organised by Gloria Mackenzie was a treat for landlubbers with everything from pebble art to quilts and engraving on display.A pet show also proved a pull with a iety of prizes handed out.

The poll showed that 64 per cent of Scots back immigration powers being devolved to  Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.            Ten per cent of Scottish respondents think that the British Government has managed the immigration system competently and fairly.             The UK-wide trust figure was higher at 15 per cent. A consultation with almost 20,000 people across the country found just 17% trusted the government to tell the truth about the reality of immigration.Even fewer - 13% - trusted MPs to tell the truth on the issue.: Two-third of teenagers don’t want immigration to riseThe research was conducted by thinktank British Future, and anti-racism and anti-extremism charity Hope not Hate, through 130 meetings with communities in 60 locations around the UK.            They also gathered data through an online survey and opinion polling conducted by ICM Research.The report - the National Conversation on Immigration - was published ahead of the Migration Advisory Committee’s report on immigration on Tuesday.Its authors are now urging the government to use Brexit as an opportunity to rebuild trust in the immigration system.The report makes 40 recommendations for the future of immigration policy including greater resources for the Home Office to deliver its goals and a mandatory registration system and Canadian-style criminal vetting for future migration from the EU.            The authors all call for an annual “Migration Day” in parliament where ministers are held accountable for their performance against a three-year immigration strategy - replacing the net migration target.: Humza Yousaf brands immigration policy cruelThey also want the government to start engaging directly with the public through an official National Conversation on Immigration run by the publicly funded Migration Advisory Committee.A spokesman for British Future said participants were asked about the level of trust in the government to manage immigration.But he added distrust has been building for 15 years following previous governments’ failure to predict the large amount of migration from recent entrants to the EU such as Poland and Romania.            Despite the low levels of trust in the present government’s ability to manage immigration, it found the majority of those involved held a more balanced view on the issue than is reflected in the media.Dubbed “balancers”, these respondents felt immigration brings economic and cultural gains to the UK, but also worry about control, fairness and pressures on public services.The research found 65% of people thought migrants bring valuable skills for the economy and public services such as the NHS, while 59% believed ersity is a good thing for British culture.A further 61% of people believed it is better for migrants to commit to remaining in the UK and to integrate, rather than coming to work for a few years before ing to their country of origin.On the other hand, 52% of respondents said public services are under strain as a result of immigration, and a further 52% believed migrants are willing to work for less - putting jobs at risk and lowering wages.        \t            \t            \t©2018\u0026nbspJohnston Publishing Ltd..\u0026nbspCookie Settings\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4800841.1537167254!/image/image.jpg","title":"brian monteith cross border business can show benefits of the union","story":"Sorry, we\u0027re having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...        Scotland\u0026#8217s win-win with the UK goes beyond just economics Thank goodness for Robert Kilgour. By establishing Scottish Business UK, the serial entrepreneur has ensured that business leaders no longer feel intimidated by independence campaigners into keeping their counsel when the country\u0026#8217s economic future is at stake.                In the 2014 referendum, instances of Scottish-based businesses speaking out about what was in their interests to ensure success – and thus create jobs and spread prosperity – were noticeably few. Kilgour often found himself a lonely figure as the only businessman willing to openly challenge the economics of the Scottish Government’s White Paper, or debate on television and radio when he knew many that privately agreed with him.             The reasons for this were many some business organisations, be they national or representing inidual sectors, felt unable to take a position for or against breaking up the UK, so chose to say nothing. Some inidual businesses felt they might become targeted for boycotts or subject to negative publicity that would lose them customers and that, commercially, saying nothing made more sense. Some businesses relied on government contracts and had no wish to put themselves at risk.             After the referendum delivered its resounding defeat of independence, Robert Kilgour resolved that never again should the country’s businesses be put in such a marginal position. He decided there had to be a vehicle for business leaders with something to say, that had some useful insight to share with their employees, their customers and the wider society that benefits from the tax revenues their enterprises generate. Scottish Business UK was soon established and a board of Scots successful in their respective fields pulled together. Now Scottish Business UK is to publish tomorrow, on the fourth anniversary of the referendum that rejected independence, its first paper on why Scotland remaining in the UK is good for business. Entitled Win-Win, it argues Scotland profits in two ways, firstly through gaining signicant economic benefits that could not be improved upon but would be hugely diminished were Scotland to be outside the UK and secondly our locally-tailored public services can be more responsive to our particular needs while being underwritten through the “union idend”.The economic pluses might be obvious to many but still benefit from being repeated so they are never taken for granted. There is the tarf and regulatory free access to the UK single market for our goods, services and people, worth four times as much as the EU to our exporters. We are able to use the pound sterling at no cost to our businesses or citizens. And there is the “union idend” where beneficial fiscal transfers can ensure vital public services are maintained even when Scotland’s own tax revenues are lower than the costs of running them. Rather than deliver Westminster austerity, the union idend from the UK has helped us to avoid it. That idend was worth £11.1 billion last year – but the fact it exists rather than its amount is the most important benefit.We also know that £45.8bn or 65 per cent of all Scottish exports go to the rest of the UK, compared to £12.7bn or 17 per cent to the rest of the EU and a larger £17.1 or 20 per cent to the rest of the world. The Fraser of Allander Institute estimates that while 125,000 Scottish jobs are supported by trade with the EU, there are 529,000 Scottish jobs supported by trade with the rest of the UK.What this tells us is that , as the Scottish Government says, we are to be concerned about the loss of frictionless trade with the EU single market following Brexit, then the risk to Scottish trade, jobs and prosperity is proportionately four times greater.             Furthermore, once the UK leaves the EU on 29 March next year, any deal that is agreed between the EU and UK would not automatically transfer to Scotland were it to subsequently become independent. Scotland would need to negotiate its own deal or obtain full or associate membership – paying its own membership fee, agreeing to adopt the Schengen border scheme and eventual membership of the Euro. All of these issues could impact upon the friction-free trading arrangements with the UK. Nor would negotiations be easy, Scotland’s hand would be weaker than the UK’s has been and we would need to repair relationships with countries such as Spain – or see any agreement being vetoed. Economically the optimal arrangement is to remain in the UK and benefit from all of its strengths.Scotland remaining in the UK is not just about economics, however, it is about the close personal ties that have built up over the last 300-plus years, our shared culture and history – and how the soft power and opportunities that come from being inside the UK, and often from leading it at the political or business level, are of great value too.            A timely reminder of how economic benefits come from more than just trade came with the opening of the V\u0026ampA Dundee at the weekend. Much economic as well as cultural profit is expected in Dundee from the new gallery – and yet little acknowledgement has been given to the fact that V\u0026ampA Dundee is a member of the British institution and that its beneficial arrival could not have been realised in the same manner were Scotland outside the UK. Of course Dundee’s V\u0026ampA pays testimony to the cultural legacy of Scots such as Charles Rennie Mackintosh and Scotland’s contribution to design more generally, but as a member of the V\u0026ampA family the recognition of that contribution is elevated – while the sharing of the V\u0026ampA’s rich British archives is also made possible.Likewise, the ious city deals that are being signed off between the Scottish and UK governments – bringing over £1bn of UK funding that is outside the Scottish block grant or the Barnett Formula shows that there can be further benefits to what was being anticipated even a decade ago. The UK continues to evolve and change and Scotland can both shape that change and gain from it.Scottish business in the UK is indeed a win-win opportunity. If Robert Kilgour and his team can publish more reports that bring to our attention the quiet or untold advantages of Scotland remaining a full and active member of the UK, then his challenging experiences in the referendum will have been worthwhile.        \t            \t            \t©2018\u0026nbspJohnston Publishing Ltd..\u0026nbspCookie Settings\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4800192.1537168158!/image/image.jpg","title":"christine jardine snp needs to make good on this vital broken promise","story":"Sorry, we\u0027re having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...        Local authorities cannot afford to fix potholes and a myriad of local problems, but replacing the council tax with a land-value tax could make a real dference, writes Christine Jardine.                Sometimes politicians can be guilty of only thinking about the big picture, blue sky thinking, always looking up.            Well in Edinburgh, at the moment, that can be dangerous. Simply because you are likely to trip.            Our pavements are awful, in some places dangerous. The potholes we all complain about are not confined to the roads, which, incidentally, can also affect pedestrians and cyclists.And with winter approaching, it’s probably going to get worse.I’m sure you are probably wondering what has provoked this mini-rant? Unless, of course, you live in Edinburgh, in which case you will already know.In fact,  you live anywhere in Scotland you can probably appreciate exactly what I’m talking about.The problem was epitomised for me a couple of weeks ago when I was invited to a meeting of tenants in sheltered housing in Corstorphine.            On my way there, I had to pick my way carefully around a large pothole in the road and over an uneven – and, for the elderly, treacherous – pavement.At the meeting itself, the problems the state of the pavements was causing for residents was the main topic of discussion.And the residents, housing association and the local councillor were in complete agreement: it needs fixed.But here’s the problem. None of the people in the room, myself included, actually control the issue which is the root of the problem.            It’s the council tax and, in Edinburgh, the garden tax and the fact that it doesn’t seem to matter how much more we pay it doesn’t seem to be enough to fix the problems.To be clear though, I don’t just blame our council for that.: Cost of living crisis sparks rise in council tax warrants, Labour claimsOh, the garden tax with its extra charge for taking away garden refuse is entirely down to the SNP/Labour Edinburgh City Council. But the fact that our council tax no longer stretches to fixing the roads, the pavements, providing full grit bins, in some places not even empty grit bins, keeping public toilets open or simply providing the level of council services that the public deserves – that’s a buck which stops on a completely dferent desk.For more than a decade, the SNP Government has failed to tackle the issue of properly funding our local authorities.            For most of the SNP’s time in office, they have frozen the council tax. For nine years, in fact, as costs to councils increased and what we paid didn’t.So even though the council tax might be increased now, the block grant from Holyrood gets reduced undermining any impact it might have.And you and I are paying the price. Literally. This is not the first time, or even close to it, that I’ve written to call for something to be done about the funding of councils and services.But, as this year’s budget negotiations approach, I still nurture a faint hope that the SNP will listen to those encouraging a less centralised and damaging approach to local authority funding.It’s a policy which makes it appear that they simply do not trust the local authorities to spend money, even those where, as in Edinburgh, they are in the administration.: SNP and Tories team up to defeat Green call to scrap council taxAnd it’s a financial power-grabbing approach which increasingly extends to adding strings to any area or form of funding – teacher numbers, for example.But it’s still the council tax that the majority of us have the most direct experience of, and whose impact we feel most closely.At first, most of us backed the idea of a temporary council tax freeze.That was partly because we were all trying to cope with the personal impacts of the financial crash, and this felt like a short-term measure to help us all.Then, of course, there was the fact that the SNP had been elected in 2007 on a platform of changing the system, introducing a local income tax. The then First Minister Alex Salmond had even calledthe council “unfair”, so we expected that they would be good as their word and reform it. Well, not so much it seems.Here we are ten years later with a system that isn’t fit for purpose, councils without the resources they need and a government without the political will to fix it.Is it that they somehow don’t have constituents whose cars have been damaged by potholes? Are there no elderly residents in their areas who have suffered broken bones falling on cracked or damaged pavements? Or is it that they just are not listening? If they do pay attention they will find that the paying public want something dferent. A couple of years ago, I thought that might actually happen. There was a cross-party commission which looked at local tax reform. But Nicola Sturgeon, who had been scathing of the existing system, ignored its recommendations and instead did some tinkering around the edges.Changing Bands E to H is not reform, it’s simply more of the same. It’s time we had proper root-and-branch reform of a system which is no longer fit for purpose. Be bold. Scrap it.Most of all, let go of the strings. Let the councils respond the way they know best – because they do know best – to local problems. There is already another radical, progressive, suggestion on the table: a land-value tax.Liberal Democrats believe there are a number of economic and social benefits that could be achieved and we should be investigating it. We already know that it works well in other countries.It encourages derelict land in urban areas to be brought back into use. And  you decide to improve or extend your property you are not penalised because the tax remains based on the value of the land it is on. What do we have to lose?Next time you are frustrated by the state of the pavements, lack of services or the way you are seeing the council hamstrung at every turn by the current system of funding, take a minute and think: maybe we should do it dferently?        \t            \t            \t©2018\u0026nbspJohnston Publishing Ltd..\u0026nbspCookie Settings\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4796096.1536904995!/image/image.jpg","title":"richard leonard this is how we can fix scotland s broken economy","story":"        A Scottish economics education, five years working as an economist, followed by 20 years representing working people at the point of production in Scottish industry has afforded me a rare insight into the relationship between economic theory and practice.                It has also fired up my passion to bring about a real change and a radical rebalancing of power in the Scottish economy.            That’s why I was pleased to read two eagerly awaited reports on the future of the economy just published. The Institute for Public Policy Research’s  distinguished Commission on Economic Justice provides a radical and visionary plan for delivering change in a post-Brexit economy and the David Hume Institute’s  “Scotland’s Productivity Challenge” stimulates debate around a very practical agenda for change.            They complement and reinforce each other. Both reports serve as useful reminders of the importance of clarity in debate. The DHI report begins as it means to go on, “A country’s productivity is the single most important determinant of its average living standards and wealth.” The IPPR make a similar point “poor productivity ... holds back growth and holds down wages”.And both recognise the importance of long termism. So, the IPPR’s Commission notes that “the economy needs fundamental reform”, as the “weaknesses in productivity, investment and trade go back 30 years or more. They will not be addressed by incremental change or trying to ‘muddle through’.”This is refreshing. The challenges we face are deep-seated and they demand a new radicalism and vitality.There have, after all, been far-reaching changes to our economic structure over the last three decades. We have shted from being a nation of producers to being one of consumers. We have witnessed a continued contraction of manufacturing jobs and the total collapse of entire industries like mining.We have seen the emergence of a service-led economy and a consequent impact on our balance of trade and our national accounts, but also at a human level on working lives and the sustainability of local communities too.              : Richard Leonard: Mediocre SNP too timid to stand up to Tory austerityAnd we have seen a transformational loss of economic and industrial ownership and control from Scotland which has strained and broken accountability in our economy even further.Telling in the reports is an analysis that despite a high level of skills in the workforce and favourable terms of trade – we sell exports at relatively high prices compared to the imports we buy – our labour productivity and our labour force is being let down because we have low capital stock, that is we have low levels of business investment in machinery and equipment.Intriguingly, the IPPR conclude that low capital investment is exacerbated by the growth of the low-wage, precarious employment economic model. Business owners getting caught up in a downward business spiral of low pay, low investment, and low productivity.            Productivity in simple terms is measured as GDP per hour worked. The long hours culture is one of the reasons why both productivity and the quality of le is dragged down.One suggestion to tackle this is better parental leave entitlement and more holidays. I would not argue with this. But it is also long overdue that we revisit the UK opt-out of the European Union Working Time Directive, which means in Scotland alone more than a quarter of a million workers regularly work beyond a 48-hour week. We need to break away from this long hours’ culture, not only for the sake of our productivity, but also for the sake of our health, and health and safety.The answer to the productivity challenge and many other industrial questions from the political right is iniably tax cuts. But there is a sleight of hand here.Whilst the Tories have cut corporation tax from 26 pence to 19 pence, they have put up regressive taxes like VAT from 17.5 per cent to 20 per cent – hitting the poorest the hardest. So, there has been a redistribution of income and wealth, but just in the wrong direction.: Richard Leonard: How public money is used to exploit Scottish workers            Moreover, both reports eschew this tax-cutting agenda. The IPPR concludes “there is in fact little evidence that investment levels are signicantly influenced by corporation tax rates” – pointing to much higher rates in much more successful economies. The DHI’s finding is that the answer to Scotland’s productivity challenge is not to be found in tax cuts, but business research and development, investment in a stronger indigenous business base and better management.And they make clear that the Scottish Parliament already possesses signicant powers to influence long-term economic performance, including education, health, housing, planning, transport and economic development.At the start of this year, the Scottish Government published its assessment of Brexit’s effect on Scotland. Productivity was singled out as the largest factor in the reduction in our GDP, expected to contribute a 5.8 per cent drop in economic output.And there is little doubt that Brexit should inject some added urgency to tackle the long-term problem of Scotland’s productivity gap. It only serves to reinforce this need for a step change in how we do things. If we do not make this change in the context of Brexit, we will simply drt even further from the high-skill, high-wage economy Scotland needs. Increasing the level of productivity is key to achieving sustainable economic development, to raising incomes and to creating better quality jobs. Scotland is one of the better performing parts of the UK by measure of productivity, but it is still below the UK average. Much of the debate in the Scottish Parliament is regularly focused on what powers the current Government does not have rather than the ones that it does.The Scottish Parliament already possesses signicant powers to influence long-term economic performance. It is high time that at long last they were used.After all, the questions we now face are far too important to be left to economists alone to answer, and they certainly cannot be left to the present parties of government. If we are to bring about the real economic change we need, we will need to change our political priorities too.        \t            \t            \t©2018\u0026nbspJohnston Publishing Ltd..\u0026nbspCookie Settings\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4800802.1537167645!/image/image.jpg","title":"gap between snp s 2014 plans and north sea revenue reaches 30bn","story":"Sorry, we\u0027re having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...        The SNP should apologise for the growing black hole in the economic prospectus for independence as the shortfall in oil revenues reaches \u0026#16330 billion, Labour has demanded.                Projections in the Scottish Government’s White Paper on independence were more than ten times bigger than estimated revenue from taxes on North Sea oil and gas production in each of the past three years.            It means the shortfall in revenue is expected to reach £29.9bn by the end of this year.            On the eve of the fourth anniversary of the 2014 referendum, Scottish Labour’s economy spokeswoman Jackie Baillie MSP claimed the figures confirm that the economic case for independence was “nothing more than snake oil” and “a lie”.Economic projections in the 2013 White Paper were based on Scottish Government models that predicted oil prices would be broadly stable for at least two years.However, the price of crude oil plunged in the second half of 2014, as the independence referendum reached its climax, nearly halving from 112 per barrel in June to 58  in December.Oil prices hit a low of 28 in 2016 before steadily rebounding to their current level of around 75.This summer saw the publication of the SNP’s Growth Commission report, which the party hopes will convince voters that it has a more realistic economic vision of independence.            Its author, Andrew Wilson, admitted that the White Paper had a robust oil price “baked into the numbers” in 2014 but promised that a future referendum would be fought with North Sea revenues treated “as a proper windfall”.“I can say with some certainty in terms of our own work that we’ll assume for the purposes of our projections that oil is producing zero revenues and therefore treat any revenues that we get from oil as a proper windfall to be used on intergenerational projects rather than spent on spending today,” Mr Wilson said last year.Ms Baillie said: “The SNP told voters that Scotland was on the cusp of a second oil boom, and that oil was simply a bonus when it came to the costs of independence. That was simply a lie.“Instead, the figures that Nicola Sturgeon campaigned on have a £30bn black hole in them.            “That would have led to turbo-charged austerity on an unprecedented scale, with huge cuts to schools, hospitals and social welfare programmes.“These figures were baked into the promises the SNP made to some of the poorest communities in our country. It was nothing more than snake oil.”Ms Baillie added: “Nicola Sturgeon should be apologising to the people of Scotland for misleading them on an industrial scale. Rather than attempt to ide the people of Scotland again with a referendum the country does not want, it is time the SNP focused on jobs, schools and hospitals.”The SNP’s Westminster economy spokeswoman Kirsty Blackman hit back, claiming that “Labour’s only contribution as ever is to do Scotland down”.“The people of Scotland deserve an apology from Labour – who shamelessly told us voting against independence would protect our EU membership but are now working hand-in-hand with the Tories to drag us off the Brexit clf edge against our will,” Ms Blackman said.            She added: “Tory and Labour plans for a hard Brexit are by far the biggest threat to Scotland’s economy and long-term prosperity – with the potential to cut Scottish GDP by up to 9 per cent, costing £12.7bn a year and putting around 80,000 jobs on the line.”        \t            \t            \t©2018\u0026nbspJohnston Publishing Ltd..\u0026nbspCookie Settings\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"theresa may it s my brexit deal or no deal at all","story":"        Rejecting a Brexit agreement based on the government\u0027s Chequers plan will mean the UK crashed out of the EU without any deal at all, Theresa May has said in a warning to Brexiteers in her own party.                The Prime Minister said that unless Conservative MPs accept the outcome of her negotiations with Brussels, \"the alternative to that will be having no deal\".            Her comments in a BBC Panorama interview came as Boris Johnson mounted another attack on Mrs May\u0027s strategy, claiming that the issue of the Irish border is being used to turn the UK into a \u0027vassal state\u0027 and that talks will end in a \"spectacular political car crash\".            : These are the ‘most Googled’ questions about BrexitMr Johnson said the European Union\u0027s fallback position for the Irish border would mean Northern Ireland was \"annexed\" by Brussels.Alternative plans set out by Mrs May would \"effectively\" keep Britain in the bloc, he added.However the PM has said the counter-proposal to her Chequers plan is \"still a hard border\" and hers is the only way that does not \"carve up the United Kingdom\" and put the Union at risk.Reports suggest that the EU is preparing to accept use of technology to avoid the need for new border infrastructure in Ireland and checks on goods being shipped between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.Brussels\u0027 current proposal is to effectively keep Northern Ireland in the EU customs union until a comprehensive trade deal with the UK is agreed, something that the DUP and political parties in Scotland have rejected.            Mr Johnson has backed proposals by the pro-Brexit European Research Group that physical checks can be done away from the border, without keeping the UK or Northern Ireland tied to EU customs rules.Writing in The Daily , he said: \"If the Brexit negotiations continue on this path they will end, I am afraid, in a spectacular political car crash.\"\"If we are to get out of this mess, and get the great British motor back on track, then we need to understand the Irish backstop, and how it is being used to coerce the UK into becoming a vassal state of Brussels,\" he added.\"The EU\u0027s backstop would leave a border down the Irish sea while the UK\u0027s proposal left it \"volunteering\" to \"remain effectively in the customs union and large parts of the single market until Brussels says otherwise\", Mr Johnson said.            \"Both versions of the backstop are disastrous,\" he wrote. \"One threatens the union the other version - and its close cousin, Chequers - keep us effectively in the EU, as humiliated rules takers.\"We need to challenge the assumptions of both these Irish backstops, or we are heading full throttle for the ditch with a total write-off of Brexit.\"We are straining at the gnat of the Irish border problem - in fact we haven\u0027t even tried to chew the gnat - and we are swallowing the camel of EU membership in all but name.\"Mrs May said there needs to be \"friction-free\" movement of goods across the Irish border, without customs or regulatory checks between the UK and EU, after Brexit.She said that the counter-proposal will not \"solve the issue of no hard border by having a hard border 20km inside Ireland\".            \"The people of Northern Ireland deserve to be listened to in these negotiations by the UK Government, as do people elsewhere in this country,\" she told the BBC.\"I want to ensure that as we go forward we have that strong union...

The director of the new V\u0026ampA Dundee has said he is \u0026#8220especially proud\u0026#8221 of the conservation and restoration of  Charles Rennie Mackintosh\u0026#8217s original Oak Room.                The Kengo Kuma-designed building will open on Saturday, the striking centrepiece of the continuing £1 billion regeneration of Dundee’s waterfront.            More than a decade after the idea of opening a V\u0026ampA in Scotland’s fourth city was first discussed, director Philip Long spoke of the challenges – and the “thrill” – of setting up the design museum as it prepares to welcome the public.            The museum’s Scottish Design Galleries celebrate the influence of design at home and abroad, from Beano artwork to Hunter wellies and the Fair Isle jumper.The jewel in the crown is Mackintosh’s Oak Room – the painstakingly reconstructed interior of part of Miss Cranston’s Ingram Street Tea Rooms – which has been unseen for 50 years.Mr Long, who came to the V\u0026ampA Dundee from the National Galleries of Scotland, admits that laying his eyes on the exhibit for the first time was an emotional moment.He said: “It’s one of his great, but lost to view, interiors that is now complete and in the museum.“It brings back to public view after nearly 50 years – in fact it’s 70 years since it was used as a tea room – one of this great architect and designer’s works.            “I can tell you, it is a thrilling, quite emotional thing to walk in and see after all of these years.”The interior is on long-term loan following discussions with Glasgow Museums several years ago.Mr Long said: “The thing I’m especially proud of is the conservation and restoration of this original Mackintosh room.“Mackintosh is, after all, one of the world’s greatest architects and designers and happens to be part of Scotland’s design heritage.            “When we set about developing the Scottish Design Galleries, one of the things we needed to ensure was to represent Mackintosh as part of the work we were doing.”Museum bosses anticipate high volumes of visitors and entry over the opening weekend is reserved for those who have prebooked tickets.Access is otherwise free and non-ticketed, with the exception of big touring exhibitions. The first, Ocean Liners: Speed and Style, looks at the design and cultural impact of cruise ships and travel.Mr Long said: “There have been lots of challenges along the way and I’m very pleased and proud that we’ve seen our way through those.“The biggest challenge has been the magnitude of the project overall.            “V\u0026ampA Dundee is not an outstation of the V\u0026ampA in London. As one of the founding partners, V\u0026ampA is a core part, but we here in Dundee are a new team that has come together to develop this project and lead it long into the future.”The question has been asked why the V\u0026ampA chose Dundee to set up home, but Mr Long suggests it was the city that chose the V\u0026ampA. Representatives from the University of Dundee got the ball rolling in 2007, suggesting to the museum that it might like to be part of the waterfront regeneration.Mr Long said: “Dundee really gets the importance of cultural facilities and activities as part of the le of its citizens. That’s been clear over the last 20 years through the investment in new organisations like Dundee Contemporary Arts, or whether it’s the ongoing success of places like Dundee Rep Theatre or the Science Centre or the redevelopment of the McManus.“All of these things demonstrated to the leadership here that investment in culture is the right thing to do.

Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildle centre based in Lerwick.

It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.\nThere are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined.\n Next you\u0026#8217ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!\nI think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.\nIf you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, \u0026#8220The Arts\u0026#8221, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.  In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved ?? SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.

A scientic, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.  Would not even need a bar!!!\nThe Shard in London, an amazingly beatul structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.  Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass.   Building methods change along with building materials.  I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.\nCome on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.\nThe Shard is a massive glass pyramid\u0026#8230.I\u0026#8217m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.\nMareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.\nIf I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used \u0026#8211 There\u0026#8217s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.\nAll the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.\nCall me old fashioned but I would love to see the modern  building business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of 25 to 80 tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles  ,all done 5000 years ago.It\u0026#8217s true you really can\u0026#8217t get the staff nowadays. I wonder  the Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops \u0026#8211 the British ways of one can\u0026#8217t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is about  to finish off  another burgeoning industry.\nI’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up!   As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.  May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in their  bucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.\nAluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.\nI’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of the  term ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much in  identying the material nature of that being used but more an attempt  to denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure?  Rather like calling a van a box on wheels? I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaning  comments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.\nIf it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.\n@ Haydn Gear.\nWhen there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.\nPretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.\nUnless you already know Mareel\u0026#8217s purpose and that its supposedly an \u0026#8216iconic\u0026#8217 design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that\u0026#8217s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname \u0026#8216The Pagoda\u0026#8217 as soon as it was built.\nLet us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for \u0026#8220Mareel\u0026#8221 to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst\u0026#8217s \u0026#8220Pickled cow and calf.\u0026#8221, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel\u0026#8217s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.\nI have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel.   What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.  Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kick  out of venting there spleens in those directions.  I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primary  to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments?  I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.\nLeaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man?\nThose of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.\nPurely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda was  in any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it?  I wonder  takeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architectural  similarities.\nThe viking was a chippy when it opened.\n\u0026#8220What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.\u0026#8221 Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, \u0026#8221 is their primary  to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments? \u0026#8220, \u0026#8220I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever\u0026#8221 and \u0026#8221 Pig ignorant prats.\u0026#8221 Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!\n\nWell Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.    I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.  There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there? All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.  Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.  I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.\nLove hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of some  by those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and to  maintain  credibility from the watchful public at large.         In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.  Look what happened!      So let today’s critics mock on  it makes them feel better.\n\nParaphrasing MGM\u0026#8217s famous motto, the phrase \u0026#8220Arse gratia artis\u0026#8221, springs to mind. LOL 🙂\nAs an artist myself  doing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.\nI have been to many art exhibitions and  art shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as \u0026#8216 ripping off the customer \u0026#8216 with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody else can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.\nIt takes me about 20 hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.\nI have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!  Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit.   Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spence  is an all   too common feature in most  walks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.    Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns is  not too far removed from the  actions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!\nSo talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.\nNobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as \u0026#8220pig ignorant\u0026#8221. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such \u0026#8220arty things\u0026#8221.  We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £16 million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained/consecrated.\nNo doubt it was deliberate   and the  opportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !\nHad you checked out Ian\u0026#8217s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I\u0026#8217d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous \u0026#8220Sam the Eagles\u0026#8221 among us. That said, it\u0026#8217s a concept I wouldn\u0026#8217t wish to see spread any farther!  🙂\n\nNo insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to \u0026#8220The Black Mountains\u0026#8221. I  will try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found in  Mareel\u0026#8217s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing else, nasty little creatures!!! .\nFair  enough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.  I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.  Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artists  when it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds. Too many around in all walks of le. Nice to have these little chats from a distance and always enjoy reading your submissions.  HG\nIs the winning artist of the Turner Prize, representing what many think of the Turner Prize and this of being a club for elitist artists where their work is highly questionable or just giving art the \u0026#8216 shock value \u0026#8216 when it comes to expressing what art is or should be?\nPersonally, I would do away with this and just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it \u0026#8216 And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230. \u0026#8216. lol\n“ And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.?”.

LoL\nThank you for the offer Haydn, but my style of art is recognizable and is representable to those people to whome I have done portraits of.\nBased on this, and the feedback from people I have done portraits of as well as people who have seen my work, I can categorically say my artwork is recognized for what it is, this of a portrait. To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say \u0026#8216 there is a strong likeness to themselves \u0026#8216 and they are very pleased with the outcome.\nAlternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.\nI could always get away with this by saying \u0026#8216 It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art \u0026#8216 and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lol\nWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.    I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself and  you look at my products you would find this to be true.   My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generate  sympathetic responses.  It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.  All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 22 ","story":"After being tasked with compiling a feature to coincide with the 100th anniversary of the senior football inter-county, it was a pleasure to speak to several of those with first-hand knowledge of the history of the Milne Cup competition.\nGeordie Hunter goes the furthest back, having made his debut in the 1953 game. On that occasion a top-notch Shetland team came away from Kirkwall with a 3-1 win courtesy of goals by Sammy Johnson, John “Pisco” Leask and Jim Black.\nHunter also played in the legendary 9-7 victory in Orkney 10 years later when, according to Orkney veteran Eric Hutchison, every shot that Bert Sinclair hit seemed to end up in the back of the net.\nSinclair himself has an amazing memory, and has kept records of some of his incredible achievements. His eight goals in one junior inter-county match and 11 in the next three successive senior counties have already been documented, but his scoring spree in the late 1950s and early 60s is something else.\nFrom 1957 to 1964 he played in just over 200 matches, at junior and senior level including representative games, and I can only find two occasions on which he failed to find the net. If anyone anywhere in the country has a record to beat that I’d be delighted to hear from them.\nSinclair also speaks of his greatest disappointment, being dropped from the county side in 1964, apparently for missing training when he had pretty valid reasons for not turning up.\nAnother who experienced the highs and lows was Derrick Bradley, who as manager led Shetland to an unprecedented 12 wins in 13 matches, the only blip being a 0-0 draw in Orkney.\nThen he was unceremoniously ousted, apparently because a few of the players had had enough of him. Bradley retains some bitterness, but it doesn’t stop him wishing the current side all the best for next weekend.\nLen Laurenson and John Johnston recount what it was like to play for both Shetland and Orkney, while James Johnston, Shetland’s equal most-capped player, reflects on 17 caps and how he went out on a high.\nBut the final word should go to two Orkney men, Hutchison and Morgan Harcus, both of whom are still avid fans of the annual event. As well as the fierce rivalry and hotly contested games, they mention the friendships they formed with their opponents.\nThat is probably what makes this contest so special. As Harcus says, they like to hate Shetland for an hour and a half, but the rest of the time it is completely dferent.\n: : : : : : : :\nDid the best team really win the World Cup? That question has been asked the  and breadth of the country after France’s 4-2 victory over Croatia on Sunday.\nPersonally I thought the Croats were very unlucky. The free kick from which the French opened the scoring should never have been given, while the penalty decision to make it 2-1 was debatable. There may just have been enough hand-to-ball movement for the spot kick to have been awarded, but it took several viewings by the referee through VAR before he was convinced.\n predictor competition, partly as a result of the scoring exploits of Antoine Griezmann, I was disappointed that it wasn’t a Belgium versus Croatia final. A new name on the Jules Rimet Trophy would only have been good for the game overall.\nFrance were ultimately the strongest team in the competition – they improved and became more resilient as the event wore on – but they were definitely not the most attractive. There was something almost German-like about the winners with their dogged organisation and ability to counter-attack with deadly efficiency.\nAs for England, I would say far too much has been made of a “new dawn” under manager Gareth Southgate. The English did get further than most people expected, but they came up well short on two occasions against the Belgians and only stuttered past Tunisia and Colombia. Two of the victories, it should be remembered, were against a shambolic Panama and a Sweden team which appeared to have no interest in winning other than by penalties.\nAfter England’s exit Graeme Le Saux – now there’s a twit  ever there was one – was going on about Southgate’s “emotional intelligence” whatever that is.\nA group of players came together and played as a team, it has been suggested by both Southgate and the media. But is that the first time in the history of football that this has happened to an English team? I don’t think so.\nIt happened at the World Cups of 1966, 1970, 1990 and 1998, and also at the European Championship in 1996. I’m sure the players who took part, for instance Bobby Charlton, Terry Butcher or Paul Gascoigne, would stress the team ethic involved.\nSpeaking of Charlton, the referee for Sunday’s final, Argentinian Nestor Pitana, had the kind of comb-over which the great man himself would have been proud of.\nThere were many who doubted the wisdom of granting the staging of this year’s event to Russia. But all in all it was a very satisfactory tournament. The organisation was good, the stadiums were tremendous, there was plenty of excitement and some great inidual performances, and the introduction of VAR provided several talking points.\nMy team of the tournament, with a token Englishman in the mix, is: Thibaut Courtois  Benjamin Pad , Raphaël Varane , Diego Godín , Ivan Strinic  Ivan Perisic , Luka Modric , Jordan Henderson , Eden Hazard  Cristiano Ronaldo , Edinson Cavani .\nIf anyone questions the omission of Kylian Mbappe, I would say the young French player has been somewhat over-hyped. He certainly has pace in abundance, and a touch of skill, but is also petulant in a way that would suggest he is more of a successor to the ing Neymar than the much more honest Lionel Messi.\n: : : : : : : :\nSeveral metro stations in Paris have apparently been temporarily renamed in honour of France becoming world champions.\nAmong them are Notre-Dame des Champs, which became “Notre Didier Deschamps” and Victor Hugo which was adapted to “Victor Hugo Lloris”.\nEngland quickly cottoned on to the idea as well, with the Southgate tube stop in London being enlarged to “Gareth Southgate”.\nMaybe  Shetland wins the Milne Cup 100th centenary match next weekend the top thoroughfare in Scalloway could be changed to “Kevin Main Street”?\nOr did the county manager not name enough village players in his squad for that to happen?\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 23 ","story":"Over a hundred Shetlanders had a memorable time in Orkney at the weekend, rekindling aquaintances and reminiscing about old battles during the celebrations to mark the 100th anniversary of the Milne Cup.\nSadly this year’s football team were unable to bring the famous trophy back home again, going down to a highly charged and spirited Orkney outfit who took their chances when it mattered.\nMany supporters have been critical of the team selection, in particular the decisions to drop keeper Saul Swanson who kept a clean sheet last year, to leave striker Paul Molloy in reserve and to field James Farmer who did not seem fully fit.\nWhile it is hard to disagree with that, I also felt there was a disjointed look about the side with several players not being fielded in the positions they fulfil for their respective clubs.\nBut despite the result this did not feel like a hammering. The 5-1 scoreline flattered the home side. Shetland could easily have had another two or three goals and it has to be remembered that Orkney only got their last two with the game either entering or having gone into stoppage time.\nMolloy’s introduction 10 minutes into the second half obviously made a dference, as he went on to score the type of goal I doubt  anyone else in the squad is capable of – muscling his way into the box, holding off a couple of defenders, creating space for himself and firing home.\nBut the damage had been done in the first half – at 3-0 down Shetland were always facing an uphill struggle and it was no surprise that Orkney put the icing on the cake with a couple of breakaway goals.\nSome have suggested it was a game too far for captain Leighton Flaws, who reversed his decision to retire after last year’s win in Lerwick. I wouldn’t necessarily go along with that. Flaws, who maintains it was not the carrot of the centenary match that prompted his U-turn, looked as good as anyone in the Shetland side in the second half.\nI felt really sorry for manager Kevin Main, who spoke openly beforehand about both his hopes for the big day and his selection tactics. As someone who was described this week as “the Gareth Southgate of Shetland football”, he deserves the chance to turn this setback around.\nTwo years ago the then management team of Allan Graham and John Scott Christie, whom Main had assisted, were basically forced out of their positions after a 3-2 defeat in Kirkwall.\nThere is no way that should be allowed to happen again. Hopefully Main and his assistant Robert Geddes will now take stock and work hard towards next year, when the match at Gilbertson Park in Lerwick will celebrate Shetland Football Association’s 100th birthday.\nIt’s just a pity we have to wait a whole 12 months until a chance of revenge.\n: : : : : : : :\nA couple of hours earlier another team in blue slumped to defeat, but with Orkney’s recent record on the hockey pitch that was less unexpected.\nThere are continuing signs of improvement among the hockey players, however, in spite of an ever-increasing list of failures at inter-county level.\nA score of 4-1 was probably about right, as Orkney were much more clinical and displayed a quality of crisp passing and control which was a shade above their opponents.\nThe Shetland players work incredibly hard and show much commitment, however, especially with the added handicap of having to travel to Brae for any kind of action.\nA few caught the eye on Saturday, among them goalkeeper Megan Nicholson who pulled off at least one fine save, Cara Leask who notched the opening goal and Kristan Robertson who got the nod as Shetland’s player of the match.\nI would also mention Victoria Duthie who was in the thick of the action throughout, making several excellent runs and showing much determination both in possession and when chasing an opponent. The fact that Duthie was still limping quite heavily a few hours later was testament to how much she gave for the cause.\n: : : : : : : :\nOrkney football historian Jockie Wood addresses the Milne Cup 100th anniversary reception at the PIckaquoy Centre in Orkney last Saturday. Former Aberdeen striker Joe Harper, the evening\u0026#8217s guest of honour, is in the centre of the picture. Photo: John Coutts\nThe reception at the Pickaquoy Centre later on Saturday evening, attended by over 400 guests, was a great opportunity for former county football adversaries to meet up again.\nUnfortunately the meal was nothing to write home about – the main course of roast beef and trimmings was cold – and the acoustics of the building were downright awful.\nThe speeches which followed,  anyone could hear what was being said, were on the y side. And I have no idea at all what guest speaker Joe Harper, the former Aberdeen and Scotland striker, was on about. All you could hear was the occasional “effing” this and “effing” that.\nIt was fitting, however, when Jockie Wood called on a couple of former Shetland players to take a bow. Both Geordie Hunter, or the “big game Hunter” as Wood referred to him, and the inimitable striker Bert Sinclair certainly did their bit in years gone by.\nSinclair in particular was in his element, reminiscing with Orkney opponents Alan Findlay and Eric Hutchison who also featured in the famous 1963 game when he hit the back of the net five times in the 9-7 victory.\n: : : : : : : :\nAnd finally, as this week’s column is all about the inter-county weekend, it is surely fitting to end on a high note.\nOn Sunday morning, although the match really should have taken place as a warm-up to the main Milne Cup encounter, over two dozen veterans took to the field again.\nHelped by the fact that one or two of the team are still turning out occasionally at B-team level, the blues were much fitter and faster than their opponents.\nRobert Adamson, who fills out his shirt rather better than he did 20-odd years ago, was on the scoresheet along with his former Thistle team mate Stuart Smith who netted a hat trick.\nThe others came from Delting’s Stuart Hay and the aforementioned Main, who surely merited it after Saturday’s setback, and a penalty from the oldest man in the side Bruce Williamson of Spurs.\nThe final score was a 7-1 win for Shetland, which as some wise guy put it made for an aggregate 8-6 football victory. But unfortunately not many will see it that way.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.\nIt is rare enough for a local game to end 0-0, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.\nAstonishingly, Delting’s 4-1 triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.\nThe final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.\nDelting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.\nDevonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.\nThis is the 14th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back 36 years for Southend’s solitary success.\nApologies to older readers  I’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in 1982, but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.\nThe quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw 2-2 with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay 4-1 away from home.\nThe semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another 3-3 draw and another replay was necessary.\nAfter Delting won that one 3-2 at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.\nDelting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.\nAlthough it was tough ask to play two games in about 18 hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.\nSo on Saturday 7th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.\nGoals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a 2-0 lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.\nPlayer/manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.\nIt was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.\nBut it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.\n: : : : : : : :\nIn professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.\nThe benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the 20 clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.\nDuring the 2017-18 campaign the clubs benefited from over £2.4 billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £150 million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £94 million.\nJust where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.\nWhile players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.\nOn the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.\nIn Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.\nFollowing Rangers’ 1-1 draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.\nIt could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.\nThat was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.\nPerhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes finds  dficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.\nRogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.\nThere are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.\n: : : : : : : :\nOne of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.\nAlthough the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and 159 runs.\nMuch has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.\nUnfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.\nI’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.\nMaybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.\nThe only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.\nSome apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.\nIn answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar.

Opinion was also sought online. There is potential for the amended boundary to generate more planning applications. Parts of Grantown including The Square were designated as a conservation area in 1975. This is the first formal review since that designation.\nThe proposal is to extend the designated area along South High Street and into peripheral areas of the conservation zone. Mr Puls stressed it was not the purpose of a conservation area to prevent development but \"rather to control development to ensure it is appropriately sited and designed\".\nHe said this was aptly demonstrated by a number of new developments consented in recent years. Strong views were expressed \u0026ndash for and against \u0026ndash on the inclusion of the belt of trees to the north and west of Inverallan Church.\nThe trees contribute to the setting of the conservation area, forming a backdrop to the B-listed church \"and provide a natural separation with the later development to the north west\", according to the officer\u0027s report to members.\nThose against the proposed extension cited the project to convert the church for \"community use, part funded by developing housing either side of the church\".\nThere was a sense that including the location within the conservation area would be \"a barrier to this development\".\nConversely, there was support for including the trees because they would be better protected from speculative development.\nThe draft proposals will go to the council\u0027s south planning committee for approval.

We are elected as MPs who vote for Sinn Féin not to take seats at Westminster.”\nMeanwhile, a poll by LucidTalk in June 2017 showed that 87% of Sinn Féin voters backed their abstentionist stance, with only 5% opposed.  \nWhen supporters were asked how they would react  Sinn Féin judged that it strategically suited the party to take seats in Westminster, more than half of their supporters  said they would oppose such a move.\n\ntest\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27475  ","story":" Michael McMonagle\n\nWe believe there is now an urgent need for an inclusive, constructive debate on the future, including how a united Ireland might be brought about and what it might look like.  - Matt Carthy MEP\nSinn Féin will host a United Ireland conference in Letterkenny tomorrow featuring a range of speakers discussing what Irish unity would look like and how it can be achieved. \nThe Towards A United Ireland conference will be hosted by Matt Carthy MEP and will be held in the An Grianan Theatre in Letterkenny from 11am tomorrow. \nIt will feature two panel discussions with contributors discussing whether an agreed Ireland is possible and  a unity referendum could be won. \nPanellists will include journalist and unionist commentator, Alex Kane, economist Paul Gosling, founder of Equate, Michael Barron, Jonathan Shafi from the Scottish independence movement, commentator Patricia MacBride and Gillian Hamill, journalist and homelessness campaigner. \nThe panel discussions will be chaired by Damien Dowds, editor of the Inishowen Independent. \nSpeakers from Sinn Féin will include Elisha McCallion MP, Martina Anderson MEP, Pearse Doherty TD, Matt Carthy MEP and Senator Padraig MacLochlainn. \nIt is the fth in a series of Towards A United Ireland conferences to be held recently. \nSpeaking ahead of the event, Matt Carthy encouraged as many people as possible to attend. \n\"We believe there is now an urgent need for an inclusive, constructive debate on the future, including how a united Ireland might be brought about and what it might look like. \n\"As part of this process Sinn Féin has organised a series of successful conferences on this theme in Dublin, Belfast, Cork and London. \n\"The event will give a range of perspectives on whether a new Ireland is possible and whether or not we can win a referendum on Irish unity. \n\"This is an important discussion and there is a place for everyone in it so I would encourage as many people as possible to come along and join us in Letterkenny,\" he said. \n\n\ntest\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27476  ","story":" Declan Kearney\nSinn Féin National Chairperson\nBrexit means that change in the political relations between Britain and Ireland is now unavoidable, and, while partition never had any democratic legitimacy, its continued imposition is no longer sustainable.- Declan Kearney\nTheannual British-Irish Association  conference convened last weekend inOxford, England.\nAt thesame time the British government was taking its latest step away from the Good FridayAgreement by changing legislation on calling elections in the north, the DUPleader pulled out from attending the BIA conference at the last minute to hostthe Tory defence minister at another DUP gala dinner in Fermanagh.\nOnWednesday, speaking after meeting the British Prime Minister in London sheprovided the latest evidence that the DUP has no commitment to restoring thepolitical institutions.  \nTheBrexit catastrophe is unfolding relentlessly.\nTheTory party civil war has become even more visceral since the Chequersannouncement.\nThe RHIinquiry continues to reveal a DUP party which was clearly dysal ingovernment, providing insights which make a mockery of that party\u0027s purportedadherence to \u0027good governance’.\nIanPaisley\u0027s misconduct \u0026amp discredited behaviour arising from the Sri Lankaepisode is yet another reminder of the recurring financial scandals associatedwith the DUP.\nThe DUPjust does not get it!\n\nThatparty has been in turmoil since it walked away from the draft agreement andaccommodation with Sinn Féin on 9th February which would have restoreding political institutions by the following week.\nYet inall these circumstances the DUP feels no pressure to change its position.\nAndeven  the British government was so inclined, the Tories have no incentive todo so in the midst of their own governmental and party crises.\nInreality some within the DUP have turned away from the political institutions.\nThey have already decided the party should notcontest the 2019 local council elections against the back ground of anagreement on Acht Gaeilge and Irish language rights. It\u0027s increasingly obviousthat continued political impasse is a DUP default position in the absence ofgiving political leadership and making political progress.\nLastMonday in a new destabilising development the Boundary Commission reaffirmedrecommendations which resemble an electoral and political gerrymander of thenorth as a counter to irreversible demographic changes.\nThefact is that the Good Friday Agreement and political process are now being heldto ransom by the political self interests and unionist priorities of the DUPand the Tories.\nTheBritish government and DUP alliance has become a mutually reinforcing wrecker’scharter. Democratic norms are being thrown to the side and violated.\nIn myown speech to the BIA conference I said there is now a real risk that 25years of progress could be squandered.\nIrepeated that the absence of ing political institutions is bad forsociety.\nThefailure to fully implement and defend the Good Friday Agreement damagesboth the peace and political processes.\n\nAnd thecatastrophe of Brexit has been torpedoed into the midst of these dficulties.\nThereis an imperative for us all to look beyond the scale of existing crises and to provide hope and positive vision.\nSinn Féin is absolutely dedicated and authenticin our commitment to opening a new phase of the peace process whichsecures a permanent reconciliation and healing process throughout theisland of Ireland.\nPartitionis the central fault line at the heart of Irish politics and society.\nIt hasbeen an abject failure from its imposition. \nThesectarian structure of the northern state post partition ensured thata substantial minority were destined never to be treated asequals.\nTheCivil Rights Movement 50 years ago highlighted graphically the inability of theunionist state to treat the minority as equals.\nThis belligerent opposition from powerful sections within politicalunionism against reform of the northern statepersists today in the form of political unionist hostility towards implementation of theGood Friday Agreement since 1998. \nTherefusal of political unionism to embrace a rights-based society and equalityhas culminated in the collapse of the political institutionsand associated crisis in the north for thelast 18 months.\nThegreater majority of citizens in the north are committed to the Good FridayAgreement.\nThey wantrights to be guaranteed which are already enjoyed by others inDublin, London, Edinburgh and Cardf.\nThe politicalearthquake of Brexit has again exposed the negative rolethat partition continues to play in Irish affairs, and the fundamentallyanti-democratic nature of the union with Britain.\nOver 20 years into the Irish peace process, Irish citizens inthe north now face the very real and frightening potential of partition,as the main source of ision and conflict in Ireland, being reinforced.\n\nVerysignicantly, a seismic sht has also occurred in the ambitionand expectation of republicans, nationalists and other citizens inthe north.\nA newgeneration is questioning partition.\nTherepublican and nationalist constituency is now looking beyondBrexit and towards the prospect of accelerated Irish reunication.\nBrexithas become a defining moment for these islands.\nIthas introduced a new political discourse about the future ofIreland north and south, and the relationship with Britain and Europe.\nThedebate on Irish unity and the timing of a unity referendum have now movedcentre stage.\nThesenew unprecedented realities in turn present new strategic challenges for all ofus in political leadership.\nTheydemand that we act as pioneers of the future not prisoners of the past.\nThereforeit is time for a paradigm sht in British government policy towards Ireland.\nNegativemismanagement of the Irish peace process and the Good FridayAgreement by successive British governments, and the particular pro-unionist bias of the Conservative governmentsince 2010, must be replaced with a recognition that the transitiontowards Irish unity should begin.\nInitially thatshould take the form of preparing for a unity referendumand by engaging in a new political discussion with the Irishgovernment and all political parties on the island of Ireland in relation toreunication.\nFormany in the British establishment this will be an anathema.\nForthose in the Tory party leadership who have tied their electoral survival to analliance with the DUP this prospect will be unthinkable.\nHowever, Brexitmeans that change in the political relations between Britain andIreland is now unavoidable, and, while partition never had any democraticlegitimacy, its continued imposition is no longer sustainable.\nIt istime for historic, decisive and brave leadership to be shown by the Britishstate.\nIn parallel, the Irish government needs to begin to prepare for theconstitutional, political and economic transition towards Irish unity.\n Itshould facilitate an open and inclusive national conversation on Irish unityinvolving all citizens, political parties, social partners and civicsociety.\n\nA GreenPaper on Irish unity should be published detailing the constitutional,political, fiscal and economic measures for a successful transition to a unitedIreland.\nTheIrish government should commence a discussion with the EU commission andinstitutions to explore their practical role and support in facilitating anefficient process of reunication.\nPoliticalunionism must also open itself up to the new reality that Ireland has changeddramatically. \nToomany within the leadership of the DUP, and other unionist parties, seek refugein the past, preferring to refight old battles, instead of looking forward tonew opportunities.\nSocietalchange brought about through referenda on marriage equalityand women’s reproductive health rights means that political unionism can nolonger conjure up the spectre of ‘Rome Rule’.\nDemographicshts in the north are irreversible.\nIt isimportant to note that political unionism and indeed the DUP are notmonolithic.\nSomevoices within unionism – few in number, but notable – have recognisedthese realities and urge fellow unionists to join the debate and tobecome pioneers of our collective future.\nHowever,republicans and nationalists need to recognise the existence of realapprehensions and fears within the unionist constituency.\nUnionistcitizens need to be convinced that the failures andinjustices of the past will never be repeated and that the newtransformational challenges to be faced will be managed withgenerosity and magnanimity.\nNo onewill have any reason to leave their home in an agreed united Ireland.\nThe 20%which would make up a new Ireland, who would not identy as Irish, must neverfeel the exclusion from society that was experienced by Irish citizens in thenorth under unionist rule.\nAminority should be cherished because it enriches society.\nDiversityshould be celebrated and respected.\nThispresents a strategic challenge for republicans and nationalists.\nPoliticaland civic unionism needs to be persuaded that it can own asignicant stake within a new, pluralist, constitutional, national democracy.\nRepublicanshave a responsibility to develop a sense of belonging for all of thosewho should be welcomed, and cherished equally as childrenof a new Ireland.\nThiswill require compromises and accommodation to guarantee religious, politicaland constitutional rights.\nTheopportunity is emerging to reimagine Ireland to reshaperelationships and create a unity of belonging for those who definethemselves as British as well as Irish and, who share the unionist political identityand orange cultural traditions.\nSinn Féin will act as a guarantor for the Britishidentity and the unionist tradition within a new and agreed united Ireland.\nButfundamental change can not be left to happenstance. It must be planned andresourced.\nWhocould have imagined 30 years ago that Germany would be reunited sosuccessfully, or that the edice of South African apartheid would fallfive years later.\n\nThemodern precedents exist for successful political and economictransformation and transition.\nMandelawas right: “It only seems impossible until it is done.”\nIrishunity is both reasonable and achievable.\nIrelandtoday is a multi-cultural society, north and south.\nWe arestronger as a people for that.\nSinn Féin’s vision is of a new inclusive,constitutional, rights-based democracy on the island of Ireland.\nThereis so much to be excited about the rainbow ersity of modern Ireland.\nThis isa time for us all to become pioneers for the future to be visionary with ourpolitics and to make the decisions now about planning for a new Ireland.\n\ntest\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/200/2018/AP-New-top-side-logo.jpg","title":"27477  ","story":" Michael McMonagle\n\nUachtarán na hÉireann must be a beacon of hope for all our people – North, South, East, and West.

This is the most common form of food poisoning in the UK. \n  \nWe have heavily invested in research throughout the production chain and we have already implemented new ideas such as hot water heating, double barrier changing facilities in each house and other technologies which we firmly believe have had a major impact in reducing the number of our birds which can become infected with Campylobacter. \n  \nFurthermore, we are focusing on excellence in biosecurity and innovative processing technologies.\n  \n\n  \nOngoing challenges\n  \n\n  \nControlling infectious disease in poultry is an ongoing challenge Moy Park face, in particular avian influenza . To address this, they have upgraded their AI contingency planning, rewriting the rulebook in the past year to ensure they have a robust plan in place.\n  \nWe have to think carefully how we would react and prevent spread  AI came in to Northern Ireland and together with agencies and Government departments we exchange views regularly with working groups, in order to remain on top of this key issue, Peter said.\n  \n\n  \nCareer Highlight\n  \n\n  \nOver his 40 years with the company Peter said a key highlight has been promoting ownership and pride with the people he works closely with.\n  \nA back to basics approach is one of my fundamental pillars, and I still firmly believe that bird husbandry and welfare are key to producing a high-quality product.\n  \nThere are endless opportunities for those considering a career in agriculture and food production, and as my we and son also work in the poultry industry, I can definitely vouch for that!\n  \nAs the world population continues to expand, the demand for goods also increases and food production, and those working in the industry, will have to keep up with this development.\n  \nBy strengthening our production capabilities over the past number of years, we are well placed to meet this demand, with poultry a healthy and versatile source of protein which is also good value for money.\n  \n\n  \nPositive outlook\n  \n\n  \nPeter concluded: As I look back on my time in the industry and at Moy Park, I’ve always started each morning the same way, and I think it has stood me in good stead!\n  \nThe first thing I think of is ‘today will bring a new challenge, a new opportunity and I will most likely learn something new’ as every day is a school day!”\n \n                  \n    \n          \n"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_995387.jpg--.jpg?1535635242000\n","title":"superb gcse results for dunclug college","story":"  \nDUNCLUG College is celebrating historic levels of achievement at GCSE level. \n  \nAll students, including those with ious learning challenges sat a minimum of 7 GCSE subjects, including the compulsory core of English, Maths and Science and a range of GCSE optional choices in a balance of General and Applied courses.\n  \n Many gted and competitive students sat 8, 9 or 10 subjects.

by-election opens this Wednesday at three venues across North Antrim, including the Joey Dunlop Leisure Centre in Ballymoney.\nAccording to the Electoral Office for Northern Ireland  75,478 North Antrim voters are entitled to sign the Petition in respect of Mr Paisley, recently suspended from the House of Commons, with 10% of those or 7,547 signatures needed to force a by-election.\nUUP Leader Robin Swann and Dunloy Sinn Fein MLA Philip McGuigan have both expressed disappointment at the EONI decision to open only three centres with limited opening hours, instead of a possible 10.\n\n\nINADEQUATE\n\n\nBoth MLA\u0027s as well as TUV leader Jim Allister have said will be signing the petition.\nExpressing disappointment, Mr Swann said three petition centres was totally inadequate for a constituency the size of North Antrim, and by restricting the opening hours, the EONI has shown little regard to people in daytime employment,\n\nSUBVERTED\n\n\nMr McGuigan agreed that the EONI decision on venues was extremely disappointing, and simply not good enough.\nHe continued that people\u0027s ability to reject the disgraceful behaviour of Ian Paisley was greatly reduced by this decision after he had accepted lavish family holidays from the Sri Lankan government and lobbyied against a UN resolution about\u0026#160 human rights abuses by the Sri Lankan authorities.\nHe said the UUP would not register as campaigner during the recall petition, but would encourage any North Antrim electors who think what Ian Paisley did was wrong to sign the petition\n

Ben their proud mother Sabrina has agreed to share their inspiring story.\nSabrina and her husband Bryan are hoping their unforgettable experiences will encourage others to give blood and sign the Stem Cell and Bone Marrow Register.\nSpeaking exclusively to The Chronicle, teacher Sabrina said: It\u0027s been the toughest year of our lives but what a dference the past 12 months have made no words can ever express how we all felt this time last year.\n\u0026#8220To have two children going through such le-changing procedures in the same hospital, on the same day, is something we could never have imagined. Caden is improving every day and Ben has never looked back.

The Ballymoney man lost his father, Mervyn Robinson, to the\u0026#160 North West 200 in 1980, while in July his cousin, William Dunlop, was killed during free practice at the Skerries 100 near Dublin.\nAll of these setbacks forced a re-think, says Robinson. My main reason for quitting the sport was my wee boy, Max, he told Chronicle Sport.\n\u0026#8220Road racing is getting very dangerous and there have been too many accidents recently, so I\u0027m not prepared to take the chance any more.\n\u0026#8220My main fear is getting caught up in something outside of my control like, like an accident happening in front of me, or a bike seizing or something.\n\u0026#8220William\u0027s death affected me big time, to be honest I felt like packing it in immediately.\n\u0026#8220The\u0026#160 circumstances surrounding William\u0027s death were just awful. The fact he left behind a\u0026#160 young daughter and Janine [his partner] had a second baby on the way made it so horrible for us all to deal with.\n\u0026#8220I thought about it and I decided I wanted to do myself some justice and finish off the season before calling it a day.\n    \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n    \n          \n\n full newspaper \u0026#187\n\n    \n\nSend this page to a friend \u0026#187\n\n  \n         your_name.focus       false     else         your_email.focus       false     else         friends_name.focus       false     else         friends_email.focus       false     else     ]]\n\n\n      \nSend to a friend\n  \nPlease complete the following form to inform a friend about this page.\n  \"\n    \n    \n      \n        \nYour Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n      \n        \nYour E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n                      \n        \nComment\n        \n\n      \n                    \n                  \n      \nIn order to process your information we must ask you to enter the letters in the image into the box:\n      \n        \n          \n            \n            \n\nplay audio version\n\n            .src = \u0027/securimage/securimage_show.php?\u0027 + Math.random  false\"\n\nReload Image\n\n          \n          \nVery Code:\n          \n        \n      \n    \n                   \n          \n\n*\n Mandatory field - please complete\n          \n              \n      \n    \n  \n\n    \n  \n     \n        \n      \n        \nNews Search\n        \n          \n          \n        \n        \nsearch news, sport and features across all publications\n      \n    \n                      \n       .ready .click .hide          .attr + \u0027-menu\u0027.          .attr + \u0027-menu\u0027.          .attr + \u0027-menu\u0027.fadeIn           false                .click .parents.fadeOut           false                    */       ]]\n      \n                                                                                                                                        \n                      \n      \n        \n\nNorthern Constitution\n\n        \n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n          \n\nMagherafelt\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\n\n\n        \n          \n\nAntrim\n\n          \n\nBallymena\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\nThe Chronicle\n\n        \n          \n\nBallycastle\n\n          \n\nBallymoney\n\n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n                  \n                           username.focus             false           else               password.focus             false           else                      ]]\n      \n      \"\n        \n          \nSubscriber Login\n          \n            \n              \nUsername:\n              \n            \n            \n              \nPassword:\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n          \n        \n      \n            \n                false\" title=\"View The Leader online!\"\n\n\n                          \n\n\n            \n banner\" title=\"Advertise with Us\" /\n\n                      \n\n\n          \n  \n    \n    \n\u0026copy  2018 Alpha Newspaper Group\n    \n\n          ?

\n            \n\nLord Mayor, Cllr Julie Flaherty attended the launch adding: “The partnership with STA is a fantastic opportunity, and we are very excited to offer a fresh and innovative swim programme incorporating advanced swimming and Junior Leguard courses, as well as increasing grass roots level classes including baby, pre-school and beginner sessions,”\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nThe programme will have very little impact on children currently in lessons. The main area of change will be the names of the lessons from Stanley right through to Shark. \n\nA Progression Chart will be displayed throughout the sites. The change will embrace all areas ensuring a standardised programme is delivered to learners.\n\nLeanne Dougliss, STA’s Interim Sales and Marketing Director added: “We are happy to launch STA’s Swim programme with Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council. Swimming is a vital le skill that all children should be given the opportunity to learn. They have embraced this opportunity to enhance their swim scheme and we are delighted to be able to offer a current, cost-effective, quality programme that is appealing to learners of all ages and abilities. Together we can save lives through the teaching of swimming, first aid and lesaving. I look forward to working with the team to ensure their customers receive the highest quality lessons.”\n\nFor information on the getactiveabc Swim Academy, visit getactiveabc\n\n                            \n            \n            \n            \n    \n"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_auto,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8634555.1536848138!/image/image.jpg","title":"education  ","story":"\nPupils were hailed for their exams success at the Dromore High, Sixth Form Celebration of Achievement.\n            \n                                      \t   \nEducation\n                                              \n                    \n\n        \n\n\n    ,             imgUrl = wrapper.find.data           \u0027                 .                                \n\t        \n            \n                      \n                                    \n                    \n            \n        \n                                        \n            \n        \n    \n    \n                    \n                \n                    St Mary\u0026rsquos say goodbye to Mr Timothy Doyle                \n            \n            \n                \n\nSt Mary\u0026#8217s Primary School, Banbridge, was shocked and saddened by the sudden passing of their much esteemed colleague and friend, Mr Timothy Doyle. \n            \n                                        \t\nNews\n                                              \n                    \n\n        \n\n\n    ,                    imgUrl = wrapper.find.data              \u0027                        .                        .                                                \n                \n                                                \n                    \n            \n        \n                                        \n            \n        \n    \n    \n                    \n                \n                    Education Authority offers assurance about future of school crossing patrols                \n            \n            \n                \n\nThe Education Authority  has given an assurance that school crossing patrols will be in operation when children across Northern Ireland  to school in the coming days.\n            \n                                        \t\nEducation\n                                              \n                    \n\n        \n\n\n    ,                    imgUrl = wrapper.find.data              \u0027                        .                        .                                                \n                \n                        \n                                              \n            \n                                  \n                                    \n                    \n            \n        , Sinead Sweeney  Jack Rice , Christopher Beattie , Amy Gray    and Shannon Ferguson  have all been selected to take part in prestigious British Council programme, and will spend a year studying business in the USA.

high pupils hailed for exam successes","story":"\nPupils were hailed for their exams success at the Dromore High, Sixth Form Celebration of Achievement.\n\n                \nPrincipal Ian McConaghy hailed the students and said their achievements, particularly at A Level, were down to a team effort.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nAddresssing the class of 2018, he said: “To our leavers and year 14 pupils, this recognition of achievement is our chance to put you in the spotlight and say ‘well done’,‘congratulations’ and ‘best wishes’ for the next stage of your lives, to all of you.  It is right and fitting that your families join us for this occasion since achieving success in education and particularly at A level, is indeed a team effort”.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nReflecting on the examination results Mr McConaghy continued “The results this year are excellent 87% of all the grades achieved were A*-C and all subjects were passed with no fails at all. These results are a tremendous credit to everyone involved and reflect highly on the sixth from provision here in Dromore High.”\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\n“There are so many success stories I could mention, but for tremendous achievements I would highlight Zara Malcolmson and Charles Wright our top two pupils with 3 A* and 3A grades between them, but in truth I could carry on down the list to include many, many more all of whom worked really hard and succeeded. As per our ethos we value the achievements of every single pupil who has done their best, worked hard and succeeded”.\n\nMr McConaghy had a special welcome for retired teacher Miss Hazel Uprichard, a member of the Senior Leadership Team and Head of Science who retired in August after 33 years of dedicated service and loyalty to Dromore High, wishing her well for her retirement.\n\nCommenting on the make up of the school’s sixth form Mr McConaghy said “a considerable number of pupils join our sixth form from other schools.These pupils are an extremely welcome addition to our sixth form transferring typically from Rathfriland High School, and other schools in the locality. These pupils settled in Dromore High extremely well and they brought some new perspectives and a fresh balance to the sixth form.  \n\n“We are delighted they chose to study here and their results are an affirmation of their choice. Two of them were chosen as Head Prefects, Deputy Head Girl Zara Malcolmson and Deputy Head Boy David Whiteside.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nReviewing the leavers destinations,’ Mr McConaghy indicated that approximately 20% of them were going to the UK mainland to continue their third level studies with the majority choosing to go to local universities. He said degree courses being undertaken in Accounting, Agriculture, Archaeology, Business, Biomedical Science, Communication, Economics Education, Engineering, Geography, Human Nutrition, IT, International relations and politics, Law, Mathematics, Nursing, Pharmacy, Psychology and Sport.\n\nMr McConaghy added: “Six of our pupils have secured Higher Level Apprenticeships in Accounting, Mechanical Engineering and Luke Edgar secured an IT apprenticeship with worldwide multinational firm Google. He takes up his position in London this month”.\n\nHe paid tribute to the staff for their commitment in curricular and extra-curricular activities, mentioning in particular the very broad and beneficial Enrichment programme for sixth form pupils which helps prepare them for the next stage of their career. All of this helps us as we seek to continue to educate our students to look upon themselves as global, rather than as parochial, citizens, and be able to assess risk, analyse world affairs intelligently and adapt accordingly. \n\n“Additionally, into year 13 this year we have admitted almost 100 pupils which again is a most encouraging intake and a vote of confidence by the local community and those from further afield in our sixth form”.  \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nReflecting on the disappointing lack of political progress in Northern Ireland, Mr McConaghy nonetheless offered his thanks to several local politicians for their ongoing support for the school “away from the spotlight”, in particular Sir Jeffrey Donaldson who “continues to advocate strongly on our behalf concerning our critical need for a new school building and the lack of places for pupils in year 8”. Mr McConaghy urged a strengthening of political support for the needs of the school at this critical time. \n\n“It is said that ‘self-praise is no recommendation’ however I feel it is my duty to heap praise on my staff and all those involved in educating this group of leavers. This school and it’s staff does a magnicent job and I offer as evidence to support that claim this tremendous group of young adults who are a credit to themselves, their families and this school.\n\n“Finally I would say to our leavers group, we don’t wish this to be your last event with your school. Join our alumni group being set up this year by Mrs Mitchell and keep in touch. Even though your formal education here is now complete we can be of assistance to each other. Be proud of this school wherever you study and wherever you ultimately find yourselves. We remain here to help should you ever need help in any way. My sincerest best wishes to you all.”\n\nGuest speaker Miss Claire Beckett BSc reflected on her time in Dromore High which she had enjoyed tremendously. Claire had always faced the challenge of combining a love of study with a love of farming. \n\nVery early morning starts to complete her work on the family farm near Donaghcloney preceded her busy days in school before ing to the farm for more work. Claire had enjoyed both aspects of her le tremendously. Early in le she knew that she wanted to work with animals and identied a gap in the knowledge of effective nutrition for cattle. Her education had prepared her for this and she was now pursuing this through her career with her employer Trouw Nutrition.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nClaire advised the pupils to commit to the highest levels of study now even  they did not have a final destination in mind at this stage.\n\nIt was important to balance all one’s endeavours in le and realise that sometimes some things have to be sacriced for long term benefit, even  it is dficult at the time. Her advice was to “work hard at whatever is right in front of you at the time”.\n\nClaire had been influenced by a number of people in her le to good effect including her family and her teachers and she paid tribute to them. Reiterating wise words given to her that “ you enjoy your job you never work a day in your le”. She urged the pupils to work hard and pursue their dreams that they may enjoy their careers also.\n\nDuring the celebration, two musical items provided entertainment for the audience, a vocal solo by Sophie Tate accompanied by her grandfather Mr Donald McClernan on acoustic guitar, ‘Song Bird’ and a piano solo by Erin McNally entitled ‘A Steady Hand’\n\nChairman Mrs Woods thanked Claire for her inspirational speech and for presenting the certicates, prizes and cups to the recipients. Mrs Woods concluded the celebration by reiterating her pride in the pupils and the school “wishing all the pupils well on the next stage of their journey” wherever it was leading them.\n\nSEE NEXT WEEK’S LEADER FOR A PICTORIAL ROUND UP OF THE DAY.\n            \n    \n"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8630052.1536655628!/image/image.jpg","title":"final blueprints for re drawing ni s political map revealed","story":"\nThe Boundary Commission for Northern Ireland has just published its final blueprints for how the Province\u0026#8217s political map will be redrawn.\n\n                \nOne key element is that a 2016 proposal to reduce Belfast’s current four constituencies to three has been definitively scrapped.\n\n\n   \n                 \n                   \t\n      \t\t\nFinal boundary revision proposals, published by Boundary Commission NI, 10-09-18.

It’s always good craic, but our Cadets also put in some serious work, learning something new every week and stretching themselves with training that can lead to respected accreditations.  Acquiring those new skills – whether that’s a BTEC in Public Services or how to abseil off a clf – creates a real sense of achievement.  Importantly, it also gives our Cadets something signicant to put on their Personal Statements as they prepare for college or apply for their first jobs and everyone comes away feeling positive about themselves.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\n“No-one can be good at everything, but we believe that everyone can be good at something and our hugely committed Adult Instructors make sure that every one of the Cadets under their care has the encouragement and opportunity to shine.”\n\nTeens from Cadet Detachments across County Antrim are already getting behind the membership campaign, preparing to welcome newcomers. \n\nCadet Sergeant Yasmin Andrews, who currently serves as her Majesty’s Lord Lieutenant’s Cadet for the County of Antrim, says, “We all know how much you can get out of being a Cadet, but we also know that it can be awkward to walk into somewhere new, knowing no-one.  Hopefully anyone coming along to check out our Detachment will see how friendly we all are and will feel welcome. … it’s up to us to persuade them to give Cadets a try!\n\n“We get to do the sort of outdoor stuff that can cost a fortune  you try to go it alone - mountain biking, climbing, marksmanship, abseiling and kayaking, plus we can do the Duke of Edinburgh Awards, work towards BTECs and we get the chance to go on Camp every year. \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nDromore Cadet Daniel Hooke agrees.  He says, “There’s so much happening that there really is something for everyone.  Most people find something they really enjoy and do well at but, even  you aren’t great at a particular activity, it’s always good craic having a go!”\n\nColonel McCammond adds, “Parents naturally want to give their children as many opportunities as possible but there have to be limits to withdrawals from the Bank of Mum \u0026amp Dad!  A key benefit of the cadet movement therefore is that all our activities are affordable or, even better, totally free … even the unorms are free all kids pay for is their footwear.\n\n“Cadet membership is open to boys and girls from age 12 to 18 and, right now, local Detachments are encouraging potential new members to come along and see for themselves what the Cadet movement has to offer. The earlier you join the more time you have to fit in all the experiences, but people shouldn’t be put off by the idea that they’ve maybe left it too late.

Certainly, for most people, there will be a Detachment within easy reach, and we are hoping that we’ll see plenty of potential new members coming along to check us out, without any obligation to make a commitment. \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n“Mums and dads are welcome to come along too, to see what the kids are getting involved with … and we’re hopeful that we may even be able to persuade some intrepid parents to consider working with us as Adult Volunteers!

mary s say goodbye to mr timothy doyle","story":"\nSt Mary\u0026#8217s Primary School, Banbridge, was shocked and saddened by the sudden passing of their much esteemed colleague and friend, Mr Timothy Doyle. \n\n                \nTimothy dedicated 30 years of his le to the teaching profession and shared his expertise and knowledge with pupils, teachers and parents.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nHe had a passion for Mathematics and imparted a love of this subject to all who had the privilege of knowing him. It was this love of numeracy that led Timothy to establish Maths Improvement NI, a programme to support good practice in the teaching of maths. This was disseminated throughout schools in Northern Ireland with great success.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nTimothy had a love for children and had their best interests at heart. He was able to engage easily with his pupils and use his talents to help them reach their potential. His sense of humour and fun was shared and enjoyed by the children of St Mary’s. Timothy instilled in his pupils many of the values that he held dear respect, good manners, fairness, courtesy and decency, to name a few!\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nTimothy was an avid supporter of Gaelic Games. He was an enthusiastic GAA coach in St Mary’s and loved the success his teams achieved at school and county level. Alongside Clann Na Banna, he established the “Gaelic League” in 1991 and its legacy continues today. Due to his influence and encouragement, many were attracted to Gaelic games, who otherwise may not have been.\n\nTimothy left a lasting impression upon all those who made his acquaintance, in both his personal and professional le. He was a true gentleman with a kind and caring heart and had the talent of making others feel at ease. Timothy made time for everyone and was undoubtedly the ‘le and soul’ of many a school outing and staff celebration. His presence will be greatly missed. His colleagues and friends cherish fond memories of the ‘yarns’ and ‘craic’ they shared. He was an inspiration to everyone and the school feels truly blessed to have know him: ‘You will be forever in our hearts.’ \n\n“He kept at true good humour’s mark, the social flow of pleasure’s tide. He never made a brow look dark, nor caused a tear, but when he died.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n            \n    \n"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"celebrating irish language","story":"\n\nNOMINATIONS\n are still open for The Outstanding Contribution to the Irish Language Award in this year’s Aisling Awards.\n\nThis award celebrates the vibrancy and uniqueness which the Irish language brings to the city of Belfast, the award will honour an organisation or person who works tirelessly to pioneer the language.

It is not some form of charity or a handout, it is a right for all those who need it.”\n\nJohn says he is aware that his friend’s predicament is not an isolated case and so he feels it is time that some form of independent review was instigated to ascertain just how many people who were in receipt of DLA have been refused PIP, and also  awarded PIP, how many were given a lower rate of benefit than before.  \n\nHe said: “My friend only discovered that the medical professional approved an award of PIP for her only for another unknown inidual to intervene and essentially overrule the medical professional’s decision by submitting a request under the Freedom of Information Act 2000 for copies of all papers associated with claim for PIP.  \n\n“Had she not done this then, presumably like many others, she may have just let it go as an appeal is not only time consuming, but also extremely stressful.”\n\nPeople Before Profit MLA Gerry Carroll said: “Once again we have another person applying for PIP who has been failed by the system. \n\nThe criteria for PIP is already strict and made extremely dficult for people to obtain. However the fact that this applicant initially met the criteria which was then overturned is very worrying. How many other people have been placed in this situation?\n\n“This latest case is a further example of how medical evidence is not prioritised when assessing people\u0026#8217s disability. We have heard time and again how medical evidence was not asked for in PIP cases. \n\nThis latest case once again proves how the system is not fit for purpose. It needs a complete overhaul and we need a welfare system that doesn’t punish those who are entitled to benefits.” \n\nA Department for Communities spokesperson said: “All PIP assessment reports go through a quality checking regime designed to ensure that decisions on entitlement, taken by the Department are correct. At times this may lead to an initial report being amended with the points increased or decreased. The checking process provides assurance that any approach to assessment is consistent so that customers with conditions that have the same al effect will ultimately receive the same benefit outcome. \n\n“Anyone who doesn’t agree with Department’s decision, can ask for it to be reviewed and provide any additional information. \n\n“There is then also the opportunity to appeal to an Independent Tribunal. Measures are currently in place to support people who are financially worse off following reassessment from DLA to PIP whilst they appeal to the Independent Tribunal.”\n"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"the community group that took on a giant","story":"\n\nMONEY\n breeds power, or so the idiom goes, but five years ago when plans were revealed for a quarter-billion pound waste incinerator in Glengormley, it sparked a grassroots community campaign that would go on to take on big capital and even the government.\nThe NoArc21 campaign started when a small group of concerned residents called a public meeting to voice their concerns about Becon Consortium’s plans to build an incinerator near homes on the Hightown Road.\nVice-chair of NoArc21, Charlie Thompson, said the danger posed by the incinerator and the anger caused by it was enough to mobilise the community.\n“The anger was bad because at that stage there was problems with the dump in Mallusk and the smells coming from the incinerator down there,” he said.\n“This area was very much seen as a dumping ground. It was like we were living in the middle of a tip. The actual incinerator would be right outside my windows. I would be looking at it every day  it was to go ahead.\n“We were told lies about the size of it too. We were told it would be all hidden and that we wouldn’t even notice it. This thing is going to be the size of Wembley Stadium or Croke Park and it’s supposed to be less than a half a mile from my front windows – I think I would see the thing.\n“I was very angry at the size and scale of it, but there is evidence out there now that these things cause cancer. The size can’t be underestimated either – it will be the single biggest freestanding building in Northern Ireland.\n“It will have a chimney stack that’s over 90 metres long. The evidence all says anyone living up to a kilometre-and-a-half away will be those worse affected. This thing is going to be pouring toxins over my family, my neighbours and everybody within a kilometre at best, but at worse the catchment area could be 15k. Almost all of the Belfast basin will be inhaling this and it’s already one of the most polluted cities in Europe, in terms of air pollution. This is just going to make it worse.”\nHe continued: “As soon as I got involved there was a small committee set up and we identied all the problems that could be associated with it.\n“After the waste is burned there is a substance left over called fly-ash, which is extremely toxic. If any of the lorries carrying it were involved in an accident, and this is a busy road, then all of that would be released into the air.\n“This is in an expanding residential area. The impact on that is huge.\n“We have evidence as well that it would reduce house prices. We estimated that it would reduce house prices by ten to 20 per cent, but we now have people who have come forward who can’t get a mortgage on their homes because there is a negative equity risk.\n“The evidence is very, very clear this causes lung infections, cancers, and lung conditions. While the incinerator complies with existing legal policies and regulations, they have never ever said it was safe.\n“Any opportunity I have had with Arc21 I have asked them  they could stand up in front of the public and say that the facility is safe. They have never said that – they have said it complies with existing policies and regulations, but those are already out of date, and are being reviewed as we speak.”\nWhile the anger amongst residents was palpable during the foundation of the NoArc21 campaign, Charlie said that channelling those energies and sustaining the group has been “extremely tough”.\n“Because of the threat it was easy at times to get people on board, but the issue is sustaining the campaign,” he explained.\n“We had a problem with apathy. When Mark H Durkan was environment minister he shot dead the application, and people thought it was dead in the water. We then had to go to the Planning Appeals Commission and we lost.\n“That said, in the history of Northern Ireland this has had the most objections to any planning application – over 4,000 people have gone to the trouble of submitting an objection.\n“The other thing that has helped us is that we are cross-community. We have been approached by all parties who have offered us assistance, but we have been very careful that we don’t side with one over another. Our group is mixed in terms of background. It doesn’t just impact on any one side of the community. This has been key to us.\n“We have secured funding through online crowdfunding, and people have been very good on that, people have thrown money in buckets for us – it all helps.”\nBy being able to recruit a legal team, NoArc21 were able to challenge the legality of the decision to grant planning permission for the incinerator earlier this year. The High Court ruled the Department for Infrastructure did not have the authority to grant permission in the absence of a minister. Charlie said that the group were “happy and shocked” by the decision, but said that they still might have a fight on their hands.\n“We’re a small community group, so this is all new to us,” he stated.\n“We didn’t think for a minute that we would win – we were hoping that we would win and we were fighting from every angle. We pulled in experts who were offering free advice and services.\n“When we heard the High Court Ruling we were delighted. We had a very strong legal team, but we were still very surprised. We always knew that this facility was wrong in this area.\n“Fighting it legally for us was a big challenge for us and we may have to do it again. The Department for Infrastructure won’t appeal, but the Attorney General submitted a series of questions that could affect the High Court decision.\n“I’m not going to say that we didn’t expect the decision to have huge ramications, but we didn’t think that it would stall the governing of Northern Ireland. There are so many things that are held up because of this. With the Attorney General submitting those questions, there’s a chance that this will go to the Supreme Court in London, and that’s something that we have to prepare for.”\nHe added: “We are optimistic, however,  we lose on one issue this could be enough to put this back to a decision for a minister to take, whether that be a direct rule minister, or  Stormont is back up and running.”\n"},{"url":null,"title":"ballymurphy massacre documentary maker macrae defends film as providing balance to false official narrative","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Le\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLe\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Le\n\n\n\nSeptember 2018\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide 2018-2019\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

They included a priest attending to those wounded and a mother of eight.\n\nIn the documentary it heard how that mother, Joan Connolly, lay crying on the ground until she passed away.\n\nAnother man died of a heart attack following an alleged violent confrontation with the troops in the estate.\n\nThe shootings took place as the Army moved in to republican strongholds to arrest IRA suspects in the wake of the introduction of the controversial policy of internment without trial.\n\nSoldiers have long been held responsible for killing the 10 people in Ballymurphy but the accepted narrative became clouded earlier this year when former UVF members came forward to claim their organisation was also involved.\n\nInquests into the deaths are due to open in November.\n\n\n \nDate set for new inquest into Ballymurphy massacre\n \n\n\nFilmmaker Callum Macrae, rejected criticism the piece did not tell \"the whole story\" in that it did not go into the context of the major gun battles around the time or give the \"full context\" about the actions of paramilitaries including the IRA at the time.\n\nHe said: \"The description - which is widely held by people in the UK - that Protestants and Catholics were at each others throats, the Provisional IRA was an incredibly dangerous force rushing around killing people and the British Army was sent in as the patsies, the guys in the middle, trying to restore order and peace - that is the official narrative, it is accepted by almost everybody in Britain - and it is simply not true.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBelfast IRA men with a drogue bomb in 1987\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"When I tell people the Provisional IRA did not exist until several months after the Army arrived, they are astonished. Because there is a false narrative. \n\n\"So to describe what I am doing as some kind of false unbalanced narrative is just simply wrong.\n\n\"My film actually is the balance to the official narrative which is fundamentally wrong.\"\n\nMr Macrae said \"of course the IRA\" were active at the time of the Ballymurphy massacre. \n\n\"The British Army described very clearly a \u0027major gun battle\u0027, with upwards of 700 rounds being fired at soldiers. The Army, specically in a statement to the Belfast , claimed there were 20 gunmen coming down from the top of the hill onto the Whiterock Road and the Army fought a two-hour battle involving Thompson sub-machine guns, pistols and rles.\"\n\nHe said the reports from the time - based on what the British Army had said happened - although \"well-intentioned\" were \"transparently untrue\".\n\n\"They talk about wiping out a \u0027hardcore IRA unit\u0027,\" he went on.\n\n\"Now I have been looking into this for four years and there is not a shred of credible evidence I can find to say any of that is true.\"\n\nHe added: \"Let me be clear - I am no apologist for the IRA. \n\n\"No one can say there was no IRA present - I am certainly not saying that. \n\n\"What we can say for sure is no one can say for certain there were no armed paramilitaries present. And we do mention the UVF claim.\n\n\"We said most of the IRA had been tipped off and most of their members had left, that\u0027s what the IRA claimed.\"\n\nQuoting Gerry Adams who claimed a \"small number\" of IRA remained to offer \"token resistance\", Mr Mccrae said there were no guns found, ammunition or shells and two of those killed had been shot in the back.\n\n\"Not for a second do I deny the IRA were there,\" he added.\n\n\"What the army claim is \u0027a large number of IRA were involved with sub machine guns\u0027. I have looked very hard for four years and can not find evidence of it. \n\n\"Nonetheless - even though I can\u0027t find evidence of it, does not mean it didn\u0027t happen.\"\n"},{"url":null,"title":"former northern ireland army base to be considered for sale","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Le\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLe\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Le\n\n\n\nSeptember 2018\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide 2018-2019\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

A2, for which Department for Infrastructure  has published road upgrade proposals, the presence of Catalyst Inc, which has sought planning permission for a second building, and an impressive river

shipbuilding from 1912 and became a Royal Navy base in 1941 for ship repairs.\n\nIt was also used as an Army base from 1971 to 2000 before being purchased in 2005 by the Department for Social

and says the Syrian government has the right to retake control of it. \n\nTurkey has appealed to Russia and Iran, its negotiating partners, for a diplomatic resolution to the explosive situation.\n\nAt the same time, it has sent reinforcements to its troops ringing Idlib, a move designed to ward off a ground assault, at least for now.\n\nMr Putin told Mr Erdogan in opening remarks carried by Russian news agencies that they will be “looking for solutions where there are none right now”, without mentioning Idlib by name.\n\nMr Erdogan in his reply expressed hope that the joint statement that the two leaders are expected to make later on will be “a new hope for the whole region”.\n\nIdlib and surrounding areas is home to more than three million Syrians, and an estimated

concerns that the local area is shouldering the ‘bulk’ of responsibility in terms of renewable energy.\n\nThe application was for the construction of two turbines at the existing Monnaboy Wind farm, which currently contains four wind turbines after planning permission was granted on October 4, 2012.\n\nThe location of Monnaboy Wind Farm is on land located east of 62 Monnaboy Road in Greysteel and the applicant is Gaelectric Developments Ltd.\n\nAn application was previously deferred for reconsideration following severe flooding in the Eglinton area event in August 2017.\n\nIt came before a meeting of Derry City and Strabane District Council’s Planning Committee earlier this year, where voted not to accept the recommendation to approve the application due to fears over the impact it would have on the character of the surrounding landscape.\n\nThe application was discussed again at the September meeting of the Planning Committee, held in the Guildhall, which was told that 82 letters of objection had been submitted in relation to the proposal. \n\nSome of the main areas of concern are, public health implications, the impact on wildle, natural habitats, landscape quality and heritage sites.\n\nAt the meeting, an objector was given the opportunity to address the committee, telling the councillors that the current turbines are already ‘overbearing’ and there is ‘constant noise’ which would ‘increase’  two turbines were added.\n\n\n\n        googletag.cmd.push                 .addSize                .addSize                .build            slot =

there is ‘no relief at night time’ and people living within a 20km radius have to deal with a ‘constant flickering of lights’ which has forced residents to grow hedges higher to ‘reduce noise’ and the ‘visual impact’.\n\nIn her view, the wind turbines were ‘eroding the character’ of the area and she believed residents should have the same rights as other ‘country dwellers’.\n\nThe turbines were not required to meet any renewable energy targets, she added, and the Derry City and Strabane District Council area was ‘carrying the full burden’ in comparison to neighbouring council areas.\n\nCommenting, Sinn Féin councillor Kieran McGuire said Derry City and Strabane District Council has been carrying the ‘bulk’ of responsibility in terms of meeting targets when other council areas are ‘not doing anything’.\n\nHe proposed refusing the application which was seconded by his party colleague Christopher Jackson.\n\nAnother Sinn Féin Councillor, Dan Kelly, also said the figures were ‘alarming’ and that this council area was ‘leading the way’.\n\nHe believed that  the council had been performing poorly it would’ve been ‘splashed over the front page of papers’.\n\nThe proposal to refuse the application was supported by the majority of councillors.\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"bishop derry announces number clerical changes derry diocese","story":"\nThe Bishop of Derry, Dr

overturn a planning decision which would have seen the owners of a restaurant in the city centre banned from erecting a shelter at the front of the premises.\n\nThe application came before the September meeting of Derry City and Strabane District Council’s Planning Committee seeking approval for the installation of three external retractable awnings to part of the front façade of the Custom House building at Custom House Street in Derry, pictured above.\n\nSpeaking at the meeting, a planning officer said that advice had been received from the Historic Environment Division  that the installation would have an ‘adverse affect’ on a number of listed buildings within the area, including Custom House, the Harbour Commissioners Office, Harbour Square and The Guildhall.\n\nThe meeting was told that the HED were of the opinion that the proposal would result in ‘unnecessary damage’ to the historic structure. \n\nThe officer added that while the plans before them had been amended from a previous application, the awnings would still ‘obscure the windows to a certain extent and remain inappropriate on a building of this style and character’.\n\nThe meeting head that a precedent had been set by the nearby Guildhall Taphouse bar, formerly the Monico Bar, another listed building which mow has an awning over a seated area.\n\nHowever, the Historic Environment Division said the building was ‘of a dferent style’.\n\nThe planning officer advised local councillors refuse the application on grounds that the proposal is ‘unacceptable’ as it would have an adverse effect on the character of Custom House and the setting of the surrounding listed buildings.\n\nThe meeting then heard from a representative of the applicant, Kular Fashions, who said that the contractor chosen to carry out the work are the ‘best in the UK’ and would carry out the work in a ‘delicate’ manner which would have ‘no impact on the structure itself’.\n\nHe added that the awning would bring ‘le and people’ into the space and said buildings are ‘not antiques’ and should be ‘inhabitable’ whether it is sunny or raining.\n\n\n\n        googletag.cmd.push                 .addSize

of buildings in the area and she didn’t want to interfere with their architectural integrity.\n\nCouncillor Dan Kelly, of Sinn Féin, said the awnings would provide shelter for street entertainment and believed that tables on the streets was part of the ‘direction of travel’ in the city. \n\nHead of Planning with council, Maura Fox, said it is a ‘balancing act’ and she was ‘very much in favour of retaining listed buildings’. \n\nSDLP councillor Tina Gardiner said she would be supportive of the awning  it was ‘tasteful’ and made reference to their widespread use on historic buildings in London. \n\nUsing the Guildhall Taphouse as an example, she said it made the space visible and attracts ‘le and vitality’.\n\nMeanwhile, Sinn Féin Cllr Patricia Logue said, the buildings may become ‘vacant and derelict’, but agreed that they should contain ‘no advertising’. \n\nHowever, the SDLP’s Gus Hastings believed awnings didn’t serve much purpose and would only encourage ‘outside smoking’ and therefore wouldn’t be supporting it.\n\nEleven councillors voted in favour of the awnings and two against, meaning the advice of planning officers was ‘overturned’.\n\nThe meeting was told that the matter would come back before the council next month.\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"plans new museum derry building used local irish republican group","story":"\nA building in Derry’s city centre which

Bredagh cruised to a 3-9 to 1-7 win over Annaclone and Saul upset the odds with a sensational 1-15 to 1-6 win over a fancied Ballymartin outfit in Newcastle.\u0026nbsp\n\nThe JFC semi-finals draw was also made on Monday night and sees Ardglass take on Teconnaught, with Aughlisnafin facing the winners of tonight\u0026rsquos replay between Kilclief and Aghaderg in Castlewellan.\n\nArdglass displayed a great tactical awareness to get the better of Dromara on a 2-7 to 0-11 scoreline at Drumaness on Saturday and Teconnaught beat St Paul\u0026rsquos 3-16 to 0-11 after they produced a storming second half performance.\n\nAughlisnafin, as expected, edged out Newry Mitchels 1-13 to 2-7 at a wet and windy Mayobridge on Monday night and they will most certainly fancy their chances against either Kilclief or Aghaderg.

While the move has been welcomed by the SDLP, it has been criticised by the DUP.\n\nThe current Strangford Westminster constituency is to be broken up and renamed Mid Down, covering an area stretching from Banbridge to Newtownards which will have an electorate of almost 77,800.\n\nPortaferry and a large part of the Ards peninsula, also currently in Strangford, will move into North Down.\u0026nbsp\n\nThe new Mid Down constituency will also include part of the current Lagan Valley constituency which is to become defunct under the revised proposals.\n\nIn addition to the transfer of the Killyleagh area into South Down, plans to move the Crossgar area from the constituency into Strangford have been aborted, while it is proposed to move Loughbrickland into South Down from Lagan Valley.\n\nThe new plan illustrates how Northern Ireland\u0026rsquos political borders could look like in years to come and there has been a mixed political reaction to moving Killyleagh back into South Down and retaining Crossgar in the constituency.\n\nRowallane councillor Billy Walker believes people in Killyleagh will be \u0026ldquounhappy about plans to move the area into South Down which is currently represented by Sinn Fein MP Chris Hazzard who does not take his seat at Westminster.\n\n\u0026ldquoCurrent Strangford MP Jim Shannon is recognised as one of the hardest working MPs at Westminster and while there are plans to create a new Mid Down constituency, I have no doubt the overwhelming majority of people in the Killyleagh area want to be represented at the heart of government in London by an MP who takes his seat, he said.\n\n\u0026ldquoBallynahinch, Saintfield, Killyleagh, Derryboye and Kilmore and part of Crossgar are currently in Strangford and I have no doubt voters in these areas will want to be part of the new Mid Down constituency. From my point of view, I would like to see all of Crossgar in it.\n\nCllr Walker said he hopes the proposed boundary changes will not be rubber stamped, suggesting there is not an appetite for change among people in Killyleagh to move back into South Down.\n\nBut former South Down MP Margaret Ritchie, believes the retention of Crossgar in South Down and the plan to reinstate Killyleagh in the constituency is welcome.\n\n\u0026ldquoIt would appear that the integrity of the historic constituency of South Down has remained intact with the addition of Loughbrickland on the western flank. However, it would appear that the Boundary Commission has been listening to submissions made at their inquiries and has retained Crossgar within the historic boundary, she continued.\n\n\u0026ldquoAn interesting feature has been the addition of the Killyleagh electoral ward which was removed from the constituency about 22 years ago. If this is the case, then this is a welcome move in that it would reinstate historic social, trading, cultural, economic and educational ties within the South Down constituency.\n\nThe former MP argued the plan to retain Crossgar in South Down and reinstate Killyleagh in the constituency ensures that the existing economic, educational, health, social, parish, and transport ties that exist and will continue.\n\nMiss Ritchie added: \u0026ldquoThe recommendations ensure that the local population has a defined identity within the new constituency of South Down providing that greater level of homogeneity.\n\n\u0026ldquoSuch proposals would ensure that communities in Crossgar and Killyleagh can identy with their neighbours in Lecale and Downpatrick with whom they have had strong trading, health and economic links for many decades.\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t.ready.prettyPhoto\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Classy Kilcoo cruise through to last four  ","story":"\t\t\t\nKILCOO flexed their considerable muscle to send Downpatrick spiralling out of the SFC quarter-finals at St Patrick\u0026rsquos Park, Newcastle, on Saturday night.\n\nApart from a promising opening 15 minutes from Downpatrick, it really was all Kilcoo and two goals in eight minutes at the start of the second half put this tie to bed.\n\nThe influential Paul Devlin gave Kilcoo a third minute lead before Conor McGrady cancelled that score with a point for Downpatrick.

It also provided an opportunity to maximise the natural resources of Portaferry by creating a space to access the outdoor recreational infrastructure with a particular focus on maritime activity.\n\nThe project began in 2017 when, after a seven-year search for ideas and funding, the sailing club was successful in getting permission to develop a semi-derelict building adjoining its premises.\n\nTo develop and manage the property, the club formed Portaferry Community Services Ltd.\u0026nbsp Renovation work on the Hub was finally completed in April this year.\u0026nbsp\n\nFunding came from a number of sources including Portaferry Regeneration Ltd through their Heritage Lottery\u0026rsquos Townscape Heritage Initiative, Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs, the Rural Development Programme, the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development, Leader, Rural Partners Ards and North Down, Ards and North Down Borough Council, The Coastal Communities Fund and Portaferry Sailing Club.\n\nPrincess Anne was welcomed on Wednesday morning by Mr Leonard Lawson, Director of Portaferry Community Services Ltd, who managed the Hub project, and Mr John McAlea, commodore of Portaferry Sailing Club.\n\nThanking Princess Anne, Mr Leonard paid tribute to all of the people who brought the project to a successful fruition, including the architect, contractor, consultants, ious funders and user groups, as well as the sailing club and its voluntary workforce.\n\nHe said the club had the \u0026ldquovision and courage to invest in this project and risk going ahead with such a large scheme and had trusted him to manage the project.\n\n\u0026ldquoPeople don\u0026rsquot realise that when groups within communities create these schemes they are depending on vast amounts of voluntary input in terms of time and commitment, Mr Lawson remarked.\n\n\u0026ldquoI would like to thank each and everyone one of you for the support and co-operation that has made this project possible.\n\n\u0026ldquoIt is incredible that It takes all this number of people, the thousands of emails, countless meetings, official forms, letters and telephone calls to bring this about.

Their journey will taken over four months and will be fraught with danger from disease, crocodiles, swamps and fast-flowing rapids.\n\nNo-one has ever canoed over such a long stretch of the Nile and Marcus admits that their trip will not be easy. \u0026ldquoIt is a little frightening even thinking about it, but I am looking forward to it immensely, he said.\n\nMarcus is now living in Liverpool where he studied at the local university, and has been planning the expedition for the past two years.\n\nAfter travelling to the Ugandan border the eight will head north down the river through Sudan and Egypt. It is a journey which will take them through the Sudd \u0026mdash probably the world\u0026rsquos largest swamp \u0026mdash and through the foaming Nile cataracts.\n\nMarcus began canoeing at Ardnabannon Outdoor Pursuits Centre outside Castlewellan, but only took up the sport seriously at university.\n\n\u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquove never tackled anything as formidable as the Nile before, he said. \u0026ldquoPerhaps one of the hardest things has been trying to arrange sponsorship. We have each spent months writing letters to ious firms asking them for equipment. The cost of the trip will be around \u0026pound8,000.\n\nThe group are disappointed that they will not be able to travel over the complete  of the Nile because of the situation in Uganda, which has made it too dangerous to start at the head waters.\n\nHowever, they will still have the satisfaction of travelling over much of the ground covered by the Victorian explorers who struggled for decades to trace the Nile\u0026rsquos source.\n\nARDGLASS \u0026mdash A \u0026pound28,000 scheme to deepen the harbour at Ardglass will begin within the next two weeks. Already a huge dredger has been brought to the site and a few explanatory digs have been made.\n\nThe work, when completed early in the new year, will allow fishing boats to land their catches alongside the market. At present it is impossible for the boats to unload their catches at the fish market during low tide.\n\nWith only some three feet of water modern day trawlers are just too big to lie in the harbour without bumping the bottom. The new scheme will aim at providing approximately ten feet of water at low tide, thus enabling the biggest of the boats to unload at the fish market.\n\nUntil then the boats will have to follow their usual and unsatisfactory custom of unloading at the main pier and having their catch transported by trucks to the market.\n\nNot since 1940 had dredging been carried out at Ardglass and the work will go a long way towards restoring Ardglass as a major fishing port.\n\nSTRANGFORD LOUGH \u0026mdash A secret experiment on Strangford Lough has helped scientists towards a major breakthrough in a three-year battle to harness wave energy as a source of power.\n\nResearch at Queen\u0026rsquos University in Belfast has now produced a revolutionary type of ocean buoy which could supply enough electricity for a town of 15,000 people. A chain or such buoys off our coast could one day be one of our main sources of power.\n\nDetails of the exciting new scheme were only released yesterday, though the Strangford Lough experiment took place almost a year ago. It was that small-scale which gave the scientists enough information to produce a design for a full-scale device.\n\nFour or five similar experiments are currently being considered by the Department of Energy in Britain for use in a wave energy programme and researchers at Queen\u0026rsquos are hoping their buoy will be one of those chosen.\n\nPORTAFERRY \u0026mdash The beautul peninsular town of Portaferry has been chosen for a major award in the Central Gardens Association Best Kept Villages and Towns competition for 1978.\n\nThe Association awarded Portaferry the title of \u0026lsquothe small town showing most improvement\u0026rsquo for its landscaping and environmental quality.\n\nCOMBER \u0026mdash News that a proposed sheltered housing scheme for Comber has been axed by the planners brought an angry reaction from local councillors this week.\n\nArds Borough councillors were told that a planning application from the Fold Housing Association for a housing scheme for the elderly in Castle Street had been refused on several grounds.\n\nComber councillor John Shields said: \u0026ldquoIt is this ridiculous that this application has been turned down. I think every effort should be made to accommodate the old people in the area.\n\nA planning official, Mr Des Stevens, said that the main objections had been that the department was not prepared to locate old people in an area where there was industrial development and also that there would be a problem of providing access for a housing scheme.\n\nDOWNPATRICK \u0026mdash Tote betting s to Downpatrick racecourse for the first time in eight years at the end of the month.

His greeting at a youth Mass in Galway where he declared \u0026lsquoyoung people of Ireland, I love you\u0026rsquo became a stand out moment, replayed on television on countless occasions since. My own childhood involved attending Mass at the Graan and serving as an altar boy in St Michael\u0026rsquos Church in Enniskillen with many of my primary school classmates. We were lucky too that for much of my childhood our pastoral leadership was led by Father Brian D\u0026rsquoArcy who preached a message of tolerance, ersity in the church, compassion for the complexities of le and the experiences that shape them. Even when a stream of disturbing disclosures arose that challenged the Church and its response to clerical abuse and coverup, Father Brian\u0026rsquos consistently strong and unequivocal demand for accountability, truth, justice and recovery for victims offered a pathway for the institutional church to remain connected with its members.\n  My own le journey took me to Dublin in 1999 and what I discovered very quickly was that the message of compassion, openness and truth that I had faithfully followed and listened to every Sunday did not reflect the views and actions of the hierarchy either in Ireland or in the Vatican. Like many people of faith I found this not just challenging but chilling.\u0026nbsp\n  As I embarked on a legal career in human rights law I spent many days hearing story after story of adults recalling their experiences of abuse and brutal actions at the hands of clergy and lay people at the Residential Institutions Redress Board.\u0026nbsp\n  Those stories will never leave me. Sine then, the full impact of church and state abuse has come through my office door clerical sexual abuse, church authority cover ups, Magdalene laundries, the cruel operation of mother and baby homes, where many single mothers lost their babies to a regime of illegal adoptions and told they had committed a mortal sin. We have been witness to church intolerance towards lone parents, women, advocates of shared education, access to certain healthcare services, separated couples and the LGBT community.\n  And so when I was given a ticket to the Pope\u0026rsquos Mass last weekend I thought long and hard about attending. I could see that for many people of faith this was an opportunity to gather as a church community and celebrate their faith, their God and their Christianity.\u0026nbsp\n  On the other hand I could see that for many victims of the Church the Pope\u0026rsquos visit resurrected those deep seated and enduring feelings of hurt, trauma and damage that has never been properly addressed with actions.\u0026nbsp\n  So many victims have said to me that the abuse itself is not nearly as bad as the culture of cover up, the systemic efforts to sideline and disbelieve victims, to hide evidence and wrongdoers from a process that would lead to truth, justice and love for the victim and their families.\u0026nbsp\n  So I ended up last Sunday foregoing the papal Mass and standing for truth with nearly 10,000 other citizens in Dublin City Centre. It was a personal choice. I am glad now I made that choice. I am sad that the Vatican and the leadership of the Church still don\u0026rsquot get it. Still don\u0026rsquot acknowledge that abuse wasn\u0026rsquot simply perpetrated on children by inidual wrongdoers but that their many violations were facilitated, covered up and enabled by Bishops, Archbishops and Cardinals all the way to the Vatican.\n  Ireland has changed utterly since 1979. It is reflected in all the societal changes that have taken place in the last thirty nine years. It is reflected in the fact that the people of Dublin were much more interested and welcoming of the Queen than the Pope.\u0026nbsp\n  It turns out that Pope John Paul was wrong when he said back in 1979 that he loved the young people of Ireland. The Church showed anything but love to all those they have hurt and damaged.\u0026nbsp\n  They have even now showed a lamentable lack of capacity to lead, to acknowledge, to take ownership of their failings and to take actions rather than deliver honeyed words. This visit was a massive opportunity to reverse the damage caused. The opportunity has been missed.\n                                    \n                \n                \n                \n                    \nThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisation\u0027s Editors\u0027 Code of Practice.

The milk botting plant began when his father began with a horse and cart. Now the business has a fleet of vans distributing milk and dairy produces to customers in four counties. However their products are supplied to customers across Ireland through the Henderson Food Service and other companies.\n  The borehole gives Draynes Farm a constant supply of water which is also useful to soften the mains water for washing.\n  A 50KVA solar panel plant has been installed on the roofs of some of the buildings.\n  Draynes Farm processes 5m litres of milk per year and operates Monday to Friday with their own supply of 1.2 million litres of farm milk held over the weekend until the beginning of a new week.

      \nDecontamination work on the riverfront site is expected to be completed by the end of the year, owners the Department for Communities said.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nExpressions of interest are being sought from developers to clary the private sector\u0027s appetite for investment.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nThe 15-acre site has already received outline planning permission.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nProperty consultants Lisney have been appointed to manage the process over the next eight weeks.\n\nDamian Mulholland, director of the Department\u0027s North West Development Office said: \"With the remediation of Fort George under way, the department is now moving to test the nature and scale of market interest in the site.\n\n\"Given its strategic location adjacent to the A2, for which Department for Infrastructure  has published road upgrade proposals, the presence of Catalyst Inc, which has sought planning permission for a second building, and an impressive river frontage, we believe the site is ideally placed to deliver lasting social and economic benefits for the city.\n\n\"We look forward to receiving suitably ambitious proposals to realise that potential.\"\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nIn the case of a positive response, the Department will then proceed with a full marketing exercise to select a purchaser.\n\nThe creation of jobs is a key priority for the department in regenerating the site.\n\nThe proposals received will be assessed against criteria including job creation.\n\nFort George was associated with shipbuilding from 1912 and became a Royal Navy base in 1941 for ship repairs.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nIt was also used as an Army base from 1971 to 2000 before being purchased in 2005 by the Department for Social Development.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n            \n    \n    try   catch     \n        \n\n

Given the anxiety out there at the moment amongst the business, community and voluntary sectors could they not have hosted engagement sessions to try and allay fears? Perhaps they could have commissioned academic research to broaden knowledge of the expected impacts and options available?\u0026#8221\n            \n                                      \t
