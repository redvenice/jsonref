She said she was married but \u0027amicably separated\u0027 and insisted that, as her \u0027wealthy boyfriend\u0027, Mr Kooter gave her most of the money to support their \u0027expensive, luxurious lifestyle\u0027 together.But Judge Cavanagh told her to pay the money back. He pointed out that a screenshot of her Tinder profile from February 2017 \u0027stated on that profile that she was employed by Citibank\u0027 and she also signed off emails \u0027Manuela Radeva, Capital Investment Manager\u0027.There were numerous emails detailing \u0027the process of making arrangements for Mr Kooter to make investments with Ms Radeva,\u0027 he added.At one point in the emails, Mr Kooter had expressed nervousness at what he was doing, saying: \u0027Just putting a large amount of money into your bank account seems a bit reckless.\u0027Ms Radeva replied: \u0027Don\u0027t worry about this - you can trust me completely.\u0027Judge Victoria McCloud has now ordered Ms Radeva to pay the rest of Mr Kooter\u0027s court costs, a bill which could reach £100,000. The judge said she must pay the first £50,000 by July 31 this year.The judge ordered that Mr Kooter\u0027s outstanding claim against Ms Radeva for 36,000 euros be \u0027discontinued\u0027, after his barrister, Kamen Shoylev, told the judge that he now wants to drop it rather than fighting out another trial.The judge also ordered Ms Radeva\u0027s £9,950 counterclaim against her ex to be stayed and dismissed unless she applies to lift the stay.But the judge said she had received a letter from Ms Radeva \u0027talking about her bankruptcy\u0027 and commented: \u0027This is a bankruptcy which came on after the judgement against her.\u0027Mr Shoylev told the judge: \u0027Mr Kooter is very likely to be applying to set aside the bankruptcy.\u0027He added outside court: \u0027It is a matter of public record that Ms Radeva is now bankrupt. It is possible that if the bankruptcy is not set aside, she may get away without paying anything.\u0027Mr Kooter has an application pending to set aside the bankruptcy in the High Court.\u0027The court heard during the trial in February that the couple enjoyed a \u0027lavish lifestyle\u0027 together, despite their short association, enjoying skiing holidays and stays in expensive hotels.Mr Kooter splashed thousands on gifts, including designer luggage and a Chanel handbag and purse for his new lover, the court heard, as well as paying out for their \u0027hotel and bar expenses\u0027.But after they split up, he demanded back the £182,000, plus another €36,000 he says he lent her.But Michael Collard, for Ms Radeva, claimed the payments were part-and-parcel of their lavish \u0027domestic expenses as a couple\u0027 and that Ms Radeva should not be made to reimburse him.\u0027This was a man on a very high income in what was clearly a serious relationship. They were living together,\u0027 he said.\u0027This was a relationship with lots of kisses. It was not a professional relationship between the two of them.\u0027Of the €36,000, he added: \u0027It\u0027s the sort of payment a wealthy boyfriend could make to his girlfriend...There is no evidence that he would have expected the money back.\u0027Ordering her to pay back the £182,000, Judge Cavanagh said: \u0027There is a great deal of contemporaneous evidence to show Mr Kooter was giving Ms Radeva substantial sums of money so she could invest on his behalf, she having led him to believe she was an expert investor working in the finance industry.\u0027In my judgment, it is highly implausible that he was giving her this money for any other reason than that she should invest it for him.\u0027It might be thought to be strange that an experienced businessman would advance these sums to somebody he had recently met without a written agreement.\u0027He admits he was naive and says he was blinded by attraction\u0027. "},{"url":null,"title":"Mother left lip stuck chest pleads help finally surgery","story":"               Leonor Niusa, 43, worked at a farm in Zamboanga City, the Philippines, when the candle she used as a source of light set a gasoline storage room ablaze.And as her burns healed her lips were left attached to her chest. Her injuries now mean her movements are limited and since the accident she has not been able to find permanent work.Instead Leonor and her young son travel through various towns asking for donations.     The pair were seen by Justin Quiban, who gave them food and water after they were seen walking around his neighborhood.And locals are now hoping to raise money for a relatively straight-forward operation to remove her mouth from her chest so she can work again.              Leonor Niusa, 43, and her young son travel through various towns asking for donations         Locals are hoping to raise money for a relatively straight-forward operation to remove her mouth from her chest so she can work again.

Travellers occupying the council-owned ground. Organisers of a charity fete in Bodmin, Cornwall were forced to cancel the eventBut after travellers set up camp at the council-owned ground on Thursday, organisers say they had no choice but to cancel the popular community event.Each year the fete raises about £6,000 for the Bodmin Hospital League of Friends, a charity which provides equipment and services to the hospital and its patients.Ann Gregan has been a member of the league for almost 10 years and has helped organise several fetes in the past.            Travellers set up camp parking in a circular formation, blocking a large area of the fete ground           Gas bottles are seen outside of a caravan brought by travellers to the would-be fete siteThe 79-year-old said the committee was heartbroken but had no choice but to postpone the fete.\u0027It\u0027s totally heart-breaking and gutting,\u0027 she said.\u0027Hours and hours of hard work has been put into this preparing for the fete. It raises so much money for the hospital.\u0027I agree, live and let live, and travellers have got to go somewhere but they knew the situation and that we couldn\u0027t go ahead with the fete and that it raises so much money for the hospital.           Owners of the caravans reportedly said sorry to the organisers but would not move \u0027They just looked us in the eye and said sorry and carried on.\u0027She added: \u0027There was a big sign outside saying the fete was happening on June 29.\u0027They couldn\u0027t have missed it.\u0027It\u0027s understood about 10 caravans moved onto the site by the hospital on Thursday after reportedly being moved on from another site in Launceston.Ann explained that the fete is held on council-owned land and that the league has a licence to hold the event on part of the site.The league arranges for the grass and hedges to be cut ahead of the event.           Bodmin hospital, Cornwall, has been denied thousands in vital funds for equipment after the annual fund raiser was cancelledThe travellers offered to move onto the area with longer grass but Ann said the committee didn\u0027t have the authority to permit them to do so.\u0027The committee had a meeting yesterday morning,\u0027 she said.\u0027The problem is that we don\u0027t have a licence for the long grass area.\u0027We are not responsible for it.\u0027We were also worried about possible fires in the grass.\u0027We had to do a risk assessment and decided it was not a responsible decision.\u0027It\u0027s now hoped the fete will be held on September 21."},{"url":null,"title":"Piers Morgan Alexandria Ocasio Cortez Twitter spat","story":"Share this article Insisting she was there on \u0027merit\u0027 and not nepotism, he said he was \u0027having a pop\u0027 at the politician\u0027s attack on the First Daughter for seemingly lacking experience when \u0027she herself was serving drinks 18 months ago\u0027. AOC used the spat to launch complaints against \u0027the GOP\u0027 and accuse Republicans of \u0027classicism.\u0027 Listing her other qualifications, she fumed: \u0027As always, I‘m proud of my work in restaurants.

Eisenhower both appointed their sons to administrative positions, and President John F. Kennedy made his brother Bobby the attorney general.The latter was widely attacked for his lack of experience, but went on to be both brilliant at the job and beloved.So spare me all the n-word bullsh*t about Ivanka.But, of course, none of this matters to the legion of Trump critics this was just another chance to toss Ivanka onto the social media bonfire once again, and chuckle demonically as she was metaphorically burned alive.Leading the demented charge was Democrat Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the young firebrand socialist who seems to lead the demented charge at everyone and everything.‘It may be shocking to some,’ she tweeted snarkily about the video clip, ‘but being someone’s daughter actually isn’t a career qualification.’                  AOC, as she is known, had been complaining about Ivanka working in the White House despite not being elected when Piers took the opportunity to argue that she herself did not have a long career in politics and had been working in a bar not long before she was put in congressThis glib, sneering tone struck me as particularly inappropriate given that Ms Ocasio-Cortez is herself arguably the least ‘qualified’ member of the House of Representatives in US political history.‘Could be worse,’ I tweeted back, ‘Ivanka could have been a bartender 18 months ago.’This wasn’t, as some promptly claimed, a dig at bartenders.I grew up in a pub in Southern England and have worked behind the bar many times myself.But since Ocasio-Cortez was mocking Ivanka for her lack of experience, I felt it pertinent to point out she herself was still working as a bartender when she won the New York 14th congressional district primary election a year ago.Of course, Ocasio-Cortez reacted to my jibe by doubling down – just as she did last week when she so shamefully compared Trump’s immigration policy on the southern border to the Holocaust.‘Actually,’ she retorted back to me, ‘that would make government better – not worse. Imagine if more people in power spent years of their lives actually working for a living?’         AOC fired back on Sunday morning that it would make government \u0027better\u0027 to have more people there who had worked in bars and restaurantsWow. So now she was saying Ivanka isn’t just unqualified to be a White House Advisor, she’s never worked for a living either.In fact, Ivanka’s worked very hard all her life.Yes, she was born into vast wealth and privilege.But that was not her choice, and I don’t see why she should now be castigated for it.Ivanka enjoyed a successful modelling career before joining her father’s business - working for Versace, Thierry Mugler and Tommy Hiflger, and appearing on myriad magazine covers.She could have carried on doing that, or chosen to do nothing at all. She had no financial need work at all.But instead, she devoted herself to becoming a top businesswoman.After graduating cum laude from the Wharton School of Economics, Ivanka briefly worked as a real estate project manager for Forest City Enterprises before joining the Trump family business in 2005.In 2007, she launched Trump Fine Jewelry and the brand sold throughout the US and Canada, as well as the Middle East.She then launched her own expansive fashion line that sold in major US department stores.She was also, until she accepted the job at the White House, the Executive Vice President of Development and Acquisitions at The Trump Organisation, and served on the board of 100 Women in Hedge Funds, an industry organisation that provides support to women professionals in finance.And when she wasn’t doing all this, she appeared as one of her father’s regular boardroom advisors on hit TV shows The Apprentice and then Celebrity Apprentice.         Ivanka appeared as one of her father’s regular boardroom advisors on hit TV shows The Apprentice and then Celebrity Apprentice (pictured on the show with Piers)It was while filming the first season of the latter that I first met Ivanka and I have spent a lot of time with her over the years.She is one of the most impressive people I know: whip smart, charming, warm, generous and gracious.She’s also a proven skilled negotiator and when she needs to be in business, as steely and hard-nosed as they come.Like her father, she has a very thick skin that enables her to soak up all the relentless and often disgusting abuse and mockery. It’s been a brutal experience that would have destroyed most young women if it happened to them.Yet throughout it all, Ivanka’s calmly and diligently gone about her job, giving service to her country for zero compensation (she’s an unpaid advisor).And unlike her father, she doesn’t engage in unedifying public spats or indeed seemingly engage in any kind unedifying behavior.         Ivanka, pictured with her father and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, has proven herself to be skilled negotiator and businesswoman         Ivanka and husband Jared Kushner, far right, traveled to Seoul with Trump and other members of the administrationIn short, Ivanka’s the kind of person who any major company in America would love to have on its top executive team.And I’m glad she’s in the White House, because from my personal experience, there are few people for whom Donald Trump has more respect, or from whom he is prepared to take forthright advice.As for ‘Angel’ Alexandria, I bow to nobody in my admiration for the way she pulled off one of the US political sensations of this Millennium.But when she tries to take the high moral ground with Ivanka, I cry ‘Whoa there, my little firebrand…’For example, Ocasio-Cortez constantly boasts about being a working class ‘girl from the Bronx’ – one of New York’s roughest, toughest neighborhoods.Yet what this blue-collar champion of the people isn’t so keen to boast about is that when she was just five, her architect father Sergio moved the family from the Bronx to a nice home in Yorktown Heights, in Westchester County – one of New York’s wealthiest suburbs.He did this so his children could go to better schools than they would in the Bronx.In other words, like Donald Trump only on a far smaller scale, he used his comparative wealth to give his kids an advantage in life.Ocasio-Cortez also portrays herself a feminist icon, making endless pronouncements about the need to respect women.‘The reason women are critiqued for being too loud, or too meek, too big or too small, too smart to be attractive or too attractive to be smart,’ she declared recently, ‘is to belittle women out of standing up publicly. The goal is to ‘critique’ into submission.’Fine words.But how do they now sit with Ocasio-Cortez launching a vicious and deliberately belittling ‘critique’ on Ivanka Trump, mocking her for never having properly worked, and for only getting a job because of her Daddy?       Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez entered a war of words on Twitter on Sunday over Ivanka Trump working in the White House despite not being elected and the Democratic congresswoman\u0027s recent bartending jobIt’s hard to imagine a more degrading insult for a woman who has in fact worked hard all her life, both during her education and during her adult career. Or a more hypocritical one, coming from someone with miniscule political experience whose own father gave HER a head start too.There’s also the small matter of Ocasio-Cortez’s political opinions, with many experts saying her policies on issues like healthcare, tuition fees and climate change would swiftly bankrupt America.Ivanka, as she invariably does, maintained a dignified silence over Ocasio-Cortez’s nasty attacks.But she did tweet this: ‘The United States is the only country in the G20 with an entirely female negotiating team representing President Trump and advancing his policies.’That is an extraordinary fact, and one you might assume a radical feminist like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez would applaud?But no, she was so wrapped up in her poisonous mockery of Ivanka’s fitness to serve her country that she never stopped to consider the incredibly powerful statement the US negotiating team is making.The irony of all this is that the 2024 US election could possibly be fought between Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Ivanka Trump.And if it is, I can confidently predict that not only would Ivanka win, she’d make a damn sight better president than a hypocritical former bartender with a constantly bitching jealousy chip on both shoulders."},{"url":null,"title":"Alps mountain bikers end giant pile racing slope","story":"Share this article One cyclist stands at the bottom of the slope with their hands clasped to their head watching in horror as others keep tumbling like dominoes.No injuries were reported as a result of the large scale bike crash.

After spending a few hours there, which earned him the local nickname Photie Man, he would head over to watch the football, surrounded by men.But at the market the crowds were mostly made up of women. Wood became fascinated with the family relationships of those around him the features shared across different faces the interactions between the women and girls, now celebrated in his latest show, Mothers, Daughters, Sisters, opening tomorrow at the Arles photography festival.“Liverpool is a really matriarchal city in many ways,” he says. “When all the riots were going on, and unemployment was high, it was women who held everything together.” Wood’s Irish background helped him get to know the market-goers. “Everyone in Liverpool has some kind of Irish relative. A lot of women, I’d look them in the eye and it was like looking at my mother. It’s like a shared understanding.”The market was an ongoing source of inspiration for Wood. “When you see women in town, around Marks \u0026amp Spencer and those shops, people have a kind of a mask on – the face they present is not themselves. But because this was out of town and everybody kind of knew each other, the women were just really natural and open, not dressed up particularly.”Wood now lives in north Wales, but visited the market again a few weeks ago. “It’s smaller, it doesn’t sprawl along the road as it used to. But it was just as exciting and interesting. I don’t think I would have made the pictures I’ve made anywhere else in the UK. There’s an energy in the place and the people are really generous and open. It was a pleasure going there every week – the pictures are made out of absolute affection.”Tom Wood’s exhibition Mothers, Daughters, Sisters will appear at Les Rencontres d’Arles, France, from 1 July to 25 August.

Increased flood, drought and fire can disrupt everything we do in their own right, as with risks we have seen in the gulf.“Changing patterns can also tip the balance in favour of harmful flora and fauna and it can tip the balance away from replenishment of nutrients in the soil.”He decried the tribal nature of politics and then he urged the room to act and engage on the subject, in spite of the noisy political debate.“Those who call themselves believers demand action now,” Killen said. “We need to show them we share their conviction about the dangers that we all face.“They need to know that we care, we take the science seriously and that we are taking action where we can to manage climate risks daily.”It was an unusual conference because since Tony Abbott dismantled the carbon price in 2013, the largely conservative industry has tiptoed around the issue – a point recognised by the National Farmers’ Federation president, Fiona Simson, last year when she declared climate change was making drought worse.Long-time climate campaigner and Boggabilla farmer Pete Mailler said there was a “widespread wilful ignorance” about climate change and that was creating the impasse on public policy responses.“There’s this big issue that says we can’t really admit to climate change because that means we have to change all these other things and that’s really hard, we don’t really want to shut down coal-fired power stations,” Mailler said.“The reality is I can’t stand by and let people glibly talk up agriculture if they are not prepared to start tackling the hard issues now. Because if we set the next generation up to walk off into the sunset and say ‘here you go’, it’s a great opportunity and if we don’t start to tackle these problems now we are setting them up to fail.”Yet the challenge for farmers and their representative bodies is always how to discuss global warming without scaring people out of food production.Verity Morgan-Schmidt, of Farmers for Climate Action, said no farmer wanted to be intentionally negative but there was a need to stare the challenges “in the face”.“It’s a huge step forward for the industry to have such a trusted respected research organisation actively engage on the issue and raise the challenges,” she said. “We all want the industry to have vibrant future but we don’t want to sell people up the river.”The National Farmers’ Federation chief executive, Tony Mahar, said climate change was increasing risk to the sector through more intense and severe droughts, high water prices, increased volatility of farm income, loss of productive land and relocation of industries.The NFF declared its “priority ask” was a $1bn eco-systems services fund, following on from a $30m bioersity stewardship fund announced in the federal election that would develop a framework to pay farmers to improve landscape and capture carbon.Mahar echoed the Craik report, which also recommended the government introduce “market-based” National Bioersity Conservation Trust fund for eco-services.“We are talking about this as the new Landcare and being a system that will recognise, reward, and put a value on some of the systems and services and land management processes that farmers undertake every day, every year, and have done for decades but haven’t been able to get an income stream from that.”The World Wildlife Fund has backed has backed the principle of paying farmers for good environment practices.The WWF’s Ian McConnel said farmer payments for eco-system work would be an important driver for positive change.“We need to reward people when they are adopting practices, especially when those practices don’t come as a win-win to production,” McConnel. “We need to prove there’s a bioersity measurement. There’s a whole range of challenges around that, but we need to have very good models based on data that says if you do this practice, we see this improvement.”McConnel said the WWF had already designed farm practices applicable to Germany where farmers could choose from a range of works from restoring wetlands to vegetation connectivity and get paid a premium.McConnel said while planting and retaining trees was certainly “the easier way” to improve environmental outcomes, capturing soil carbon was potentially a longer term solution for farmers.The NFF’s $1bn target was “absolutely” achievable, he said, and could come from a mix of government funding and private investors.“The world needs pretty large-scale investment if we are going to turn the head on bioersity loss and carbon so we are going to have to see some pretty big investment in that space and I think the willingness is there from both the public and private to invest,” McConnel said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/958f6077768c9f50b50a719c6279cf75d5e243c8/0_201_3494_2097/master/3494.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3990b6e6ec2496329895afb2af00bfbc","title":"global markets rally as hopes of us china trade deal rise","story":"Wall Street hits record high after Donald Trump and Xi Jinping agree to resume talksStock markets around the world have rallied sharply as hopes of a peace deal in the US-China trade war rise.Shares on Wall Street hit  intraday highs on Monday after Donald Trump and the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, agreed to resume trade negotiations following a meeting at the G20 gathering of world leaders in Japan at the weekend.The Dow Jones industrial average jumped almost 200 points in afternoon trading in New York to about 26,758 and the wider S\u0026ampP 500 index of major American firms soared to 2,965, setting new intraday records for both indices.On a day of gains for bourses around the world, the FTSE 100 closed 76 points higher at 7,502.Trump said over the weekend that the meeting with Xi had been “excellent” and that the relationship with China was “right back on track”. The president promised there would be no additional tariffs on Chinese imports for now – a key concern among investors. China also agreed to hold back from imposing tariffs and will purchase more US agricultural products.The long-running trade dispute between the US and China has served as a handbrake on the global economy over recent months, dragging down factory output as international imports and exports dwindle. Trump has slapped import tariffs on $200bn (£158.1bn) of Chinese goods, while China has retaliated with higher taxes on US imports worth $60bn.Mark Haefele, the global chief investment officer at the Swiss investment bank UBS, said the truce would likely be prolonged as an escalating trade conflict would cause damage for Washington and Beijing."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ce8f644edd2bd5cbd32a61fce9fa60d0380d43f4/160_22_1016_610/master/1016.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=129965e21ccf3b553de9a83029d20fa0","title":"neil woodford refusal to budge over fund fees is breathtaking","story":"Unit holders cannot access their investments but management charges will continueThe song remains the same from Neil Woodford. The gates will remain closed on his Equity Income Fund, meaning unit holders still cannot access their investments. But management fees will continue to be charged because Woodford’s operation still has overheads to cover.The tin ear on fees is extraordinary. The chief executive of the Financial Conduct Authority, the chair of the Treasury select committee and Hargreaves Lansdown, his chief cheerleader, have urged him to waive charges in the period in which dealings are suspended. But he will not budge.One assumes, from his talk in his latest video about the “attractive” investment opportunities ahead, that Woodford still harbours hopes of reviving the fund and his career. But how does he expect to appeal for loyalty when it matters?The Tory leadership race, bizarrely, has become a contest in which both candidates make unfunded spending pledges in an attempt to make Labour’s plans look austere. Even the intervention of the chancellor, Philip Hammond, making the bleedin’ obvious point that the Treasury’s £26bn of “fiscal firepower” would evaporate in the event of a no-deal Brexit, hasn’t halted the procession of loose promises.In his latest outing, Jeremy Hunt would throw £6bn at the farming and fishing industries to help then prepare for a no-deal Brexit. He justified this on the grounds that “we spent just over £1tn bailing out the banks after the financial crisis”, so why not do the same for others in their hour of need?Let’s skip over the important detail that, unless Hunt is proposing to nationalise farming and fishing in the UK, the comparison doesn’t work. More revealing, from the point of view of assessing the candidates’ ability to present numbers honestly, is Hunt’s sloppy claim that “just over £1 trillion” was spent on the bank bailout.Yes, we know the exercise was vastly expensive. But, come on, the outlay – which is what is implied by the word “spent” – was not £1tn. The country would have been bankrupt several times over if that had been the case. The entire national debt was less than £1tn in 2009.Hunt’s number isn’t entirely plucked from thin air, it should be said. Taxpayer support for the banks was estimated by the National Audit Office to be £1.16tn at the peak. But “support” is not the same as money spent. Crucially, the vast bulk of NAO’s figure – some £1.03tn – was non-cash support in form of loan guarantees, indemnities and liquidity schemes.The actual cash outlay, principally from buying shares in Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds Banking Group, plus loans to insolvent banks, was £133bn, according to the NAO. That is still a staggering figure, even though the sum had fallen to £32bn by March 2018, thanks to share sales and loan repayments. But the sum spent was never £1tn-plus. A would-be prime minister should know this stuff."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0e5404ce2816c10d358c75e427ad4563eff8c43e/0_225_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=01aaea6084e656253dc83193610845a1","title":"san francisco big tech workers industry","story":"San Franciscans have long complained that tech workers ruined their city, driving up rents and homelessness and eliminating ersity. Now even the tech workers agreePhotographs by Jason HenryIt was a beautiful winter day in San Francisco, and Zoe was grooving to the soundtrack of the roller-skating musical Xanadu as she rode an e-scooter to work. The 29-year-old tech worker had just passed the Uber building when, without warning, a homeless man jumped into the bike lane with his dog, blocking her path.She slammed on the brakes, flew four feet into the air and landed on the pavement, bleeding. “It was one of those hardening moments where I was like, ‘Even I am being affected,’” she recalled.It should be noted that Zoe, who asked not to be identified by her real name because she was not authorized by her employer to speak to the press, is not the stereotypical tech bro who moves to San Francisco for a job and immediately starts complaining about the city’s dire homelessness crisis. She arrived in 2007 to study at San Francisco State University and had a career in the arts before attending a coding bootcamp and landing a job at a major tech company.But the fall and other incidents, including getting mugged and having her phone stolen, have all contributed to her growing sense of insecurity in the area. She told the  the tale of her scoot, interrupted, because she said it was a perfect example of her own – and perhaps the broader community of tech workers’ – increasingly hate-hate relationship with San Francisco. “This guy needed services to help him,” she said of the man who caused her to fall, “and we all suffer because of the issues that are not being addressed.”A quarter of a century after the first dot-com boom, the battle for San Francisco’s soul is over and the tech industry has won. But what happens when the victors realize they don’t particularly like the spoils?For Zoe, the newfound financial security from working in tech does not counterbalance a constant sense of being unsafe in the city. She now earns three to four times more than when she was a “starving artist”, but she says she is terrified to walk at night. She no longer rides scooters and says she feels “triggered” when she sees them around the city. She takes Ubers everywhere after dark and asks drivers to watch to make sure she gets inside her apartment building.“Mark Zuckerberg lives nearby, but our corner is the main prostitution corner in the city,” she said of the Mission District apartment she shares with her boyfriend. “There’s condoms and syringes. It’s absolutely crazy with how much we pay for rent … It’s tough, because we work in tech, but we ask ourselves every day if we should move.”It’s a striking contrast from just five years ago, when tech workers showed up in force at San Francisco City Hall to declare their love and respect for a city that was not exactly loving them back. “I am so proud to live in San Francisco and be a part of this community,” Google employees were instructed to say, as a preface to their remarks at a January 2014 hearing before the local transportation authority, according to a leaked company memo.That hearing was one of several pivotal moments in recent San Francisco history when public officials could have used the city’s legislative or regulatory powers to force the tech industry to contribute more to public services, but chose not to. Such inflection points (which also include a controversial 2011 tax break for Twitter and a failed attempt at a “tech tax” in 2016) highlight the complicated relationship between the city government and an industry that has brought untold wealth and jobs, but has arguably failed to pay its fair share – while treating the city as a petri dish for disruptive innovations (think Uber, Airbnb and self-driving cars) by ignoring regulations.The nominal issue in 2014 was the use of public bus stops by private charter shuttles (AKA “Google buses”) hired by tech companies to ferry employees the 45 miles south to their Silicon Valley headquarters. Activists wanted the double-decker buses banned from the streets and the companies fined for the illegal use of bus stops the city chose to legalize the buses.The Google Bus controversy was particularly charged because it tapped into local residents’ deep concern that San Francisco – a city with the population of Jacksonville, Florida, and the self-importance of New York – would be reduced to a bedroom community for Silicon Valley. But while the buses continue to ply their routes north and south, that particular nightmare scenario hasn’t come to pass. Instead, San Francisco has become more of a satellite campus, with South Bay stalwarts including Apple, Facebook, Google and LinkedIn competing for office space in the city proper. They’ve joined the San Francisco-native companies Twitter, Uber, and Airbnb in the cramped confines of a city of just 49 square miles, surrounded by water on three sides.The consequences of that squeeze are well documented: the outrageous housing costs, the displacement of black and Latino families, evictions, homelessness, the loss of beloved businesses and cultural institutions. The tale of how tech destroyed the city that gave us the Summer of Love has been told so many times that in 2014, the San Francisco Chronicle produced a satirical cheat sheet for out-of-town reporters parachuting in for taste of avocado toast and class warfare. (Amid a bumper crop of new elegies to San Francisco in recent months, web publication HmmDaily updated the form with an “AI Algorithm-generated” version.)But what’s striking about the current winter of our discontent (yes, it’s July consider this your obligatory Mark Twain reference) is that it’s not just the archetypal “evicted Mission District visual artist” complaining that techies ruined San Francisco: it’s the techies themselves, too.The arguments against San Francisco are manifold: it’s too expensive even for people making six-figure salaries, it’s dangerous and depressingly unequal, and, increasingly, it’s kind of boring. A frequent refrain among the more than a dozen tech workers who spoke to the  for this article was that it is not so much the presence of have-nots that is ruining their experience of San Francisco, but an overabundance of haves. “The housing crisis has a huge negative impact on quality of life because of who it excludes from living near you,” said Simon Willison, a software developer who moved to San Francisco from London five years ago. “When I visit other cities I’m always jealous of their income ersity: that people who have jobs that don’t provide a six-digit salary can afford to live and work and be happy.”“Even though people think there is ersity in the city, there isn’t really,” said Adrianna Tan, a senior product manager at a tech startup who moved to San Francisco from Singapore. “Sure, you get people from all over the world, but the only ones who can move here now come from the same socio-economic class.”“I feel like San Francisco is between Seattle and New York, but rather than the best of both, it’s the worst of both,” said Beth, a 24-year-old product manager who asked not to be identified by her real name. Beth moved to the city directly after graduating from Stanford to work at a major tech company, but recently transferred to Seattle. “Everyone I met was only interested in their jobs, and their jobs weren’t very interesting,” she said of her time in San Francisco. “I get it, you’re a developer for Uber, I’ve met a million of you.”One aspect of that homogeneity is that when everyone around you is either rich or destitute, being rich doesn’t feel that rich.“Unless you’re here to hit the IPO jackpot, you’ll always be middle-class,” said Chris, a former Apple manager who recently decided to leave San Francisco for Texas and spoke on condition of anonymity. “Tech salaries allow you to get by for now, but there’s no future for anyone under 40 in this city who’s not rich.”“It’s just not sustainable for a couple to live here,” he said. “A million-plus for a home with $300,000 down? Then when we have kids, $30,000 a year for private school? Who can afford that even making $300,000 a year? … There’s hundreds of other places in the country with the same restaurant culture or at least on par that cost half as much.”Chris also complained about the “property crime, unchecked homeless and drug issues” plaguing the city, noting that he had recently witnessed a man smoking crack cocaine in broad daylight in the middle of the famously twisty Lombard street. “You don’t see people smoking crack brazenly in public on Melrose in LA or in Times Square, NYC, but here the cops just shrug.”Figuring out how to exist in a city with so much human misery clearly on display is another challenge for affluent tech workers, many of whom express compassion for the poor and homeless, as well as frustration with the city’s decades of failure in providing adequate shelter and services to the homeless and mentally ill. “It was really hard to stomach the indifference that I witnessed from folks who’d been living in San Francisco for a while, simply stepping over the slumped bodies of people who lived outside or just cold ignoring people asking for money,” said Jessica Jin, who moved to San Francisco from Austin, Texas, to work for a tech startup, of her first impressions of the city. “I wondered how long it would take me to also become numb to it all.”Badrul Farooqi, a startup worker, said that he had been surprised to experience echoes of the constant fear of crime and violence he was exposed to growing up in Detroit while living in San Francisco. “The entire purpose of going to school and working hard was to escape this kind of environment,” he said. And while Farooqi acknowledged that San Francisco was much better off than the Detroit of his childhood, he argued that in some ways it was worse because the misery seems so unnecessary. “San Francisco is not Detroit,” he said. “Detroit was always poor … San Francisco has money! There’s so much money in this city.”Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a689acd998a0997f64e9abfec1059681f4f21502/0_227_2850_1710/master/2850.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ab11959a6d6c6704bea1a66a3a11f78b","title":"jeremy hunt tory leadership contender","story":"A week ago there was a discernible cigarette paper between them: Boris Johnson was the bad character with charisma, the sociopath who would do anything, say anything, lie, cheat and swerve, his roguishness and proroguing priced in with the populism. Jeremy Hunt was dull as hell but more sensible, the man who (probably) wouldn’t drive the country off the cliff in a Boris bus.The three-quarters of voters who reject a no-deal Brexit could only hope against hope that, just possibly, Hunt might defy the odds and persuade the Brexit-crazed old white men of the Tory tribe to think again. No longer. The only useful role for the inevitable loser in the Conservative leadership contest was to pull the next prime minister back into the realms of reality. But in the death throes of this contest, Hunt emerges as a swiveller too, a turncoat peddler of the same hyper-dishonesty, just as ready as his opponent to wreck the economy and people’s lives.The apparent certainty of Johnson’s victory is driving erstwhile sensibles to abandon everything they said before: Matt Hancock on the Radio 4 Today programme let go of all he stood for as candidate to clutch the Boris bandwagon.Character was supposed to be Hunt’s USP, but in the crucible of this campaign his has irredeemably collapsed. Why throw away dignity and reputation when he could have saved both in an attempt to rescue the country? Instead he backs every Johnson trope. Forget “I’m an entrepreneur”, he copies “fuck business”, telling the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show he is willing to trash family businesses “with a heavy heart” as “a necessary sacrifice”. For we voteless bystanders, it’s ours not to reason why, as both men “do or die” us into the valley of economic doom.Both spray money as if from one of Johnson’s water cannons. Hunt’s proposed £6bn to compensate farmers and fishermen for steep no-deal tariffs would improve their lot not one iota, just covering needless costs when the Brexiters promised frictionless trade. How much is £6bn? Some £4bn would repay all the cuts to schools since 2010. Replacing the 20,000 lost police officers could cost under £1bn. Or £6bn could increase social care by more than a third. Instead the money is just to stop farming and fishing collapsing, a minuscule sector compared with manufacturing and services. Compensating them would be fathomless.The two men’s glorious spending spree is an unexpected electoral gift for Labour. The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) reckons both men would spend roughly what Labour pledged at the last election: forget any future “magic money tree” jibes after this reckless spaffing-up-the-wall by these Tories. As the chancellor looks on aghast, the country may celebrate this bombshell end to austerity – except this is haphazard spending on electoral eye-catchers regardless of the urgent need for public-service repair. Hunt and Johnson’s tax cuts for the wealthy come with no reversal of poverty-inducing benefit cuts. There would be no £26bn “fiscal firepower” with a disorderly no-deal Brexit, as the chancellor tweeted yesterday, confirmed by the IFS: it would be eaten up by plunging Treasury revenues. So forget Hunt’s pledge to “turbo-charge the economy”.Gordon Brown might be permitted a wry smile at the irony, given the Tories’ mendacious attacks on him for his spending to protect against the worst effects of the 2008 financial crash. Here’s Hunt, the born-again Keynesian, promising the same for a no-deal Brexit: “When you face a financial crisis it is responsible to spend money.” But here’s the big difference: this crisis is artificially created by him and all Brexiters. Meanwhile, manufacturing just suffered its sharpest fall in six years, leaving Make UK, the trade body, protesting that Hunt and Johnson’s no-deal pledges show they have “zero understanding” of the consequences.Though Johnson looks a shoo-in, tremors in recent polls show a narrowing of the gap. Toby Helm of the Observer and the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg detect some Tory members switching to Hunt – but with no numbers. Unease may grip some, but both men have locked themselves into the same no-deal dead end, with no exit, no escape. Nigel Farage is announcing his 650 parliamentary candidates this week, to block any no-deal U-turn.If anyone hoped Hunt’s character might save the day, this swerving to woo members is true to form. In a now deleted tweet, David Cameron’s former director of strategy, Andrew Cooper, called him “an unprincipled windsock who will believe whatever he thinks you want him to believe”. As culture secretary, arbiter on a Murdoch bid to buy BSkyB, he hid behind a tree to avoid photographers catching him going to dinner with the Murdochs. To duck the blame, he fired his adviser for cosying up to the media oligarchs.In the NHS, he fired chief executives brutally to frighten others, knowing them to be blameless. When a list of indebted trusts showed too many women executives for the chop, he changed the names arbitrarily. An observer of cabinet says he was a “lightweight who expressed no views”, and only tried to please. Hunt started his campaign with a call for a 12-week abortion cutoff, to woo Tories. Outrageously, he compared the EU to the USSR. As recently as 27 May he wrote in the  that the Conservatives “will be committing political suicide if they attempt to push through a no-deal Brexit” – but see how the windsock blows now.Yet, ultimately, the only character that matters is that of the sane remnants of the Tory party. Can they muster a true Churchillian nerve to defy their party and vote no confidence in their leader if a no deal threatens?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c0dac89af8c7b5cb1241be0028d84b84a724e15c/0_163_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9555ec4c59a45a54d03d2814f4857ed5","title":"your pictures share your photos on the theme of radiant","story":"Wherever you are in the world, this week we’d like to see your pictures on the theme ‘radiant’The next theme for our weekly photography assignment, published in print in the Observer New Review is ‘radiant’.Share your photos of what radiant means to you – and tell us about your image in the description box.The closing date is Wednesday 3 July at 10am.

Chas Newkey-Burden meets the children getting involvedOn a five-a-side football pitch, a short stroll from the Arsenal stadium, local kids are falling in love with sport. But it’s cricket, not football, that has them buzzing.For the past four years, thanks to the Islington Chance to Shine Street Youth project, Mikey Thompson has run weekly sessions at this north London leisure centre for the Eritrean Youth Club.Holding classes all year round, whatever the weather – including snow – the Islington setup is a far cry from the sleepy sun-kissed village greens often associated with the game.Thompson, 55, is known as the godfather of inner-city cricket. He says his mission is simple: “to put a bit of joy back on to kids’ faces”.It’s working. The children are enraptured by his down-to-earth approach, which relies on simple drills to teach them the basic disciplines of cricket. As the sun shines, the kids support one another, screams of joy keep going up, and the smiles are everywhere.Eight-year-old Sesen says her favourite part of cricket is the batting. “It feels so nice when I hit the ball because the bat really vibrates in my hands!”But there is another reason why she enjoys picking up the bat. “It makes my hands more steady,” says Sesen. “This is important, because when I grow up I want to be an artist and then my hands will have to be still, so my art doesn’t go all wiggly.”Winta, also eight, says that the sessions have helped her emotionally. “It helps me feel more confident in life,” she says. “If I’m a bit upset in the middle of the week, I just think about cricket and it immediately makes me feel better.”The project has the “open to all” ethos of its backer, Chance to Shine, a charity that aims to give all children the opportunity to play, learn and develop through the game of cricket. Chance to Shine’s main partner, NatWest, also has a long history of supporting grassroots cricket, facilitating schemes to assist communities and to show iniduals that anyone can play, no matter their level of experience.Hiyab, 12, personifies this. He says that when he first came to the sessions, he knew nothing about cricket and wasn’t even sure whether he would be able to play it. “But now I’ve got really confident because I did better than I expected,” he says, with a big grin.Hanan, 10, is also “surprised” by how well he did when he started going along. Before he knew it he was being picked for his school cricket team he now dreams of playing in the Olympics one day.Nine-year-old Selina thinks more children should get involved in cricket, whatever their circumstances or knowledge of the game. “They can still try it,” she says. “It’s so much fun once you start.”Thompson believes the key to the fun of the sessions is for him to channel his inner child. “If you don’t go into their world, you’ve lost them,” he says.He sweeps aside cricketing jargon to produce an experience that captivates children, drawing on decades of coaching and playing involvement, as well as his experiences coaching the blind and those with other disabilities.Thompson fine-tuned his approach when he ran a project in Hackney. “We went into some serious estates where it was all concrete,” he remembers. “I knew that old-fashioned cricket coaching simply wouldn’t work there – the children would have just walked away.”So he introduced tape-ball cricket and speedy, 20-ball games. Nodding at the nearby football stadium, he says that he injected some of football’s speed and excitement to lure inner-city children away from that game and towards cricket.He is full of praise for the support of his charity backer. “Chance to Shine is one of the most wonderful, wonderful things that has ever happened to cricket,” he says. “If it wasn’t for Chance to Shine, state school cricket would be dying.”It is people like Thompson who keep it alive. He believes that, taught correctly, cricket can be “a vehicle to steer children away from crime and antisocial behaviour and towards the right paths”.A passionate, tireless worker, he now hopes to get government backing to take his work into young offenders’ institutions – something Chance to Shine is also looking in to. “I think I could really help,” he says. “I’d like to use cricket to steer young offenders away from crime and get them off welfare.”For almost four decades, NatWest has supported cricket, with a mission to make the game easier for everyone to play and enjoy.

When pupils at Hague primary school in Bethnal Green, east London, said they wanted to play cricket, there was a problem – the playground had very little space and no grass at all.“It was like a Victorian yard,” recalls headteacher, Judy Coles. So the school built a rooftop playground, complete with concertinaing cricket nets.Coach Soyfur Rahman was 11 when he arrived in England from Bangladesh 15 years ago. He spoke hardly any English and found the transition a “great shock” at first. He remembers with a smile the joy of playing on the roof. “I loved it,” he says. “I was always trying to hit the ball past the nets and off the roof.”He wasn’t the only one – he remembers that when England cricketers Michael Vaughan and Alastair Cook visited the school they also tried to hit the ball for six. No wonder the school insisted that a soft ball was used!Cricket helped the 11-year-old to integrate. He had played street cricket in Bangladesh and when he started playing the game at his new school he quickly began to learn English. “I was the only Bengali speaker in the team, so that made me learn English quicker,” says Rahman, who is now 26.“Listening to my teammates I started to pick up words. Thanks to cricket, I learned English quicker than other kids from Bangladesh. It also gave me a lot of confidence.”When the staff noticed that Rahman had a special talent, Coles helped him to get involved with local cricket clubs. He also received coaching from Chance to Shine, the charity that aims to give all children the opportunity to play, learn and develop through cricket.Rahman credits his success to the coaching courses run by the charity. “They really help coaches to get better and show us how to get the best out of the kids,” he says. “Whatever support I needed, Chance to Shine provided. Then Middlesex hired me to deliver what I’d learned.”He says the charity’s support of young people is transformative, and helps to put them on the right path. “Rather than hanging round on the street, they can play cricket and take a different direction in their lives,” he says.NatWest has been supporting cricket for almost 40 years. It works with Chance to Shine to help create opportunities such as Rahman’s, and keep programmes like this free of charge – something Rahman says is vital.“Among the south-Asian community here, money is a problem. And if you play club cricket the usual way you have to pay for membership, bats, pads, helmet, gloves, bags and shoes. That’s a lot of money, and would be a barrier for many people. But with Chance to Shine projects you don’t need to spend anything. It’s free. You can just turn up, have a game and go home.”For Coles, unearthing and supporting a talent like Rahman’s is life-affirming. Cricket has been her passion since childhood, when she sat at the boundary and proudly watched her grandfather play.She describes it as “an absolute pleasure” to watch children playing team games and developing their skills. “You get children who start not knowing one end of the bat from another and then become good players,” she says. “They develop such confidence.”She also gets parents involved, to make it a family affair. “None of us have great talent, but we have enthusiasm – and we want children to have fun,” she says.Coles says Chance to Shine is “really good at getting cricket into schools, particularly in the inner cities” and believes the charity’s team are “fantastic ambassadors for the game”.With the charity’s support, some of her pupils were invited to open up the London Stock Exchange with cricket legend Devon Malcolm. They have also been taken to see Test matches at Lord’s and the Oval.The school has built a strong cricket culture and the pupils are enthused by the sport – the girls are particularly passionate about the game. “You see them getting involved at lunchtime,” says Coles. “I’m really proud of that.”Rahman thinks that this summer will be the one where cricket really captures the mood of the nation. “With the work Chance to Shine is doing, and the World Cup and Ashes taking place, I think there will be more interest in cricket than ever before,” he says. “That is really positive.”For almost four decades, NatWest has supported cricket, with a mission to make the game easier for everyone to play and enjoy.A proud partner of the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) and the charity Chance to Shine, NatWest champions cricket at all levels – from grassroots support for local clubs and getting more people involved in the game to supporting current and future England stars and helping fans cheer on their teams, however and wherever they choose.With NatWest, cricket is a game that has #NoBoundaries.

Tasneem-Summer Khan meets a coach, an umpire, and a player inspiring girls and the game to come togetherYou won’t often hear cricket described as trailblazing it’s more commonly thought of as reactionary. However, spurred on by a summer of World Cup and Ashes cricket, women and girls all over Britain are making their mark on the sport.Asma Ajaz-Ali, a third-generation British Pakistani who grew up in inner-city Birmingham, experienced a variety of socioeconomic and cultural barriers to playing the game. Despite this lack of access to the formal game, she taught her brothers to play on an informal basis, then began running sessions for women and girls who had never before held a bat, supported by Warwickshire CC.“People think cricket is all upper middle-class men,” says Ajaz-Ali, who joined the ECB’s ambitious South Asian Action Plan, supported by NatWest, that aims to transform community engagement by recruiting 2,000 female mentors. “I go to mosques, temples, community centres, and get children and women from everywhere involved. Children see their mothers coaching and feel pride. It tells them they can do that too. These initiatives change opportunities and cultural attitudes for generations.”Ajaz-Ali prefers to focus on the future than lamenting her own lack of opportunity growing up. “I can’t bring back that time for me, but I can offer something to these girls,” she says. She sees change happening in the sport and aspires to generate more: “I have women playing in shalwar kameez, I coach asylum seekers. The point is to break down barriers and build inclusivity. Cricket is such a cool sport. It’s vibrant, it’s dynamic, and we have to try harder to make more people, particularly girls of all backgrounds, understand that.”Much like Ajaz-Ali, Laura Caughey found it hard to get a game of cricket. Growing up in Northern Ireland, she attempted to join a team as a child, only to be told she could practise with the boys but, lacking female peers, could not play in matches. “That stuck with me through adulthood and it’s not something I want more girls to experience.”Caughey decided to focus on a different aspect of the sport – umpiring. “I’d watch Simon Taufel and study what he did … he was my cricket idol growing up.” She became Ireland’s second female umpire this year when she was appointed to the representative panel of match officials.Through umpiring, Caughey has met like-minded people and helped to shape the conversation through administrative panels, eventually helping to set up and develop a women’s side at her local Carrickfergus CC. Reflecting on the enduring dismissive attitudes towards women in the sport, she says: “I just want to enjoy my season and let my on-field speak for me.”Ellie Threlkeld has been playing cricket for 10 years. She credits her experiences in mixed-gender cricket for developing skills which saw her move from the age-group county setup to playing for Lancashire Thunder in the semi-professional Kia Super League.Recognising the limited prospects for women cricketers, she opted to study psychology at Loughborough. The university’s enviable facilities and MCCU membership enable her to simultaneously develop her game and prepare for another option if cricket doesn’t work out.Threlkeld – who has ambitions to replace her England wicketkeeping heroes Sarah Taylor and Amy Jones one day – volunteers, coaches, and does ambassador work to grow interest and participation. “Assemblies get a great turnout, and girls can see how good it is to be a cricketer, but kids don’t just need role models – they need more thrown into the game so it’s an actual career.“A lot of women don’t have the option to train full-time – they need to work to earn a living. If there was money involved in the game, everything would improve faster.”With women all over the country dedicating their time and energy to the sport, barriers are shifting – new generations of girls are becoming women under the tutelage of these inspirational characters, and it’s hard to imagine anything but a positive future for British women’s cricket.For almost four decades, NatWest has supported cricket, with a mission to make the game easier for everyone to play and enjoy.

Auria London has dressed Daisy Lowe and Rihanna. Davy J has swimsuits for wild and sporting swimmers. Ruby Moon offers “activewear for activists”. Fisch is stocked at Matches. Mara Hoffman’s pieces sell for hundreds of pounds. But follow the stories of all these labels and you will arrive in the same place: at Econyl, a recycled nylon fibre that its Italian manufacturer claims is “infinitely recyclable”.“At the beginning, many people were laughing at me,” says Giulio Bonazzi, CEO of Econyl’s parent company, Aquafil. An average of 64,000 tonnes of fishing nets are left in the ocean each year, and these were the first nylon items that Bonazzi’s company collected for recycling, initially from the fish farming industry in Scotland and Norway, from professional ers who spotted ghost nets, and now from “all over the world – Japan, Australia, south-east Asia, north and South America”.Lejeune says that, when she started the Ethical Fashion Forum in 2006, plastic as an issue was not on her radar. “That has really changed in the past two years.” There is an obvious and pleasing circularity to the idea of swimmers bathing in recycled ocean waste. No wonder small fashion brands are not the only ones to love Econyl. Gucci adopted the fibre in 2017. Stella McCartney has pledged to stop using virgin nylon by 2020, switching to Econyl (she makes bags with it, too.)The company now has more than 750 fashion clients and “demand is growing strongly day by day”, Bonazzi says. He has his sights set on the plastic industry at large – “glasses, furniture, chairs”, he rattles off – and even nets in which to transport and sell supermarket fruit.As Tamsin Lejeune, founder of the Ethical Fashion Forum and CEO of the new enterprise Common Objective, points out, Ninety Percent is interesting because “some of the best and most innovative examples of change in the fashion industry are coming from the supply sector”. As for Hassan, his family moved from Bangladesh to England in 1971 and he lived his teenage years listening to John Lennon’s Imagine and Pink Floyd’s Breathe (“Don’t be afraid to care …”).On a sourcing trip for New Look in the early 90s, he drove past the dump near Kamalapur railway station in Bangladesh. The smell was appalling, but worse still he could see “children eking out a living there”, and started to think about a sustainable business model. With his partner Para Hamilton, he set up the charity Children’s Hope (one of Ninety Percent’s beneficiaries). When the pair opened a factory in 2009, they provided a canteen with fresh food cooked daily. Other benefits include health insurance and on-site healthcare (there are now 12,000 employees and the factory has produced clothes for H\u0026ampM, Debenhams and New Look.)Matthew Needham was an intern at a major luxury brand in Paris where he saw firsthand the degree to which waste is built into the fashion industry. “It takes 10 weeks to order leather from the tannery, so the brands tend to order more colours than they need,” he says. They decide only when they arrive which to use and which to dispose of. “For me, the waste was thoughtless”. He describes himself as an upcycler, an approach shared by fellow designers Bethany Williams, who has worked with materials including book waste, and Helen Kirkum, with her amazing mash-up trainers made from discarded shoes.Needham, like De Castro, believes that sustainability “should be inherent in the design process for everyone”. He finds luxury deadstock before it goes to incineration (“Like the Burberry thing” – where the company destroyed £28m of its own products to guard against counterfeiting). He scours markets, the streets and sometimes his own studio. After a shopping trolley with no apparent owner sat in the street for two weeks, he turned it into a raincoat. Lace-like plastic found on a beach in Norway became a skirt. Often he blends these finds with high-end unused fabric, such as tweed that might have been Chanel, but instead spent years in a warehouse. “I like the idea of considering the value in creativity. Not the value in the materialistic thing itself, but the value in the creativity. That’s luxury. The craft, the skill, the mindset, the thought process that goes into making something,” he says.His work has already appeared in i-D and he is often approached by big-name brands wanting to benefit by association. He usually declines. “For them, I’m a tick box.” Needham creates pieces to order a deal with a major retailer is only a matter of time away. Being at the start of his career, he says, is a major advantage. “You have the benefit of not being tied down by marketing and business plans. You really have to decide for yourself what you think sustainable is. For me, it’s about using what we have, because we have too much.”Jamie Lim grew up in Malaysia and Hong Kong. She loved the batik prints her parents wore, the beautiful furniture made of straw. At 17 she moved to the US for university, and each time she went home on vacation she looked for artisanal gifts to take back for friends. As time went by, they became harder to find. Plastic straw began to proliferate. “So that was the impetus of the brand – it started as a way to preserve indigenous techniques,” Lim says.Now, Kayu’s beautiful bags – California-style totes handwoven from natural plant fibres by artisans in Terengganu, Malaysia – are stocked at high-end stores including Liberty, Bloomingdale’s, Saks Fifth Avenue and Net-a-Porter. Reese Witherspoon and Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, carry them.Crucially, these bags look great. They prove that conscientious fashion can compete with, and lead, the mainstream fashion industry in terms of aesthetics and design. “What they are producing is absolutely beautiful, and completely separate from what you might think of as sustainable fashion,” says Emma Slade Edmondson, a creative consultant who specialises in sustainability and ethics in fashion retail.Lim is also in the process of steering Kayu towards zero waste. Excess fibre from the bags is being made into alphabet tags or pouches, with the proceeds donated to charity. The straw waste is biodegradable, of course, as are the bags, over time, although some of the hardware is not.“The idea was to make jeans – organic cotton, people getting properly paid,” says Bert van Son, who founded Mud in 2012. Nothing too radical there. “But we soon found out that cotton could be easily recycled. We thought: why not get the jeans back?” Mud offers a choice between buying jeans or leasing them. Those who rent simply swap the old ones for new.“There is a mindshift happening,” Van Son says. “We used to have a 5050 split between people renting and buying. But over the past 12 months the leasing has grown. People like to take another colour, wash or style after a year. They’re happy to send back their old jeans and get a fresh pair.”Anyone buying a piece from Birdsong will come face to face with its maker. The London social enterprise label, which majors on statement tees and classic shifts, puts photographs of the women (they are all women) who cut, sew, embroider or knit the clothes on its labels.This is not a gimmick. Birdsong’s creators, Sophie Slater and Sarah Neville, started out working in women’s charities. They personally know the 12 to 50 people who make the clothes. “We never set out to make a fashion brand,” Slater says. “We just loved fashion as the conduit, a way to use these women’s skills to bring about change.” Now the clothes are sold in more than 30 countries.The brand was born out of feminism and the Fashion Revolution movement. Slater and Beckett wanted to take the clothes that were being made in daycare centres and sold in bring-and-buy sales, and showcase them on a stylish website.“Then we had the idea of collaborating with all these amazing feminist photographers,” Slater says. She enlisted activists she knew how to model the clothes and adopted the slogan: “No sweatshop \u0026amp no Photoshop.”Now Birdsong has its own designer, bringing shape and coherence to the talents of the makers. To reduce waste and overstock, the knitwear designer Katie Jones has created a template for crocheted blocks that can be quickly sewn into sweaters or cardigans, depending on orders received.“Traceability and transparency are big priorities,” says Emma Slade Robinson (she suggests checking out another brand, Know The Origin, too). Slater, for instance, knows the Birdsong makers by name, pays them a London living wage, and has even been to a family wedding. “I guess our mission is to create beautiful things the women enjoy working on, and give them a revenue stream.”Birdsong’s place in the fashion industry is changing, too. “When we used to be invited to events, it was to give a talk at a hemp convention,” Slater says. But at a recent industry breakfast with representatives from well-known high-street brands, some of Slater’s fellow attendees were discussing whether sustainability was a trend. “I stood up and said, ‘We’ve got 50 harvests left!’” she says – referring to the news that soil fertility will be eroded in the UK in the coming decades. “Me and my friends working in ethical fashion always said we felt like the geeks and the fashion people were the cool ones. Now it feels like they are really paying attention.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/42315fbff8726ad2a22244ce892c85da763af175/0_596_8012_4808/master/8012.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f6656fd8802db9108347cdec2652f46c","title":"rachel roddy penne all arrabbiata recipe","story":"The art of the tomato pasta sauce is distilled beautifully in this simple classic – a fiery delight to serve with penneOur white stove is spattered red, as is the sleeve of my dress. There are thin, red skins blocking the sink and caught up in the plug, like seaweed on a ship’s chain. I have also just touched my contact lens with the same fingers that crumbled chillies, and finished a big bottle of olive oil. In return, though, we have just eaten the most satisfying and fiery tomato sauce.As much as I enjoy the tinned tomato sauces that see us through the winter and spring, there is nothing like fresh tomato sauce. One that shouts summer, even when the sky doesn’t one that is bright, jammy and slick with olive oil.Every pan is different from the last, even when you did exactly the same thing as last time with ostensibly identical ingredients.What’s more, fresh tomato sauce brings out the best in us as cooks, appealing to our nurturing side, because we know that whether we are dealing with fruit just tugged from a fragrant vine, or less advantaged tomatoes, or any of the degrees in between, it is our responsibility to bring out the best in our sauce.Tomatoes “require the cook to appreciate context”, wrote the American food writer and journalist Molly O’Neill in A Well-Seasoned Appetite, her book of words and recipes – a book that seems even more alive now that she has, sadly, gone. That line stuck in my head and reminded me of the most obvious, but often forgotten, thing to consider about tomatoes: their circumstances and conditions. How ripe are they? How taut or fleshy? Are they watery, sweet or acidic? Taste, think, then cook accordingly.Good olive oil is always a good start for fresh tomato sauce – it is the foundation, so lay it well. Less flavourful tomatoes can be cooked in olive oil and garlic, skin on, then passed through a food mill to extract every bit of flavour. A handful of sweet cherry tomatoes, raw or roasted, or a squirt of concentrate, can enhance a kilo of disadvantaged ones. Garlic, peeled and lightly crushed, whispers its sunny fragrance, whereas sliced or diced it roars. Acidic tomatoes can be balanced with a spoonful of sugar (don’t believe anyone who tells you this is not a done thing in Italian sauces). Tomatoes that are already too sweet can be corrected with salt and a dot of vinegar, while wateriness can be cured by patience, and bubbled away.Then there is the dimension of heat, which in Rome means the use of peperoncino, or red chilli, most often used in its dried form. It is nowhere more apparent than in arrabbiata sauce, which literally translates as “angry”, but physically translates as “fiery delight”.The English word “context” comes from the Latin con (together) and texere (to weave). Could there be two better words to describe the coming together – the weaving – of tomatoes, olive oil, garlic, salt, heat and time into a sauce?“Spaghetti o penne?” Silvano asks Alfio in the film Sette Chilli in Sette Giorni, as the two young doctors prepare a clandestine arrabbiata while their patients sleep in the diet clinic. “Penne – si chiama penne al arrabbiata” (“penne – it is called penne all’arrabbiata”) replies an exasperated Alfio, referring to the quill-shaped pasta that is the most familiar shape for this rich, Roman sauce.It is also traditional to add a final swirl of olive oil and a handful of chopped parsley as you toss the sauce with the penne.Prep 20 min (if peeling tomatoes, 5 mins if not)Cook 20 minServes 46 tbsp olive oil2 garlic cloves, peeled and crushed700g fresh plum tomatoes, peeled and coarsely chopped (or tinned, without juice)1-2 small, hot dried chillies, crumbledSalt400g-500g penne1 heaped tbsp chopped parsleyGrated pecorino, to serve (optional)Put the olive oil and garlic in a frying pan. Put the pan over a medium-low heat and let the garlic sizzle gently for a few minutes – do not let it burn – then remove the garlic from the pan.Add the tomatoes to the pan along with the crumbled chilli and a pinch of salt, and cook, covered, for 10 minutes.Remove the lid, turn up the heat under the pan, and cook for another five minutes. By the end of cooking, the sauce should be thick and shiny with a slick of oil.While the sauce is simmering, bring a large pan of water to a boil for the pasta. Add salt, stir, then add the pasta and cook until al dente.Ideally, tip the sauce into a warm bowl, add the drained pasta, parsley and a bit more oil, toss, and then ide between bowls. Otherwise, mix everything in the saucepan and serve directly from there."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1d2459bf31f64f6fd164789785d9c6f7da4afd25/0_107_5076_3046/master/5076.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f39641c5ad0757dc8927a6ab400a3785","title":"arsenal 40m approach crystal palace wilfried zaha","story":"Arsenal have made their first approach for Wilfried Zaha and have indicated they would be willing to pay £40m, falling well short of Crystal Palace’s valuation in what is likely to prove the first act of a saga that could extend to next month’s transfer deadline.Palace have already made clear they value the 26-year-old youth-team graduate closer to £100m given his importance to Roy Hodgson’s team and the fact he signed a five-year contract, worth £130,000 a week, only last summer. They would also be required to pay Manchester United a proportion of any fee, thought to be capped at around £15m, as part of a sell-on clause agreed when Zaha re-signed for the club in January 2015.However, the situation could be complicated if Zaha, who has made clear his desire to leave this summer in the hope of playing European football, now agitates for a move or hands in a formal transfer request. That tactic, while rare these days, would in effect see him waive loyalty bonuses due over the remainder of his contract at Selhurst Park.The player is playing for Ivory Coast at the Africa Cup of Nations, and scored in the 4-1 victory over Namibia on Monday which secured progress into the knockout phase. His brother, Herve, played a role as a consultant for the agency which smoothed Aaron Wan-Bissaka’s £45m move to United over the weekend with a second brother, Judicael, going public on Monday to plead with Palace to lower their valuation and reach agreement with Arsenal for the forward’s departure.Judicael Boris Rodrigue Inchaud, who is listed as a football agent and director of Zaha Promotions at Companies House, told Sky Sports News: “Wilfried will always hold Crystal Palace and their fans in the highest regard and all the support they’ve given means the world to him. It’s my brother’s dream though, to play for Arsenal. Given all Wilfried has given to Palace to help them remain a Premier League club, I hope Palace will be able to see their way to agreeing a deal with Arsenal that allows Wilfried to realise his dream of playing European football for the club he’s supported since childhood.”The prospect of a messy orce from the club with whom Zaha has been associated since he was 12, and for whom he has played 285 games across two spells, looms large. The forward has been unsettled in the past only to go on to sign five-year contracts in each of the last two summers.Ivory Coast’s progression through the tournament in Egypt, and the extended break the player would be granted thereafter, could delay his return to Palace for some time yet, but he will hope some kind of compromise can be reached in his absence.Arsenal’s failure to qualify for the Champions League has severely restricted their transfer budget, though they could try to add value by offering players in part-exchange for Zaha.

Through a financial career first in the City then for 20 years in Hong Kong where he runs a hedge fund, Segantii, with $3.5bn under management, Sadler has not lost a note of his accent, and the Tangerines remained an anchor of home.On an emotional first visit to the club since he bought it from receivers for £10m on 13 June Sadler tries to remain diplomatic and limit himself to describing as “sad” the Oyston tenure, during which he and Gerrity joined the vast majority of fans who observed a four-year boycott of home matches called by the supporters’ trust.“You can use a whole load of words – it was disgraceful, whatever you want,” he concedes, “but more than anything else it was just really, really sad.”A high court judge found in November 2017 that after Blackpool’s modern high point, the single 2010-11 season in the Premier League, the Oystons had “illegitimately stripped” the club of £26.77m while the team and club were drained of investment. That led to the appointment of receivers, Paul Cooper and David Rubin, on behalf of Valeri Belokon, the joint shareholder to whom the Oystons were ordered to pay the same sum, plus his original £4.5m investment in the club.Sadler, not having to deal directly with the Oystons to buy it and encouraged by Gerrity, now a senior prosecutor with the Crown Prosecution Service in the north-west, resolved to grasp the opportunity.“There are three parts to it,” he says of becoming his club’s owner. “One is the realisation of a childhood dream – although it’s beyond a childhood dream. Two, I think it’s going to be really enjoyable I really relish the challenge, I want to get stuck in. I’ve proved I can build a hedge fund. I’ve learned an awful lot in my 28-year business career. I’m sure a lot of it is applicable to the world of football.“Three, there is a civic duty. Somebody had to step up and become the custodian of this club, to make sure that future generations can come here and watch a match, like I did with my dad.”The rebuilding work will need a minimum further investment of £10m, he says, and he returns repeatedly to the glaring lack of training facilities. While the Oystons built a hotel next to the stadium, the first team have been training for years on two local pitches which do not even have a changing block or any permanent buildings.“Having been up to the Premiership, it’s just sad to see how little investment appears to have happened, compared to the amount of money that was in the club,” Sadler says. “I think, to take that money out when investment was needed, was … not the right thing to do. Why have a Travelodge and not Championship-class training facilities?”The money to buy the club, which remains confidential but is said to be around £10m, is his own, not the hedge fund’s, he says, and the further investment required will also come from him personally, with no other investors. The manager, Terry McPhillips, who guided the team to 10th place through trying times last season, is to be retained on a new two-year contract and Sadler hopes to finance new signings this summer as a statement that better times are ahead.Gerrity is a director Steve Rowland, formerly the supporters’ trust secretary, has been appointed the club’s supporter liaison officer and Tim Fielding, a former trust chair who was sued by the Oystons, is an adviser to the board.Sadler acknowledges that football is not pure philanthropy and that with the proper investment and stewardship he could make money, particularly if the club reach the Premier League again, but he insists that is not his motivation.“I don’t want to sound like a messiah but there is a point where I am doing it for the greater good, to put something back,” he says. “Because I grew up here, I enjoyed growing up here, and I left, but I’ve always looked back. Cut me in half and I’m like a stick of Blackpool rock: Blackpool matters to me and this club matters to me. And to have the opportunity to be the person that buys the club and rebuilds it: that’s a great opportunity. But it’s also a great responsibility.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/15ee67db83a4d445edc98bbef6bcc646effa884f/0_92_2293_1375/master/2293.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4ad54d114799aa0a801206253511a7ce","title":"england v usa the copa america and afcon 2019 football weekly podcast","story":"Max Rushden, Barry Glendenning, Lars Sivertsen and Tim Stillman discuss England’s inexorable march to World Cup glory, the USA ‘spygate’ episode, Luis Suárez’s tears, the back streets of Alexandria and Elton JohnJoin the conversation on Facebook, Twitter and email.

My girlfriend has recently lost nearly two stone, going from a size 12 to 10, on an intermittent fasting diet and, while I am proud and pleased she did so, I have noticed I am less physically attracted to her than I once was. I really enjoy my girlfriend’s newfound confidence, but when we have sex now it’s a struggle for me to get aroused and I feel disappointed when reaching for the parts of her body I once enjoyed immensely. I then feel guilty for not being so attracted to her, which makes my internal situation worse.I had this issue with a previous girlfriend. She took it badly and would bring it up in every subsequent argument or failed sexual encounter, quickly ruining the relationship. My current girlfriend has an altogether dimmer view of my preferences and is quite old fashioned when it comes to sex due to her strict Christian upbringing.Your particular erotic triggers are not uncommon. But as you are obviously aware, issues regarding weight gain and loss can be acutely sensitive in our culture – especially for women. There may be a way to subtly help your partner to understand the complexity of your feelings, but careful preparation would be required. Could you very simply and honestly express the duality of your appreciation for her reaching of her health goals versus your focus of attraction? If you decide to attempt this, you must first be very clear in your mind about what exactly you hope to achieve.Being strongly fixated on specific aspects of people (rather than the whole person) can constitute a fetish. And fetishistic interests often mean that – even if one truly loves and respects a partner in most ways – elements of her can be objectified and craved in a way that she might find demeaning. You are clearly somewhat ashamed of this, yet it is part of who you are – something that has developed over a long period of time – probably since childhood.Learn all you can about the psychological and behavioural mechanism of fetishism and try to relate that learning to your own early experiences. In doing so, you may gain greater self-acceptance – and vital insights into how to safely introduce your partner to your real self.• Pamela Stephenson Connolly is a US-based psychotherapist who specialises in treating sexual disorders.• If you would like advice from Pamela on sexual matters, send us a brief description of your concerns to private.lives@the (please don’t send attachments).

By Monday morning, he had been plucked from the crowd at the Other Stage to perform flawlessly in front of thousands – and turned into a social media star.The 15-year-old in a bucket hat from Wells, Somerset, set social media alight with his barnstorming appearance alongside Dave as the pair performed the rapper’s track with AJ Tracey, Thiago Silva – named in honour of the Brazil and Paris Saint-Germain football player. It was, Alex told the , “the best time of his life”.In a widely shared BBC video, Dave – full name David Orobosa Omoregie – asked the crowd: “Who is sober enough to sing these lyrics with me?”Alex, sitting on the shoulders of a friend, was wearing a PSG shirt with Silva’s name on the back, and pulled at the club’s emblem as his companions pointed at him, trying to get Dave’s attention.Dave, who spotted Alex gesticulating, said: “I see a PSG shirt over there, but do you know the lyrics?” After Alex responded with a few confident lines, Dave concluded: “He looks like he knows the lyrics … Yeah, let’s take a chance.”As Alex took to the stage, Dave briefly reassured him he would only need to cover AJ Tracey’s part – but instead, Alex rattled through every single word of the complex, quickfire tune without hesitation, drawing an admiring pat on the back from the slightly upstaged Dave, and the adulation of the crowd.On Monday, the  contacted Alex via his mother, who said that he would be able to speak after he had had a sleep. When fully rested, the teenager said he had no hesitation about heading to the stage after Dave called on him. “I thought he might be joking so I thought I’d better get up as quickly as possible,” he said.He added: “I’m not sure what was going through my head. I was so nervous. I thought: ‘What if I mess up?’ But then I went on stage and performed and it felt so good.”By Monday Alex had received a message from Thiago Silva. The footballer, currently preparing for Brazil’s Copa America semi-final against Argentina on Tuesday, congratulated Alex on his performance, and asked for his number to speak over the phone.“I haven’t spoken to him yet, but we’re in different time zones,” Alex said. “I’m not really sure what I will say to him. I really like him as a player, so I’ll probably just say that.”Dave, a rapper, singer, musician and songwriter from south London, whose rich, personal lyrics have won him a string of hits and an Ivor Novello award, has also been in touch.“He was supportive and said that I would get a lot of messages today and if I needed anything to let him know. He said if it got overwhelming he would be there,” Alex said.“I’ve listened to the song plenty of times, to be fair, but I was worried when I went on stage. I didn’t think I would know all the lyrics but I did … I pick up lyrics quite fast,” he said.After the performance, Alex was stunned by the reaction. “I walked off stage and the security guards took me back down and it was just amazing,” he said. “The way security brought me back down was in front of everyone and I was walking past people who were screaming my name. I had the best time of my life.”He admits the attention has been a lot to take in – but so far Alex is taking it in his stride. “Lots of people have started following me on Twitter and Instagram and liking all my posts … I am not going to let it get to my head too much.”It was the teenager’s first time at the festival and he was there with about 20 friends. “I’ve not been before but my mates said it was one of the best Glastonburys so far. It was so hot and there was a really good atmosphere, no one being aggressive. It was just overall good vibes.”He also sought to correct social media claims that he had not been completely sober for the performance. “It’s funny reading the comments,” he said. “If I was drunk I wouldn’t have been able to remember the lyrics like that.”As for the future, Alex said he had never considered trying to turn his performance skills into a career. Instead, he said, he was “just focused on getting it right” on the day. Still, the reaction from the crowd made him realise he had some talent. “I’d be up for performing with him again,” he said. “And being in a video.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/063e118f573284c6714c6ff156417915f3ce9477/0_490_7244_4345/master/7244.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fc47785e5f4ae5fe8363f01405a739b4","title":"from kylie to miley sunday at glastonbury","story":"The world’s greatest music festival closed out with a hits-packed Cure set – plus choirs, cones and cutesy metalby  Ben Beaumont-Thomas and  Karin AndreassonHangovers, fatigue and accumulated sweat were put aside for one more day in the sun, with the Cure delivering an epic final headlining set.Miley Cyrus proved her rockstar worth, with a set that featured everything from Old Town Road to Nine Inch Nails, via a lot of swearing.Opening the day were the Langa Methodist Church Choir, a Cape Town choir whose grace and beauty soothed many a sore head first thing in the morning.It was a moving performance for Kylie Minogue, who was forced to cancel in 2005 due to a breast cancer diagnosis, and had never returned until now. “Never mind the legends slot next stop, headliner,” said the ’s deputy music editor Laura Snapes.Janelle Monáe and Billie Eilish tore up the West Holts and Other stages respectively.Looking down over the Shangri-La area: Glastonbury’s far eastern corner where activists, ravers and the very, very lost congregate for mind-spinning happenings.Cutesy-slash-terrifying Japanese band Babymetal astonished on the Other stage, with their high-intensity, high-glucose take on metal.Dave, who made one audience member’s dreams come true with a chance to guest on the mic and Years \u0026amp Years, who brought pure pop and queer energy to the Pyramid stage.In the early hours of Sunday morning, Mark Ronson brought his Club Heartbreak concept to the Stonebridge Bar: melancholy yet uplifting dancefloor bangers to – paradoxically? – cure you of a broken heart.Come the morning, Glastonbury was back to its usual self: sitting thoroughly outside of mainstream life, and always for the better.As everyone was contemplating their first cider of the day, the ’s very own Kate Hutchinson played an early set at the Beat Hotel.As you read this, the tent city is being dismantled for another year – but ready to rise again for Glastonbury’s 50th anniversary.

The pseudonymous street artist from the West Country picked the perfect platform yet again this weekend – the Pyramid stage at Glastonbury festival, no less, where Stormzy headlined in a stab-proof vest decorated with a near-monochrome union jack flag. It added a punch of visual tension to his verbal mash-up of modern Britain from knife crime to Boris Johnson. Only after the rousing show did a photo of Stormzy in his discomforting vest appear on Banksy’s instagram with a claim of responsibility: “I made a customised stab-proof vest and thought – who could possibly wear this?”, adding on a separate line: “Stormzy at Glastonbury”.Stormzy, it turned out, had not been simply wearing a stage costume, but art.Of course it is. How did we not see it straight away? The union jack flag has been used as a pop-art icon by musicians from The Who to the Spice Girls. Nor is the idea of body armour as art unheard of: Jake and Dinos Chapman recently exhibited a series of bronze suicide vests that imitate a bronze aqualung created in the 1980s by Jeff Koons. But these artists never thought of getting a grime star to wear their art on the main stage at Glastonbury. Stranger still, Stormzy seems to be the delighted victim of a Banksy prank judging from his tweeted response: “Absolutely fucking speechless.”If so, how did Banksy get Stormzy to wear one of his works unknowingly? Did he leave the vest in the Glastonbury dressing room with a note: “From an anonymous well-wisher?” Surely the rapper was in on the stunt, for the vest was perfectly coordinated with the rest of his show. Its stark design showed up powerfully against the spectacular swirl of multicoloured lights and flashed-up messages. It seems too much to believe that Banksy happened to infiltrate a work of art that balanced the optics of the performance so precisely.It’s more likely that the two are collaborators. After all, they are both masters of modern culture. Stormzy’s set began with a video discussion of the power of culture, and embraced ballet in an interlude celebrating the fact that dancers’ shoes are finally being made to suit black skin tones. Stormzy and Banksy both know that culture is positional and situational. It’s context that makes the comment. Stormzy’s show was a triumph because he so enthusiastically embraced this opportunity – enjoying “the greatest night of my life” – instead of alluding to, what looked like on TV, the overwhelming whiteness of the Glastonbury audience. Because this is about communication and Banksy’s design helped Stormzy speak for England. Stormzy was wearing armour, alluding to contemporary Britain’s wave of knife crime. It resonated with his references to this tragedy – at one point the words “knife crime” were lit up behind him and there was an excerpt from a speech by David Lammy. The black and white tones of the flag, with just a hint of rusty red, like dried blood, were mournful. But images are never as simple as that. Banksy’s artistic weakness in the past – and it’s still a huge limitation if you look at his works in a gallery or isolate them from their context – has been a narrowness and superficiality in saying just one thing. The vest he made for Stormzy is different, though. Its combination of the British flag with an artefact of paranoia is a perfect image of our moment. Stormzy’s tense and provocative stage-garb exploited the flag’s visual strength in a new way. Amid all the stage razzmatazz, he wore the banner of a ided and frightened nation."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/328f487a99fe7368a52e379726f743c43ae5b1af/0_328_1592_955/master/1592.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3d2b1b225136eef6613f36166a62577f","title":"do you think that there is alien life beyond earth first contact","story":"Scientists searching the universe for aliens to conduct survey of the public for views on first contactScientists wrestling with the delicate issue of how to respond should humanity ever be contacted by an alien civilisation have hit on a radical idea: a survey that asks what the public would do.Members of the UK Seti Research Network (UKSRN) are to launch what they believe will be the largest ever survey of public attitudes towards alien contact on Monday at the Royal Society’s summer science exhibition.The views they gather will help them shape plans for an international protocol that sets the ground rules on how organisations should share news of any signals that are detected what sense can be made of them and how, if at all, humans might reply.“There is absolutely no procedure enshrined in international law on how to respond to a signal from an alien civilisation,” said Martin Dominik, an astronomer at the University of St Andrews. “We want to hear people’s views. The consequences affect more people than just scientists.”Beyond sending probes to other planets in the solar system, the search for alien life has largely focused on listening for complex radio signals from outer space with the world’s most powerful telescopes. Last month, astronomers on the Breakthrough Listen project announced they had heard nothing after eavesdropping on more than 1,000 star systems within 160 light years of Earth.But Dominik points out that with 300bn stars in the Milky Way alone, Breakthrough Listen has barely begun the mammoth task of scanning the cosmos for life elsewhere. “If there were tens of quintillions of other civilisations like ours evenly distributed in the Milky Way, the Breakthrough Listen project would not have heard a thing,” he said.Dr John Elliott, a reader in intelligence engineering at Leeds Beckett University, said the global Seti community would announce any bona fide alien signal immediately. But in an era of social media that would spark a flood of fake news and conspiracy theories that leave people utterly confused about the truth, he said.The problem is that while scientists might quickly realise that an intercepted signal was complex enough to be broadcast from an advanced civilisation, it might take weeks or months to understand, if it can be deciphered at all. Any signal could easily be electromagnetic noise from equipment or a snippet of a terrestrial broadcast that leaked into space, unintended for such distant ears.The survey will help scientists work out how best to provide reliable information but also what should be done if it seems only polite to respond to an interstellar missive. The late Stephen Hawking warned that humans would do well not to alert alien civilisations to life on Earth, but other researchers disagree.Later this year, an organisation called Messaging Extraterrestrial Intelligence (Meti) International plans to beam signals into space containing references to the periodic table of elements. They will not be the first attempts to contact ET. In 1974, scientists at the Arecibo telescope in Puerto Rico sent a radio message about life on Earth to a group of stars 25,000 light years away. Given how baffling the message will be to many humans in the 21st century, it is unclear what any recipient will infer from it.“It makes sense to create a legally binding framework that is properly rooted in international law,” Dominik said. “I’m completely comfortable with taking the whole thing above the level of scientists. If there are public consequences of replying and sending out messages that is a political decision and not one to be taken by scientists.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2cc6b8643a7411d2aeacc45da7f4c4baaa3175aa/0_270_1605_963/master/1605.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7fcaf12d75d93ea29a483724e09f06f9","title":"research misconduct claim upheld against former head of ucl lab","story":"A lab run by one of Britain’s foremost academics published fraudulent scientific papers for more than a decade, according to investigators.Work at Prof David Latchman’s laboratory at UCL Institute of Child Health came under scrutiny from senior academics after an anonymous whistleblower alleged that dozens of papers from the lab were doctored.Latchman, a prominent geneticist with hundreds of papers to his name, oversaw research by about two dozen scientists at the laboratory from the early 1990s until 2003 when he became master of Birkbeck, University of London.UCL initially refused to release the reports from two separate misconduct investigations in 2014 and 2015 but finally made them public on Monday.  had requested the documents under the Freedom of Information Act 2000 in January and, after a lengthy delay, referred the case to the Information Commissioner’s Office.The reports show that experts convened by UCL found evidence of research fraud in each of the investigations and called for the doctored papers to be retracted. One panel said fabricated data it had spotted “might be just the tip of the iceberg” and said work in many other papers was “very sloppy”. The studies covered a range of topics from human genetics to heart attacks.While the reports did not claim that Latchman fabricated data himself or had any knowledge of the behaviour, an allegation of research misconduct against him was upheld. “Whilst he did not intentionally commit the misconduct in research identified in this investigation, his recklessness in the conduct of his laboratory and his involvement as author on many publications facilitated that misconduct,” one panel found.The first expert panel checked 28 papers from Latchman’s lab dating back to 1997 and found evidence for research misconduct in eight of them. The second panel examined 32 studies from 1990 to 2013 and found evidence of fraud in seven.One paper published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology contained clear evidence of “cloning”, where copy and paste was used to repeat features throughout an image. In some papers, fabrications were “fundamental” to the conclusions reached by the authors.“In the panel’s view the evidence clearly indicates that the researchers in the laboratory had developed a culture outside the accepted standards of research integrity,” one panel found.A co-author of the second paper, Anastasis Stephanou, who is now at the European University in Cyprus, admitted responsibility for the latter manipulations and said Latchman and the paper’s other authors were “completely unaware” of the changes.Further questions have been raised over dozens of studies from Latchman’s group on the PubPeer website, a forum used by academics to discuss scientific research.UCL said: “These reports concluded that manipulation of research data had occurred in many research papers during the period of Prof David Latchman’s time as head of the unit.”As a result, it said, UCL started formal disciplinary action against a former member of Latchman’s research group, who it did not identify, but the inidual resigned before it was completed. Because Latchman had not intended to commit misconduct in research, there were insufficient grounds for dismissal, the statement added. Latchman no longer supervises research.A disciplinary hearing in September 2018 chaired by a UCL chemist, Prof Richard Catlow, decided that no formal action would be taken against Latchman. Instead it noted that fraud could be hard to detect and recommended UCL “consider the difficulties in leading a research unit” when the head could spend only a small proportion of their time overseeing research. It also urged senior group leaders to consider when they should stop being named authors on papers.A spokesman for Latchman said: “The outcome of this UCL disciplinary hearing has drawn a protracted four-year long ordeal involving publications at UCL to a close. The nature of the manipulation identified in the UCL investigation was such that any fraud would only be apparent to a reviewer who was actively looking for such deception. To subject all research to this disproportionate scrutiny is not reasonable. To then make the assertion that to overlook such deception is ‘inattentive’ or ‘reckless’ is unjust.“Thankfully, UCL have recognised that scientific fraud can be difficult to detect, even in well-run teams, and as such made the decision that no disciplinary action would be taken against Prof Latchman. UCL also recognised that there is a clear need in the training of early-career scientists to instil the highest standards of research ethics, while making clear the consequences of fraudulent behaviour, a sentiment that Prof Latchman has always supported.”Latchman received a CBE in the 2010 birthday honours for services to higher education.

Having restored confidence with a muscle-flexing victory against India, Eoin Morgan’s side meet New Zealand in Chester-le-street on Wednesday looking to cement their place in the final four.There is little question that the centurion Jonny Bairstow and Jason Roy combining for a 160-run opening stand – and Ben Stokes lighting the afterburners with a 54-ball 79 – provided the foundation on which Sunday’s 31-run win at Edgbaston was built.Morgan told his players to remember their methods in previously reaching No 1 in the rankings and this trio of batsmen certainly took heed, delivering purposefully for a total of 337 for seven that asked India to break the World Cup’s record chase in reply.Nevertheless it would be remiss to ignore the role played by two of England’s bowlers who, despite a fine century from Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli’s 66, managed to puncture enough holes in India’s batting to leave MS Dhoni and Kedhar Jadav struggling for boundaries at the end.The five India wickets to fall in this successful strangulation job were shared by Chris Woakes and Liam Plunkett, cricketers who seldom crave the spotlight yet over the course of England’s four-year project have become Morgan’s seam-bowling bankers.Woakes first, whose three successive maidens at the start – during which came a smart caught and bowled to remove the opener KL Rahul – set the tone perfectly.The player teammates have called “The Wizard” ever since a darts tournament in his under-19s days is now being referred to as “Mr Perfect” – and not just because of the impeccable haircut.It relates instead to the 30-year-old’s polished all-round game, two facets of which came to the fore on the ground where, as a Warwickshire junior, he assisted the ground staff during the 2005 Ashes Test.As well as final figures of two for 58 that included the arguably match-sealing wicket of Sharma, caught behind for 102, there was also the spectacular catch in the deep to remove Rishabh Pant.“I actually ed a little early and had to stretch a bit more,” Woakes said, in typically self-effacing fashion. The closest he came to a swell of the head was when told his face had been spotted on a flag in the audience at Glastonbury’s Pyramid stage that day. “That’s brilliant, delighted with that,” he replied, before quickly adding: “That’s embarrassing, actually.”Plunkett, whose three for 55 on returning to the XI included the prized scalp of Kohli slicing to backward point, is a similarly ego-free England seamer.It is a virtue to be this way during the current big-hitting era, even if the squad’s oldest campaigner had been quietly straining to play after sitting out four group games (including, notably, the three defeats by Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Australia).Plunkett, in for Moeen Ali on the day owing to the pitch and a short boundary, said: “We came into this World Cup ranked No 1 and, yes, we’ve had a few defeats. But people are allowed to beat you. People are chomping at the bit to play the best team in the world, so it is good we’ve had our kick up the backside.By his own admission Plunkett is unsubtle in his approach. “I’m not trying to reinvent the wheel or trying to get five for spit. My job is to smash out my length, mix my pace up and pick up crucial wickets” he said. Morgan has said that, if the 34-year-old were a spinner, he would receive more plaudits for the consistent wicket-taking role he performs in the middle overs and you can see where he is coming from.The question now, as England head to Plunkett’s first professional county, Durham, is whether this sentiment translates to an unchanged attack. After receiving said kick in the backside, the return to winning ways has given Morgan a headache."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9042811a032122f2426206c4e9632404e1b6506f/0_104_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5072ab70451d5bf03b962abac5c3cea8","title":"england australia eclipses world cup pinnacle womens cricket","story":"The last time England women won the Ashes was in 2014: Charlotte Edwards was still the captain, neither side were professional, and the majority of the series was not even televised. In the five years since the women’s cricket landscape has fundamentally shifted but one thing has remained a constant: beating Australia is a formidable challenge.That is particularly true given the form which the Women’s Ashes now takes. This will be the fifth series to be played using the multi-format points‑based system, whereby a win in each of the three one-day internationals and three Twenty20 gamess contributes two points towards the final result, in addition to the four points on offer for the one-off Test played mid‑series. With success in each format of the game required in order to claim the trophy, both sides now unequivocally view the Ashes as the pinnacle event in the international calendar - more important than even the World Cup.“It’s a great series to be a part of, one of the big ones in world cricket,” was the verdict of Meg Lanning, Australia’s captain, on the eve of the series opener at Leicester on Tuesday. “Playing against England is always a very tough contest – we’ve got a great rivalry. We’re looking forward to the challenge of playing against a world-class side in their home conditions and we’ll be up for the fight.”England’s captain, Heather Knight, said: “It’s a big series between two really good teams and we’ll both need to be at our best. We’re massively excited and can’t wait to get out there.”Knight, whose side are fresh from whitewashing West Indies in their three-match ODI series last month, said England were “as well prepared as we’ve ever been for a home Ashes series”. That may be so, but it is also true that the challenge of winning back the Ashes has only become more herculean since their opponents retained the trophy at home in late 2017.Australia have now enjoyed almost two years as the only country in the world with a fully professional domestic women’s setup underpinning the national side. In 2017 England actually won the T20 leg of the series 2-1 and ending up tying the series 8-8 but the two sides’ most recent T20 encounter – the World Twenty20 final last November – looked a total mismatch, with Australia winning by eight wickets.Since that tournament England have been bolstered by the return of two Ashes stalwarts, the wicketkeeper Sarah Taylor and frontline pace bowler Katherine Brunt, while their bowling lineup is fortified by the recent renaissance of the seamer Kate Cross.Though their side looks almost identical to that which began against West Indies last month, the coach Mark Robinson has chosen to name a squad only for the first ODI, leaving the door open for one of England’s new kids on the block to force their way in at an early stage in the series. The most likely candidate is the 21-year-old Bryony Smith, who is fresh from an excellent run of form for Surrey and hit 68 against the Australians in last week’s warmup.“It’s brilliant to have a group of players beneath us chomping at the bit, scoring runs, putting pressure on the team to perform and keep getting better,” Knight said. “It’s good for us as a squad – pressure for your place will bring out the best in us.“No team is perfect but we’re hard-working, humble and resilient and we’re also not short of match-winners. That’s a good place to be and hopefully we can bring our best to this series.”They will be up against an Australia side who are a potent mix of household names – Meg Lanning, Ellyse Perry and Alyssa Healy – and young prospects – the 20-year-olds Georgia Wareham and the pace bowler Tayla Vlaeminck. The wicketkeeper Healy is enjoying the most productive period of her career, fresh from being crowned player of the tournament at the World T20, while the leg-spinner Wareham – who made her debut in September 2018 – will relish her first opportunity to try out her wares on English pitches. The fact that for the first time an Australia A squad is touring England concurrently with the main side also places more options at coach Matthew Mott’s disposal, should form or fitness necessitate.“The new ball battle for both sides is going to be important,” Lanning said. “Both sides have got world‑class opening bowlers and batters, and whoever wins that battle will go a long way to winning the game. We feel like we’ve got some good firepower up there with bat and ball to combat what they can throw at us.”England have made a big song and dance recently about their winning streak: they are now 14 games unbeaten on the bounce. They will certainly have their work cut out for them if that record is to remain intact over the next few weeks."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1f12fdda9adfb0f443b4ae38fece25fcfbd9c027/676_52_4941_2965/master/4941.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9c90f06f06c38dd8bf8cae27c5452b1f","title":"rose mcgowan edinburgh harvey weinstein me too","story":"Her revelations about Harvey Weinstein sparked #MeToo. Now, as the disgraced mogul’s trial approaches, the actor is back with an Edinburgh showSometimes Rose McGowan can say his name, and sometimes she chooses not to. In her memoir, Brave, published last year, he is known only as “the Monster”, his face likened to a melted pineapple. Interviewed by the  a few months ago, she refused to discuss him at all. Now, perched by the fountains on the Barbican estate in London on a warm spring afternoon, she refers to him at first as “the bad guy in my life”. When she goes on to mention him by name, it is with a casualness that makes me wonder if I’ve misheard her. “Some days it’s a bullet and other times I can handle it,” she says. “It depends how much of an onslaught I’ve gotten so far that day. But we all know who it is.”It would be impossible not to. The #MeToo movement that emerged in 2017 after multiple allegations of rape and sexual assault were levelled at the Miramax boss Harvey Weinstein — allegations he continues to deny in the run-up to his trial this September – amounts to the defining social and cultural revolution of the century so far. And the 45-year-old McGowan, who was already the star of the queer, nihilistic indie romp The Doom Generation and the horror-comedy Scream when she alleges she was raped by Weinstein at the Sundance film festival in 1997, was at the forefront. “I’ve been called one of the first to speak out. No. I was the first. I called the New York Times. I blew it wide open, not them. They won the Pulitzer and I’m the one hard-up for money. It’s disgusting. I was kind of grossed out by how much they enjoyed being lauded.”All this is said plainly and softly throughout our conversation, McGowan rarely even resorts to hand gestures for emphasis. The impression is of someone composed and contained, a woman who has already done her raging in private, or on the page, or occasionally in public confrontations. A heckler at a bookshop event last year, for instance, demanded to know what McGowan had ever done for trans women in prison her furious response – “What have you ever done for women?” – was interpreted in the ensuing controversy as a slight on trans people. “Whenever I say ‘women’, I’m including trans women,” she tells me now. “I don’t separate the two. It was disgusting that I was mischaracterised, considering all the work I’ve done for the betterment of the planet. I’ve been actively involved in LGBT rights most of my life.” Online commentators were swift to “cancel” her. “How dare they! Well, they can cancel me but I can cancel them, too.”Today, however, all is serene. With her pale face and bleached platinum crop, McGowan is rendered nebulous in the bright sunshine, so at times she appears to be little more than a pair of black sunglasses and scarlet lips suspended in the haze. Mentally, too, there is a calmness about her. She picked over the traumas in her life for the three years that it took her to write Brave, and is ready to try to put them behind her: “It’s been the fight of my life but I’m not going to be defined by it.”She has just returned from the Venice Biennale, where she starred in Tonia Arapovic’s video installation Indecision IV. Now she’s preparing Planet 9, a music and spoken-word show that shares its name with the electronic album she made while writing Brave (“Recording it kept me sane”). Planet 9 was dreamed up by McGowan when she came to the US as a child from Tuscany, where her parents had been members of the Children of God cult. “I hated America so much. The only alternative was to shut my eyes in class and go to Planet 9 in my mind. It’s this idealised place where we can all go it elevates us. I used to wonder what the sound frequencies were like there. I was a strange 10 year old.”It has provided escape and tranquility throughout her life. “I find it hard to be in this world. This planet has been quite treacherous for me, and it’s a fight every day to want to stay here because I’d really rather go somewhere else. That’s why Planet 9 exists. It’s like meditation.” What does she see when she’s there? “I’ve always imagined orbs floating around me. Orbs and circles.” If the music works, she says, it should make listeners feel high without taking drugs. Then she peers into my eyes and recites the album’s opening lyrics: “Are you lonely on your planet? Are you lonely on the fringe?” I blink back at her, not quite sure whether an answer is expected.A different sort of fringe – the one in Edinburgh – will host the world premiere of the show, which will be accompanied by some unusual visuals. An associate of Weinstein “stole naked photos and videos from me, which ended up on Pornhub,” she says. “What I’ve done is take back two of my videos – they’re not explicit, it’s just me walking around – and projected them side by side, then filmed the projections and slowed them down.” These will form part of the Planet 9 performance she may also read from the passages in Brave about healing. The rest will be “me and the music. No band. I’ll take the hit. That’s what I do: being brave to inspire others. I directed a movie, after all.”And a good one at that: Dawn, a 15-minute short she made in 2014 about the violent abuse of a young girl, was her way of telling her own story before she was ready to name names. “It shows what happens when we send girls out in the world to be polite.” At Sundance with Weinstein, she recalls, she was politeness personified. “It was a meeting with my boss. I’d already done two movies for his company and we were supposed to be discussing my future. And then that became my future.” Dawn served a purpose. “It was about me, metaphorically. But we’ve reached a point now in society where it’s not the time for metaphors. We can’t afford them.”That film’s disguised confessional was followed in 2015 by an act of incendiary directness. Horrified by the note on an audition script she received for a new Adam Sandler comedy (“push-up bras encouraged”), McGowan shared it on social media. When that prompted her agency to sack her, she posted about that, too: “I just got fired by my wussy acting agent because I spoke up about the bullshit in Hollywood. Hahaha.”A year later, she tweeted all the reasons why she hadn’t gone to the police about her then-unnamed attacker one was that she had been advised she would never win in court against him because she had appeared in sex scenes. She was getting bolder by the tweet. “Trump had a lot to do with it. He showed in a black-and-white way what sexual harassment really is.”When the allegations against Weinstein became public knowledge, some of his former colleagues issued statements of shock and disgust. I ask if any of her male directors got in touch to express support: perhaps Gregg Araki, who made The Doom Generation? Quentin Tarantino, who directed her in Death Proof? Or her ex-boyfriend, Robert Rodriguez, who cast her in Planet Terror as a go-go dancer whose leg is torn off by zombies and replaced with an assault rifle? “Yuck. No. Of course not. Never. They’re weak.” She has about as much time for them as she does for men who worry that #MeToo has endangered harmless flirting. “That whole ‘If I can’t abuse you, how am I gonna get my way?’ thing. Try being human. Try being nice. It might work out for you. Don’t rape and we’re good.”Brave has been a galvanising success – as if to prove it, a passerby calls out to McGowan from a walkway above us, raising her fist in solidarity – and she is now at work on the follow-up, Trust. “It’s about making the choice to trust people despite every single disgusting thing that’s been done to me. If I didn’t, my abusers would have won.” Acting, she insists, is in the past. “I miss performing. But my career was stolen.” She feels part of a lost generation of actors whose prospects dwindled mysteriously after they tried to resist Weinstein’s attacks: Ashley Judd, Annabella Sciorra and Mira Sorvino are among the others blacklisted, their names besmirched. “We all got stolen. And we were all very good at our jobs. That’s the other crime in all this.”How is she feeling about the forthcoming trial? “I’m so scared for the women brave enough to testify. I would’ve done so, had so much time not elapsed. I fear for them because they’re going to be savaged by his lawyer. I send them all my strength because they’re going to need it.” And where will she get her strength? Will anyone – perhaps her partner, the model Rain Dove – look after her? She thinks this over. “I’ve never really asked people to take care of me,” she says. “I don’t know what that looks like.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b26dda99a535eabf53432c699541fad422a65fc0/0_169_2553_1531/master/2553.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f19d0f44fef12603599064222aa1bc51","title":"english cardinal john newman to be declared a saint","story":"Newman is regarded as one of the most influential figures from 19th-century BritainOne of the most significant figures in 19th-century Britain is to be declared a saint by Pope Francis.Cardinal John Newman will be canonised in a ceremony in St Peter’s Square in Vatican City on 13 October, almost 130 years after he died. He will be the first English person born since the 17th century to be declared a saint by the Catholic church.Newman was ordained as a priest in the Church of England but converted to Catholicism in 1845. He is regarded as one of the most influential figures from his era for both Anglicanism and Roman Catholicism, revered for his hymns and poetry and for his devotion to the people of Birmingham.He was a powerful preacher and founded the Birmingham Oratory religious community. When he died in 1890, more than 15,000 people lined the city’s streets for his funeral procession.Pope John Paul II declared Newman “venerable” in 1991, recognising his life of “heroic virtue”. In 2010, on a visit to the UK, Pope Benedict XVI declared him “blessed”, saying Newman applied “his keen intellect and his prolific pen to many of the most pressing subjects of the day.” Newman continued “to inspire and enlighten many all over the world,” Benedict added.A second miracle attributed to Newman – the healing in 2013 of a woman with life-threatening complications in her pregnancy - was approved by Pope Francis this year, paving the way to his canonisation.In 2008 a decision to move Newman’s remains to a new tomb in Birmingham Oratory in preparation for his canonisation was criticised by the gay rights campaigner Peter Tatchell and others.They argued that it contravened his written wish to be buried next to his close friend Fr Ambrose St John. The oratory said the order had come from the Vatican. Tatchell said it was “an act of shameless dishonesty and personal betrayal by the homophobic Catholic church”.Cardinal Vincent Nichols, archbishop of Westminster, said of Monday’s announcement: “This is a moment of great pride … John Henry Newman is known for many great qualities, but we remember him particularly for the kindness and compassion of his ministry to the people of Birmingham.”Christopher Foster, the Anglican bishop of Portsmouth and co-chair of the English and Welsh Anglican-Roman Catholic Committee, said: “The canonisation of Blessed John Henry Newman is very good news for the Catholic church in England and Wales, and we give thanks with them for this recognition of a holy life formed in both our communions that continues to be an inspiration for us all.”Sally Axworthy, the British ambassador to the Holy See, said: “Cardinal Newman had a major impact on Catholic theology and on education worldwide, making him a truly global Briton. He brought his experience from the Anglican church to his work as a Catholic, bridging the two traditions.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ebc4c93855dddd434a4eb19b0e206dee9d7c916c/833_756_4920_2952/master/4920.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=612cc87fddf76f589b40a26fb997fe78","title":"shanghai etiquette classes in pictures","story":"Against a soundtrack of classical music, children learn social skills, dining manners and deportment – hence the books on their heads to teach them how to walk gracefully.

Photograph: iStockTelecommunications is among the most complex industries in the world highly regulated, massively expensive, and central to the success of business, education and government, it is one of the foundations that modern economies are built on. It also reaches - or doesn’t, as the case may be - into every home, and every wallet, in the country. This makes it a political livewire. Eir’s latest missive is unlikely to clarify things, so here are some key questions answered. Why is Eir now talking about €500 million when it claimed it was able to deliver rural broadband for €1 billion last week?The €1 billion figure that Eir unleashed last week is the company’s estimate for delivering the objectives of the National Broadband Plan right now, if it were allowed to. After they published this suggestion, the Taoiseach questioned in the Dail why its indicative bid, made before it dropped out of the process, was €2.751 billion.Eir has now shared an analysis with the Department which claims that the strict conditions imposed by the state on the NBP drove the figure higher. Their analysis, which was conducted at the time it was putting in its bid, says the subsidy could have been as low as €512 million, and would have fallen in a range between that figure and just over €1.5 billion. However, given how the Government wanted to proceed, the company says it had no choice but to submit the higher bid.So if Eir’s claiming it could have delivered rural broadband for €512 million back then, why is it saying it would cost €1 billion now?Effectively, it is saying that absolute best case scenario, the Government subsidy could have been as low as €512 million, but its current estimate is around the €1 billion mark, a figure that the company is confident in as things stand.What does all this mean? The new figure underlines Eir’s central argument about the NBP: that it is an expensive, cumbersome way to achieve the delivery of rural broadband. Of course, these are just paper exercises. Eir is not burdened by having to deliver on these figures, at least so long as the NBP remains in place. What does the Government say?Throughout this, the Government’s point has been that the very things which Eir claims are unnecessarily adding costs are the things that will ensure a good outcome for the state. Namely, a transparent process that leaves a better functioning market and ensures that if the NBP winner enjoys unexpectedly profitable outcomes, the State will be able to claw some money back. It also counters that Eir’s bid is effectively unrealistic, that it contains no budget for contingencies and assumes a very low level of repairs.What’s more, the Department is concerned about the State aid and competition law implications in the Eir plan, particularly the fact that it would waive the €900 million it plans to charge the Granahan McCourt consortium for access to its network of telecoms poles. Whose approach would be cheaper?This, of course, is the all important question. Neither would be cheap, and they would cost in different ways. For example, the subsidy level dictated by NBP is a higher cost to the taxpayer, but the way Eir is suggesting it would charge for connections could be significantly more in the long run than under NBP. For example, the cost of connecting under NBP is a once off €100. Under Eir’s plan, this is €170, but that gets charged every time a consumer changes broadband provider. This is charged to the broadband provider, but they almost certainly pass it on to the consumer. As people change more over the longer term, this begins to add up. There’s also the issue of difficult connections like a boherereen the middle of nowhere. The Government says some 81,000 could be hit with big connection fees, Eir says that figure is much lower, around 9,000. So whose approach is cheaper? Short answer: depends who you ask. Is the Nationl Broadband Plan in danger?It would be more accurate to ask when has the NBP not been in danger. The Government is almost certain to shoot Eir’s proposal down, but the NBP has proven to be a magnet for controversy, so this is unlikely to be its last challenge.

Photograph: Marc O’SullivanTelecoms company Eir could have delivered the National Broadband Plan (NBP) for a government subsidy as low as €512 million, according to a letter from company.This figure is significantly below the current projected €2.97 billion government subsidy for the preferred bidder in the €5 billion National Broadband Plan. However, according to Eir, delivering on the €512 million figure would have required changes being made to the process and some restrictions relaxed. The €512 million figure is contained in a letter sent by Eir chief executive Carolan Lennon to the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment last week, and seen by The .The figure is based on a financial analysis conducted by Eir shortly before it left the National Broadband Plan bidding process. Ultimately the company’s indicative bid in the original bidding process was €2.751 billion, as was disclosed in the Dáil by Taoiseach Leo Varadkar last week. However, the financial analysis undertaken before Eir dropped out of the bidding process, and now shared with the Department, uses two alternative cases which allowed the company to “(use) more commercial assumptions and better leveraging our existing infrastructure would have produced a subsidy requirement of between €0.5 billion and €1.5 billion.”Last week Eir suggested it could now independently deliver the objectives of the National Broadband Plan for €1 billion. The lower subsidy alluded to in the letter may again raise questions over the choices made by the State in designing the National Broadband Plan.In the letter, Ms Lennon also suggests that staying in the race for the National Broadband Plan could have had a “catastrophic” impact on Eir’s business. The telecoms company states that the strict rules covering the national broadband plan would have had a “contagion” effect on the rest of its business.Eir is effectively arguing that the Government’s proposed approach to delivering rural broadband could have presented a fundamental threat to the company’s capacity to continue operating and delivering broadband in the rest of the country.The company’s argument is that rules the Government is seeking to impose on the winning National Broadband Plan bidder would eventually become the common standard across the country. These rules include higher levels of customer service and lower prices offered to broadband providers operating within the so-called “intervention area” of 512,000 rural premises covered by the NBP.“By designing a process that would have forced Eir to offer better wholesale prices and access, better service levels and lower prices for approximately 20 per cent of our network, it ensured that eir would ultimately be forced to offer those same elements across the other 80 per cent of our business should eir have stayed in the NBP.”This, the company says “could have had a catastrophic effect on the rest of our business”, and would have raised “the very real and highly concerning issues of contagion, where regulatory equivalence would force eir to offer those onerous services and prices across the country as a whole”. The company also argues in its letter that the envisaged levels of oversight in the NBP “are unnecessary for Eir”, as it is already regulated by ComReg. Elsewhere in the letter, the company complains that both the Department and the Minister for Communications, Richard Bruton, have “erroneously” made the claim that removing 300,000 premises from the NBP, which Eir is serving commercially, led to an increase in the subsidy that is being paid to the Granahan McCourt led consortium which is delivering the Government’s plan.The letter argues that the predicted subsidy level of €787 million which was in place in April 2017 - after the 300,000 premises were removed - was lower than the predicted €1 billion subsidy that was in place prior to the removal of the premises.“I would be grateful if the Department would clarify the facts in relation to what has been a successful projects,” Eir chief executive Carolan Lennon writes in the letter. However the Department of Communications has said Eir’s alternative plan “has not met” the State’s criteria for the roll-out of high-speed connections.It is the clearest indication to date that the Government will formally reject the €1 billion proposal by Eir.

A report by the London School of Economics (LSE) into children’s attitudes towards the internet found they overwhelmingly wanted a ‘grand erasure’ of their online footprint to stop childhood mistakes affecting their future.The research, which was funded by the Information Commissioner\u0027s Office, also found that children were generally trusting of tech companies in the same way they are of their schools.LSE researchers reviewed more than a decade’s worth of studies into children’s understanding of their online data and also conducted focus groups with more than 160 secondary school-age children.Professor Sonia Livingstone, who led the research, said children were generally “outraged” when they learned how much of their personal information is being hoarded online and wanted “a fresh start” when they turned 18.She said: “They say ‘whatever I do before I am 18 should be wiped off’ as it shouldn’t have any effect on them as an adult. They want a kind of grand erasure because they talk about the importance of making mistakes and just being kids trying things out.”The Government is currently looking at a range of new measures to better protect children online including imposing a legal duty of care on tech giants and introducing an Age Appropriate Design Code, which will mean social media giants will have to assume users are children if they can\u0027t age verify them.Duty of Care white paperMost social media companies have a minimum age of 13, but due to the lack of proper age checks the study found children as young as nine said they had profiles.The study found that children generally took instructions they received online on “face value” and often didn’t understand how tech companies were commercially benefiting from the information they handed over. As a result, they found it “puzzling” that internet companies often asked them to give out details they did not see as relevant to the service.The children interviewed were also shocked to learn that material they thought they had deleted could still exist online and wanted “delete to mean delete” when it came to social media.Other features children wanted from tech companies were a way to see which other companies their details had been shared with and “child-friendly mechanisms” to edit their information.Prof Livingstone said the children were generally mystified as to why tech companies were interested in personal information they saw as quickly going out of date as they grew up.She added: “Creepy is a really common word that they use. It’s creepy and sinister that all that data is being kept.”Duty of Care CampaignHong Kong protests: riot police retake parliament after firing tear gas to clear crowdsCardinal John Henry Newman to be become first English saint in 50 years, Pope confirmsComment: Crushing dissent in Hong Kong will not be as easy for China as Tiananmen SquareCambridge University accused of racism for allowing non-black lecturer to say N-word in classProtesters gather in Sudan after three bodies found next to school Anti-vaxxer paid compensation by Cardiff University after being kicked off their course for their beliefsDisgraced vice-Chancellor who resigned amid watchdog inquiry awarded a £270,000 \u0026#39golden goodbye\u0026#39 Comment:  In the race to replace Juncker, the EU\u0026#39s sleight of hand reminds us why we voted LeaveTory leadership race: John Bercow blocks fresh attempt to prevent no deal BrexitSales in beer fall by a third in 10 years as young people drive popularity in alcohol free drinks, report revealsBody fell into south London garden from plane heading to Heathrow, police believeDuchess of Cambridge delights children in her Back to Nature gardenFewer English students to be admitted to Scotland\u0026#39s medical schools under new SNP policyWorld watches China\u0026#39s reaction to Hong Kong protests as fears of military involvement grow Emmanuel Macron decries \u0026#39tainted\u0026#39 EU after Brussels fails to agree an heir to Jean-Claude JunckerComment: Sorry, Mr Hunt – Leavers simply can\u0026#39t trust you to deliver BrexitMother killed during school run had been moved to safehouse just weeks earlier, court hearsGeorge Osborne announces orce from wife Frances after 21 years of marriageGermany and Italy face off in row over arrest of migrant ship captainComment: I\u0026#39m an ultra-competitive sports day mum - and there\u0026#39s nothing wrong with thatWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/technology/2019/04/21/TELEMMGLPICT000032877532_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqwDgGh3pkom49KxtKngnUa36K9dyKixjq8GqZuuMTIBE.jpeg?imwid","title":"need first amendment internet counter troubling censorship social","story":"The repercussions of companies with an effective monopoly on our news using their position to impose ‘values’ should concern us allFor all its focus on ersity, Silicon Valley is about as ideologically erse as a vegan powwow The advent of modern technology has brought us extraordinary freedoms.

Ms Seresin and her peers found the experience of speaking in front of senior faculty members “intimidating”, adding that they felt as though they were on trial.  “Many of those present seemed simply unable to comprehend the difference between a black writer reclaiming the n-word and a nonblack Cambridge lecturer or student saying it aloud in class,” she said.“We also faced hostility regarding the idea that different rules applied to black and nonblack lecturers, even though beyond Cambridge this is a widely accepted principle and for obvious reasons does not constitute a double standard.”Ms Seresin explains how this incident - as well as the lack of black lecturers and postdoctoral researchers at Cambridge and her pessimism about the progress of efforts to “decolonise” the curriculum - left her convinced of the “pervasive” racism.She also cited the case last year where a Cambridge academic went on strike after claiming that a porter’s refusal to call her “doctor” is racist. Ms Seresin acknowledged that her decision to leave Cambridge mid-way through her PhD “comes from a position of privilege, including racial privilege”, adding that those who remain at the university need not be “condemned for their complicity”.Ms Seresin, who was educated at Camden School for Girls, a former grammar school in north London which counts the actress Emma Thompson and the ex-Spice Girl Geri Halliwell among it alumni.She went on to read Comparative Literature and Studies of Women, Gender, and Sexuality at Harvard University, and then completed an MA at Cambridge before starting her doctorate.A Cambridge University spokesman said: “The Teaching Forum, which included students, met and following a well-informed exchange of views it was decided that there should be no prescriptive rules on what language is appropriate to reference when reading from texts, but that academics should consider the contemporary and political discourse around particular words or terms.”The spokesman added that the university strives to create a culture “free from racism, discrimination, prejudice and harassment”.They said they have introduced a number of prevention initiatives and anonymous reporting options to make it easier for staff and students to report harassment or discrimination.Hong Kong protests: riot police retake parliament after firing tear gas to clear crowdsCardinal John Henry Newman to be become first English saint in 50 years, Pope confirmsComment: Crushing dissent in Hong Kong will not be as easy for China as Tiananmen SquareProtesters gather in Sudan after three bodies found next to school Anti-vaxxer paid compensation by Cardiff University after being kicked off their course for their beliefsDisgraced vice-Chancellor who resigned amid watchdog inquiry awarded a £270,000 \u0026#39golden goodbye\u0026#39 Comment:  In the race to replace Juncker, the EU\u0026#39s sleight of hand reminds us why we voted LeaveTory leadership race: John Bercow blocks fresh attempt to prevent no deal BrexitSales in beer fall by a third in 10 years as young people drive popularity in alcohol free drinks, report revealsBody fell into south London garden from plane heading to Heathrow, police believeDuchess of Cambridge delights children in her Back to Nature gardenFewer English students to be admitted to Scotland\u0026#39s medical schools under new SNP policyWorld watches China\u0026#39s reaction to Hong Kong protests as fears of military involvement grow Emmanuel Macron decries \u0026#39tainted\u0026#39 EU after Brussels fails to agree an heir to Jean-Claude JunckerComment: Sorry, Mr Hunt – Leavers simply can\u0026#39t trust you to deliver BrexitMother killed during school run had been moved to safehouse just weeks earlier, court hearsGeorge Osborne announces orce from wife Frances after 21 years of marriageGermany and Italy face off in row over arrest of migrant ship captainComment: I\u0026#39m an ultra-competitive sports day mum - and there\u0026#39s nothing wrong with thatWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/07/01/TELEMMGLPICT000188442663_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqqwwNAECrD5S6hf9oI2CkB7nKN2gkuj54lIvZPHScwJk.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"cardinal john henry newman made saint pope confirms first english","story":"A portrait of Cardinal John Henry NewmanCardinal John Henry Newman will be made a saint, the Pope has announced, making him the first English person to be canonised in almost 50 years.The respected religious scholar, who dedicated himself to helping the poor and sick, died in 1890 aged 89.Newman founded the Birmingham Oratory in 1849 and also helped found what is now University College Dublin.Pope Francis announced that his canonisation will be held on October 13.The last canonisation in England and Wales was in 1970 when Pope Paul VI made 40 English and Welsh martyrs saints.

So many of them loved hopping over the stone and that\u0027s so nice to see.Mr Catling said after speaking to the duchess: This was just a field and we brought in 18 articulated lorries worth of stuff in and we had a team of up to 20 people to build it.He added that Kate had requested the path across the water feature for George: We made the stepping stones because Prince George wanted them. The kids loved jumping across it and it was down to Kate we got that in.The Duchess visited the site near Kingston in south-west London last Tuesday to help with the planting, and Mr Catling said she had been a useful member of the team.He said: She was very hands on, it was fantastic. She came and did lots of planting and directing everyone around and got involved in the mulching.The Duchess has a longstanding interest in the early years development of children, and believes spending time outdoors plays a pivotal role in the future health and happiness of youngsters.Kate first guided youngsters from local Hampton Hill Junior School supported by Place2Be, a children\u0027s mental health charity, around her garden on an insect hunt, then took a group of children from Anna Freud Centre, Evelina Children\u0027s Hospital and Action for Children for a tour.The Duchess of Cambridge visits the Hampton Court Flower Festival with children from Hampton Hill junior school at Hampton Court Palace.She told some of the children pinecones had been hidden in the garden for them to find, adding: There are eight, Charlotte helped me find them.The stepping stones proved a little taxing for Daniel Naghi, 10, from Hampton Hill, he said: I slipped and fell and it started bleeding. One of the teachers came and gave me a plaster and I went straight back into the garden I loved it.The duchess who came to see us was really nice and I think she helped make the garden.She asked me about snails but I didn\u0027t see any but loved the treasure hunt and think the garden is pretty good.His schoolmate Kane Dare, aged nine, said the duchess told him about an unusual visitor to the garden: Kate said there were foxes in the garden which had left half eaten sandwiches.Duchess of CambridgeHong Kong protests: riot police retake parliament after firing tear gas to clear crowdsCardinal John Henry Newman to be become first English saint in 50 years, Pope confirmsComment: Crushing dissent in Hong Kong will not be as easy for China as Tiananmen SquareCambridge University accused of racism for allowing non-black lecturer to say N-word in classProtesters gather in Sudan after three bodies found next to school Anti-vaxxer paid compensation by Cardiff University after being kicked off their course for their beliefsDisgraced vice-Chancellor who resigned amid watchdog inquiry awarded a £270,000 \u0026#39golden goodbye\u0026#39 Comment:  In the race to replace Juncker, the EU\u0026#39s sleight of hand reminds us why we voted LeaveTory leadership race: John Bercow blocks fresh attempt to prevent no deal BrexitSales in beer fall by a third in 10 years as young people drive popularity in alcohol free drinks, report revealsBody fell into south London garden from plane heading to Heathrow, police believeFewer English students to be admitted to Scotland\u0026#39s medical schools under new SNP policyWorld watches China\u0026#39s reaction to Hong Kong protests as fears of military involvement grow Emmanuel Macron decries \u0026#39tainted\u0026#39 EU after Brussels fails to agree an heir to Jean-Claude JunckerComment: Sorry, Mr Hunt – Leavers simply can\u0026#39t trust you to deliver BrexitMother killed during school run had been moved to safehouse just weeks earlier, court hearsGeorge Osborne announces orce from wife Frances after 21 years of marriageGermany and Italy face off in row over arrest of migrant ship captainComment: I\u0026#39m an ultra-competitive sports day mum - and there\u0026#39s nothing wrong with thatWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/07/01/TELEMMGLPICT000069723025_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"licence fee payers support big salaries stars like gary lineker","story":"BBC sources described Lineker as an \u0026#39outstanding broadcaster\u0026#39Arts and Entertainment EditorLicence-fee payers support the BBC paying a seven-figure salary to Gary Lineker, the director-general has claimed, as he said the public wants the corporation to retain talented and entertaining stars.As the BBC publishes its annual report on Tuesday, Lord Hall of Birkenhead defended its high salaries. Lineker will head the list of top earners once again, with a salary of £1.75-1.76 million per year.“There’s a regular debate about whether we should pay what we do for the biggest stars like Gary Lineker, Graham Norton or Zoe Ball. I accept they get big salaries - in total around one per cent of our content spend.“But they also front some of the biggest shows on TV and radio: programmes that account for 40 per cent of viewing and listening to the BBC,” Lord Hall said.“They would earn significantly more elsewhere - and recent departures to commercial rivals show this argument isn’t hollow.”The biggest salary cuts in the BBCLord Hall said the amount spent on presenter salaries as a proportion of the BBC’s entire budget has come down this year but added: “More importantly, whenever we ask the public whether they want big stars on the BBC they say yes. They say yes because they are talented and entertaining. They also say yes as it means they are getting big value from the BBC.”Lineker is paid so highly despite the fact his contract is not exclusive and allows him to host Champions League coverage for one of the corporation’s rivals, BT Sport.His fee for last year covered around 30 editions of Match of the Day, FA Cup coverage, the Sports Personality of the Year Awards and the World Cup.A BBC source said: “Gary Lineker is both a former footballer of the highest pedigree and an outstanding broadcaster. The football market is incredibly competitive, not just for rights but for talent.”Lord Hall based his assertion about licence fee payers’ approval of high salaries on an Ipsos MORI survey it commissioned in July 2017, which said: “Getting the highest quality presenters, actors, actresses, directors and news reporters is competitive as these people are in demand from many broadcasters. If it means paying similar to what other broadcasters pay, what do you think the BBC should do?”It found that 78 per cent of respondents agreed with the statement: “The BBC should be able to try to get the highest quality presenters, actors and reporters for its programmes and services.”Lord Hall has defended the high salaries of some of the BBC talentGraham Norton remains one of the BBC’s highest earners, for his weekly Radio 2 show and other projects, although his fee for his BBC One chat show is not included in the figures due to a loophole that allows salaries to be hidden if they are from programmes made by independent production companies.Zoe Ball enters the top 10 for the first time after taking over the Radio 2 breakfast show from Chris Evans.Lord Hall said it is a “myth” that the BBC is wasteful, claiming that the corporation made over £150 million of efficiency savings last year by cutting back office roles. He said a rise in head count is partly due to hiring people in-house to do jobs that were previously outsourced.He said: “I of course believe the BBC should always be under heavy scrutiny. That comes with accepting money from the public. Where we get things wrong we need to make changes and be better. We aren’t perfect. But I do think the BBC is part of what makes this country special.”The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

Shame on Labourit backs them, and on any Tories who join them.MPs have repeatedly promised to honour Brexit. Yet they reject the only deal on offer and the EU refuses to improve it. No Deal isn’t The Sun’s favoured option, but it IS the logical and inevitable consequence of their game-playing.Grieve hopes instead to stop Brexit . . . by blackmailing his own Government and, sickeningly, holding a gun to the heads of the poor both here and abroad.But No Deal would still be the default. And funding would have to be immediately restored. Grieve is madhe thinks anyone but him and his Remainer friends will be blamed for targeting benefit claimants, OAPs and schools.Their conceit is repugnant. Even Theresa May, normally one to mince her words, calls them “grossly irresponsible”.This Cabinet lacks resolve, but our new one must unite to face down the wreckers. Boris Johnson is right to say there would be no place in his for those unwilling to back No Deal as a last resort.If it means exile for Amber Rudd and her allies, so be it. Voters have had enough of MPs and ministers issuing threatsthey don’t get their way.WE are sick of Theresa May trying to inflict damaging policies on her successor to establish a “legacy” in her last days.Her new milkshake tax must be thrown out. There is no credible case for it.The Government says the fizzy drinks levy “succeeded” because makers cut sugar in their recipes. Rubbish. The sole point was to make people less fat, and it hasn’t. If it’s failed on that, it’s failed.Spreading this folly to milkshakes compounds the stupidity.Voters will flock to a new Tory PM who champions consumer choice and puts nanny state zealots back in their box.It’s a sweet prospect.ONLY leftie class warriors could fail to admire a graduate who sets up a viable company and creates jobs.Entrepreneurs are our economy’s leblood, providing work for millions and putting food on families’ tables.So we welcome Jeremy Hunt’s pledge to wipe out their student debtthey launch a start-up hiring more than ten people for five years.Too few graduates do so.

Are you just putting the case for Remain ”After the interview in March, viewers complained that Miss Bundock was “rude and biased” but the BBC responded: “We’re satisfied that by the end of the interview Mr Martin was able to put across his argument in full.”Now however the objections have been upheld by the corporation’s more senior Executive Complaints Unit.It ruled: “It would have been easy for viewers to form the impression that the presenter held a distinct view of her own on Mr Martin’s support for leaving the EU without a deal, and the interview fell short of the BBC’s standards of due impartiality in that respect.”The statement added: “It has been stressed to the presenter that the way questions are framed should make it clear to the audience that this is for the proper purpose of impartial challenge and that a personal view is not being expressed.”Meanwhile the fallout from BBC One’s disastrous Tory leadership debate continues.New figures show a massive , viewers complained about last week’s show, with most alleging “bias against Boris Johnson” as well as favouring “contributions from the south of England”.Earlier this week The Sun revealed that the BBC had admitted presenter Emily Maitlis’s style “may not be to everyone’s taste” – then hastily deleted the jibe.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

From Pakistan to Poland, Israel to Ireland and South Africa to Switzerland, people enjoy the best of British.But there is undoubtedly more to do to turbocharge trade. That’s why we are guaranteeing that under our leadership, Britain will never join a permanent customs union and instead seek to negotiate a comprehensive Canada-style free trade deal.This means Britain will enjoy a fully independent trade policy to compete with the world’s biggest players.It is simply not good enough for a country as productive as ours to hand over its trade policy to the European Union.We intend to leave the EU with optimism and confidence. Britain can walk tall in the world with the lowest corporation taxes to attract business, a £billion boost for our armed forces and a competitive free trade policy.We will have political leadership at the heart of our team from the start of the negotiation with the EU.This will include the best and brightest, like world class negotiator Crawford Falconer. And there will be no need for a Department for Exiting the European Union.So we will fold these resources into a beefed-up Department for International Trade and Digital Enterprise.We want to be a truly Global Britain and this cannot be done on the cheap. We need to be competitive so we will increase our trade footprint overseas by doubling the International Trade department budget.So we must wrap up Brexit as quickly as possible. It’s an urgent priority and that will be our unrelenting focus until it is done.We both voted three times to leave the EU andothers had done the same we would have left by now. We don’t see Brexit as a problem to be solved but as the most amazing opportunity for our country.It is a task which will require confidence, craft, vision and attention to detail. It will require the promotion of some relationships and the resetting of others.And let us make one other thing clear: that team will never include the Labour front bench, which is hell bent on blocking Brexit.There are a few other things about our Brexit plan that readers should know. If we leave without a deal – not an ideal outcome but one that must remain an option – the full £billion orce payment will not be handed over.We will not pay a penny more than is legally required. Anyone who thinks we are going to write a blank cheque to the EU is sorely mistaken. To leave we need an experienced deal maker.Perhaps one who delivered a smooth Olympic Games in . Perhaps a deal maker who delivered £million a week for the NHS after winning a battle with the Treasury. Perhaps a deal maker who is already around the table with European leaders as Foreign Secretary.So today our solemn promise is this: We must be able to demonstrate real progress with the EU by the middle of October. If no agreement is in sight by then we will press ahead with No Deal.No one sensible wants this outcome, butit’s a choice between no Brexit or No Deal then we will never betray the democratic mandate that Brexit won in .Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Imagine that!Why the sudden interest in women’s football  I’ve heard more than one person ask.Well, it doesn’t take a genius to spot the cause and effect — put women’s football on to BBC TV and people will not only watch it, they will bloody love watching it, and realise the level of talent possessed by the likes of Ellen White, Lucy Bronze and the rest of the team.It strikes me that exposure and access is the only reason that we as a nation have cared so much less about women’s football than men’s in recent years. In fact, I know this to be true. You know how Maybe you already know this too but just to recap, this isn’t the first time that our nation has fallen in love with women’s football.Cast your minds back a hundred years or so to World War One when any man fit enough to play football had been sent to fight on the front line.Back at home, it turned out that women were completely able to do so much more than stay at home looking after children.In fact they were able to not only take on the men’s jobs — they also took their places on the football field. And people loved watching them.Women’s football was absolutely huge during World War One, drawing crowds of up to , even after the war had ended.These pioneering women managed to achieve phenomenal success and recognition, and they did it at a time when such a thing would have seemed nigh on impossible. They defied society, challenged convention, cocked a snook at tradition and expectation — and changed the mindset of a nation by taking women’s football to unprecedented  heights, all within a couple of years.And they did it because the men were away fighting — and so they were allowed to.And then women’s football here disappeared completely.Why The men came back from the frontline — and they wanted their jobs and their football back.And the women  They were expected to go back to the domestic realm. And, just like that, it turned out  women were no longer considered suitable to be footballers.Apparently, the sport was condemned as “inappropriate for their bodies”. And so began a campaign against women’s football, the sport that had been appreciated by the nation. That culminated on  December , when the FA called on clubs belonging to the association “to refuse the use of their grounds for [women’s] matches”.It would be easy to conclude that they were scared of the competition.With women safely out of the way men could take their rightful place back on the pitch. Incredibly, it was not until after England’s World Cup win in  that women’s football began to be revived.In  the Women’s Football Association was formed, and in  — a full half-century after the ban — the FA allowed its members to host women’s games again.Still, though, until now the attention paid to women’s football has been pretty desultory.But that’s changed, thanks to the Lionesses and to the exposure that women’s football has rightfully  been given. And now finally, after  years, football may be coming home.England’s Lionesses are two games away from winning the World Cup, having shown skill, determination and hard work in the tournament.The way they play out from the back, the way they keep possession, the way they handle themselves under pressure is a real credit to football. The men should take note.I couldn’t be more proud and how fabulous that more than .million tuned in to watch them.To say that I’m excited for the USA game on Tuesday is an understatement.When you’re at boarding school you wear what you’re told, eat what you’re told, go to bed when you’re told.

So I suppose, in a way, it is progress.But here’s a more radical thing. Should we  have a Miss England competition at all It’s outdated, old-fashioned and sexist.We should not rate people on their looks but on their character, what they stand for and what they do.No matter how you dress it up, the prize for Miss England goes to the best-looking entrant. With competitions like this still going on, is it any wonder young women are tortured by self-esteem and confidence issues Make-up or no make-up, it is still judging women on how they look  – and pitting them against each other.I didn’t know until now there is  a Mr England competition too, but that is just as bad.Talk about a bitter-sweet level playing field – where men are as obsessed as women about their abs  and whether or not they should be hair-free.WHAT does it say about society when men who beat up women are not jailed  It says that violence against women is often tolerated.Attacks on woman are the most socially tolerated form of violent behaviour.This week a steroid-using, drug abusing body-builder beat up his girlfriend so badly she thought she would die.She was the FIFTH partner this man has assaulted.He was not jailed as the judge  thinks imprisoning a serial domestic abuser would do “no good”.  No good  It would send a signal that it is not OK to beat up women.As this was his fth victim on record, I am sure there will be more, as he has escaped suitable punishment.He should be in jail and the judge removed from office, at the VERY least.IT’S hard not to feel  sickened by the fact Faryal Makhdoom and her boxer husband Amir Khan spent  £, on their daughter’s first birthday party.Faryal, , and Amir, , held the Amazonian-inspired bash earlier this month at the University Of Bolton Stadium – the same place where the couple held their £, engagement party and eldest daughter’s £, second birthday celebration.I’m sorry, but £, for a first birthday party  Where has  their perspective gone Of course everyone wants to throw their child a great birthday party, but a one-year-old won’t even remember the event.Wouldn’t it have been better for Faryal and Amir to have held just a small celebration and put all that money they spent – on something that lasted for just  a day – into a bank account  so that their daughter could eventually put it toward her own flat, or setting up a business when older Sleeping under canvas, even   it is dressed up as a “bell tent”, “eco-pod” or a “VIP yurt”, is my idea of a nightmare.Add to that probably more than , people, a woeful lack of loos, nowhere to hide from the beating sun and nowhere to wash – and it becomes a vision of hell.Yuck.ANYONE  do a massive eye-roll watching footage of Aaliyah, the -year-old Londoner appearing on Channel ’s  Hours In AE Not only was she there because she had just a broken fingernail, she was complaining at having to wait to see a doctor – I guess because the doctors were busy attending to real emergencies.Aaliyah, broken nails were why plasters were invented.You – and your mother, who took you to AE in the first place – need to get real.So do we.

We could end up with a version of Mrs May’s hideous Chequers stitch-up, with a few extra bells and whistles on the Northern Ireland backstop.That won’t wash, Boris. Voters have been conned twice already. They won’t fall for another blatant fudge.Worryingly, Boris has surrounded himself with Mrs May’s most loyal Cabinet supporters — ministers who connived, and failed, three times to get her botched deal through Parliament.He is listening to staunch Remainers like Health Secretary Matt Hancock.He is taking advice from Attorney General Geoffrey Cox and Brexit Secretary Steve Barclay who, for all their Brexit credentials, willingly dipped their hands in the Chequers blood. They each have a CV to protect.Bearing in mind Boris’s pathological craving for popularity, allies are also alarmed by the sudden support of old cronies and arch-Remainers David Cameron and George Osborne.None of them will tell him what he needs to hear: To save the Tories from the Farage sword, Britain must leave the EU as free traders.We cannot sign up to any iety of customs union, single market or EU court.Boris famously loves to be loved. He likes to have his cake and eat it. He hates making hard choices.But this is the biggest decision of his le and he cannot fudge it.Brussels’ greatest fear is Britain, the world’s fth-largest economy, as a free-wheeling tax haven on its western shore.It is, therefore, our deadliest negotiating weapon, and Boris needs to show his readiness to use it.He has frequently hailed Singapore’s transformation from a small, poor nation to a small, low-tax, well-educated, rich one.Against howls of protest, he backed Brexiteer tycoon Sir James Dyson’s decision to move his HQ there.Boris likes to remind us he won Mayor of London against the odds. But it is worth remembering he only did so after almost running out of steam.He needed to have his feet held to the fire with a blunt warning: “Let us down and we’ll cut your f***ing knees off.”Someone should sit down and give him exactly the same message today.THE most striking aspect of the Tory leadership contest has been the articulate energy of all the candidates – including the no-hopers.All are professional politicians whose job is to argue their case, sometimes without notes, and win over the hearts and minds of voters.It is only striking because Theresa May ­possessed none of those skills.Now we discover her Madame Tussauds waxwork has been given the heave-ho.

He replied the best way of guaranteeing Britain leaves is to pick a PM who can “actually get us a deal that can get through Parliament.”Boris supporters leapt on the comments – accusing Mr Hunt of “kicking the can down the road”. “Only Boris is committing to delivering Brexit on October ,” one aide said.Mr Hunt will dramatically step up his bid to close the gap on Boris by trying to prove how serious he is about delivering a No Dealthere is no “prospect” of an agreement with the EU.He will vow to slash corporation tax to . per cent from  per cent overnight in a No Deal Budget – costing £ billion. And he will pledge to spend £ billion reimbursing tarfs faced by farmers and fishermen. Dairy products could face a  per cent duty in a No Deal.Mr Hunt said: “If we could do it for the bankers in the financial crisis, we can do it for our fisherman, farmers and small businesses now.”He also pledged to set up a COBRA-style emergency committee to prepare for a clf edge exit. The former Remain voter insisted that he would be prepared to see Brits lose their job in a No Dealit meant delivering on the result of the  Referendum.Challenged by the BBC’s Andrew Marr he said: “I would do it with a heavy heart. We are a country where politicians do what the people tell them to do.“Soin order to do what the people tell us to do, we have to leave without a deal, I would do that. But I would find support for those companies to help them weather the storms.”He separately confirmed moves to hire former Canadian PM Stephen Harper as part of his negotiating team to thrash out a trade deal with the EU.Boris Johnson stuck to his end of October deadline.And Jeremy Hunt rightly promises extra cash for farmers, fishermen and the small firms which could take a hitwe end up in a No Deal scenario.But his problem is that no one really believes he would deliver No Deal. Mr Hunt won’t even commit to taking us out by the end of the YEAR, let alone honouring the October  deadline.And while it’s good to see more No Deal funding on offer, both candidates should be wary of rash spending promises they might not be able to pay for.Until Brexit’s sorted out once and for all, the new PM must keep the safety-first approach which has brought our debt under control in recent years.With Labour gagging to turn on the spending taps, evenit bankrupts Britain, the Tories need to show they’re still the party of financial prudence.That’s the best way to keep the UK fighting fit for our future outside the EU.And he said he felt a “personal responsibility” for delivering Brexit after his high profile campaign to Leave. “I played a part in that campaign. I take personal responsibility now for what is happening to our country, for the drt and the dither and the indecision, and the failure to be sufficiently robust in the negotiations which we’ve seen so far.“I want to lead us out of this mess.” Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Prospect union deputy general secretary Garry Graham said: “No peacetime Government has ever been as reliant on its civil service as this one, and you’d think the Conservative Party would be grateful for its work. “Instead Jeremy Hunt wants to cancel all August leave for civil servants with less than a week’s notice, at the same time as MPs are going on a five-week recess.    “This call for Civil Service leave to be cancelled smacks of panic and hypocrisy. “Politicians would be better placed putting their own house in order and finding a political solution to what is a political issue.” But the Foreign Secretary warned: “It is important that the EU knows that we will do what it takes to make a success of a no-deal Brexit. “We won’t blink as a country. That no-deal Brexit is not going to be an opportunity for them to successfully turn the screws on our country. “I will start engaging with the EU straight away, throughout August. “Then, when we have published our plan for a deal we think we can get through Parliament by the end of August, we will start formal negotiations in September.” He added: “There is a hard deadline in what I have said, by the end of September, I, as Prime Minister, will make a judgment as to whether there is a realistic prospect of a deal that can get through Parliament in the short-term.    “And,my judgment is that is not the case, talks will stop and we will put our heads down and focus on no-deal.” Mr Hunt also slapped down rival Boris Johnson, saying that “belief alone won’t cut it” over Brexit “Rhetoric is not enough. This is about the hard graft, focus and attention to detail,” he said. “When I talk to people running their own businesses, to farmers, to shopkeepers, to people on the high street who are worried about the situation that we’re in now, they don’t want a showman, they don’t want to be entertained - they want a Prime Minister who is going to lead us out of this crisis.” And he was forced to defend his style, denying he lacked the “personality and charisma” to become PM. Mr Hunt also renewed his challenge to chicken Mr Johnson to stop dodging live head-to-head TV debates. He suggested his No rival was showing disrespect to Tory activists by skipping a showdown. “I have set out my plans, why doesn’t he set out his plans ” he demanded. “Let’s do it together in a TV studio and allow the Conservative Party to compare the two. “People want to have that choice they want to see the two of us. “I think that’s also respectful for members.” "},{"url":null,"title":"lib dem leadership contest quirk","story":"NewsThis Lib Dem leadership contest quirk is the most Lib Dem thing everJust when you thought the Lib Dems were as Lib Dem as they could get, they somehow manage to be a little bit more Lib DemShareCommentsByBen GlazeDeputy political editorMikey SmithPolitical Correspondent:,  JUL Updated:,  JUL NewsIts more Lib Dem than sandals and bar graphs \"Get the biggest politics stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email An astonishing quirk of the Lib Dem leadership contest has been revealed and itaposs the most Lib Dem thing that has ever happened.You see, the Lib Dems have never been fans of the aposfirst past the postapos voting system - mainly because it prevents smaller parties getting elected.

Laura, , was thrown behind bars after she was caught with  Tramadol painkillers at Hurghada Airport. But five months after she was released from the Egyptian jail, Laura has grounded herself. She has refused a luxury trip abroad with her dad and now only travels a few miles on the bus as far as Hull city centre for work. The jailed Brit has been given her job back, working at a clothes shop. But most nights the Brit has been living like a hermit, staying home and spending two hours chatting to her Egyptian lover, Omar Caboo, over the internet.    Laura, who is still madly in love with Omar, had claimed she had taken the banned painkillers to help her lover who had suffered a bad back since a car crash. But after arriving in Egypt the pills were discovered lying at the top of her suitcase and she was thrown behind bars. She was quizzed for days before being jailed on Boxing Day . She was released -months later after a presidential pardon. Retired haulage company boss Neville Plummer, , said: ”She now finds airports terrying places. I doubt she’ll ever set foot in one again.”    From his smart detached Hull home, just a mile from where Laura lives with his ex-we Roberta, Neville added: “I wanted to take her on holiday to Majorca to help her get over her terrible ordeal. “She would have liked to come but said she couldn’t because she couldn’t face setting foot in an airport ever again and would run awayshe ever found herself near one. “She is going to have her first holiday since her release in a few weeks’ time, but she’s only going a few miles up the road to Scarborough with her sister Rachel. “This airport phobia is going to be with her for le, so I can’t see her ever going too far away again. “Shame really, because she was such an independent, adventurous girl before all this happened.” Laura was arrested in October  after arriving for a two week holiday with prescription pills she said here supplied by a work colleague. She was jailed for three years on Boxing Day after a court rejected her claim that the opioid painkillers - illegal in Egypt - were for her Egyptian lover, Omar, . After her release, she told of suffering “horrendous prison conditions.”    She said she was locked up  hours a day in a tiny cockroach-infested cell with  other women prisoners and only a thin blanket to keep her warm. She described it as a “living nightmare” and claims she didn’t deserve to be behind bars because she was just “ignorant” about the law. Neville, who spent £, on legal fees and family travelling expenses to help secure Laura’s release, said his daughter had ed to her old clothes assistant job and was gradually getting her le back on track. He added she was still “very much in love” with Omar and spoke to him for two hours every night on her computer. But he doubted her relationship with resort entertainment manager Omar, who has a we and children in Egypt, would ever be anything more than a long-distance one. “How could it be  She’ll never get on an aeroplane again, and he can’t afford to come over here. I think in time it will just fizzle out.”    The devoted dad had campaigned for her release and taped  episodes of her favourite soap, Emmerdale, for her to watch on her . Laura, arriving back at her mum’s house after work last Friday, said: “I am trying very hard to get on with my le. I don’t want to say much more than that at the moment.” After her release Laura was grilled by Piers Morgan about insisting she was just “ignorant” and hadn’t checked the travel guidance. During the Good Morning Britain appearance she was asked how she got so many tablets from her work colleague. Laura said she “couldn’t wait to see the woman” who gave her the tablets. It is not knownthe pair are back at work together. Piers Morgan asked her: “Where did you get itfrom ” She replied: “I got it from someone I know. She’s just somebody I know from work.” Laura claimed: “I can’t talk about that too much for legal reasons. I can’t wait to see her and ask her where she got them all from. “I am so embarrassed. I didn’t think I had done anything wrong. Omar had a bad back for a while and had been to the doctors. “I wasn’t the most sympathetic person in the world and I thought he had pulled a muscle. I thought I was doing a good deed. “I never asked my friend for Tramadol. She told me she would get me some strong pain relief.” Describing the conditions she was held in, she said: “The prison was horrendous. “Everyone wore white and there were  women to  beds. “There were five toilets in Cairo, for  women. I had to get a shower with a jug over a hole in the floor. “I have witnessed the most horrendous things I’ve ever seen in my le. There were so many low moments. “On my second day I saw two girls get tortured with sticks and I couldn’t understand why I was in a room with these people.” She said that during her time in jail she was taken under the wing of a ft con called Mama Amy. Speaking about why she took the drugs, Laura said: “I knew I had more than one tablet with me, but I had no idea I had . I just didn’t think. “I was so happy walking into the airport, I go to Egypt three times a year. I saw the guy who checks your suitcase, put it on the conveyor and he askedI had medication. “I opened the suitcase and he pulled them out and he said ‘What’s this ’ I thought he was joking when he said I couldn’t have them.” Piers told Laura that some people were not “buying” her story, but she told him: “Don’t ever call me a drug dealer.

However, his behaviour took a more sinister turn in December  when he molested a teenager as she waited at a bus stop. Maidstone Crown Court, Kent, heard he ignored the -year-oldaposs desperate pleas to stop hugging her before putting his hand up her school skirt and tightly gripping her thigh. She eventually managed to flee his clutches but had to hide behind a billboard until her bus arrived. His other victims included a rough sleeper. Reed again struck up conversations by askingthey were cold before wrapping a scarf around them or hugging them tightly. He even told one his name was Katrina but to call him Katie, and the women later told police they were convinced Reed was simply a lonely old woman wanting company. The court was told that of the  offences making up his  previous convictions,  were for breaches of his sexual offender orders, with all but one marked by suspended sentences or community orders. But a judge decided today that prison was now unavoidable after he admitted a further eight breaches and three offences of sexual assault. Judge Adele Williams ignored a plea from his lawyer that he should be spared prison to undergo a aposspecically-targeted and onerousapos treatment programme called the Horizon Project.  Passing sentence, she said Reed, who has been a cross-dresser for almost  years, had repeatedly failed to take advantage of any assistance previously provided by the courts. Judge Williams told him: You have an entrenched and long-standing compulsion to behave in this way and my duty is now clear. It is to protect the public from your behaviour, she told Reed. There are persistent breaches here and your behaviour has caused very serious distress. The unemployed cross-dresser from Chatham, Kent, who was sporting stubble and wearing a grey cardigan when he appeared in court, was again made subject to an indefinite sexual harm prevention order. He will also have to continue to sign on the sex offender register on his release. Prosecutor Lucy Luttman told the sentencing hearing that the sexual assaults occurred between December  and March this year. The schoolgirl was waiting at a bus stop in Maidstone at about .pm on December   when Reed approached her, first saying they should be friends before adding aposYou must be really cold. Let me warm you upapos. He then gripped her tightly and hugged her before running his hand up her leg under her school skirt and holding her thigh aposvery firmlyapos, said Miss Luttman. Reed ignored her pleas to stop and pushed her phone away when she went to use it. The teenager eventually escaped his clutches but could not call her mum as by then her phone had run out of charge. She was panicked and crying, and she hid behind a billboard until her bus arrived, said Miss Luttman. His second victim was targeted at a bus stop in Chatham. Reed was said to have aposcorneredapos the woman before holding her hand and nestling his head on the top of her breast. He kept looking up at her and hugging her, said the prosecutor. She described it as feeling horrible and only allowed it because she felt scared. She was also convinced Reed was a woman, and repeatedly referred to him as apossheapos in her victim impact statement. A month later she was again singled out by Reed, this time while travelling on a bus. His face was said to have aposlit upapos on recognising her. He took hold of her hand and struck up conversation. She didnapost know what to do and responded with conversation, said Miss Luttman. The defendant continued to hold her hand throughout the duration of the  minute journey. He then started touching her collar from behind, saying he was making sure she was warm, a feature of his offending.  He then took a scarf from his bag and wrapped it around her. She felt uncomfortable and left. However, Reed approached her later that same day at a taxi rank, coming up behind the woman and touching her shoulder. She was really shaken by how close the aposwomanapos was and she said she really freaked out. The defendant said he was just checking she was getting home okay and asked for his scarf back, said Miss Luttman. It was only when the victim told her partner what had happened that he figured out Reed was responsible. Throughout the incident she was convinced the defendant was a woman because of the way he was dressed and because he spoke with a female voice, continued the prosecutor. He had told her his name was Katrina and to call him Katie. Never once did she think he was a man. She thought he was a lonely woman, felt sorry for her and wouldnapost have been rude to her. The victim was said to have been left feeling vulnerable and anxious by Reedaposs warped behaviour. I feel absolutely destroyed and mugged off that this was a man, she told police. I just felt sorry for her. Reed was arrested and released on bail, with a condition not to dress in his female guise. However, undeterred, he then targeted a homeless woman in Chatham High Street in March this year. He was again wearing womenaposs clothing with his lower face obscured by a scarf. Miss Luttman said the victim aposgenuinely believedapos Reed was a woman. Having struck up conversation, he asked the womanshe was cold before wrapping a scarf around her and giving her a pair of gloves. Reed then began to hug her and pulled her head towards his chest, rubbing her hair. His victim felt aposuncomfortable and embarrassedapos as people were looking at them but was able to eventually leave. A few days later Reed, still dressed as an old lady, saw the same rough sleeper and asked for his scarf back before wrapping another around her. But on this occasion he was recognised by a civilian police officer. He referred to him as Paul and it was only then that the victim realised the defendant was not a female, added Miss Luttman. She told police aposI felt something wasnapost right but I just didnapost believe him not to be a womanapos. When interviewed by police Reed denied the offences and said his clothing was generic. His sexual offending started in  but it was not until  that he received his first ban from approaching women while dressed as a granny. It followed his conviction for two charges of sexual activity with a child. Despite multiple breaches since, the court heard Reed has only been jailed on one previous occasion in June  when he was also convicted of three offences of sexual assault. He has been subject to sex offender notications and sexual offender orders since May  and has, prior to these offences, breached them  times, said Miss Luttman. The sentencing hearing was told he had been relentlessly bullied both at home and during his schooldays about his height. From the age of nine he spent y periods away from his family undergoing growth and hormone treatment at Great Ormond Street Hospital, and subsequently sought solace in wearing his mumaposs clothes. He was miserable from that young age and said it gave him comfort. He has never broken free from that shackle, said John Fitzgerald, defending. He has never meant any harm and he apologises. In the past he never thought he was doing wrong and was just seeking comfort. But he now wants to change and that is signicant. He wants to ensure that the rest of his le isnapost spent on this criminal offending. Mr Fitzgerald urged the court to apostake a more constructive approachapos in its sentencing, arguing that while prison might punish, it may not solve the problem. He will be released, he wonapost have a home, he will be miserable, and wonapost have any support or treatment, he said. One fears he will again find himself in a ladyaposs coat and scarf in the not too distant future and that will be a complete waste of time.

Photographer, Simon Ashton, , took action after his nine-year-old was left “heartbroken” when she couldnapost get hold of the stickers. Last month a seven-year-old little girl was also left upset and wrote to supermarket bosses to complain. But the dad from Leeds, decided to solve the problem for his disappointed daughter and her pals, by making the children the stars.    He said: “My daughter, Carmela, was absolutely heartbroken she too couldn’t locate any of the Lioness stickers. After Carmela couldn’t find her hero’s stickers, I decided I would create an alternative to alleviate how upset she was.” Simon came up with the idea of creating a unique sticker album, for his daughter’s team - the Rothwell Juniors. He pictured all the girls in their kit, and employed a designer to create a collector’s album. Now, the delighted girl’s team are starring in their own sticker book just like their World Cup heroines, where they get to swap their own pictures with their friends to complete the team in their own album. Simon said: ‘I presented it to the girls at their end of season presentation on Friday night and the ecstatic look on their faces was just magical.    They couldn’t believe they were stars of their own football album and immediately started swapping stickers with their team mates, desperate to find their own picture.” Simon said it was “ludicrous” the kids canapost get hold of the official Lionesses stickers book “when our national female football is in the semi-finals playing against the world number one, the USA”. But he pointed out that it was easy to buy the male version everywhere and added: “What sort of message does that send out ” Immy Masterson, from Horsham, West Sussex, penned an open letter to Sainsburys last month angered about the lack of stickers in their stores. Her pleas won the backing of former Sports Minister, Tracey Crouch, who said: ‘Panini did a great thing in producing the album but have been failed by the outlets who clearly still have a backward view of women’s interest in football.” Sainsbury’s said the stickers are available in most of its stores adding: “The Panini Women’s World Cup stickers and book are available to buy in around  stores and have been popular with customers. We hope to have them back in stock in our Horsham store shortly.”  England’s Lionesses’ opening game against Scotland scored a peak audience of . million viewers, making it the UK’s most watched women’s football game of all time. As well as amassing record breaking tv audiences, the England women’s team are also capturing the hearts of young female footballers across the country. Simon, a married dad-of-two, who also coaches his daughter’s team, said: ‘The girls are so excited about the tournament. It inspires them to do better at their game, seeing their heroines doing so well. Simon’s daughter, Carmela, said: ‘My dad is absolutely awesome. He is the best Dad in the world for doing this. Me and my friends absolutely love it. I was really upset when I couldn’t find the Lioness stickers which I saved up my pocket money for, but when we went to Sainsbury’s they didn’t have one single packet on the shelves. It didn’t feel fair, when you can get the stickers of the England male team really easily. But now my Dad has made all my dreams come true. He is absolutely the best.” The team’s, goalkeeper, Ruby Philip, nine, told Simon: You’ve turned me into a sticker... I love it.” Simon is now getting requests from other local girl’s football clubs clamouring to create their own team albums. He said: “If this had been the male team in the World Cup Final, the country would have been at a standstill and you would be able to memorabilia in every shop you went in to. It would be everywhere you looked. The same support should be given to our girls, so they can go on to be the Lionesses of the future.” "},{"url":null,"title":"grandma horrified used needles found","story":"NewsGrandma horried by used needles found in public baby changing facilityJoanna Larkin was enjoying a day out in Chester when she had to cough up some cash to use the public toiletShareCommentsByLauren Wise:,  JUL Updated:,  JUL NewsThe public toilet is maintained by Cheshire West and Chester Council \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailUsed needles were found scattered across a baby changing table in a public toilet by a horried gran.

The group of around  ran and jumped out of the emergency exit at the back of the vehicle after the engine started overheating while travelling up a hill. Devastated groom Colin Sweeney had no choice but to carry on with his nuptials as his family and friends were rescued. The plumber - also known as Sammy - from Scotland was marrying sweetheart Brenda McCullagh, a teacher, in her native Ireland on Saturday, reports the Daily Record.    His family from East Kilbride were on the bus - run by Byrne Coaches - as it travelled to the ceremony in Cranagh, Donegal. They watched as it burnt to a shell, while emergency services rushed to the scene. It took three fire engines from the Northern Ireland Fire and Rescue Service to put out the blaze and wedding guests were collected by another bus. Family friend Ian Dawson said: “There was smoke all over the place and it was obvious that we had to get out of the bus quickly.    “The engine had overheated and the driver was trying to get up a hill and it was never going to make it. We had to open the emergency exit and jump, which was no mean feat because it was a six foot drop.” He added: “One of the guests, Stuart Maxwell, is a mechanic and he sensed the danger right away. He knew there was a major fire risk and he spotted it first, which meant people got off the bus fast. He probably saved lives.” The guests managed to race to the wedding venue after a replacement bus was sent - but missed most of the ceremony.  Ian said: “We tried to let people at the church know what was happening but we were out in the sticks and had no reception so the show had to get on. “I think Sammy and Brenda would have been relieved to see us turn up because it was quite a large proportion of the total guests. “We were all glad to get out of the fire unscathed but it turned into a great weekend in any case.” After the fire the road was closed. The cause of the fire is being investigated. Among the wedding guests to be evacuated were former Partick Thistle star Scott Chaplain and fellow pro Ross Clark, whose clubs included Queen’s Park and Dumbarton.

Kate revealed she went foraging for pine cones with George, five and Charlotte, four, before hiding them in advance of a children’s treasure-hunt on Monday. The garden, co-designed by Kate and Landscape Architects Andree Davies and Adam White, has moved from its debut home at the Royal Cha Flower Show to this year’s RHS Hampton Court Palace Garden Festival this week. Schoolchildren from the nearby Hampton Hill Junior School were the first to set foot in the newly reconfigured space - double the size of the original - and set about trying to find eight pine cones with magnying glasses.    Kate told them excitable children aged between nine and : “There are eight, Charlotte helped me find them.” She asked one little boy, who like his classmates was from Hampton Hill Junior School, “have you found any snails ” as they stood near a large hollow log. The Duchess, , then spent her time taking a group of local school children on a hunt for insects and bugs.    As they skipped along stepping stones in the garden which drew over  onlookers on the preview day, it emerged that Kate had asked the garden contractors who helped build the garden to install stepping stones because George “loves them”. Jake Catling from Landscape Consultants, said: “We made the stepping stones because Prince George wanted them. The kids loved jumping across and it was down to Kate we got that in.” “This was just a field and we brought in  articulated lorries worth of stuff in and we had a team of up to  people.”    The duchess visited the site near Kingston in south-west London last Tuesday to help with the planting. Mr Catling said: “She was very hands on, it was fantastic. She came and did lots of planting and directing everyone around and got involved in the mulching.” Kate smiled as she looked radiant in the summer surroundings of the festival, wearing a bottle green midi dress by Sandro which was emblazoned with a funky polka-dot print.    The dress is currently on sale in Harrods for £ which she matched with high heel wedge shoes and a pair of earrings from high street story Accessorize, which cost just £. However it wasn’t all smiles as one young lad managed to slip and fall on one of the stones, grazing his knee in the process. Daniel Naghi, , from Hampton Hill, said: “I slipped and fell and it started bleeding. One of the teachers came and gave me a plaster and I went straight back into the garden.    “The Duchess who came to see us was really nice and I think she helped make the garden. “She asked me about snails but I didn’t see any but loved the treasure hunt and think the garden is pretty good.” The garden has been designed to encourage families and communities to engage with nature and spend time in the great outdoors. The design is inspired by the original garden at RHS Cha with many of the key features such as the waterfall, dens and hollow log ing, alongside new elements including a wildflower meadow, rolling hill and summer planting.    Kate said she believes these environments enable children to develop skills for le through free play, building confidence, strength, creativity and resilience. After the treasure hunt and search for mini-beasts Kate hosted a picnic for her patronages in the garden. Children from the Anna Freud Centre, Evelina Children’s Hospital, Action for Children and PlaceBe then had the opportunity to explore the garden.

Prince Harry gave his we an eternity ring as either apospush presentapos or a first anniversary gt, and she proudly showed it off for the first time at Trooping the Colour.The delicate pave-set eternity band created by celebrity jeweller Lorraine Schwartz, and Meghan is understandably delighted with it.A source told Harperaposs Bazaar : Meghan was touched. A lot of thought went into it. And itaposs certainly true that Harry was very sweet with his ideas for the ring - and it contains three very romantic secrets .   The band is made up of diamonds - but it also contains three extra stones, Meghan, Harry and Archieaposs birthstones. There is a green emerald for Archie, a blue sapphire for Harry and an olive-green peridot stone for Meghan. How sweet! As well as representing their family, each of the stones has a special meaning which will mean a lot to the Duchess. Sapphires are meant to protect those close to you, peridots supposedly bring power and emeralds symbolize love.   Meghan has also had her engagement ring altered , changing the band for a glitzier and thinner alternative. Harry popped the question back in   with a beautul ring  featuring two diamonds from his mum  Princess Diana  aposs collection and one from Botswana, where he does a lot of charity work.Instead of the original thick gold band, the diamonds now sit on a much thinner micropavé band. Itaposs unclear when the work was done, however she was spotted without the ring during the last few months of her pregnancy so it could have been done then.    However Ingrid Seward, the editor-in-chief of Majesty Magazine, believes it was an odd decision and says the piece of history shouldnapost have been modernised.Speaking to the Sun Online , she said: I find it a bit odd Meghan would want to alter a ring that her husband had especially designed for her.A royal engagement ring is a piece of history not a bit of jewellery to be updated when it looks old fashioned. However many fans disagree and say Meghan should be able to do whatever she wants with the ring.    One wrote: Meghan isn’t wearing Diana’s ring. Harry designed Meghan’s ring using some of Diana’s diamonds plus a larger diamond from Botswana. Harry later re-designed ring and added another band .

It tickled us all. I % thought it was x-rated as soon as I saw it - it looking nothing like a slide. I was queuing to pick Amelia up as usual and one of her teachers was stood by the door with a workbook to her chest - hiding what was on the page. She said aposcan I have a quick chat  We were just wondering what park you take Amelia to apos Then she showed me the book and we had teaching assistants and other staff there and we were all roaring with laughter. I didnapost want her to think we were all laughing at her so I said aposAmelia, this is a really good drawingapos.

Ms Radeva, who moved into Mr Kooteraposs apartment in Woolwich, London soon after they met, claimed on her Tinder profile to be an investment banker working for Citibank who was single and looking for love. But it transpired that she was not a professional financier, and had wed another man just a few weeks before she made contact with Mr Kooter.    She was told to pay £, in damages and costs to Mr Kooter in February after High Court judge John Cavanagh QC found that the £, was not a gt as she claimed, but money Mr Kooter believed she was going to invest on his behalf. This week she was ordered her to pay up to another £, to cover more of his court costs. But lawyers warned Mr Kooter could end up getting nothing, because Ms Radeva has declared herself bankrupt since the ruling was made against her. In February, the High Court heard that after their nine-month relationship broke down, Mr Kooter sued his ex, claiming he had only given her the £, to invest for him, thinking she was a high-level professional investment expert.  But Ms Radeva denied his claim. She said she was married but amicably separated and insisted that, as her wealthy boyfriend, Mr Kooter gave her most of the money to support their expensive, luxurious lestyle together. But Judge Cavanagh told her to pay the money back. He pointed out that a screenshot of her Tinder profile from February  stated on that profile that she was employed by Citibank and she also signed off emails Manuela Radeva, Capital Investment Manager. There were numerous emails detailing the process of making arrangements for Mr Kooter to make investments with Ms Radeva, he added.    At one point in the emails, Mr Kooter had expressed nervousness at what he was doing, saying: Just putting a large amount of money into your bank account seems a bit reckless. Ms Radeva replied: Donapost worry about this - you can trust me completely. Judge Victoria McCloud has now ordered Ms Radeva to pay the rest of Mr Kooteraposs court costs, a bill which could reach £,. The judge said she must pay the first £, by July  this year. The judge ordered that Mr Kooteraposs outstanding claim against Ms Radeva for €, be discontinued, after his barrister, Kamen Shoylev, told the judge that he now wants to drop it rather than fighting out another trial.  The judge also ordered Ms Radevaaposs £, counterclaim against her ex to be stayed and dismissed unless she applies to lt the stay. But the judge said she had received a letter from Ms Radeva talking about her bankruptcy and commented: This is a bankruptcy which came on after the judgement against her. Mr Shoylev told the judge: Mr Kooter is very likely to be applying to set aside the bankruptcy. He added outside court: It is a matter of public record that Ms Radeva is now bankrupt. It is possible thatthe bankruptcy is not set aside, she may get away without paying anything.  Mr Kooter has an application pending to set aside the bankruptcy in the High Court. The court heard during the trial in February that the couple enjoyed a lavish lestyle together, despite their short association, enjoying skiing holidays and stays in expensive hotels. Mr Kooter splashed thousands on gts, including designer luggage and a Chanel handbag and purse for his new lover, the court heard, as well as paying out for their hotel and bar expenses. But after they split up, he demanded back the £,, plus another €, he says he lent her. But Michael Collard, for Ms Radeva, claimed the payments were part-and-parcel of their lavish domestic expenses as a couple and that Ms Radeva should not be made to reimburse him. This was a man on a very high income in what was clearly a serious relationship. They were living together, he said.  This was a relationship with lots of kisses. It was not a professional relationship between the two of them. Of the €,, he added: Itaposs the sort of payment a wealthy boyfriend could make to his girlfriend...There is no evidence that he would have expected the money back. Ordering her to pay back the £,, Judge Cavanagh said: There is a great deal of contemporaneous evidence to show Mr Kooter was giving Ms Radeva substantial sums of money so she could invest on his behalf, she having led him to believe she was an expert investor working in the finance industry. In my judgment, it is highly implausible that he was giving her this money for any other reason than that she should invest it for him. It might be thought to be strange that an experienced businessman would advance these sums to somebody he had recently met without a written agreement. He admits he was naive and says he was blinded by attraction.

Determined Khiara Darbyshire went into college hooked up to TENS machine to dull the pain of contractions as she raced to get through the -minute written test. Amazingly the -year-old passed both exams with flying colours despite being in agaony. It first happened in  as Khiara, then , sat her Geography GCSE.She gave birth to lb oz baby Hugo a week later after her labour stalled.The same thing happened again in April when she was sitting her theatrical and media make-up exam at Greater Brighton politan College.    Khiara, of Worthing, West Sussex, said: “I was shocked that I took my GCSE geography while in labour and I still managed to pass, but I didn’t expect it to happen again. “I was in pain both times but the second time the contractions were coming very regularly and lasting up to a minute each time. “I’ve never written so fast though - I was the first to finish and couldn’t wait to get to the hospital.” Khiara fell pregnant at  and her due date was right in the middle of her GCSE exams.    She initially dismissed her pains as ‘practice contractions’ – known as Braxton Hicks – but she was, in fact, in early labour with baby Hugo, who is now four. So she was relieved when she discovered her second baby wasn’t due until nine days after her theatrical and media make-up exam at Brighton Met College. However, the day before she sat the paper to become a film make-up artist she went into labour after being induced because she couldn’t feel her baby moving. By the next morning she was having contractions that became so painful she entered the exam hall wired up to a TENS machine. Khiara did breathing exercises and turned up the device, which uses a mild electrical current to reduce pain, to cope with the labour pains that were coming five minutes apart. She finished the -minute exam in just over an hour, then asked: “Is it okayI go now to have my baby ”   Her daughter Poppy was born a few hours later at Worthing Hospital weighing lbs oz.And all her hard work paid off as she passed, gaining a merit and coming top of her class. The delighted mum-of-two was back at college just two weeks after giving birth to do the first of six practical exams which she needed to become a qualied make up artist.    She said: “I bought the TENS machine on the way to the exam to block out the pain because I was determined to take the paper. “I’d worked too hard to miss it and just hoped that I’d be OK. I thought it would be better to sit it while in labour than take it later with a screaming baby. “Luckily the exam was easy as I’d revised so much and so I was able to breathe slowly and turn up the TENS machine to take the edge of each contraction. “I caught a taxi straight to the hospital from college and the driver had to go slowly over all the speed bumps.”    Khiara’s partner Sam Tarrant, , raced to be at her side when she gave birth. And after graduating, Khiara picked up a Commitment to Learning award from her college to congratulate her. Now the couple want a third baby - but say they will time it better next time. She said: “I want another baby in the future, but I can’t risk this happening again. I will have to time everything to perfection or make sure I don’t take any other courses. “I’m going to frame both Hugo and Poppy’s birth certicates and hang them next to my exam results to show what I went through having them.” Julie Nerney, chairwoman of the Met’s board of governors, said: “This is the highlight of my year. “It puts everything working at the college does into perspective.” "},{"url":null,"title":"holidaymaker goes crazy wrecking spree","story":"NewsHolidaymaker goes on sunlounger wrecking spree at Ibiza hotel as guests egg her onGuests at Hotel Piscis, owned by Playasol Ibiza Hotels, in San Antonio, look stunned as the woman revelled in the attentionShareCommentsByNatalia PenzaBradley JollyOnline journalist:,  JUL Updated:,  JUL Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news world-news video holidaymaker-goes-berserk-ibiza-hotel-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, subsets :[,,,,,],bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, subsets :[,,,,,],bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true\"\"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email This is the bizarre moment a holidaymaker hurled sun loungers, chairs and glasses into a swimming pool at a busy hotel.

Raising money for charity is one of the things my company does as a way of giving something back to the community.“This isn’t the first long distance bike ride I have completed.“I have previously cycled from Land’s End to John O’Groats with the money I raised going to a charity in Edinburgh named The Yard which raises cash for adventure playgrounds for disabled children.”"},{"url":null,"title":"ayr form led to dundee united making moves for new boy liam smith","story":"New boy Liam Smith is delighted to be one of Dundee United’s summer recruits and suspects previous employers Ayr United were partly responsible for the arrival of some of the men who beat him through the doors at Tannadice by a few months.It was Tangerines gaffer Robbie Neilson’s knowledge of Smith from their time together at Hearts, plus his form for the Honest Men last term that earned the -year-old right-back his move.In fact, such was his form during the first half of last campaign, United made a bid for him in January before having to settle for fixing him up on a pre-contract and getting his services now.And Smith believes Ayr’s surge to the top of the Championship before Christmas prompted increased transfer activity where in the ision.“I think because we had done so well in the first half of the season and Ayr were considered a smaller club, the bigger sides in the ision got a bit of a fright,” he said.“United, Partick and other teams like them saw we were doing well and thought we have to do something about this, so they signed a few players in January.“There was nothing Ayr could do about the players these clubs were signing, they don’t have the budget to compete at that level and I think they can be delighted with where we finished last year and the season we had.”News Smith would be heading for Tannadice once his Ayr contract was up, leaked out just a day or so before the teams were due to meet towards the end of the season.While he would have preferredhis proposed move had been kept under wraps for a little longer, the way things have panned out, he insists it was not a major problem.“It came out the day before we were playing United, that wasn’t ideal but Ian McCall trusted me and knew that I would give my all for Ayr until the end of the season and that’s what I did.“We didn’t meet United in the play-offs, probably thankfully. It would have been a little, maybe slightly, awkward. When the news came out it was near to the end of the season, so all I could do was give my all for Ayr to win.“And it’s not something you even remotely think about it when you’re playing on a Saturday. It’s not in your head, you are just doing your job in the day.”While he’s known for months he was Tannadice-bound, it was only with the start of pre-season training at the beginning of the week that he was able to get down to working with his new team-mates.And already, he admits, he’s been impressed with what he’s seen.With most of the squad that will be used next season already in place, he is confident the quality required to live up to expectations and secure automatic promotion is there.“Just from the first couple of days of training you can see the quality in the squad and the players the manager has to choose from. To be added to that is, obviously, good for myself and, hopefully, I can stay in the team and do well.“I have experience of winning the Championship with St Mirren so I think I’m ready for that challenge of the expectation of winning games and playing in front of a big crowd at Tannadice. I’m confident that I can handle it and I’m sure we’ll be doing all we can to make it happen.”And he’s made it clear that, for all the Championship is a ision he rates highly, he plans to be spending most of his United career operating a step up from it.“I’m ready to challenge myself at a higher level. It would have been greatUnited had gone up last season but % the aim is to win this league.”"},{"url":null,"title":"times-past-the-old-firm-menzies-and-easterhouse-gangs-feature-in-our-look-back","story":"Another selection of photographs from the Herald and Times archive, today spanning the  years between  and ."},{"url":null,"title":"memories-pictures-from-across-glasgow-throughout-the-years","story":"Images from the archives of the Herald and Evening Times."},{"url":null,"title":"times-past-old-photographs-of-glasgow-through-the-years","story":"Images from the archives of the Herald and Evening Times."},{"url":null,"title":"times-past-do-you-recognise-any-of-these-old-photographs-of-glasgow","story":"Images from the archives of the Herald and Evening Times."},{"url":null,"title":"times-past-do-you-recognise-any-of-these-old-photographs-of-glasgow","story":"Images from the archives of the Herald and Evening Times."},{"url":null,"title":"times-past-how-many-of-these-old-photos-of-glasgow-do-you-remember","story":"Images from the archives of the Herald and Evening Times."},{"url":null,"title":"watch-moment-angus-woman-zoe-archibald-gets-stuck-in-toy-car","story":"THIS is the hilarious moment a Scotswoman got stuck in a childrens toy car - and had to be cut out using a bread kne."},{"url":null,"title":"times-past-memories-of-happy-days-gone-by-in-glasgow","story":"Images from the archives of the Herald and Evening Times."},{"url":null,"title":"the-rocket-man-elton-john-tribute-night-heading-to-kilmarnock","story":"A TRIBUTE night to Sir Elton John is set to hit Kilmarnock."},{"url":null,"title":"residents-frustration-over-missed-bin-uplifts","story":"RESIDENTS living in the West End of Glasgow have voiced frustration overdelays to recycling uplts, which they say haveleft tenement back courts strewn with rubbish."},{"url":null,"title":"a-world-of-flavour-on-your-doorstep","story":"STICKING to the same old grub can become monotonous after a while.

These should ensure everyone receives #joined up# care, that they are asked how they are feeling as part of every diabetes appointment and that a mental health professional with knowledge of diabetes is part of every diabetes care team.To sign our petition, go to diabetes.org.uk missingAngela Mitchell, National Director of Diabetes Scotland.Sir,I#m asking residents in the Highlands and Islands to give their views on Conservative proposals for tackling serious crime.In order to provide Scotland with an alternative to Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP in , we are keen to gain feedback from as many people to our policy proposals to make them as relevant as possible to the needs and aspirations of everyone in Scotland.Too many people in Scotland are affected by the behaviour of serious criminals. This needs to be properly addressed and my colleague Liam Kerr MSP, shadow Justice Secretary, has outlined key policy proposals in a member#s bill in the Scottish Parliament to tackle this scourge.It would give Scottish judges the power to impose whole le sentences to those convicted of the most serious violent and sexual crimes including the murder of a police officer.The courts would still have discretion to impose the appropriate sentence based on all the facts of each case, as they do in England and Wales where such a provision already exists.The proposed Whole Le CustodyBill will not mean the perpetrators of a particular crime will always receive a whole le sentence, but rather that the courts will have the power to impose one where there is sufficient justication.We have started the consultation and experts and members of the public are invited to register their views.Email me at donald.cameron.msp@parliament.scot or write to me at Donald Cameron MSP,  George Street, Oban, PA NT, with your views.MSP Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands.Sir,The SNP has warned Scotland’s NHS is under threat from a Tory-Trump trade deal that could leave the Scottish Government without a veto over a post-Brexit deal that sells Scotland out.This stark warning follows the revelations from Donald Trump that in terms of trade deals, everything, including the NHS, would be on the table.At Prime Ministers Questions, SNP Deputy Westminster Leader Kirsty Blackman MP said Donald Trump and the Tories could not be trusted on the NHS and criticised the UK government for plotting to take powers away from the Scottish Parliament that would allow it to safeguard Scotland’s NHS.The threats to Scotland#s NHS are growing under the prospect of a hard-right Tory-Trump Brexit trade deal. Those threats could undermine the integrity and independence of our Scottish NHS.The UK Tories will block any potential veto by the Scottish Government over such a damaging deal.The SNP government will fight to the end to defend Scotland#s public services from this unprecedented Tory Brexit danger. Our NHS must remain in public hands. It is not, and should never be, up for sale.Scotland has been completely ignored throughout the Brexit process and Tory plans to grab powers from the Scottish Parliament will leave us even more exposed.It is clearer than ever that the only way to properly protect Scotland#s interests, and keep our NHS in public hands, is with the full powers of independence.MP Brendan O#Hara, Argyll and Bute."},{"url":null,"title":"monsters and magic come to lochgilphead booksigning","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowLochgilphead#s Argyll Book Centre is holding a book signing with Lari Don.The Secret of the Kelpie author will be in the indie book shop on Saturday June  to read her new book to eager ears and talk to readers about their favourite folk tales and inventing monsters.After a quick break, Lari willto read excerpts from her spellbinding Spellchasers trilogy to inspire you to imagine magical adventures of your own and tell one of your favourite myths.Born in Chile, Lari Don was brought up in Scotland where she has worked in politics and for the BBC.

Working with the Kilmartin Museum Education Officers, Field Archaeologist Roddy Regan and the Tarbert Community Castle project team led by Robert McPhail, pupils either spent a half day or full day on the castle site.Each day the children had a guided tour of the castle site and of the ious open ‘dig’ trenches, followed by a viewing of some of the objects found on the site in previous weeks. The highlight of their day was to excavate the soil in their trench and the children enjoyed ‘trowelling’ the soil, then sieving their excavated soil checking for any objects that may have escaped their eye.Finally, at the end of the dig sessions, the pupils gathered round to examine the objects no matter how big or small, they had each found on the day. Over the two weeks, the children found a iety of broken pottery pieces ranging in age and style that included medieval and Victorian pottery, clay pipes, broken Victorian slate pencils, ious colours and style of glass and one silver D coin dating to early s.On behalf of the Kilmartin Education team and the schools that took part in the community dig, we would like to express our sincere thanks to the Tarbert Community Trust for allowing the schools such a wonderful opportunity, to dig on a site that is steeped in history, and is of such historical signicance for the West coast of Scotland but in particular for the Mid Argyll and Kintyre area."},{"url":null,"title":"selkirk-apartments-are-simply-the-best","story":"AN infill development on Selkirk High Street has been crowned the best in Scotland.Eildon Housings -apartment development replaced a crumbling former department store.And the stylish one- and two-bedroom flats have won praise from locals in the town.Now the development has been named as the Best Small Affordable Housing Development of the Year by the Scottish Home Awards.Delighted Eildon chief executive Nile Istephan told us: ldquoWe are particularly proud of this new development and our equally deserving new scheme at Craigpark, Galashiels, both of which were finalists in this competition.\"We are absolutely delighted to have won this award as we know we were up against stf competition this year in this category.ldquoThis award continues a long line of success at national awards over recent years and reinforces the value that Eildon brings to Borders communities with the investment we are able to make, working in partnership with Scottish Borders Council and the Scottish Government.The Selkirk apartments cost a total of pound.million to build, which included a grant of pound, Allia Ltd through their arrangements with the Scottish Government to assist in the funding of new social housing provision.Mr Istephan believes further award-developments are on the horizon.He added: ldquoEildon has ambitious plans to invest heavily in our region and we are taking forward a wide range of further new affordable housing developments which are of equal high quality.\"We are hopeful they will receive similar recognition in the future as we continue to work to deliver inclusive growth for the Borders."},{"url":null,"title":"tributes-for-john-kenneth-wells-1942-2019","story":"IT was with deep sadness that Peebles Golf Club had its flag at half-mast two weeks ago following the news that JK Wells passed away in his adopted home of Coolum Beach, Queensland, Australia.Kenny was one of the clubrsquos great characters and without doubt one of the most talented players in the clubrsquos history.He won the Club Championship five times in a row between  and , and was also Borders champion on three occasions.One of his finest victories came in the  South East District Championship, beating some of the countryrsquos leading amateur golfers, and was twice a winner of the Thorburn Cup.He was the le and soul of the party and was a stalwart of the old clubhouse bar, enjoying more than a few beers, debates and the celebratory filling of his many trophies.Many members will have their own fantastic memories and stories of their times with Kenny, in battles on the course and nights out in the bar and he will be very fondly remembered by the crop of juniors and kids growing up at the club in the early s.He was a very welcome guest to the club on his trips home with his we Mags after emigrating to Australia, with his most recent visit just last year .He would have been a very proud man this Beltane Week with his grandson Gregor as the Sword Bearer.Our thoughts and sympathies go out to Margaret, Suzie, David, Jenny, and all the grandchildren at this sad time.RIP JK Wells, a true club legend.

regions first Premier Inn.And now that developers have dropped controversial proposals to include a new supermarket, the plans are being given the thumbs up from David Parker.Mr Parker, who represents Leaderdale and Melrose at the local authority, told us: \"I am pleased that Newland Assets have listened carefully to the representations they have received concerning the Borders Gateway proposals.\"A Class  food retail store was very much against local and national planning policy for the site in Tweedbank as it introduced out of town shopping but the developer has listened carefully to ious concerns on this issue and removed it.ldquoThe new proposals have taken on board many observations made so far during the planning process and the revised plans are better in terms of design, road layout and visual impact.\"I am very excited about the economic impact this development could have on the wider Borders economy.ldquoSecuring a Premier Inn for the Scottish Borders will help put our region firmly on the tourism map and the economic impact of Premier Inn and the potential for other investors to follow them, is something which must be grasped.ldquoThe revised Borders Gateway proposals will complement the work taking place to develop the Tweedbank Innovation Park and will sit comfortably alongside the public and private sector projects which are underway at Tweedbank at present.\"The pound million Borders Gateway development also includes a BP filling station, a Costa drive-thru coffee shop, and a MS kiosk.And it is expected that the new outlets will create up to  jobs.Although the wider vision of the development had been welcomed, the supermarket part of the plans had come in for criticism.And Newland Assets revised their plans to omit the supermarket earlier this year.Councillor Parker added: ldquoBorders Gateway has the overwhelming support of the public and many businesses in the area and now that the food retail plans have been dropped there is no reason why these proposals should not be fully endorsed by the planners and backed by Scottish Borders Council.\"The economic advantages of this proposal signicantly outweigh the very small number of policy considerations which are left.ldquoAlthough it was right for the planners to raise concerns about the previous proposal, now that the developer has listened carefully to all the objections and amended the plans accordingly to deal with them, the Borders public simply wonrsquot understand why the council isnrsquot backing this ambitious inward investment opportunity.\"It will help bring new jobs and secure existing jobs and undoubtedly lead to a tourism boost in the Scottish Borders.ldquoI look forward to this development receiving approval and work commencing on

including  around the Eildon area.Among the identied playparks to be decommissioned are  in Galashiels - Balnakiel Terrace, Broom Drive, Croft Street, Kingsknowe, Lee Brae, Netherbank, Roger Quin Gardens, Rosebank Place, Sykes Acre, Waverley Place and Woodlea - four in Earlston - Acorn Drive, Everest Road, Gun Road and Summerfield - four in Selkirk - Bannerfield small park, Fairfield Crescent, Heatherlie Park and Rosebank Quarry - and three in Melrose at Eildon View, Fairways and Priors Walk.Playparks in Darnick, Fountainhall, Gattonside, Lauder, Newstead and Newtown St Boswells are also facing the chop.Opposition councillor Stuart Bell, who represents Tweeddale East, said: ldquoParents tell us that ndash particularly for small children ndash they value small local facilities where the kids donrsquot have to cross busy roads, and parents can keep an eye on them.ldquoThese parents have a right to be consulted on any changes.Council leader Shona Haslam has been driving the plans forward.And she believes that the sacrice of smaller playparks will be worth it.Councillor Haslam said: ldquoOur investment means we will have better and bigger facilities but some smaller sites will have to close.ldquoWe have lots of old equipment in unsuitable locations, for example on concrete standings or in areas that flood easily, are often vandalised, or in a poor state of repair ndash and we are discussing with communities what should happen to these.\"We want our playparks to be the best, but that may mean that some of the single swings or roundabouts may have to go."},{"url":null,"title":"selkirk-bids-for-online-stampede-following-website-launch","story":"SELKIRK is hoping to attract a few surfers to explore the Royal Burgh with the launch of a new tourism website.The online site went live recently -

we need to keep the momentum going.\"Our website has given us a good base to highlight the amazing iety we have in Selkirk from its many cultural and historical connections right through to the breath-taking landscapes we have bordering the town, providing an embarrassment of riches for cycling, walking and riding routes.As well as showcasing many of Selkirks shops, hotels and restaurants, the Explore Selkirk website also provides a comprehensive whats on guide.The pages also chart the towns history and provide details of the many scenic trails in the surrounding hills and valleys.Local councillor Caroline Penman added: ldquoWe are really grateful for the additional funding from Scottish Borders Council to support the website development.\"The website is the first opportunity for many shops and businesses to have an online presence and we know the high-quality products and services the town can offer.\"Selkirk is unusual compared with many high streets, being able to claim many independent shops and cafes.

The day after the crash, Superintendent Jim Guy of Strathclyde Police said there had been no evidence from the crew of any problems before the tragedy.He said the evidence available suggested an accident rather than terrorist attack. The scene of the crash was sealed off almost immediately and an air exclusion zone was imposed.Although most of the wreckage was left for accident investigators to examine, it is understood Royal Ulster Constabulary Special Branch officers removed boxes and cases containing secret papers on Friday morning.On Saturday,  personnel from RAF Machrihanish were drafted in to help find and catalogue debris from the crash.FIFTY YEARS AGOKintyre could be surfers# MeccaKintyre could become the major centre in Britain for surfingthe enthusiasm of two young men gets the encouragement it deserves.One of them, George Raynes, of Bishopbriggs in Lanarkshire, is secretary of the Scottish Surf Club, and with his treasurer, James Short of Glasgow, has just completed a preliminary survey of several of the Kintyre beaches with a view to exploiting them for the sport of surfing.George has surfed on beaches all over Britain and also in the Channel Isles and in Europe and he thinks that the beaches at Machrihanish and Southend could become the Mecca for British surfers and the venue for the British Championships.He was particularly impressed with the waves at Machrihanish but thinks Southend has great potential as well.He told the Courier: #The possibilities here are tremendous. These beaches are essentially accessible from the central belt of Scotland, in fact from all over Britain when one considers the air service, and the weather records show that there is plenty of sunshine and the water is warm compared to the waters off the east coast of England, for example.#In fact, I#ve been told that Kintyre topped the sunshine league in Britain last year.#The water is so warm, comparatively speaking, that the sport could become an all-year-round activity in this area. In the winter one would have to wear a wetsuit, of course, but the conditions are ideal and the wave forms have great potential # after all, they are coming straight in from the Atlantic over the north of Ireland.#What I#d like to see is a surf club established in Campbeltown. It could become a great asset from a tourist and amenity point of view.#And any Kintyre people who really took up the sport would have a great advantage over other surfers when it comes to competition because they have the benefit of readily available beaches all year round.#If this club gets going, the chances are that the British surf champions in the years to come will be Kintyre people.#ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOOrr Ewing CupFootballers were favoured with beautul weather last Saturday and the games played on Kinloch Park in the Orr Ewing Cup competition brought together very large gatherings of spectators.The match in the afternoon was brought to a sudden termination by an unfortunate dispute over the award of a goal. The opposing teams were Kintyre and HMS Thames.Kintyre opened strongly and after  minutes# play had scored twice. The dispute arose over the award of the second goal, which Thames claimed to be offside.The referee, Mr Duncan McCallum, an old Hearts player, was of a dferent opinion, and on his allowing Kintyre the goal, the naval team without more do walked off the field.It is understood that the Thames team intimated to the league at the weekly meeting on Monday night their withdrawal from the competition.The teams were: Kintyre # Jas McKinlay: James Black and Archd Sharp: M Muir, A McCrank and T Cameron: R McGeachy and D Brown: Dan McNaughton: N Scally and J Donaldson.HMS Thames # Meese: Jesseman and Love: McCloud, Hirst and Fernie: Dunnell and Weekes: McGeachy: Slynn and Segrott.Referee # Mr D McCallum.In the evening, the opposing teams were Campbeltown and Kilbrannan. A week previously Kilbrannan had inflicted a - win over a naval team: against Campbeltown on Saturday they found the tables turned on themselves, and with the same score repeated they had to suffer the chagrin of a five-goal margin.It was hard game, but high scoring seldom adds to the vim or interest of any match and so it was here.Campbeltown from the kick-off may be fairly said to have had the measure of their opponents, but while they were the better , on play there was nothing like a - goal margin between the teams.Campbeltown owed their comfortable lead mainly to the masterly play of their centre forward, Archd O#May. This young footballer was home on furlough from the Rhine Army, and his display was undoubtedly the feature of the game. He is a fearless player with a rare turn of speed and a most deadly shot.At least three of six goals came from his foot, and were beautully taken, while he was the means of a fourth which he gave the right wing the honour of finishing.Kilbrannan#s solitary goal was well taken by Brown after a clever break through and an inidual run.Kilbrannan has material for the making of a team that should get much better results than they have so far achieved.The players are keen and inidually have a lot of football in them, but an almost entire absence of method both in attack and defence spoils their chances.The teams were: Campbeltown # A McCallum: G Quigley and Chas McKinven: D Kelly, J McDonald and John Martin: Chas Black and Arch Black: Arch O#May: W McKillop and James Martin.Kilbrannan # John McIntyre: D Bannatyne and Wm Gilchrist: J Short, N McKenzie and James Boyce: D Gilchrist and M Brodie: C Kelly: D Mathieson and J Brown.Referee # Mr W Mustarde."},{"url":null,"title":"thought for the week june 7 2019","story":"As I retreat into the comfort of a warm house and an even warmer coffee, I wonder what it must have been like for Columba and his fellow monks as they made their way from the shores of Ireland to the wilds of Argyll.The fragile shell of a coracle was not the most effective shelter against the wildness of our coastline.Yet they came.

There are several factors influencing this, but the major factor which has tipped the balance is the extended funding hours and the negative impact this is having both financially on small businesses, like Mary Poppins, and to the quality of early learning and childcare.New Scottish Government policy instructs councils to increase their funded childcare hours from  to , by . This move also includes longer opening hours and a move from term time to year-round opening hours to attempt to make childcare more nationally accessible.Ms Dewar said: ldquoThe money received for funded places does not cover the costs of providing the quality of early learning and childcare which we want and are required to provide, especially with regards to staff costs.ldquoThe timescales and measures that the Scottish Government has put in place to educate a workforce to meet the increased requirements are insufficient, and there is a serious shortfall to meet the requirements of the extended funding.ldquoEast Lothian Council indicated it estimated it would require approximately  staff to facilitate the increase in funded hours in East Lothian. The majority of these posts are early learning and childcare practitioners.ldquoThe local authority advertises early learning practitioner posts at between pound. and pound. per hour. Private nurseries are unable to compete with these rates of pay due to the funding rates we are allocated.A group of parents and staff, including Ms Dewar, are visiting county MSP Iain Gray to discuss the problems, but Ms Dewar added that unless he can ldquowork a miracle and change the policy, then it is unlikely the decision to close the nursery will be reversed.When asked about the nursery, Mr Gray said: ldquoThe loss of any nursery provision is disappointing, particularly with the Governmentrsquos , funded hours policy set to be implemented next year.ldquoIn the case of the Mary Poppins Nursery, the owner has highlighted a number of factors that have contributed to their decision to close.ldquoI have written to East Lothian Council about some of these issues.ldquoHowever, there are also wider issues at play here. The nursery sector has been warning the Scottish Government that private nurseries are struggling in the run-up to the roll-out of its flagship , policy from August .ldquoMinisters must act quickly to address the sectorrsquos concerns and ensure that the capacity exists to deliver the funded hours next year.A Scottish Government spokesperson said: ldquoIt is, of course, concerning to hear of any nursery considering closure, and the obvious effects this might have on staff, parents and children.ldquoEast Lothian Council has provided assurance that they will support families to find alternative early learning and childcare places for children who had been expecting to use the Mary Poppins Nursery from this August.Ms Dewar added: ldquoI am distraught that circumstances have forced me to this decision and that such a wonderful place for children to experience their early years is to close.The decision was met with an outpouring of grief on social media.The nurseryrsquos recent th birthday was marked with a garden party.The nursery was founded by Sue Armstrong, affectionately still called lsquoMiss Suersquo, after she had written to Mary Poppins author P L Travers to askshe could use the name.Miss Sue said: ldquoI received many letters from P L Travers about the nursery.ldquoAt the beginning, she wanted to know what the nursery was going to be like. She had no objection to me using the name, she just wanted to find out more. I ended up meeting her as well.ldquoWe were hoping to get her to come and open the nursery  years ago, but her arthritis was bad. We stayed in touch, however. I would send her letters about how the nursery was getting on along with photos, and she would write back saying how she liked it, and ideas of what to do.ldquoShe said that the children should be encouraged to make up their own stories. lsquoChildren like doing that,rsquo she said.Miss Sue sold the nursery to Ms Dewar in  as she was ldquosick of all the paperwork.She said. ldquoWhen I heard it was to close down, well, itrsquos just all so sad really. Itrsquos such a terrible shame.ldquoIt is such a nice and happy place for the children, homely and warm. Itrsquos just awful that it canrsquot stay open.Miss Sue still attends events at the nursery, dressed as the iconic nanny Mary Poppins.She added: ldquoIn the film, Mary Poppins says that shersquoll stay until the winds change. Well, maybe this is the wind changing for Mary Poppins Nursery.Ward councillor Craig Hoy said: ldquoThe closure of the Mary Poppins Nursery is deeply regrettable but reflects the real pressures the independent sector is experiencing as a result of the SNPrsquos , hours policy.\"The Government faces huge problems to provide the free childcare it has promised. In many areas the level of nursery provision simply isnrsquot there and independent nurseries are already struggling financially with the planned

Five minutes in a car can cover a distance which would represent a fairly long walk.Itrsquos kind of a simple principle, I know, but one I sometimes forget, as I did a couple of weekends ago. We set off from an event at Amisfield Walled Garden for a walk. My idea was to walk along the River Tyne to Hailes Castle and thenndash by car a -minute round trip.We had some supplies in the form of fruit in my bag and a little water. It was a sunny and warm day and so we set off on our adventure.We began the walk at the old Abbey Bridge which spans the Tyne close to Amisfield. As you walk under its ancient ribbed arches of this late medieval bridge, you get a real sense of its age and the beauty of its construction.The path beyond follows the river and it is almost impossible now to imagine that a great abbey once stood here, with connections to the infant Mary Queen of Scots. A ruined old mill of later centuries still stands here. I reflected on the stories of this location: a courageous nun who defied a flood in the th century and a gruesome murder in the th century and just visible in the near distance the old graveyard, now ringed with trees and almost unrecognisable as a resting place for the dead.A labourer once thought he saw a ghost at the graveyard, but it proved to be something , and I had a wry smile at that tale of a drunken evening over  years ago. These are all tales I have already told here, but they entered my head as we wandered to the gate that led along the northern bank of the river.Hailes Castle is on the southern bank of the river and I knew that there was a bridge that would takes us over. So we set off to find the bridge.But it took us over four hours.It was a stunning walk, with wild flowers and trees decorating the riverbank almost all the way. A grey heron seemed to follow us perhaps he was warning us that the walk was longer than Irsquod anticipated.It is a walk decorated with history too, of course. A stone in the corner of the field by the first gate caught my eye. Deeply ingrained groove marks on it intrigued me. I was later told that it could be the marks of a plough, as the tips of the plough have scraped over the stone a ploughman unwittingly leaving evidence of his unrecorded toil.Halfway along the walk we arrived at the small hamlet of Sandyrsquos Mill. The cottages and mill itself have been beautully restored. The th-century mill still has its waterwheel, although itrsquos now embedded in silt. The mill ceased working  years ago and was transformed into a residential property, but with much of the old machinery inside still intact. It appears to be a very sympathetic and sensitive restoration.It was beyond Sandyrsquos Mill that the distance began to take its toll. The young kids were tired and desperately looking for the bridge. I spotted Traprain Law some distance away and realised that I had badly misjudged the distance and time it would take with wee ones. We had to sit and have a rest and story, with that grey heron listening, to gather the energy to continue.The kids didnrsquot complain much as we wandered along the still-beautul path, now desperately looking for the bridge. As we had rested wersquod phoned for friends to come and lsquorescuersquo us at Hailes Castle with chocolate and water, and we knew they were there waiting for us.Irsquove never been quite so pleased to see Hailes Castle. It loomed suddenly from across the river. I had never approached it from this direction and it certainly did its best to impress. The bridge was just a wee way further and we finally crossed it with a sense of relief.When we arrived at the castle, the kids devoured the chocolate and water, in a way that reminded me of a scene in the movie Ice Cold in Alex. Thank goodness for good friends.Wersquod made it and what a sense of adventure ndash and an achievement!I sat with the kids and told stories as my we went with the friends to retrieve our car. Hailes Castle drips with history but they wanted tales about giants.The day was a lesson for me: to think more carefully about distance when setting on a walk! I thoroughly recommend the path, especially on a lovely summerrsquos day. But itrsquos going to take half a dayyou have kids. So prepare for that!Unbelievably, the kids later wanted to go to a playpark. ldquoWhere do they get the energy  my we asked.ldquoFrom us! I replied!"},{"url":null,"title":"hopes-of-seeing-railway-station-return-to-haddington","story":"RAGESmet with Peter Brett Associates ndash a leading consultancy of engineers and planners ndash to outline the case for improved transports links to and from East Lothian.One of the more ambitious plans was to see theof a railway station to Haddington.Residents of the town have not been served by a railway station since , with the station closing to freight nearly  years later.However, RAGES feels there could still be a possibility of a station ing to the town ndash though the group acknowledged that work needed to be done.A spokesman for the group said: ldquoRAGES expressed its preference for re-opening of the Haddington branch, ideally to the previous terminus on Station Road.ldquoMinimal compulsory purchase relocation of existing industrial units would be required the biggest physical obstacle would be the reconstruction of the A overbridge which was unwisely built without preserving the railway alignment and loading gauge.ldquoA level crossing would be required at Gateside, failing which an alternative road access could be provided for the new houses on the north side of the line onto the A.There was also a suggestion of creating car parking and even a park and ride facility in the town to serve the new service, which would link the town with Edinburgh.The spokesman added: ldquoAs insufficient parking exists at Station Road , a park and ride station at Oak Tree would be essential, which could also serve the substantial Letham Mains and Gateside developments.ldquoJust east of where the A crosses the railway formation, there is a large rectangular piece of ground, occupied only by scrub, which would be suitable as a car park.ldquoAs only single track would suffice between Longniddry and Haddington, it would be possible to retain a footpath cycleway as the line was originally provided with double track throughout.ldquoAn electric train service from Haddington to Edinburgh would provide the speed and capacity which road transport ndash car or bus ndash cannot match.

It is better than some human beings are treated ndash that is the sad truth.Mr Farnsworth was presenting an annual report on the racecoursersquos performance over the last financial year.The Beast from the East snow storm, an outbreak of equine influenza, and a long spell of dry weather all contributed to what he described as one of the worst years the course had been through in his memory.A number of key fixtures were cancelled and profits fell.In December, four horses died during one day of racing at the course but a subsequent review by the British Horseracing Authority ruled that the course and race organisers were not at fault.Councillor Gordon Mackett asked Mr Farnsworththe racecourse had been affected by animal welfare concerns.The course manager said: ldquoWe did have a horrible day when there were four fatalities however, these were all completely separate incidents.ldquoIn a sport like this you will get injuries and fatalities from time to time. It is horric for the people involved.Mr Farnsworth said that the public were becoming more aware of incidents like these through social media which, he said, ldquofuelled the debate around animal welfare.However, he said there had been no indication that it had had an impact on events at Musselburgh, which saw record crowds at its Easter Day racing this year and another sell-out Ladies Day.His report to the committee revealed that the racecourse had reported a loss over the last financial year after it paid over pound, of legal costs relating to the ongoing process by East Lothian Council to find new third-party operators to run the course.Councillor Kenny McLeod questioned why the costs were being met by the course and not the council itself.However, depute chief executive of the council Alex McCrorie told the councillor that the costs were charged to the racecourse because when the new operator was procured it would be the racecourse that benefitted.He conceded to Mr McLeod that, without the legal costs being taken from the coursersquos funds, it would have been in profit last year.East Lothian Council replaced the previous governance committee which oversaw the running of the course with a new committee last year after relations between members of the old committee badly deteriorated and the British Horseracing Authoritythreatening to suspend its racing licence.The new Musselburgh Racing Associated Committeendash which is made up of four elected councillors and two representatives of the racing industry, currently members of Lothians Racing Syndicate ndash has been overseeing the hunt for a new operator.However, the BHA has only granted temporary licences and extensions under the new committee as it continues to monitor its performance.Mr Farnsworth said that the introduction of the new interim committee had caused some problems too.

I have heard many dferent versions of this tale, and most recently come across one version in a book by Taffy Thomas, who is a renowned storyteller. Here is my version of the story, which I have titled lsquoThe Riddle Rulersquo:IT WAS to be the final race of the tournament. The two knights had been equally matched, and now they would race each other for the prize of a gold cup filled with gold coins.There was an air of excitement as the crowds gathered for this race. Sir John and Sir Harry arrived together, each mounted on their stallions. Sir Johnrsquos horse was called Lightning, while Sir Harryrsquos horse was named Spear.They were equally matched, both knights had won an equal amount of races, and both had won against each other. There was no favourite, everyone knew this race would be very close.The atmosphere was electric with anticipation.Then the kingrsquos storyteller leaned over to whisper in the kingrsquos ear: ldquoYour majesty, this race is the last of the tournament. I feel it should be a race with an extra challenge, so that the crowd are better pleased.The king agreed, but asked the storyteller what he thought the extra challenge should be.ldquoThe race should be a test of the knightsrsquo wits as well as their riding ability, replied the storyteller. ldquoSet them a riddle rule and see how they solve it.ldquoAnd what is the riddle rule to be  asked the king.The storyteller smiled: ldquoDeclare the rules of this race to be thus: the horse which crosses the finish line second will win the cup and coins for its owner.And so the king declared the riddle rule just before the beginning of the race: ldquoThe horse which crosses the finish line second will win the cup and gold for its owner.There was a murmuring amongst the spectators. The knights looked at each other, thinking.When the starter flag was lowered and the king cried ldquogo, both knights stayed at the starting line. ldquoYou go first, said Sir John to Sir Harry. ldquoNo, after you, said Sir Harry to Sir John. But neither knight was willing to leave the start line lest they be deemed to be first.Soon there were boos and clapping from the crowd, but the prize was too great for either knight to risk going first.ldquoThis race is no fun, said the king to the storyteller, annoyed now that hersquod agreed to the change in rules.ldquoGive them until this afternoon to find a way to race, replied the storyteller, ldquothere is a way but they must discover it. It will challenge their wits and also their riding skills.And so the king stood: ldquoThe race is postponed until pm this afternoon. The knights must find a way to race to the riddle rule, otherwise the prize will be forfeited.For the rest of the day there was an excited buzz as people began to discuss possible solutions to the riddle rule with the knights.ldquoWhy donrsquot you agree to cross the finish line together  was one suggestionldquoBut then they would be equal first and the prize would be lost, commented another.ldquoBesides, said Sir John, ldquoI do not trust Sir Harry not to pull his horse back at the last moment. ldquoI do not trust you either, said Sir Harry.The deadline was fast approaching and no solution to the riddle rule had been found.ldquoPerhaps being first is more important than winning the gold, said an old woman.The knights looked at each other, thinking about this. Then they both said ldquonaw and shook their heads.It was  minutes before the race and a child came up to the knights and said: ldquoI have an idea. Everyone looked down at the child and laughed. How could a poor child know the answer when the knights themselves and all the spectators were scunnered But the storyteller was walking by and overheard the laughter. ldquoChildrenrsquos wisdom is not to be laughed at, he scolded them.And so the knights asked the child for the solution.The child said two words to the knights.In a flash, the knights got mounted and prepared to race. When the starter flag was lowered and the king shouted ldquogo, both Sir John and Sir Harry raced as fast as they could, each being desperate to be first across the finish line. Their riding skills were well challenged by this race.Who won does not matter in this story. What matters are the two words that were said by the child. They were the answer to the riddle rule, and so made the race possible.What were those two words If you havenrsquot already worked it out then re-read the story carefully. If you still donrsquot know, and want to know the answer, then I will give it next week.Or perhaps you could ask a child. I know some children from P in St Gabrielrsquos Primary School who know the answer to this."},{"url":null,"title":"plan-to-turn-prestonpans-town-hall-into-a-digital-paradise","story":"Prestonpans Community Council is bidding to take control of the High Street venue and turn it into an audio-visual and digital haven.A sub-committee of the community council that was formed when the option for a Community Asset Transferof the Town Hall to the group was first offered has come up with a lsquodigital destinationrsquo concept ndash and garnered positive feedback from the community council.The community council is the only group to have put in a note of interest for the Town Hall, and the sub-committee ndash featuring DJ Johnston Smith, Calum Miller and Professor Roger Bromley ndash has now made public its vision for the building.Their initial idea is to create an audio-visual centre within the Town Hall for gamers and competitions, as well as running educational classes on technology and creating a ldquodigital destination for all with k audio-visual displays, fibreoptic network, high-speed computers, floor space and a cafe.In the subcommittee strategy, the members state: ldquoThe activities which once occupied our Town Hall are not filling it today we need to think creatively to identy new audiences.ldquoAll of the traditional activities can now be accommodated where in our town.ldquoOur Town Hall needs to offer something unique to the community: our challenge is to use our assets to create richer social interactions for all.ldquoWe live in a world where the social networks that helped us advance are increasingly replaced by the digital iety.

It provides a superb vertical foil to the horizontal expanse of the beautul little town, or Royal Burgh of Inveraray. From the top of the tower, the views can be magnicent, sweeping from the Arrochar Alps, Beinn Ime and the Cobbler above the head of the loch, down to the Firth of Clyde and the western hills of Kintyre. From above, the shape of the geological pressures that created Scotland are laid out impressively. At the foot of the Tower, lies the th century planned Royal Burgh.Climb the Tower , look around, and down. On the way up, visit the bells themselves, fitted like a jig-saw into the space, and see the video display of the bells ringing - an almost frightening sight! On the ground floor is an exhibition of Argyll in the First World War.The Tower has a poignant history. It was conceived and built by the th Duke of Argyll, Duke Niall Diarmid, as a memorial to the dead of the First World War, in particular to the Campbells and the ldquomen of my lands. It was an act of personal piety. Ten bells were commissioned from John Taylor and Company of Loughborough. The ten were cast as a single perfectly matched suite. The Scottish Association of Change-Ringers keeps them perfectly timed, and as the second heaviest set of  bells in the UK, they are known and visited by campanologists from around the world, particularly at the bell-ringing festival . Bells traditionally have names, and these bells are named for the ancient Celtic saints who inhabited the boundaries of the Dukersquos possessions: Moluag, Columba, Mund, Brendan, Maelrubha, Blaan, Murdouch, Brigid, Molaise, and Our LadyStella Maris.The Bells were cast in . First they had to reach Inveraray. The first lorry carrying them broke down in Lancashire. Then the second lorry proved unable to climb the Rest and Be Thankful - like so many other visitors before and after. Two bells and the frame had to be dumped and rescued the next day.Then the Tower had to be built. The Duke taxed all his friends and visitors for money. The facing stone came from the quarry in Furnace during winters, the Duke himself collected rubble in his wheel-barrow for the interior of the fabric. The tower was begun in , and finished  years later in , and the bells hung. The cost was just over pound,, approximately pound million in todayrsquos money. The bells could be heard in St Catherinersquos, across the loch.Before long, the tower was struck by lightning, and with the Second World War, ringing ceased. The Tower became almost ruinous. After the war, Lady Glenkinglas founded the Friends of Inveraray Bell-Tower, and gradually restored the Tower to safety, from where the bells ring proudly today during the summer months for visiting bands.The House of Argyll traditionally belonged to the Presbyterian party, with its strong links to the Hanoverian monarchy. In the s the then Duke married an Anglican Duchess, and built the church of All Saints for the Scottish Episcopal Church. Duke Niall Diarmidrsquos spiritual le was centred here, and the holy stillness of the church reflects that tradition. In his spiritual testament, he asked for prayers each All Soulsrsquo Day for ldquoall who died in the War. A local resident who remembers him avers: lsquoFor Duke Niall, that would have included the Germansrsquo. A poignant place indeed!Visit the websiteto find out more.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------The Royal an LochanLocated in Tighnabruaich in Argyll, The Royal an Lochan Hotel boasts stunning views of Kyles of Bute.

Instead of simply being the subject of consultation there needs to be recognition of our role as change-makers and leaders.Mr Young added: ldquoWe are delighted to receive a grant for our Leaders with Lived Experience pilot project. We will use co-production methods to develop a leadership programme that works to promote lived experience leadership and remove the barriers to leadership development opportunities.Ms McGinn said: ldquoThe voices of those with lived experience have frequently been absent from important discussions such as those on assets, services and resources. This funding should help remedy that.

Hersquos had a succession of top  singles, a number one album and is reputed to be worth millions.But, just when you thought Glastonbury had nothing new to show you in a slot that in recent years has been filled by the likes of the Rolling Stones, The Who, Coldplay, Mumford and Sons and Ed Sheeran, Stormzy, only the second black Briton to headline Glastonbury, embodied that all too rare thing in the cultural landscape: the zeitgeist. Dressed in a stab-vest daubed with a faded Union Flag, designed by graffiti artist Banksy, he proceeded to unleash a performance of authority, intensity and authenticity which touched on kne crime, racism and inequality of opportunity.Just when you thought you had the measure of this set, it slammed on the brakes and turned  degrees, transforming into a ballet performed by a company of black dancers, highlighting the awful truth that only recently have they been able to buy ballet shoes that match their skin colour. It changed again, to a joyful summer party, then again to an on-stage church, compete with spine-tingling gospel choir, as the devout young musician praised God.This had it all ndash aggression and anger, humour and wit, virtuosic rapping and soulful singing ndash and it was presented with an astounding level of intelligence and accessibility. It didnrsquot matter a jot whether you liked or knew grime music even watching on television you felt the earth move. This was the moment black British culture flew to new heights.Indeed, the way this young man held the Glastonbury audience, which nowadays consists mainly of white, middle-class former indie-kids in their s and s, in the palm of his hand, was a sight to behold, and a much-needed reminder in these ided times that people from dferent races, ages and backgrounds can still come together.:Kylie Minogue in tears on Glastonbury One of the highlights came when this self-made embodiment of modern Britain led the audience in a chorus of ldquof*ck Boris, the man, lest we forget, who described black people as ldquopiccaninnies with ldquowatermelon smiles, and represents the privileged, insular arrogance that drives the toxic brand of Brexit that is dangerously engulfing parts of these islands.Irsquom sure armchair viewers up and down the country found themselves joining in with the chant, only adding to the irony that many more people chanted F-Boris with a rapper on Friday night than will vote him in as Prime Minister.There was predictable outrage in the right-wing press, feigned offence at the use of swear words against Johnson while the racist, sexist, homophobic language used by the former Mayor of London over many years has been either ignored, or even worse, excused. I donrsquot doubt many of Mr Johnsonrsquos supporters would cross the street to avoid young men who look like Stormzy.Whatrsquos also interesting about this sort of hypocrisy, of course, is that unlike Mr Johnson, Michael Omari, as he is known to his family, is a man of action as well as words. He not only talks and raps about his community and its challenges, but puts his money where his mouth is, creating a scholarship to fund black students through their studies at Cambridge and setting up his own book publisher, #Merky, part of Penguin, to give young people a voice in writing. He is also a prominent and active supporter of justice and compensation for the Grenfell Tower survivors.And while Mr Johnson arrogantly denies or ignores past mistakes, Mr Omari has had the maturity and courage to admit and atone for his, including homophobic tweets posted at the age of . Put simply, Stormzy is already more of a role model than our future Prime Minister will ever be.And by using his  to change the conversation around young black men ndash as , adoring white, middle-class people standing in a field in Somerset will attest ndash he is contributing far more to society than music.Stormzyrsquos headline performance will go down as one of the most spectacular and assured in Glastonburyrsquos -year history. But its political and cultural signicance goes beyond this.A -year-old from south London reminded us what passion, integrity and authenticity look like at a time when wersquove never needed these qualities more."},{"url":null,"title":"POLITICS WATCH  Who let the dogs out and other mysteries","story":"Those might have been the headlines on last nightrsquos ITV newsit was not for the selfless souls getting up early to watch the Sunday morning politics shows and separate the wheat from the chaff, the chocolate raisins from the rabbit droppings.

to the unconventional gas licence that covers  square kilometres south and west of Falkirk until June .Energy minister Paul Wheelhouse admitted it would be ldquoa disappointment to some.Anti-fracking campaigners said the extension ldquobeggars belief.Known as petroleum exploration and development licence, the licence is  per cent owned by Grangemouth operators Ineos and % by Reach Coal Seam Gas Ltd.The Scottish Government was criticised last year for extending the licence for -months, with environmentalists warning it added to confusion over the status of fracking.:SNP ministers accused of Alice in Wonderland stance on fracking banThree SNP MPs had also asked the government not to renew PEDL , which was first granted by the UK government to Reach Coal in , with Ineos buying its share in .The licence had been due to expire on  June , but the SNP government extended it using powers devolved to Holyrood months earlier.The second year-long extension was revealed in a letter to the Scottish Tories at .pm last Friday, the day after MSPs left Holyrood for summer recess.Mr Wheelhouse said it would have been ldquoa dereliction of government responsibility not to have considered the licenseesrsquo request for more time.However Mr Burnett said: ldquoThe fact that this was sneaked out at .pm a day after MSPs had left for summer recess speaks volumes.ldquoThe SNPrsquos lsquobanrsquo on fracking in Scotland has already been exposed in court as a sham.ldquoThis simply confirms that Nicola Sturgeonrsquos government is still saying one thing in public, and quite another in private.ldquoSupporters of a ban, particularly Patrick Harvie and the Greens, must feel completely duped.Critics say fracking, which involves pumping pressurised water and chemicals into underground shale beds to release natural gas, is a risk to climate change and public health.Advocates say it could support hundreds of new jobs and add millions to the economy.Ineos, which currently imports US shale gas to Grangemouth to use as a chemical industry feedstock, has long expressed an interest in fracking in Scotland instead.The Scottish Governmentrsquos preferred policy position is not to support fracking, but it has agonised for years without coming to a final decision on whether to allow it or not.It set up an expert  in , introduced a moratorium in , ordered more research in , and then consulted on fracking in .In October , Mr Wheelhouse appeared to have settled the matter, telling MSPs: ldquoThere is, in effect, a ban on unconventional oil and gas activities in Scotland.:Cost of SNP fracking ban court case revealedA week later, a series of ministers also told the SNP conference there was a ban.Nicola Sturgeon told delegates ldquoFracking is now banned in Scotland and Deputy First Minister John Swinney said there was ldquoa ban on fracking here in Scotland.However the following May, after Ineos challenged the ban in court, the government admitted it wasnrsquot banned after all and its lawyer explained the term was only a ldquoPR gloss.The government spent pound, of taxpayers money on external legal advice for the case.In March this year, just days before the government was due to give its final decision, the government announced yet more consultations - to clary points raised in the last one - on the business, environmental and regulatory aspects.:SNP ministers delay decision on fracking yet againMr Wheelhouse said at the time that the government wanted to set out its position ldquoas soon as possible after this process is complete, but failed to put any timetable on it.In his new letter to the Scottish Tories about the PEDL  extension, the minister claimed the government was ldquomoving at pace towards finalising its position.However, as the latest consultations only closed on June , its assessments were ongoing.He wrote: ldquoI have approved an extension to the initial term of PEDL  for a period of  months. This will allow a period of time for the conclusion of the policy making process and the licensees to consider their position in the light of the finalised policy in due course.ldquoI appreciate that this may come as a disappointment to some but I assure you that, similar to the effect of the extension last summer, this does not change the Scottish Governmentrsquos preferred policy position of not supporting the development of unconventional oil and gas in Scotland.ldquoI would like to stress that, in the meantime, no local authority can grant planning permission for any proposed fracking or coal bed methane project without advising Ministers, which then permits us to call the application in and we would defer any decision on any planning application that did come forward until the policymaking process on our preferred position is completed.Scottish LibDem MSP Liam McArthur said: \"This is not reassuring news for those whose property sits on or near sites potentially earmarked for fracking, or indeed anyone who cares about protecting our beautul natural environment.ldquoNicola Sturgeon stood up in Parliament and declared that fracking was banned, then her governmentrsquos lawyers stood up in the Court of Session and argued that it wasnrsquot. Now her minister has confirmed that Ineosrsquos license to frack has been extended once again.ldquoMinisters are dragging their feet on a real legislative ban and it is sending completely the wrong message when we should be committing to an all-out assault on Scotlandrsquos emissions.\"Liberal Democrats are clear that embarking on a whole new front of carbon-based fuels and energy production would do nothing to help meet our climate commitments.\"Friends of the Earth Scotlands Director Dr Richard Dixon said: \"It is very disappointing that the Scottish Government has opted to extend this license again, when people locally and nationally have said no to fracking so clearly.ldquoThe operators have already had two extensions to this license and despite having consents in place before the moratorium on fracking, they hadnt fulfilled their drilling commitments, so clearly this license should have been revoked.\"Extending this license adds to the confusion about whether fracking is to be banned or not and prolongs the uncertainty for the communities at risk.\"We urge the Scottish Government to move forward with its decision making process, legislate to ban fracking and draw a line under this issue for good.Donald Campbell, Chair of the Broad Alliance of community groups opposing fracking, said:ldquoIt beggars belief that the Scottish Government would consider extending this licence for Unconventional Oil and Gas.\"The First Minister, Cabinet Secretaries, Ministers and MSPs have spoken most eloquently, stating that fracking will not happen in Scotland.ldquoCommunities across the land rely on our elected representatives to stay true to their word and ensure that no licences are granted for Unconventional Oil and Gas.\"Penny Cole, speaking on behalf of Frackwatch, said: ldquoIf the Scottish government means to ensure no fracking, why does it go on extending the existing licences  They have the power to end them - why donrsquot they exercise it \"We thought we won when , people said no to fracking - but actually the threat remains.\"It means that communities have to stay on the alert we canrsquot say lsquojob done, our government has listenedrsquo."},{"url":null,"title":"brexit-impasse-sees-remain-voters-favour-independence","story":"Professor Sir John Curtice said an overview of polls since last June showed a marked swing in favour of Yes among people who voted Remain or didnrsquot vote in the EU referendum, with Leave voters solidly backing No.In a new analysis on the What Scotland Thinks website, Sir John said eight polls in the second half of  suggested Scottish Remain voters were evenly split on independence.But four polls carried out between April and June this year found most Remain voters backed independence, at  per cent for and % against, omitting donrsquot knows.:Majority now support early vote on second Scottish independence referendumAmong those who didnrsquot vote in the EU referendum, including those under  at the time, support for independence rose from % to % between the two polling periods.Sir John wrote: ldquoIn short, not only have recent polls suggested that there has been something of an increase in support for independence in recent months, but also that this rise has occurred entirely among those who voted Remain .The April-June polls found support for independence at %, against the % result of the  referendum.Sir John added: ldquoIt would seem that the Brexit impasse has motivated some Remain supporters in recent months to re-evaluate their attitudes towards the union.ldquoThe Brexit process could potentially change the balance of support for independence versus staying in the Union - and so determine the future of the British state.:Majority would back Scottish independenceBoris becomes PM, poll suggests"},{"url":null,"title":"archbishop-welby-put-the-truth-out-on-social-media","story":"It came as the Church of England issued social media guidelines for the first time in a bid to tackle online abuse and misleading content.It is thought to be the first church organisation to have done so.The charter, written specically for all users who engage with the churchrsquos and archbishoprsquos national social media channels, promotes \"truth, kindness, welcome, inspiration and togetherness\".: Pressure to be perfect social media mum left me sick with anxietySpeaking at a live QA session at Facebooks London offices, Archbishop Justin Welby said: ldquoIt is the golden rule that Jesus talked about that is part of all the major world faiths, which is to treat others as you would like to be treated.\"It talks about truth, kindness and welcome.ldquoWhen you put something out on social media, put the truth out.ldquoFrankly there is no such thing as an alternative fact.

From free personal care to the abolition of tuition fees, the ban on smoking in public places, a minimum pricing for alcohol and the introduction of equal marriage. There’s a long, long list of these inidual policies that wouldn’t have happenedwe hadn’t had a Scottish Parliament.Across the world there are other countries now looking to Scotland to learn from the globally ground-breaking things we’ve done on public health, on tackling climate change, and on the work we’re doing around renewable energy.But above any inidual policy, there is a much more fundamental achievement, and that is that,  years on, the parliament has reinvigorated Scottish democracy and become an accepted, established part of Scottish le. We should all take great pride in that.What has been the most dficult challenge the Parliament has faced and you personally The sad and unexpected death in  of Donald Dewar – the man who had driven through the Scotland Act and then become the first First Minister – was no doubt a moment of great uncertainty for all MSPs in the early days of the Parliament.On a personal level, I’d have to say assuming the office of First Minister was my biggest challenge. Despite having spent  years in frontline politics, and seven as Deputy First Minister, nothing can prepare you for the moment where suddenly you are the last word, where there is no longer anyone above you to seek a second opinion on somethingyou want it – everyone is looking to you.What is your most memorable moment There have been many memorable moments. The passage of the Equal Marriage Act and the Minimum Pricing legislation are two key ones for me. I also think the referendum campaign has to be one of them. It not only saw Parliament at its best – with robust debates and intense scrutiny – but also sparked an enormous outpouring of democratic engagement across the country. Although the result didn’t go the way I wanted, the legacy of a more politically involved country is one we should all cherish.I have a lot of memorable moments. It’s not the famous names or the big events, but the stories I hear from iniduals around the country that inspire me. I’ve spent a lot of time lately listening to the le experiences of Scotland’s care experienced young people. Their stories will stay with me forever and drive me to improve their lives and opportunities.In  years’ time, how do you hope the Parliament will have evolved It should evolve in line with the way people in Scotland want it to. The Parliament was established in large part because of the democratic deficit that opened up during  years of a Tory government which became more and more unpopular in Scotland. Despite devolution, Brexit in particular has demonstrated that Westminster is willing to ignore the views of people in Scotland and disregard votes of the Parliament. I have absolutely no doubt that by  we will have completed the powers of the Parliament and become an independent country. That means we will have established a genuine partnership of equals with the rest of the UK and will have ensured that people in Scotland always get the governments they vote for.Are there any people you would like to thank We should never ever forget those who campaigned for decades to see a Scottish Parliament – many of whom never lived to see it become a reality.Then there are those who have worked tirelessly behind the scenes. We couldn’t do our job without the work of the parliament staff, led by the Parliament’s chief executive, Sir Paul Grice, who recently announced he was moving on to a new job after  years. He might not be well-known by the wider public but, as someone who was there from the very beginning, all MSPs and staff owe him an enormous debt of gratitude.For me personally, I certainly would not be where I am today without the support of my mum and dad and my husband Peter.Everyone is invited to join the partySaturday, June ,  is gearing up to be a great day.From am to noon, the Queen will address Parliament and each of the party leaders will speak in response. The audience will include those young people who were born in  as well as finalists from a competition for student film-makers who produced a short film on the impact the Scottish Parliament has had in their area. There will also be a number of performances celebrating the best of Scotland’s culture and music and the Makar will perform a new piece of work.In the afternoon, the Parliament will open its doors for a day of celebration – a party everyone is invited to join from pm to pm.There will be a chance to sit in the Presiding Officer’s seat and see how it feels to take charge, as well as retro games like giant Jenga, Kerplunk and space hoppers. There will also be live music, dancers, face painting and caricaturists.And of course, there will be birthday cake and food too. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said: “It will be a great day, full of colour and energy. Parliament always does these events well and brings in so many people from across Scotland. “I hope we spend the day not just looking back on what has been achieved, but focused on the work the parliament still has to do.“The public are often sceptical of politicians, but I hope people across the country will reflect on how far we’ve come with the parliament and the dference it has already made to so many people’s lives.”"},{"url":null,"title":"nicola sturgeon the scottish parliament s greatest achievements","story":"The Scottish Parliament will celebrate its th anniversary today .Her Majesty the Queen will take part in the th anniversary celebrations today, with the iconic Parliament building in Edinburgh being open from pm to pm for visitors to join in the birthday celebrations.And in an exclusive QA, Scotland’s First Minister Nicola Sturgeon told us what she believes the Parliament’s top  greatest achievements are.The country’s top politician also shared her thoughts on Brexit and the future, sounding a note of caution for the UK’s next Prime Minister.Here, in her own words, Nicola walks us through the Parliament’s success story...Right from its earliest years, the Scottish Parliament showed that it was ready to take policy decisions substantially dferent to those at Westminster to help build a better country.A clear early example of this was the introduction of free personal care for the elderly. This was a substantial commitment but was vital for Scotland’s long term interests, preparing ourselves for the challenges of an ageing population. We’ve recently extended free personal care to cover all those who are assessed as needing it, no matter their age.MSPs also charted a dferent course when, following a change of administration in , parliament voted to scrap tuition fees in Scotland, restoring Scotland’s long and proud tradition of free education.Similarly, the decision to abolish prescription charges brought to an end what was little more than a tax on ill health. The NHS of course is the greatest, and most valued, example of a universal service where care is provided on the basis of need and not ability to pay. Our health service, like others across the world, faces challenges. But it is a real achievement of the Scottish Parliament that we have resisted the marketization moves south of the border while ensuring that under the current government Scotland’s AE departments are the best performing in theUK.On other occasions, the Parliament has led the UK in making bold policy choices, such as the ban on smoking in public places. Our Climate Change Act includedthe most ambitious emissions reduction targets of any legislature in the world and, as Health Secretary, I was heavily involved in the campaign to introduce a minimum unit price for alcohol, which we knew would play a key role in tackling Scotland’s unhealthy relationship with drink – another world leading measure.data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.glasgowsouthandeastwoodextra webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"As the Scottish Parliament prepares to celebrate its th anniversary, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon reflects on both its journey and her own.\"  First Minister Nicola Sturgeon reflects on  years of the Scottish Parliament viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"GLAS | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"GLAS | Article Teaser\"It took a decade of hard work to make this policy a reality and I am personally very proud of the campaign, working with stakeholders, to persuade MSPs to back minimum pricing, as well as overcoming a legal challenge that went all the way to the Supreme Court.I am personally committed to making sure every child and young person in Scotland gets the best possible start in le. We have already delivered an increase in free, high quality childcare for all three and four year olds and extending entitlement to eligible two year olds and will increase it further before the end of this parliament.Scotland has also become a much safer society under devolution. Recorded crime has fallen to some of the lowest levels seen since the s. In particular, non-sexual violent crime has fallen substantially, thanks in no small part to the excellent work of the Violence Reduction Unit, which was established over a decade ago with cross-party support and is now being copied across the UK.In recent years, new powers have come to the Scottish Parliament and with those powers come increased responsibilities for MSPs to deliver for the people ofScotland.Income tax policy is now a key feature of the annual Scottish budget. We’ve used these new powers to introduce a fairer income tax policy, with most people paying less tax than they would south of the border – while continuing to raise revenue to support investment in the economy and public services.Last year Parliament passed the wide-ranging Social Security Act, paving the way for devolution of a number of benefits, as well as creating a number of newbenefits such as increased carers’ support allowance and best start grants for families with young children – and a new social security agency to deliver them. This new agency has a culture of dignity and respect at its heart and early feedback from service users has been overwhelmingly positive.I also appointed the first gender balanced Scottish cabinet and we are encouraging more women to stand for parliament, and bring a better balance to ourpublic le.Over the course of the Scottish Parliament consistent action has been taken to ensure communities have the opportunity to own the land they live and work on.Many communities have benefited from the right to buy that now covers rural and urban communities.Of course, the foundation of our country is a strong and resilient economy. That’s why we have slashed or abolished business rates for , premises –saving almost £. billion for our small businesses.We have invested in our infrastructure with all governments building new schools and hospitals and, of course, the iconic Queensferry Crossing.And, to help make sure we have the workforce we need for years to come, we have delivered just over a quarter of a million Modern Apprenticeships in the lastdecade.In April this year, new legislation to tackle controlling and coercive behaviour came into effect, giving Scotland some of the most robust domesticabuse legislation in the world.I’m also proud of the many steps we’ve taken to make Scotland a fairer society, including the introduction of equal marriage rights – attending one of the first same-sex weddings in Scotland is a memory that will stay with me for a long time.And we all worked together over many years to help Glasgow successfully host the  Commonwealth Games. This helped to inspire Scots to get more active,delivered new facilities and put Scotland on the world stage. It was a sight to behold.My final achievement is perhaps harder to quanty. There is no doubt that the re-establishment of Scotland’s parliament has profoundly changed our political culture for the better, with our nation’s lawmakers much more accessible to those they represent. It has also enabled us to have conversations we wouldn’t have had and to debate our own future, with the  independence referendum generating an increase in democratic engagement.Looking ahead, we now face the signicant challenges posed by Brexit which, of course, Scotland’s people and parliament overwhelmingly oppose. Given the long-term damage that Brexit will cause to Scotland, and the material change in circumstances this represents, I believe it is only fair that people are given the choice of whether to become an independent country. Indeed, the current SNP Government was elected on a clear manesto commitment that people should be offered that choice should Scotland be taken out of the EU against its will. Polls consistently show that people living here believe the decision on whether to hold a referendum should be a matter for Holyrood and not Westminster. Twenty years after it came into being, that is an important measure of the way people in Scotland view the Parliament and one that the new UK Prime Minister would do well to heed."},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"July ,  at : amA sponsorship initiative established by Loganair has helped  dferent Highlands and Islands organisations in the last year.

This has been under constant review, some might say attack, since .#Commenting after the Coastguard Agency consultation meeting in Edinburgh yesterday, Thursday, on the future of emergency tug provision in the north of Scotland, Mr Carmichael said: “For the third time in nine years the Maritime Coastguard Agency is again consulting on future provision of emergency tugs and for the third time in nine years it looks like a botched job.“The consultants engaged by the MCA have been set tight and arbitrary deadlines.

There has to be a commitment to reducing the numbers of geese and not just keeping the population at its current level.“This means we need to see funding that lasts long enough to ensure that the measures take effect and that farmers have confidence that their concerns are being seriously addressed.“I will be closely monitoring the new measures being taken forward by SNH in the coming months and at the outcomes of SNH’s study on goose management in the islands.“I also look forward to hearing how the Minister intends to ensure that efforts going forward are sustained so that farmers in Orkney can have confidence that the Scottish Government are serious on dealing with the problem of excessive geese numbers”.Mr McArthur said that, while the announcement of measures was welcome, progress on the issue will take time and government must remain committed to finding a resolution.He said: “It is clear that the minister recognises the importance of tackling this issue and the scale of the challenge involved. While the package of measures announced by SNH today is welcome, it is also clear that it is going to take time to achieve the objective of bringing greylag goose numbers down to a sustainable level.“That is why it is so important that the Scottish Government now stays the course.

According to SNH, this study will consider the practicalities, cost and location for a number of possible measures bring the birds# population down.SNH also elaborated on a previous announcement of an expansion to the licence to shoot the birds, with a new Orkney-specic licence to cover the period from February  to June  — outside the open shooting season and the time covered by the General Licence, which allows Greylag geese to be shot from July  to August  and during the open season from September  to January .This means farmers will no longer be required to apply to the SNH Licensing team for an out-of-season licence but can make a quick call to the Kirkwall office for permission.The new measures include volunteer shooters being available again this year in August and September to undertake goose control on farms which are experiencing issues with geese.SNH is considering further changes to licences, in particular, a mechanism to increase bag limits, and a possible extension to the General Licence, currently available in July and August, to include May and June.Finally, volunteer shooters will be available again this year in August and September to undertake goose control on farms which are experiencing issues with geese.Graham Neville, SNH’s Northern Isles and North Highland area manager, said: “We understand increases in greylag goose numbers have seriously impacted on farmers and crofters on Orkney. Working closely with the local goose management group, we have committed to measures that will help protect crops, while still maintaining the balance between conservation, farming and hunting.”News of support for these measures also followed an announcement earlier in the week that the sale of goose meat and funding have been extended in Orkney and the Western Isles, until the end of .copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The concern is that, although resurfacing and general maintenance continues to be done, this may not fix the issue in the long-term.OIC has now engaged a specialist team to look at the issue, who#ll be deploying state of the art equipment to take radar readings through the causeway down to sea level, providing valuable information on its deep make-up.This data will then be used to come up with options for short and long-term maintenance of the road, with general inspections and periodic minor repairs continuing until the results of the survey are fully considered.Due to the nature of the work, there will unfortunately be road closures and a convoy system in place on the evening of Monday  July. The work has been scheduled for between .pm and .pm to minimise disruption, by ensuring that traffic from the last Pentland Ferries arrival has passed through. Delays of up to  minutes are possible.The work will begin with coring taking place, which sees four small cylindrical sections of the road removed, analysed and then replaced. This allows the contractors to identy the make-up of the top layers of the road and calibrate their equipment accordingly.The second stage of the work sees a specialist vehicle driven at usual traffic speed across the barrier a number of times, taking video and radar footage as it moves.The third and final stage sees a piece of hand-pushed equipment moved across the barrier at walking speed taking Ground Penetrating Radardata of the full depth of the structure as it goes. The GPR system emits short duration pulses of electromagnetic energy. These pulses or scans are transmitted into the road and reflections from material boundaries or embedded featuresare detected by a receiver. Through analysis of the reflected signals a continuous D model of the Barrier can then be provided, determining material thickness and construction changes.  This should therefore determine what,any, underlying defects there are within the matrix of the causeway. The survey allows data to be taken down to depths of five metres.The video survey will provide a high resolution and spatially referenced video to enable the visual condition of the surface to be assessed to sub-metre accuracy. This will be matched with the GPR survey to produce a visual model to pinpoint anomalies in the surfacing.John Wrigley, OIC roads and environmental services manager said: #As a key element of Orkney#s travel network, we keep a keen eye on the state of this road.#Our ongoing monitoring has shown that the surface continues to deteriorate despite previous interventions — which would suggest that resurfacing is not going to fix the problem in the long-term.#We now need to carry out this important piece of work to seethere could be a more deep-rooted reason for the issues — which should lead us to an appropriate and cost-effective solution.##Previous survey work has given us detailed information on the top layers of the road, but this new survey will look deep into the construction for voids or other potential failures.  We apologise for the delays that this survey will cause on the night of  July # but we#re sure that local road users will understand that this is necessary as part of finding a long term solution to improving the structure of the road.  We#d ask that road users take their time in the vicinity on the night and would also take the opportunity to remind people of the mph advisory speed limit that already exists on the first Barrier.#East Mainland, South Ronaldsay and Burray councillor, Andrew Drever added: “I accept the concerns that have been raised over a period of time, particularly by motorcyclists, and I am pleased to see this piece of work getting underway.#Once we have the survey results, we’ll be able to look at options and hopefully find a way forward in a short a timescale as possible.#copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The aim of the pilots was to reduce goose impacts by managing their numbers and by selling goose meat locally.SNH has said the studies confirmed that resident greylag goose populations can absorb substantial losses without any effect on their conservation status.The sale of the meat and funding have also been extended for the Western Isles.Sally Thomas, SNH’s Director of People  Nature, said: “Wild geese are an important part of Scotland’s nature, but their rapid rise in numbers has been challenging for farmers and crofters. We understand it’s still an issue in some areas, with a dficult balance between conservation, farming and hunting.“Our goal is to give farmers and crofters the tools they need to safeguard their crops, by giving them the control to manage goose numbers sustainably through sport shooting, other control, or selling goose meat for profit.”The pilots are now being extended until the end of . The  transitional Challenge Fund will help local goose groups develop business models to generate income from the sale of resident greylag goose meat in the long term.SNH has also said that they and local goose management groups are also exploring other options together, such as more flexible licences when necessary, a review of bag limits in some areas, and egg-oiling.The pilot studies cost about £, over five years to March  and an additional £, to March .

Naturally enough it is a time for back-slapping by its performers and the exchange of self-congratulatory platitudes from those that think more government is good in itself, irrespective of whether expected outcomes are achieved or how ruinous the unintended consequences are.I am not of that ilk. I was sceptical of the proposed Scottish Assembly in  and therefore voted No in that referendum, and was not moved to change my mind in  and established the No-No campaign for that reason. Once Tony Blair defeated John Major in his landslide victory, there was no doubt that some form of devolution would happen, and so it came to pass. Given what has happened in Scottish politics from then, including a Tory wipe-out that took  years to correct , it must be fair comment to say Major’s premiership was the greatest threat to the Union to date.There is a tendency among nationalists and devolutionists to talk up one person or another , or one political event or another , as existential threats from which the UK must succumb. This is practically always arrant nonsense that should come with big flashing red lights asking, “What are the author’s motives ”The monumental lack of self-awareness or contemptuous arrogance of our political bettersresults in routine claims by the First Minister and other SNP hacks that this or that right-wing bogeyman of the day is a threat to devolution or the use of powers by the Scottish Parliament. The fact that the SNP understood, correctly, that devolution was a unionist political concept designed to halt the growth of nationalism and was not supportive of it until the final slam-dunk confirmatory referendum has been lost in the euphoric mists of time. One example of a nonsense claim is the idea that Johnson is such a bad prospect for Prime Minister that the Scottish public would no longer support remaining in the UK were he to win his party’s leadership election and become PM. Yet Johnson was a better mayor of London than Theresa May was a Prime Minister – by a country mile. Boroughs such as Lambeth and Hackney did not rise up and revolt, wishing to secede. No, Johnson was re-elected, while May has literally been run out of town for her repeated political deceit, failure to listen and regular failure in policy delivery. If the Union can survive May’s off-the-scale ineptitude, then Johnsonshould be able to achieve a Boris Bouncethat initially strengthens rather than weakens the general belief in the Union. What happens next is beyond anyone’s ken.Asto demonstrate my point, both Hunt and Johnson are making efforts to show how their potential premiership would be good for Scotland’s place in the UK. Given the potential that Brexit offers for ing decision-making more locally, not just to Westminster but to Holyrood, and given that there is at long last a recognition that far more needs to be done and branded as the benefits of UK economic or social support, one could be forgiven for believing that the Union could become much stronger, following a deal or a no-deal Brexit.Johnson was right to point out that,the EU referendum result is not respected, then the corresponding blow to democracy that it represents is also a blow to the Union. For those Scottish constituencies that produced a strong Leave vote, such as Moray and Banff  Buchan, and then unseated their SNP MPs with Tory replacements, a failure to leave the common fisheries policy would surely be viewed as a second British betrayal that wouldthem to the SNP fold. In that respect Hunt’s greater support for May’s disastrous Withdrawal Agreement must surely count against his unionist credentials.After  years of the Scottish Parliament, both Hunt and Johnson feel they have to talk about how they will defend the Union. Surely this is a recognition that the unionist devolution project has failed in one of its core aims of providing stability in the UK by reducing the attraction of nationalism through greater decentralisation. Many of the ideas coming forward have merit but where are the ideas for decentralising from Holyrood – or repealing the many new Scottish laws that can be shown to have been damaging or counterproductive to the claims made of them  While English politicians are being creative in an attempt to strengthen the Union, very few Scottish politicians are even willing to admit devolution is deficient and requires a completely new and realistic attitude towards self-criticism.Devolution has not bound the country closer together, but instead has allowed nationalists to push us apart. It is not so much that the UK is more ided, as Scotland is ided more itself. Never have Scottish people been so pitched against each other and never has the nation been so ungoverned by its ruling class than it has been under devolution.A final observation is that,the Scottish Conservative and Unionist Party leaders honestly believe that the Union comes before everything, they should look at their own party name to see it is they who are riding two horses. Is theirs a Conservative Party in Scotland that just happens to be historically unionist or a genuine unionist party that draws from the well of practical politics and therefore does not take sides in the Tory-Labour ide If it is Conservative “and” Unionist they should recognise that crafting Conservative policies cannot always put unionism first some might have benefits for the Union but others might carry some risks to it that require mitigation, for the policies will not be defined by their unionism but by their Conservatism . If Ruth Davidson runs a unionist party she should have learned from the more nuanced and taciturn Arlene Foster, who quite rightly – as a unionist first – has declined to take sides in the Tory leadership contest. Political consistency aside, Davidson would then more easily be able to craft a sincere working relationship with a prime minister who publicly was only her third choice – or never her choice at all.Brian Monteith is an MEP-elect for the Brexit Party.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"scotland s national cycle path is a huge missed opportunity says lesley riddoch","story":"Poor maintenance and design means ournational cycle path is a huge missed opportunity, writes Lesley RiddochDoes Scotland have the worst national cycle path in the UK Despite efforts to become an active nation, it seems we do.

It’s not possible to ride in any sort of a group and cycling becomes an unsocial chore between Calvine to Dalwhinnie.

If gted they may even go on to contribute with useful research and technological ideas so unlike are present green, ignorant and wholly ill-informed flock in thecouncil chamberAn area of industry which has not been looked into with any proper statistical information is thisof Agriculture. This industry produces more green house gases than the all of transportation. In fact, it is several times greater than transportation. The catch  scenario is this industry has had no regulation or legislation is regard to reducing greenhouse gases, infact, due to population growth, the pollution created by agriculture is vastly on the increase. Technology has played its part, but it is a situation where reducing pollution is very, very dficult to achieve given the nature of the industry itself. As the population increases, this will become more relevant in terms of the overall pollution created, and no doubt, something will have to be done. Whether sea based farming of certain foods may reduce the pollution, but much of agriculture is still based on land and the production of meat will still create problems related to greenhouse gases in terms of land used for meat production and or crop production as well. It is a dilemma which will become more relevant as the population increases.I can assure you these bairns weren#t pushed into anything. They were toldthey wanted to go they had to complete a form.

The courage comes from not following the crowd herd and forming an independent and educated view. Jumping headlong onto the bandwagon is easy, understanding the science and striving to do something about it the hard bit. Joining a not fully educated and scientically ignorant caucus is just so stupid.Especially a meaningless strike from school, what child would not love a day off among mates  No doubt the pig ignorant and stupid will be so impressed.

It is a time to reflect on le, listen to beautul songs, and a prayer session is also available afterwards for those who wish to get involved in that.“I think with the issues of addictions with drugs and alcohol becoming more of an issue in North Belfast, the Divine Mercy group offers something dferent to anyone who is seeking help.“Whatever is going on in your own le or your family’s le,your son or daughter is suicidal or has addiction problems, I would encourage you to come along to the Divine Mercy group.“There is help available, which is why people come back. It’s an outlet for people also and a comfort zone for them. The Divine Mercy gives these people hope.“There are young lads coming here who are broken in their lives. The reason we can draw them in is because we are all from dferent backgrounds and we are able to reach out to them.”One of the great successes of the Divine Mercy group has been the regular Cursillo residential weekends in Benburb.The Cursillo runs from a Thursday evening to a Sunday afternoon with participants able to meet people and explore their faith further in a serene and spiritual environment.Hugh Byrne, another key figure in the Divine Mercy group, said the Cursillo is a le-changing experience for those involved.“After three days, they are dferent people. It is truly a le-changing experience and I have seen that with people over the years.”Hugh is also responsible for talking to anyone who comes to the Divine Mercy group in order to offer help and advice.“I sit and have a chat with the lads every week,” he added.“If I get them to listen, that is the start. If we help turn one person’s le around, that is better than none.“I ask them how far they are in their addiction whether it would be alcohol or drugs.“Some people have fallen away but there have been a lot of successes. Relationships and marriages have been fixed and people have turned their lives around.“We also have good links with rehabilitation services and other helplines to point people towards further help.”At last Friday’s meeting, the group were joined by some American visitors who ed to Belfast a year on from experiencing the Divine Mercy group for the first time.Thomas says the success of the group has been extremely encouraging and a sign that they are on the right path.“It was great to see the visitors from the USA who were here last year and wanted to come back over again,” continued.“They are going back to spread the word about the work the group does.“The group can only get better. We started with just three people so we have come a long away in quite a short time.“People are coming back so we must be doing something right.“We have the prayers and so on and then we come out and sit and have tea, coffee and biscuits. It is great to see everyone bonding and talking to each other.“People don’t realise how powerful the Divine Mercy is. It doesn’t matter what is going on in your le. Ask for help and reach out to the Divine Mercy.”The Divine Mercy group meets every Friday at pm at Sacred Heart church in Glenview Street and all are welcome to come along."},{"url":null,"title":"belfast council votes to take legal action to bring down flags and banners","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Flags in support of the former paratrooper have been put up throughout Northern Ireland.Although his proposal only referred to paramilitary flags and banners supporting British soldiers, Mr Beattie argued that all flags and banners that cause hurt or ision should be challenged. He said those \"paramilitary flags and banners supporting British regiments are being used to ide, offend and cause hurt to victims\".He told councillors they should face up to their responsibilities saying there were businesses in the city being fined over illegal advertisements but no action being take on \"isive flags or banners\".\"Anyone who sets out to put a flag or banner on a lamppost designed to cause hurt to our citizens, or hurt to families and victims must be challenged and we cant shy away from that.\"We can not longer say it is not our responsibility. It is our responsibility to protect citizens.\"We as a council will no longer stand for bigots, for those that set out to ide the city, for those that promote hate. We as a council should stand together. We shall do our best to make our city, a good city, a city for all, an inclusive city.\"The Sinn Fein motion proposed all banners or paramilitary flags removed from public property unless \"permission is granted with protocols that protect citizens\". data-dfpadtargetingThe UVF flags in Cantrell CloseThe motion was passed by  votes to  with unionists voting against. There were three abstentions.During the meeting those opposed said the motion itself was \"isive\".The DUP, pointing toward McCreesh play park in Newry and how Sinn Fein \"eulogise\" those killed during the Troubles, said it was ironic the motion came from the republican party.Councillor George Dorrian said that while he would prefer Ulster Banners and the Union flag only to be put in place, the erection of flags and banners was a tradition.He said there had been progress in areas in bringing about protocols on how flags and emblems were treated and much hard work had gone into easing tensions.\"This sweeping action to remove all flags and emblems is not practical or helpful,\" he said.\"This instead will aggravate tensions while some are spending time on the ground working to improve community relations. That is where time should be spent.\"Alliance Councillor Emmet McDonough-Brown said those looking to erect flags should consult with communities saying it was more about \"demarcating territory than celebrating culture\".He said flying flags in shared spaced for three months of the year was \"retrograde and wrong\".A People before Profit amendment to the motion on specying Parachute Regiment and Soldier F banners was defeated.Councillor Ciaran Beattie explained there could be no specied banner as every one needed to have planning permission. He said it was the case no flag or banner had ever received planning permission.Alliance and the SDLP also lost bids to have the motion amended. Both parties called for all authorised flags and banners to be targeted.SDLP Councillor Seamas de Faoite said people were \"sick and tired\" of the flags debate every summer and it was time to address the matter.The UUPs Jim Rodgers said he was disappointed the special meeting was called on the anniversary of the Battle of the Somme.\"We need to start wising up and start building this city,\" he said.\"There is so much to be done.

No formal or transparent selection process was used in her selection for appointment nor was she given a written contract of employment, statement of main terms and conditions or job description.During , following several years of signicant growth, the firm decided to consider promotions from associate solicitor grade to salaried partner. Mrs Mercer and two other colleagues were promoted to salaried partner later that year.However, the following year, when she applied for promotion to the role of an equity partner, she was told she did not meet the eligibility criteria. Mrs Mercer did not find out about the promotions of her comparators at the time they took effect on June , , because they had not been announced internally. Instead she learned about them around  through what she described as the \"office rumour mill\". When she enquired about applying for promotion to the next stage, she was informed that there would be no more movement in the firm for the foreseeable future.Mrs Mercer flagged ious issues about her pay during  and  and the fact that promotions were taking place without any formal or transparent selection process.In June  she informed one of firms partners that she wanted to be paid the same salary as her male comparators and to have her bonus calculated on the same terms as theirs. Mrs Mercer was later told that the firm had decided to defer the issue of her salary and bonus until the end of the financial year as part of a wider review of business and salaries. Following this she lodged an internal grievance, seeking equal pay with her comparators on the ground that she was performing like work with them. Her grievance was rejected as the firm was of the view that her work as a salaried partner was \"not as demanding as that of a salaried partner benefiting from a profit share arrangement\". The legal practice accepted that Mrs Mercer was receiving less remuneration than her male colleagues but did not accept that she was undertaking like work with them. It contended that, although she and her male counterparts were all qualied solicitors, there were signicant dferences in the work they and Mrs Mercer were undertaking both in respect of legal work and other responsibilities.In addition, the respondent contended that,Mrs Mercer proved that she was undertaking like work with her comparators, there were genuine material factors which were not the dference of sex and which explained and justied any dferences in pay.The tribunal found that Mrs Mercer was employed on like work with all her comparators going back six years to June .The firm was ordered to pay her £, in respect of the dference between her gross annual salary of £, and the modied amount of £, going forward. She will also receive £, arrears of annual salary falling six years before the date of her claim in June  along with interest of £, on arrears."},{"url":null,"title":"high do mla claire sugden and beau get married in clifftop ceremony","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

thats perhaps for others to judge - but it doesnt cause me a moments hesitation to lay the wreath today and it wont cause me a moments hesitation to continue to reach out to unionists in the future.\" data-dfpadtargeting Division, the thDivision and other forces made the supreme sacrice, is commemorated at the Cenotaph in the Garden of Remembrance, Belfast City Hall grounds.Photo by Kelvin Boyes   Press Eye.\" Division, the thDivision and other forces made the supreme sacrice, is commemorated at the Cenotaph in the Garden of Remembrance, Belfast City Hall grounds.Photo by Kelvin Boyes   Press Eye.\" title\"Press Eye -

He called the plummeting ice levels “a white-knuckle ride”.Mr Serreze and other experts said they do not knowthis is a natural blip or long-term global warming that is finally catching up with the South Pole. Antarctica has not showed as much consistent warming as the Arctic.   “The fact that a change this big can happen in such a short time should be viewed as an indication that the Earth has the potential for signicant and rapid change,” University of Colorado ice scientist Waleed Abdalati said.At the polar regions, ice levels grow during the winter and shrink in the summer. Around Antarctica, sea ice averaged . million square miles in . By , it was a record low of . million square miles, according to the study in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.The dference covers an area bigger than the size of Mexico. Losing that much in three years “is pretty incredible” and faster than anything scientists have seen before, said study author Claire Parkinson, a Nasa climate scientist.Antarctic sea ice increased slightly last year, but was still the second lowest since . Even though ice is growing at this time of year in Antarctica, levels in May and June were the lowest on record, eclipsing , according to the ice data centre.Ice melting on the ocean surface does not change sea levels. Non-scientists who reject mainstream climate science had often pointed at increasing Antarctic sea ice to deny or downplay the loss of Arctic sea ice.While the Arctic has shown consistent and generally steady warming and ice melt — with some slight year-to-year iation — Antarctica has had more ups and downs while generally trending upward. That is probably in part due to geography, Ms Parkinson and Mr Serreze said.The Arctic is a floating ice cap on an ocean penned in by continents. Antarctica is the opposite, with land surrounded by open ocean. That allows the ice to grow much farther out, Ms Parkinson said.When Antarctic sea ice was steadily rising, scientists pointed to shts in wind and pressure patterns, ocean circulation changes or natural but regular climate changes like El Nino and its southern cousins.Now, some of those explanations may not quite fit, making what happens next still a mystery, Ms Parkinson said."},{"url":null,"title":"campbell welcomes confirmation dup role securing winter fuel payments","story":"East Derry MP Gregory Campbell has welcomed confirmation from the British government that Winter Fuel Payments will remain a universal benefit for all older people thanks to the DUP’s Confidence and Supply Agreement.Mr Campbell received the assurance following a Parliamentary Question to the Chancellor of the Exchequer on means testing of the benefit.Commenting, the DUP MP said: “The decision by the BBC to remove free TV licences from over-s has renewed the focus on universal benefits for our older people.“The future of some universal benefits was drawn into question at the last General Election, but thanks to action from the DUP, a commitment to maintain the pensions triple lock and the universal nature of Winter Fuel Payments was secured.”\"The Winter Fuel Payment is extremely important for many people to ensure they are able to live more comfortably during the colder months of the year.

Ireland to support the rights of workers to holiday back-pay.Northern Ireland could face a massive public sector back-pay bill after a tribunal finding that police officers and civilian staff are owed holiday pay dating back twenty years.Trade unions have argued that all workers should be included, from both the public and private sectors.There are about , public sector employees in Northern Ireland, official figures show.The public sector bill would be a huge challenge to Stormonts budgets, especially given the payments that will need to be made to RHI claimants.The British government rushed through a two-year limit on miscalculated claims but no such cap was put in place in Northern Ireland which means the costs could be astronomical.Niall McCarroll, Chairperson of Derry Trades Union Council said DTUC will be at the forefront of the biggest working-class action in a generation, demanding that any worker who has had their rightfully earned money withheld, ed immediately.This is in line with the recent Appeal Court hearing, which ruled that workers were owed money as their holiday pay had been based on basic working hours, not the actual hours worked including overtime, which in effect breached European law.The court ruled that miscalculations arose because holiday pay had been based on basic working hours, not the actual hours worked, including overtime.Mr McCarroll said: “Since the Appeal Court ruling all we have heard is how much this will cost the tax payer, impacting on our ability toand indeed provide much needed already stretched public services, whilst protecting budgetary integrity.“There has been no reference to the integrity of workers who have been forced to use foodbanks, went into mortgage arrears, struggling to survive during austerity driven pay cuts, austerity, which seems to have benefitted the already wealthy whilst attacking working class communities.”Poverty payThe trade unionist questioned whether workers might have been spared such hardshipthey were given the correct holiday pay.“This shortfall in take home pay could be as much as £ a month, which is a signicant amount for any worker, especially workers within the Derry and Strabane area, who are already in receipt of poverty pay and terms and conditions which deny them a just and favourable standard of living.“For many workers this shortfall could have been the dference between being able to heat their homes and feed their families.”He added: “Of course, so called business leaders and employers have known about this additional holiday pay entitlement for some time which most chose to ignore, and indeed when challenged by the trade union movement they refused to value their employees and pay out.“The establishment in all its parts has once again been exposed in their continuous cycle of treating working class people and their families as being non-entities within society.“All elected representatives and political parties should come out now, publicly and unequivocally showing solidarity and making it clear that they support workers and their families, in their demand for equality and justice, calling for this Appeal Court ruling to be implemente“The full power and influence of the trade union movement will meet head-on any attempts to challenge this ruling and deny workers their rightful entitlement.”Political responseIn statements to the Derry News, NI’s five main political parties have gone on record as saying they believe workers should receive payments they are legally entitled to.The DUP is however mindful of implications for the public

“urgent clarity is needed” but like other parties was concerned about “budgetary implications” for the Northern Ireland Civil Service and its associated public bodies. He also expressed disquiet about the impact on countless business owners.Stephen Farry of Alliance, who was employment and learning minister in , stands over his decision not to introduce a cap to protect taxpayers from backdated pay claims.He insisted he acted honourably and with integrity and believed that imposing the cap would have been \"counter-productive\" as it could have caused an \"articial clf-edge\", leading to a spike of claims before the cap could take effect.And SDLP policing spokesperson Dolores Kelly said when the issue was first identied, action should have been taken to provide certainty, compensate workers for the errors and to insulate budgets from a signicant hitit would impact the delivery of public services.She also pointed the finger at Mr Farry: “It is a matter of profound regret that the Minister of the time failed to raise the issue at the Executive or introduce measures to limit public sector exposure in conjunction with other parties, Trade Unions and workers.”googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshPhoto: Chairman of Derry Trades Union Council, Niall McCarroll."},{"url":null,"title":"one derrys esteemed citizens honoured plaque","story":"A plaque will be unveiled this weekend in honour of a Derry trade unionist who was described as “one of the most respected labour leaders” in Ireland.On Saturday th June , the Derry Trades Union Councilintends to honour former Alderman and Trade Unionist Campaigner James McCarron by erecting a plaque at his former family home in Derry followed by a talk and celebration of his le with fellow trade unionists and family members.James McCarron, a trade union leader and an Alderman on Derry Corporation, was one of  people who perished when the RMS Leinster was torpedoed and sunk by a German U-boat in .RMS Leinster was an Irish ship operated by the City of Dublin Steam Packet Company.

Unfortunately the swing bridge has been out of commission since June .I have met with residents and local Labour councillors, who have been working closely with residents to discuss their concerns and plans to make the bridge once more available to the public.The bridge is owned by the Vale of Glamorgan Council and leased to Penarth Quays MarinaLTD. It was built to ensure that both residents and boat owners had equal access to land and water.I understand that there are no mechanical reasons why the bridge should not be used.The Vale Council and PQM have agreed that safety upgrades need to be carried out for the bridge to reopen. In October  PQM submitted a planning application for modications to the swing bridge. I have been told that PQM were contacted by the Vale council to mody the current application to include lower intensity flashing lights and lsquosilent alarmsrsquo. Unfortunately PQM felt that the changes would not meet the safety standards they felt necessary and choose to withdraw the application. I understand that the Vale Council is currently awaiting the outcome of a noise report which will feature in future discussions between the Vale and PQM over the future of the swing bridge.The swing bridge has been an integral part of marina le for many years and is enjoyed by both residents and the thousands of tourists to the area. Connecting the two sides of the marina the bridge acts as a short cut for residents, particularly useful for those with walking dficulties. Having spoken to local businesses about the potential for the reopening the consensus seems to be generally positive. Reopening of the swing bridge, customers could use the car park on Llwyn Passat and use the bridge to access Portway businesses.I hope that the Vale council and PQM are able to work together to find a solution. I think we can all agree that the way forward is to ensure safe operation of the bridge while minimising disruption to adjacent properties.Before the Easter recess I met with residents to listen to their concerns over plans to remove Victorian lampposts from across Penarth. The cast iron lampposts, which have been an integral part of Penarthrsquos street scene for a century are being replaced by the Vale council with modern LED lighting. I am disappointed that several lampposts along Cwrt-Y-Vil road have been removed without notying residents.Residents have set up a petition, of which over a thousand people so far have signed asking for the old posts to be left in place with new ones installed beside them. This has been carried out in towns and cities across the UK to protect the local heritage.The petition can be found at www.change.org p vale-of-glamorgan-council-save-the-victorian-heritage-of-penarth u .I will continue to work with your local Labour councillors on these issues.

And under my leadership, a Conservative administration will proudly put the people of the Vale of Glamorgan first.ldquoNaturally, we are open to working with other councillors who share those ideals.ldquoOthers - including those who resigned from the Conservative party - will have to explain to voters where they stand on these issues - and I would urge them to back us, rather than propping up a Labour administration that was rejected by the Vale at the last election.Cllr Bailey said he had a six-point plan for the Vale.He pledged to deliver the Dinas Powys bypass stop inflation-busting council tax rises scrap proposed parking charges review the local development planto curb inappropriate development protect rural schools and oppose the Barry Biomass plant.Cllr Bailey said that he was also keen to improve engagement with the public, after a series of hugely unpopular decisions taken by the existing cabinet.He said: ldquoDuring the elections in , we promised to build a stronger relationship with local residents by consulting them on key decisions.ldquoUnfortunately, too many people feel that their views are simply being ignored and that Vale consultations are just tick box exercises. Take the proposals around car parking charges, or the closure of Llancarfan School. I donrsquot think anyone outside of the Civic Offices believes that those decisions werenrsquot already done deals, and thatrsquos simply unacceptable.ldquoAnother good example is the councilrsquos failure to listen to the public over Penarthrsquos original Victorian lamp posts.ldquoIrsquove been criticised for wanting to listen to the people who elected me, and I make no apologies for that. Under my leadership, thatrsquos exactly what would happen and whilst I do accept that there are dficult decisions to be taken, we have to take the public with us - not ignore their legitimate concerns. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Although a relative newcomer to the site, having previously taught in Newport, it is clear he is immensely proud of the students and staff.ldquoVisitors to the school often comment on the warm, friendly and purposeful environment that exists at Stanwell and, despite its size, they see how the school cares about the inidual child and their progress, he said.ldquoThe schoolrsquos Mission Statement is summarised as lsquoLearning to Excelrsquo and this is the vision for every child, whatever their starting points, interests or talents. The school thrives because we have a fantastic team of teachers, teaching assistants, support staff, parents and governors who help make this vision a reality.ldquoThis is what makes the school so successful because everybody gives so much.Wandering through a theatre the school uses to put on assemblies and biannual productions, Mrs Kynaston pointed out a section of floor that moved away to create an orchestral pit. The production value afforded to every department ndash theatre, maths, sports, English ndash was astounding.ldquoWe try to give our pupils the very best, said Mrs Kynaston. ldquoWe want them to truly reach their potential. To excel.Mr Brown agreed. ldquoOur amazing staff believe in every young personrsquos potential to succeed and really do go the lsquoextra milersquo for pupils, he said. ldquoOur pupils flourish academically but also as well rounded, confident young people ready to contribute to society.The extra-curricular provision at the school is broad and this really helps to develop our students confidence and skills beyond the classroom setting.That extra-curricular provision is a key focus for the school.Lessons finish at .pm, earlier in the day than most other schools, but that affords pupils plenty of time to take on other pursuits.The school offers a huge number of activities, ranging from the expected - rugby, football, hockey, theatre and orchestra - to the esoteric, like German Film Club or Cipher Club.School trips in recent years have taken students to such exotic destinations as Costa Rica, Iceland, Borneo, Morocco, Spain, Germany, France, and Italy, allowing students to soak in culture both at home and abroad.Clearly, a huge pupil base allows for a huge number of options.The schoolrsquos ability to bring such a population to the table, and keep them focussed, has produced excellent results.In the last fty years alone, it has produced Olympians, rugby internationals, Members of Parliament and television presenters.It has ties to Nasa, and men who walked on the moon have visited the school for talks.Its most curious claim to fame comes in the form of a mascot painted on a wall.Emma Davies, a former pupil of the school, had a design chosen as the official Welsh Wenlock ndash the Olympic mascot for the London  games.But Stanwell flourishes academically, as well.In its  GCSE results,  per cent of Stanwell pupils achieved at least their expected grades, compared to  per cent of the rest of Wales. The same story went for maths, with  per cent again hitting their expected target or better, against  per cent of Wales.       ,params: .pushAt A level,  per cent of all grades were A* or A, with  per cent of the year group achieving A* to C overall.A level results put Stanwell students amongst the top performers in Wales, with many iniduals securing exceptional grades.  of themachieved the equivalent of three A grades or better.Three of its pupils went to Oxford University last year, while another earned a place at Cambridge University.Mr Brown said: ldquoWe place a large emphasis on listening to our learners and and our pupils make a dference as leaders in the school, whether itrsquos through well established groups such as our school council, eco-committee or charity committee, or in aspects of teaching and learning where we have subject prefects and learner voice groups.ldquoThey help us evaluate our work as a school and plan for the future.ldquoWhat always comes through is how proud they are of their school.Rightly so. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log        ,params: .push-- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

People should be able to disagree with each other without resorting to abuse.Devolution is a journey not a destination.

The renaming of our on-air studio to ldquoThe John Wilce Studio was a popular choice to recognise his outstanding dedication.ldquoJune  wouldrsquove been Johnrsquos th birthday, so this we felt really was a fitting tribute and a lovely memorial to all those who knew him, as a constant reminder of his contribution to Radio Glamorgan.Mr Wilce regularly presented on Sunday evenings, often dedicating features to listeners. Without fail he played a Beatles track every time he was on air.When Mr Wilce was off-air, he oversaw and maintained broadcast equipment, actively engaged in fundraising and stood as a trustee, assisting with the day-to-day running of the station.Jamie added: ldquoI speak on behalf of everyone at RG to say it was a privilege to know John, not only as a fellow volunteer but as a friend. He always put everyone  first and his patience was beyond words. His music knowledge was phenomenal and the impact he had on everyone he met, not just at Radio Glamorgan has really come to light since his passing.Michelle Fowler, volunteer services manager at Cardf and Vale University Health Board, said: ldquoItrsquos such a wonderful tribute to rename the studio after John. He really made an impact on our wards and with our patients who listened to his shows.ldquoItrsquos such a lovely way to mark not only Johnrsquos birthday but also to mark the contribution he made as a volunteer during Volunteersrsquo Week. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He has also cast doubt on the future of the proposed Dinas Powys bypass, and say he believes the Barry Incinerator will be required to draw up an environmental impact assessment ndash which campaigners have been calling for.Cllr Moore and the councilrsquos new deputy leader Lis Burnett gained control of the authority in May.Their priorities include balancing the councilrsquos budget and preserving vital services for the most vulnerable in the face of a need to make pound million of savings over the next two years, as well as regeneration and building more homes, and improving school buildings.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWersquore going to be open and transparent and be prepared to work with people. If there are issues we will try to work through those issues.ldquoSometimes we will have to make decisions that not everyone is going to be happy with.ldquoWe have to be honest with people. We have to say these are the facts and whether we like it or not we will have to do some things dferently or not at all.Cllr Burnett added. ldquoBut we have to be honest about the levels of pressure on local government.ldquoOur priority has to be services to the most vulnerable.The Labour-led coalition includes members of the former Conservative cabinet, which quit the party when former leader John Thomas was deposed as leader of the Vale Tories. The coalition also includes Llantwit First Independents.This is where the new leadership stands on the key issues facing the Vale:Parking chargesCllr Moore said new parking charges proposed by the previous administration, which included town centre car parks, coastal resorts and country parks, will be reviewed.He said new parking charges are likely in the Vale, but they will be ldquorealistic.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWe have to be sensible. Some of the things put forward previously were off the wall, they went too far.ldquoIt will be a full revamp of everything. Whatever we do wersquore not going to fleece the residents of the Vale.ldquoWe may have to make some changes. It does cost money to provide car parking. There are things we will have to start charging for. It will be realistic and fair for everybody.School improvementsThe new cabinet says delivering on major new school buildings is a priority for the new administration.Developments in the pipeline include new builds forPencoedtre and Whitmore High Schools, and expansion and refurbishment of Ysgol Gymraeg Bro MorgannwgAgeing schools in the Vale are set to get a pound. million cash boost for repairs.Llancarfan Primary SchoolLlancarfan Primary School was set to be lsquoclosedrsquoand moved to a new pound million facility in Rhoose.The previous cabinet had approved the plans despite protests from parents and campaigners.Cllr Moore said Llancarfan School move was ldquopremature - but did not commit to scrapping the plan entirely.ldquoIf itrsquos justiable itrsquos justiable, he said. ldquoIf itrsquos not, we will look at alternatives.ldquoItrsquos not an easy decision to take. Itrsquos something we have to take some time about.ldquoWhat Irsquom not going to do is jump or kowtow to people who shout the loudest.Cllr Burnett has previously tweeted the closure of Llancarfan ldquowouldnrsquot be happeningLabour were running the council.New roadsWork continues on outline business cases for two major new roads being proposed ndash the A to M link around Pendoylan and Dinas Powys Bypass between Barry and Cardf ndash but no decision has been made whether either will actually go ahead.The future of both roads rests on whether Welsh Government and the council deem them viable, and whether ministers cough up the cash to fund them.But Cllr Moore said he doesnrsquot think Welsh Government will find the money required for the Dinas Powys Bypass.ldquoItrsquos out of our hands, he said.IncineratorCllr Moore said he believes Welsh Government will order the Barry Biomass incinerator to carry out an environmentalimpact assessment.Cllr Moore, who has previously attacked what he termed ldquoscaremongering and lies around the biomass plant, said he did not want the facility in Barry Docks.He said: ldquoWe opposed it vehemently, both as a council and as a party and personally. It shouldnrsquot be there.ldquoBut now it is there it has to operate within legal parameters.ldquoIf it does, therersquos nothing anyone can do about it.The council refused the original planning permission for the facility, but a planning inspector allowed it in  following an appeal. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We believe it is important that all families feel welcome in the school. Education is a partnership between home and school with a shared responsibility based on trust and mutual understanding and the co-operation and participation of parents with our school in the education of their child is positively encouraged.ldquoA good relationship between school and home builds a childrsquos confidence, aids their learning and helps them to fulfil their potential in all areas.They stressed that the children had an equal say in their education, through the use of techniques like lsquoImmersion Daysrsquo ndash where pupils have a multi-sensory experience of any given topic.These learning opportunities have ied from using LEGO in building new robot designs and solving problems, to visits from STEM experts. businesses and education experts.The pupils develop a basis from these experiences from which to draw questions and interests, while the staff ask for pupilsrsquo ideas about how they would like to learn further.ldquoWe recently we had an Immersion Day on the topic of volcanoes, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoA few of the pupils mentioned ways they would like to learn more about the subject. When we followed their suggestions a few weeks later, they were incredibly enthused ndash it really focuses them, develops their engagement.These pioneering techniques of giving the children an equal say in their education have a proven record.Albert Primary featured in Estynrsquos lsquoRecognising excellence in education and trainingrsquo publication for its innovative approach.The publication said: ldquoThe school provides pupils with an excellent range of high quality learning experiences.Mr Gilbert said: ldquoMost importantly the inspection report captures the ethos of our school and, in particular, it confirmed that we are achieving our aim to make the school a happy and secure place in which pupils grow in confidence and independence.Albert Primary also earned an award for being the top performing primary school in Wales in recognition of their implementation of the Renaissance Reading programme, and the impact it has on their childrenrsquos reading progress.The staff were experienced and enthusiastic. During the tour, I was treated to a brief rehearsal of the schoolrsquos summer production ndash The Lion King. The youngsters performing looked genuinely thrilled to be involved, and were remarkably talented singers.There is plenty of sport provision, with the deceptively spacious grounds playing host to several open tarmac areas and courts. Football, basketball, rounders, cycling and more were on offer, along with chess, drama and music clubs. For those looking to go off school site, Belle Vue Park is feet away from the front entrance, and often works with the school.This year, Albert Primary has been awarded the prestigious Platinum Flag Award after previously gaining three Green Flag Awards thanks to the environmental education programme, Eco-Schools.But no school is without its problems.A major concern for Albert Primary is having to balance a large deficit budget. In order to do so the school has lost a number of agency learning support staff, with the deputy head taking on a greater teaching commitment next year to make up for the shortfall.Another blow came after four years of saving and planning to convert a disused toilet block into a teaching and community centre.The funds, totalling pound,, had to be used to offset the deficit budget instead. The proposal was to refurbish the existing outbuilding to provide a new classroom facility for the oversubscribed main school to use, alongside the community.The governors are currently creating a task group of stakeholders to address future funding sources.But the spirits of the pupils and staff have not been dampened by financial dficulties.ldquoI believe that we are extremely fortunate in Albert Primary to have created such a positive and vibrant environment in which our children can learn, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoIt is the dedication and commitment of its staff and everyone associated with the school that makes Albert Primary the school that it is today ndash successful, happy and continually improving.Albert Primary was founded in  to accommodate all ages of children up to school leaving age.Much of its original character has been preserved and it now holds Grade  listed status. The school has some unusual Victorian artwork by Norton Nante and parts of the school were designed by highly respected Victorian architect J Coates Carter.A Victorian mural on the front of the building shows several children hard at work. One of them is holding a pet mouse on a lead.It is clear that this quirky attitude to learning has been present and successful in the school for a long time.Long may it last. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Abandoned - BlissThe first dog to arrive at the centre was -year-old Spaniel Grace, found by a member of the public at the side of the road. She was taken to the vet immediately, but after an owner didn’t come forward, she was brought to Dogs Trust.Two weeks ago, another Spaniel - aged eight and nicknamed Bliss by the team - was found tied to a fence not far from the rehoming centre. Like Grace, the Spaniel has not been microchipped, which has been a legal requirement for all dogs since  and the easiest way to identy a dog who has become separated from their owner. Shockingly just one week later, a Cairn Terrier - less than a year old, was found by a rehoming centre staff member at the very same spot where Bliss was left. Terrier Rizzo was lucky to be found as she is quite small and it would have been easy to miss her in the long grass.The most recent addition to the ranks of abandoned pooches is Sally, an eight-year-old Collie cross, who was found as a stray by a member of the public and brought to the rehoming centre.Abandoned - RizzoOonagh Philips, Rehoming Centre Manager said: “We want to remind anyone who no longer feels that they can care for their dog to contact their local rescue organisation for support. When a dog is abandoned on the road side, it not only puts them in danger, but also drivers. We are so thankful that all four of these dogs were found when they were.“Grace and Bliss were very shaken up by their ordeal when they came into our care and it took them a couple of days to build trust around people again. We could tell Rizzo hadn’t eaten in a while, which could have resulted in a deterioration of her physical health. Sally is incredibly sweet natured, and just like the others, will make a wonderful addition to the right home.“We are not sure why there has been a recent influx in dogs being abandoned. We always remind people that ‘A Dog is for Le®’ but we understand that le happens, and places like Dogs Trust are there to support any dog owner who experiences a bump in the road and needs our help. Sometimes the most responsible thing we can do as a dog owner is admit that we aren’t coping with our pets, but it is important to ensure they are kept safe and not left to fend for themselves.”If you

Ulster Business speaks to director Clare Kelly about a burgeoning firm which is leading the way in more than just business, but connectivity, co-working and wellness for its members Eighteen years ago and in its early stages of infancy, Glandore began its le in one building at Fitzwilliam Square in Dublin – capable of hosting just  members.Fast forward to the present day and it’s an all-island business with an -strong workforce across nine locations in Belfast, Dublin and Cork – playing host to as many as , people. And it’s very much a family-owned and run business, led by founder Michael Kelly with daughters Clare, Fiona and Rebecca each as directors within the company.Glandore’s high-end flexible working spaces have been up-and-running in Belfast for  years – with capacity for  members across its two locations here. However, the family’s connection to the city dates back to , when Michael first bought - Arthur Street, now Arthur Place.It’s been at the forefront of attracting some of the leading international foreign direct investmentto Belfast, working closely alongside Invest NI to bring in cyber-security and technology firms from the US and beyond – first setting up here in . Glandore offers its members a wide iety of flexible office space, co-working and hot-desking – designed so companies can grow organically. But it’s also focused on bringing its members together, connecting indigenous and international firms, while also considering wellness in the workplace, and improving its green credentials. Clare Kelly is a director of the family business – a qualied occupational therapist and Trinity College graduate, who joined Glandore in .She’s now tasked with focusing on the key marketing and business development elements of the burgeoning company – attracting and retaining members, and ensuring there remains a strong pipeline of clients.“We offer our members a erse range of services,” Clare tells Ulster Business. That includes short-term hot-desking for small businesses with just a handful of employees, to providing flexible high-end office space for companies with dozens, or hundreds of workers.”And while the flexibility allows firms to scale from small numbers to a larger workforce – taking short-term space for as little as just three months – Clare says many of the companies stay for several years, orto Glandore further down the line in their own business journey.“We also host a range of events, and can bring everyone together through the network of our members. That has allowed us to cater from very early start-ups, right through to the largest multi-national company, or scaling FDI business,” Clare says.“The dference with Glandore is the flexibility. A company may wish to bring in one or two people, and then concentrate on recruitment – but they can then scale with their growth, from say  to  people. “That flexibility and scale is key. In terms of Glandore, we are offering high quality space, but also offering a range of business services to our members.”Across its two Belfast city centre flexible workspace buildings, Glandore’s expanding network means it can now host around  members – with locations at Arthur House and the nearby Arthur Place.It has six locations in Dublin, including the Silicon Docks and Central Business District, and has boasted a long list of foreign direct investment firms, including Facebook, Twitter, Dropbox and Smartbox, and has also opened its newest office space building in Cork city.Glandore has forged strong relationships with Invest NI – helping provide high-end working environments for rapidly expanding FDI businesses – along with Belfast City Council, the Belfast Chamber and Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry.Some of its high profile international current, or former members, include cyber-security experts Rapid , digital marketing firm Bazaarvoice and global payments giant Cayan – a company which has now expanded into its Belfast headquarters at City Quays.The quality and bespoke nature of the offices are part of what helps Glandore stand out from the crowd. Clare says firms are able to specy exactly what they want, with a top-end design and fit-out team on hand to develop a specic working environment for each business.“When Glandore was set up by Michael in , he always focused on a high quality working environment,” Clare says. “We take premium office space in premium locations, and there is no expense spared in fit-out.“We provide a bespoke set up – whether they need a co-working space or a virtual office, for example. We can tailor that for each business. It’s not a cookie-cutter approach.”And while she says design and the aesthetics are important, behind the decor is the IT and security infrastructure to ensure that guests have the very best available to them.“We have always invested heavily in our network, and have our own on-site IT. We have an IT director, manager and team – so there is support even before day one. All of these things are important to firms of all sizes.”For Glandore, it’s not simply about putting guests on seats – there’s much more to the offering. “We have such a erse mixture of companies in the network and community, and we are able to mix the indigenous firms with the international companies, and actively, facilitate connections between our members.”That includes an alumni programme, which sees members past and present ing to celebrate their successful partnerships.“We bring back customers from the last  years, and representatives from Invest NI and Belfast City Council. It’s about making the connections between the current scaling members and those which have come before,” Clare says.“That support is invaluable. It can be very isolating in the those days when you are setting up, so it’s great to have someone you can bounce ideas off.”Glandore goes further still, with the introduction of both the Glandore Wellness Programme and Glandore Green Initiative – the latter focused on creating a greener and more sustainable office space.“We have been working with these companies for several years, and we get a bird’s-eye view,” Clare says. “One thing we have been very mindful of is the need for us to support from a wellness perspective.“We offer a complimentary wellness programme, which started in , long before it became a buzzword. It offers a way for our members to connect with each other, and help in retaining talent.”And while almost every business has experienced some Brexit-related impact, Clare says Glandore has reached its highest occupancy rate in its history – rising to % in Belfast.“It has been a very uncertain time and that has impacted businesses across Northern Ireland. There have been some delays in regards to FDI, but our hats go off to Invest NI which still attracting businesses into Northern Ireland.”And while there’s also scope for further growth in Belfast, there’s potential for that demand to move outside Belfast, with a potential to grow into the North West.“The hope is to continue our expansion as an all-island business, having operated on both sides of the border for  years, with capacity to grow the businesses in Belfast.“With the likes of Derry, that would be something on the agenda for Invest NI as part of its remit to win investment for outside Belfast. We will take the lead from the councils and from Invest NI, and we will look to see where we can add. If there isn’t space for a business to land, people will go where.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/bbobb.jpg","title":"coffee chain bob and berts creating  new jobs","story":"Posted on Monday  June  by John Mulgrew A Northern Ireland coffee shop chain is creating  new jobs as its expands it reach across the UK with eight new stores, it has emerged.
