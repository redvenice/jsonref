Prince Albert had projected in 2016 that the restoration project would take at least a year to complete, and he was pretty close on his estimateNow with two children of his own, he told People magazine at the time that he purchased the property that he can\u0027t wait to make new memories there with his own children, twins Prince Jacques and Princess Gabriella.\u0027I\u0027m looking forward to showing the house to the kids, sharing it with them, having them see the garden,\u0027 he said. He projected then that the restoration project would take at least a year to complete, and he was pretty close on his estimate.          Prince Albert and his family worked from top to bottom over the past year-and-a-half to make sure the home properly conveyed the emotional and historical significance it holds for them          On the second floor, four bedrooms including the one where Princess Grace spent her younger years brought back memories for the Prince          Prince Albert gave a tour of the refinished property to the Today Show          Princess Grace Kelly is seen here on January 10, 1956, with her fiance Prince Rainier of Monaco          Prince Rainier III of Monaco and Oscar winner Grace Kelly pose for photographers at the home of Kelly\u0027s parents after the pair\u0027s engagement was announced on January 5, 1956          Prince Rainier of Monaco and film actress Grace Kelly show off the engagement ring to her mother at the home of Kelly\u0027s parents a few days after their announcement          Next to the den, there\u0027s bar which the family referred to as \u0027Kelly Tavern\u0027 Next to the den, there\u0027s a bar which the family referred to as \u0027Kelly Tavern.\u0027 An oar that is believed to have belonged to Princess Grace\u0027s father hangs today above the bar, where the point of his scull is also displayed.In addition to the restorative work, irreplaceable personal touches somehow remained throughout the residence, like the linen closet floor on the second floor that survived with etching of the Kelly children\u0027s heights clearly visible, from two years old to their late teens.          Prince Albert shows Kotb one of the irreplaceable personal touches that somehow remained throughout the residence, like the linen closet floor on the second floor          The linen closet door survived with etchings of the Kelly children\u0027s heights clearly visible, from two years old to their late teens          Though he was thankful the memories were preserved unscathed, Prince Albert couldn\u0027t really offer much of an explanation for the still-standing treasure          \u0027Maybe they thought we were going to take it back one day,\u0027 he said, suggesting previous owners might have realized its importance to the history of the familyThough he was thankful the memories were preserved unscathed, Prince Albert couldn\u0027t really offer much of an explanation for the still-standing treasure.\u0027Maybe they thought we were going to take it back one day,\u0027 he said, suggesting previous owners might have realized its importance to the history of the family. That is a sweet thought, but it\u0027s not likely all of the previous owners had such charming intentions in the back of their minds.The property made headlines in 2014 when its 81-year-old former owner pleaded no contest to animal cruelty charges for keeping cats and dogs in unsanitary conditions on the property.Officials with the Pennsylvania Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals seized 15 cats from the home and found the remains of several others.The owner had lived in the large brick house since 1973.          Though it\u0027s restored now, the Kelly home made headlines in 2014 when its 81-year-old former owner pleaded no contest to animal cruelty charges for keeping cats and dogs in unsanitary conditions on the property          But today, it\u0027s back to its original beauty, sitting on a 0.69-acre (0.279-hectare) parcel that features gardens and a private backyard          Princess Grace, the former model from Philadelphia high society is shown here in a 1955 portrait during her Hollywood years          From the steps of her childhood home, Princess Grace of Monaco (1929 - 1982) waves with her family, from second left, her husband Rainier III, Prince of Monaco (1923 - 2005), Albert II, Prince of Monaco, and daughter Princess Caroline (later Caroline, Princess of Hanover), in Philadelphia in 1963Toby E Boshak, Executive Director of the Princess Grace Foundation-USA, described the painstaking attention paid by Prince Albert and his family, to protect the history of the Kelly home.They scoured over old family photos and videos to get each detail just right. \u0027There’s an old rug that used to be in the living room that was brought back,\u0027 Boshak said.\u0027They polished and restored all the finishes, keeping the originals when possible and matching older items that resembled the period of the house.\u0027Some had speculated the home, which was first built in 1928 by the Oscar winner\u0027s father, three-time Olympic gold medalist rower John B Kelly, might be turned into a museum.

And in Benedict\u0027s online family tree, Susan spotted the name Moroney - a version of the name which had appeared on the New York City birth registry.Benedict was descended from the Moroneys of County Clare, Ireland.

The photograph was released on Saturday by reporter Matthew Lee who accompanied him on the trip          What the world saw: Pompeo and Kim Jong-un pose for a photograph issued by North Korean state media after their 90 minute talk on Wednesday May 9 He also shared a photograph taken during the four-day event which shows Pompeo dining with North Korean dignitaries.  His report is published in full, below. It began with quiet words from State Department officials: Apply for a new passport immediately. You may soon be going to a country for which ordinary U.S. passports are not valid for travel.          AP diplomacy reporter Matthew Lee was one of two journalists invited by the State Department Vague as it was, the instruction to two reporters last Friday left little doubt about our mystery destination: North Korea.Secretary of State Mike Pompeo had visited the capital, Pyongyang, in complete secrecy while he was still CIA chief in early April to set the stage for an unprecedented summit between President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.Now, Washington was abuzz with rumors that he would be heading back soon to finalize details for the summit and bring back three U.S. citizens who had been held by North Korea for more than a year for alleged anti-state activities.It would turn out to be my second visit to the isolated, authoritarian nation. Eighteen years ago, I had accompanied Madeleine Albright on her historic trip to North Korea, the first-ever by a sitting secretary of state - a highly choreographed and publicized two-day affair covered by some 80 journalists.But this was something completely different: an under-the-radar, secret mission with only two American reporters as independent witnesses.  Pompeo is pictured arriving in Pyongyang on Wednesday, May 9  Since the death last year of Otto Warmbier, the American college student who suffered brain damage while in North Korean custody, U.S. nationals have been prohibited from traveling to North Korea without special passport validation.An hour after handing over our passports, Carol Morello of The Washington Post and I were in possession of new ones and an extraordinary letter.          Washington Post reporter Carol Morello \u0027Dear Mr. Lee,\u0027 mine read, \u0027The Department of State grants your May 4, 2018 request for a special validation permitting travel to the Democratic People\u0027s Republic of Korea ... Based on the information provided, we determined that the validation is in the national interest of the United States.\u0027The \u0027national interest of the United States.\u0027 Hmm, I pondered, had I ever done anything before that would qualify?Carol and I, who cover the State Department, were told to pack a bag and be on stand-by, but given no departure time, let alone a date. We were sworn to secrecy and advised that any leak of a potential Pompeo return to Pyongyang would be grounds for the two press seats on his plane to go empty.The \u0027Most Secure Place on Earth\u0027: Top secret NORAD base...Trump approves disaster aid for Hawaii\u0027s Big Island as...Share this articleRumors of the trip intensified through the weekend as European diplomats who wanted to meet with Pompeo to discuss the administration\u0027s imminent decision on the Iran deal - which Trump was preparing to withdraw from - were being told he would be out of the country on North Korea-related travel.          Pompeo did not know if he was guaranteed a meeting with Jong-un when he arrived in Pyongyang, according to the report           After their 90 minute talk, it took Kim 10 minutes to give word back to the State Department that he would release the prisonersStill, Saturday and Sunday passed with no word.Then, late on Monday afternoon, we were told we\u0027d depart from the department\u0027s Foggy Bottom headquarters at 7:45 that night. We would fly overnight with refueling stops in Alaska and Japan, and go on to North Korea, returning in reverse order at some undetermined point. The State Department had allotted 10 hours of time on the ground. Officials cautioned though that it could be as many as 24 hours depending on the unpredictable North Koreans.We left in a two-van motorcade from the department\u0027s underground parking garage with spokeswoman Heather Nauert, a translator and other Pompeo aides for Joint Base Andrews outside Washington. A staffer\u0027s forgotten bag caused a brief bit of alarm amid concern that our brief return to the Harry S. Truman building could attract unwanted attention. Once at Andrews, we waited for Pompeo to arrive and soon the U.S. Air Force C-32, a converted Boeing 757, its fuselage emblazoned with \u0027United States of America\u0027 with tail number 80001, was airborne. Destination: Pyongyang, capital of the most reclusive nation on Earth.So began a four-day journey with no confirmed schedule on the ground in North Korea, no guarantee of the prisoners\u0027 release or on progress for the summit and little to no sleep.When I\u0027d visited in 2000 as a reporter for the French news agency Agence France-Presse to cover Albright, circumstances were very different. For one, no special passport was needed. Dozens of journalists had either flown with the secretary of state or taken charter flights from Beijing to Pyongyang to cover the events. There were organized press tours of the capital and a mass stadium show hosted by the current leader\u0027s late father, Kim Jong Il.Portraits of late leaders Kim Il Sung, left, and Kim Jong Il, left, are seen along the motorcade route transporting Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and US diplomats in Pyongyang, North Korea, Wednesday, May 9, 2018The dynamics between Washington and Pyongyang, still long-time adversaries, had changed, too, and in unpredictable ways. Trump and the younger Kim had traded threats and insults during 2017 as North Korea conducted atomic and ballistic missile tests, fueling fears of war. Then this year, the rhetoric had cooled significantly and Kim had made an extraordinary offer to meet with Trump, an invitation the president accepted with startling alacrity.Notwithstanding the secret arrangements for Pompeo\u0027s return trip, we wouldn\u0027t be the first to report it.As our plane descended Tuesday into the U.S. air base in Yokota, Japan, for its second refueling stop, Trump announced that his top diplomat was on his way to Pyongyang.It came during his highly anticipated declaration that he was withdrawing the U.S. from the Iran nuclear deal. Trump would use the fact of Pompeo\u0027s visit to counter criticism that the Iran decision meant he was not interested in negotiating with adversaries.After a quick cold shower, which would be the only bathing opportunity in four days, we left Japan for the two-and-a-half-hour flight north and arrived at the Pyongyang airport early Wednesday morning. All normal communications were effectively shut down with staffers carrying \u0027burn phones\u0027 on which they could text and a limited number of satellite phones for emergency use only.Pompeo was greeted by North Korean dignitaries and boarded a Mercedes limousine. We climbed aboard a Chevy van, identified by logos on the spare tire and driver\u0027s console as \u0027The American Road.\u0027 The driver, whether or not he spoke or understood English, was non-communicative, so our questions about \u0027The American Road\u0027 went unanswered.  North Korean souvenirs postcards and book purchased by Matthew Lee, diplomatic writer for The Associated PressPyongyang had changed a lot in two decades. There were more tall buildings and more vehicles, but certainly still far fewer than in other world capitals. Also different were the smartly uniformed female traffic cops who had once directed a minuscule number of cars with precision gestures. They had moved from the middle of intersections to the corners, apparently due to the installation of stoplights.After a winding drive past grandiose memorials, museums, government offices and revolutionary billboards, we arrived at the city\u0027s main hotel for foreign visitors, the Koryo International, where many of us had stayed when Albright visited in 2000. The hotel re-opened last year after a renovation aimed at ridding it of its Soviet-style appearance, with gleaming marble floors and walls. The elevators, however, remained as slow as they had been 18 years earlier.With Pompeo\u0027s uncertain schedule, the Koryo lobby, bookstore, luxury goods market, coffee shop and traditional Korean restaurant were Carol\u0027s and my base for the next nearly 13 hours while he met and lunched with North Korean officials and finally left for closed-door talks with Kim, just an hour after receiving confirmation that the meeting was, in fact, on. We waited for news over endless cups of coffee.The bookstore offered some respite. It sold treatises by Kim Il Sung, North Korea\u0027s founder and the current leader\u0027s grandfather, and by Kim Jong Il on their life and politics. There was also a book of anecdotes about Kim Jong Un that had a chapter on the importance of well-fed dolphins. Postcards depicting North Korea\u0027s military might - missiles raining down on a geographic feature adorned with the Stars and Stripes and the Statue of Liberty under siege - were big sellers, according to the clerk. Dollars, euros, yen, Chinese yuan all happily accepted, she said.But essentially we had a long, boring wait.Still, the Koryo can offer up surprises.          The three men arrived back in Joint Base Andrews in the early hours of Thursday morning. They were greeted by President Trump and Melania Trump. They began their journey on the same plane as Pompeo and the journalists but got onto a different, smaller, government plane in Japan as they refueled Eighteen years ago, it was the appearance of a German aid worker, Norbert Vollertson, who seized on the rare presence of foreign correspondents to risk expulsion by illegally driving one of them out of town to show him squalid living conditions and human rights abuses. He was later deported.On Wednesday, it was when hotel staffers suddenly began to stare in rapt attention at televisions tuned to North Korean state television. It was a special report, breaking news to North Koreans about Kim\u0027s two-day trip earlier that week to Dalian, China, to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping. He\u0027d traveled by plane not train: the first trip abroad by air by a North Korean leader in decades. The trip was treated as an epic and historic event that analysts said could have been a test flight to prepare for Kim\u0027s upcoming summit with Trump.After Pompeo finally returned from his 90-minute meeting with Kim, he gave a \u0027fingers-crossed\u0027 response when asked if the American prisoners would be released. About 10 minutes later, a North Korean emissary arrived to give him the good news: They would be released. We would be heading home soon.    Both planes stopped in Anchorage, Alaska, to refuel on their way back. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo\u0027s plane is pictured A small team of medical personnel and officials were dispatched to collect the three detainees. The rest of us, including Pompeo, drove to the airport to board the plane for the long journey back to Washington.As the prisoners arrived, we caught a glimpse of them leaving their vehicle and walking up stairs to the plane. Unlike Warmbier, they were ambulatory and appeared in good spirits as they boarded. They were sequestered in the middle section of the plane with curtains closed.They were transferred to another, smaller government jet in Japan, and we would not see them again until they arrived at Andrews and emerged from their aircraft with Trump. We watched online on our cell phones from a distance as we and our plane were held far from the event, too far to make out faces or any details.In 2000, I had written a story comparing Pyongyang to a real-life version of \u0027The Truman Show,\u0027 the 1998 film about a man living in a reality created for television. Standing on the tarmac in the wee hours of Thursday morning and staring at a live feed of the prisoners\u0027 return on my iPhone while Trump greeted them hundreds of yards away, that sense returned."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/11/23/4BFB4BC800000578-0-image-a-31_1526077047583.jpg","title":"Former Labour leader Neil Kinnock accuses Jeremy Corbyn evasion duty","story":"    Former Labour leader Neil Kinnock, who has warned Jeremy Corbyn he will commit a \u0027serious evasion of duty\u0027 if he doesn\u0027t back Britain remaining in the single marketFormer Labour leader Neil Kinnock has warned Jeremy Corbyn that if he fails to back plans to keep Britain in the single market this would be a \u0027serious evasion of duty\u0027.Lord Kinnock, who led his party from 1983 until 1992, said his refusal would expose working people to \u0027the rockslide of hard Brexit\u0027.He slammed Mr Corbyn\u0027s claim that being part of the single market restricts the UK\u0027s ability to intervene in British industry, branding it an \u0027infantile leftist illusion\u0027.\u0027It would be a serious evasion of duty if Labour did not seize this chance to protect our country from the rockslide of \u0027hard\u0027 Brexit,\u0027 the peer wrote in The Independent. \u0027By supporting continued EEA participation we can end the prime minister\u0027s deference to the cliff-edge kamikaze squad and force her, or her successor, into the pragmatic patriotism of putting country before party.\u0027 Brexit-hating peers who voted to keep Britain inside the...Peers vote to scrap the official Brexit date from the...Share this articleHe added: \u0027I respect our Labour leadership in the Lords and I value loyalty.

They have been published in newspapers, magazines and on websites around the world.          1. Photographer Jeff Rayner, camera slung over his shoulder, arrives at the Omega internet cafe at 9.50am on March 27 with Thomas Markle          2. The photographer scans the computer booths for the best viewpoint as Mr Markle heads to the front counter to pay to get online  3. Mr Markle and the photographer book time to use one of the computers, but are secretly planning to choreograph a photoshootIn all of them Mr Markle appears to be unaware they are being taken. But we can today reveal they were in fact contrived and shot with his co-operation. It is not known if he was paid to take part.The faked images include Mr Markle apparently:Being measured for a suit to wear to the wedding – in fact the ‘tailor’ was an assistant at a party goods shop recruited for the job as the suit hire store the photographer planned to use was closed.Being caught browsing a book of British landmarks in a branch of Starbucks – although he actually arrived at the cafe with the photographer, and set up the shot.Working out with weights to get in shape for the big day – but the pictures appear to have been taken on a waste tip, an unlikely place to exercise but away from prying eyes.The revelation that Mr Markle has been co-operating with a paparazzo behind the backs of his daughter, Prince Harry and Kensington Palace officials will cause huge embarrassment to the Royal Family in the run-up to the wedding. It will be galling for Harry who, in a BBC documentary last year, hit out at the paparazzi for the way in which they pursued his mother, Princess Diana. She was killed in Paris in 1997 after being chased by photographers.And shortly after his relationship with Meghan became public in 2016, the Prince made a heartfelt plea for the media to respect the privacy of Meghan and her family.Last night, just hours ahead of our exposé, represenatives of Mr Markle wrote to editors around the world and to British newspaper watchdog the Independent Press Standards Organisation. Editors were told that he was suffering as a result of media intrusion and did not want to participate in photocalls or interviews.          4. In this grainy image, the figure of Mr Markle sitting at a desk in front of a computer screen can just about be made out, while behind him Rayner uses his long lens to capture pictures he later sells for sizeable fees          5. Rayner trains his lens on Mr Markle, who is in the corner of the cafe, reading stories about Harry and Meghan but looking at the screen at an odd angle          ... to produce this lucrative shot which was flogged to the world\u0027s unsuspecting mediaKensington Palace officials did the same a few weeks before. An official letter, written by Prince Harry’s communications secretary Jason Knauf, described how Mr Markle had been ‘followed and harassed’ by photographers and journalists. The letter urged editors not to publish pictures of Mr Markle and called on them to stop pursuing him.Mail on Sunday reporters have established that Mr Markle and Rayner, a 44-year-old Los Angeles-based photographer, set up at least four photoshoots.

Ten were dead, six seemed to be dying – one with a disfiguring skin disease – and just five were still alive. One sparky little fellow clambered up on a pile of corpses then sank to its trotters and stared at me pitifully. Each one of these caged animals – alive or dead, healthy or sick, big or small – had a small blue tattoo on one of their thighs.

Restrictions on production are so rigid that one UK supermarket lost a six-year legal fight for the right to slice ham sold under the label.I went into three farms alongside the secretive investigations team from Essere Animali – an Italian group campaigning to end factory farming abuses – to probe the damning accusations against the producers of this world-famous cured meat.Woman found guilty of housing dozens of filthy and sick...The lion dismissed as a \u0027breeding mistake\u0027... because she is...At least 1,000 pigs drown at a Spanish farm after river...Share this articleLast year they released shocking footage secretly recorded over six months on a farm near Bologna. It showed workers throwing animals around, lifting them by their legs and dumping some to die in corridors.Yet even Francesco Ceccarelli, the investigation team’s head who has spent two years probing the production of Parma ham and the similar Prosciutto San Daniele, was horrified by the evidence we discovered during our nocturnal visit to one farm near Brescia.‘I’ve never seen so many dead,’ he said. ‘Some have been dead for days and there are so many sick with terrible eyes and skin. I feel such compassion for them since there seems to be no care, no medicine. This is like a death camp for them.’We entered the farms in a military-style operation, starting shortly after midnight.After dressing in a dark boiler suit, we clamped masks over our mouths for protection from the hideous fumes created by thousands of pigs clustered in giant sheds. One man with a walkie-talkie stood guard as we checked to see if shed doors had been left open so we could start our disturbing tour.          There were rows of female pigs in sow stalls that left them room to sit and stand but never to turn around. Such restrictive crates were banned in Britain shortly before the turn of the centuryAfter pushing open the door to the first room, hundreds of pigs crammed into pens looked up startled as our lights flashed on. All seemed to have their tails sliced off – although routine docking (tail clipping) is forbidden under European Union regulations.I saw some pigs with bloodied tail stumps where bored or stressed neighbours had munched on them. This was far from the only sign of cannibalism – corpses I saw later in rooms down the corridor also appeared to have been chewed.Scores of rats scurried round the filthy shed, some sprinting along pipes beside my head. One piglet trapped in a corridor without water trotted up and nudged my legs.These are curious and highly intelligent creatures. Yet they were packed in their barren pens, standing on slatted floors and lacking any comforts such as straw or sawdust as demanded by European rules. Some seemed sick with infected eyes – caused by high levels of ammonia in the air, claim activists – or festering sores on their bodies. One had an ear horribly blown up like a balloon.This farm, with so many dead piglets littering its pens, seemed dirty and devoid of decent care. Yet even in another that was significantly better kept, I discovered conditions far removed from the natural imagery associated with this industry. There were rows of female pigs in sow stalls that left them room to sit and stand but never to turn around. Such restrictive crates were banned in Britain shortly before the turn of the century.Activists said the animals are kept confined in such cramped conditions for four weeks during artificial insemination. I watched as one sow urinated, the gush of liquid splashing from the floor on to its neighbours. Like the other farms I saw, there was no outside access for the animals during their short lives in caged captivity.

Tradition dictates that royal men receive a title on the morning of their wedding – with Harry looking set to become the Duke of Sussex\u0027The dukedoms of Cumberland, Albany and Teviotdale are all suspended, meaning there could be claims to those titles.\u0027Windsor – last used by the abdicated Edward VIII – is likely to be off the table.Although it would reclaim the title for a new generation, Wallis Simpson – the last Duchess of Windsor, who sparked the abdication crisis of 1936 – was, like Meghan, an American orcee.Other options could include Avondale and Kendal.Previously used titles that are available to Prince Harry  are Connaught, Albany, Cumberland, Ross, Kintyre, Kendal, Sussex and Clarence. Connaught is now a province of the Republic of Ireland ans would be very unlikely to be used.  The Duke and Duchess of Windsor´s marriage caused difficulties for the royal family with Edward VIII abdicatingThe previous holders of the titles Albany and Cumberland lost their titles after they fought for Germany during World War I. Their heirs are also alive and hence could disrupt any claims to the title.   Ross and Kintyre have not been used in more than 500 years, and Kendal was only used once used for a baby son of King James II, who died during infancy.  However, the previous Duke of Sussex, Prince Augustus Frederick, holds a lot of parallels with Prince Harry.He was born on the January 27 1773 at Buckingham Palace, the ninth child of King George III and Queen Charlotte. He was given freedom to develop his own interests, like Prince Harry, and supported many liberal causes.    Prince Augustus Frederick, who died in 1843, was the last person to hold the \u0027Duke of Sussex\u0027 titleHe was a strong supporter of anti-slavery legislation among other causes such as electoral reform, Jewish rights and Catholic emancipation.      He died aged 70 on April 21,  1843 at Kensington Palace, where Harry and Meghan now reside. Harry – whose full name is Prince Henry of Wales – could turn down a title, but would be a surprise move. In this case, Meghan would be known as HRH Princess Henry of Wales.She is not entitled to be Princess Meghan because she is not a princess in her own right, only through marriage.The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge were also given titles linking them to Scotland and Northern Ireland, becoming the Earl and Countess of Strathearn and Baron and Baroness Carrickfergus, meaning Harry and Meghan might also be given multiple ones as well."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/12/13/4C1F1BBB00000578-5720463-Palmer_believed_he_was_a_relative_of_the_Kennedy_family_pictured-a-1_1526128792241.jpg","title":"Hall Fame pitcher suspected Kennedy lovechild finds answer age 72","story":"    Hall of Famer Jim Palmer who had long suspected he was a secret Kennedy lovechild has finally discovered the truth at the age of 72          Palmer believed he was a relative of the Kennedy family (pictured is Sen.

Moroney\u0027s brother Thomas, turned out to be Palmer\u0027s grandfather.His daughter was Mary Ann Moroney, Palmer\u0027s mother. Mary Ann worked as a domestic for the Feinsteins - friends of his adopted parents.Unfortunately, a little more digging put an end to the Kennedy dream once and for all.Susan Palmer discovered that Mary Ann Moroney\u0027s sister Katharine was married to a man whose surname was Kennedy. When she gave birth on October 15, 1945, in a Manhattan hospital, unmarried and without the baby\u0027s father, she appears to have chosen the common name Kennedy as the mother\u0027s name and the misspelled Maroney as the father\u0027s.James Palmer is not only not related to the famous Kennedys, but he is not related to any Kennedy at all.           His biological father was in fact a man called Joe Geheran (pictured) a boxing fan and socialite who would sometimes appear in the society pages of the Irish-American newspapers of New YorkHis biological father was in fact a man called Joe Geheran, a boxing fan and socialite who would sometimes appear in the society pages of the Irish-American newspapers of New York.He was married to Anne Heavy in 1945, but that did not stop him having an illicit affair with Mary Ann Moroney on one cold January night.Nine months later, James was born.  Susan Palmer has since tracked down relatives of Moroney and Geheran, who both died several decades ago - many of whom were delighted to learn they had a Hall of Famer cousin.Now the mystery is solved, but Susan Palmer says she is still dreaming about Mary and Joe, and that night they shared.\u0027She didn\u0027t have any family here. Can you imagine being 38 and having a baby who was a mistake?\u0027 she says. \u0027But maybe she was really in love with Joe Geheran.\u0027\u0027Maybe, she was just horny,\u0027 James jokingly replied.Jim Palmer, adopted before Hall of Fame baseball career, found birth parents - The Washington Post"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/12/10/4C1F5A8400000578-5720561-image-a-40_1526116776997.jpg","title":"Traveling Pompeo secret mission North Korea","story":"Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, right, stands as he speaks during a dinner between North Korean dignitaries and US diplomats, Pyongyang, North Korea on Wednesday, May 9, 2018. The photograph was released on Saturday by reporter Matthew Lee who accompanied him on the trip          What the world saw: Pompeo and Kim Jong-un pose for a photograph issued by North Korean state media after their 90 minute talk on Wednesday May 9 He also shared a photograph taken during the four-day event which shows Pompeo dining with North Korean dignitaries.  His report is published in full, below. It began with quiet words from State Department officials: Apply for a new passport immediately. You may soon be going to a country for which ordinary U.S. passports are not valid for travel.          AP diplomacy reporter Matthew Lee was one of two journalists invited by the State Department Vague as it was, the instruction to two reporters last Friday left little doubt about our mystery destination: North Korea.Secretary of State Mike Pompeo had visited the capital, Pyongyang, in complete secrecy while he was still CIA chief in early April to set the stage for an unprecedented summit between President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.Now, Washington was abuzz with rumors that he would be heading back soon to finalize details for the summit and bring back three U.S. citizens who had been held by North Korea for more than a year for alleged anti-state activities.It would turn out to be my second visit to the isolated, authoritarian nation. Eighteen years ago, I had accompanied Madeleine Albright on her historic trip to North Korea, the first-ever by a sitting secretary of state - a highly choreographed and publicized two-day affair covered by some 80 journalists.But this was something completely different: an under-the-radar, secret mission with only two American reporters as independent witnesses.  Pompeo is pictured arriving in Pyongyang on Wednesday, May 9  Since the death last year of Otto Warmbier, the American college student who suffered brain damage while in North Korean custody, U.S. nationals have been prohibited from traveling to North Korea without special passport validation.An hour after handing over our passports, Carol Morello of The Washington Post and I were in possession of new ones and an extraordinary letter.          Washington Post reporter Carol Morello \u0027Dear Mr. Lee,\u0027 mine read, \u0027The Department of State grants your May 4, 2018 request for a special validation permitting travel to the Democratic People\u0027s Republic of Korea ... Based on the information provided, we determined that the validation is in the national interest of the United States.\u0027The \u0027national interest of the United States.\u0027 Hmm, I pondered, had I ever done anything before that would qualify?Carol and I, who cover the State Department, were told to pack a bag and be on stand-by, but given no departure time, let alone a date. We were sworn to secrecy and advised that any leak of a potential Pompeo return to Pyongyang would be grounds for the two press seats on his plane to go empty.The \u0027Most Secure Place on Earth\u0027: Top secret NORAD base...Trump approves disaster aid for Hawaii\u0027s Big Island as...Share this articleRumors of the trip intensified through the weekend as European diplomats who wanted to meet with Pompeo to discuss the administration\u0027s imminent decision on the Iran deal - which Trump was preparing to withdraw from - were being told he would be out of the country on North Korea-related travel.          Pompeo did not know if he was guaranteed a meeting with Jong-un when he arrived in Pyongyang, according to the report           After their 90 minute talk, it took Kim 10 minutes to give word back to the State Department that he would release the prisonersStill, Saturday and Sunday passed with no word.Then, late on Monday afternoon, we were told we\u0027d depart from the department\u0027s Foggy Bottom headquarters at 7:45 that night. We would fly overnight with refueling stops in Alaska and Japan, and go on to North Korea, returning in reverse order at some undetermined point. The State Department had allotted 10 hours of time on the ground. Officials cautioned though that it could be as many as 24 hours depending on the unpredictable North Koreans.We left in a two-van motorcade from the department\u0027s underground parking garage with spokeswoman Heather Nauert, a translator and other Pompeo aides for Joint Base Andrews outside Washington. A staffer\u0027s forgotten bag caused a brief bit of alarm amid concern that our brief return to the Harry S. Truman building could attract unwanted attention. Once at Andrews, we waited for Pompeo to arrive and soon the U.S. Air Force C-32, a converted Boeing 757, its fuselage emblazoned with \u0027United States of America\u0027 with tail number 80001, was airborne. Destination: Pyongyang, capital of the most reclusive nation on Earth.So began a four-day journey with no confirmed schedule on the ground in North Korea, no guarantee of the prisoners\u0027 release or on progress for the summit and little to no sleep.When I\u0027d visited in 2000 as a reporter for the French news agency Agence France-Presse to cover Albright, circumstances were very different. For one, no special passport was needed. Dozens of journalists had either flown with the secretary of state or taken charter flights from Beijing to Pyongyang to cover the events. There were organized press tours of the capital and a mass stadium show hosted by the current leader\u0027s late father, Kim Jong Il.Portraits of late leaders Kim Il Sung, left, and Kim Jong Il, left, are seen along the motorcade route transporting Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and US diplomats in Pyongyang, North Korea, Wednesday, May 9, 2018The dynamics between Washington and Pyongyang, still long-time adversaries, had changed, too, and in unpredictable ways. Trump and the younger Kim had traded threats and insults during 2017 as North Korea conducted atomic and ballistic missile tests, fueling fears of war. Then this year, the rhetoric had cooled significantly and Kim had made an extraordinary offer to meet with Trump, an invitation the president accepted with startling alacrity.Notwithstanding the secret arrangements for Pompeo\u0027s return trip, we wouldn\u0027t be the first to report it.As our plane descended Tuesday into the U.S. air base in Yokota, Japan, for its second refueling stop, Trump announced that his top diplomat was on his way to Pyongyang.It came during his highly anticipated declaration that he was withdrawing the U.S. from the Iran nuclear deal. Trump would use the fact of Pompeo\u0027s visit to counter criticism that the Iran decision meant he was not interested in negotiating with adversaries.After a quick cold shower, which would be the only bathing opportunity in four days, we left Japan for the two-and-a-half-hour flight north and arrived at the Pyongyang airport early Wednesday morning. All normal communications were effectively shut down with staffers carrying \u0027burn phones\u0027 on which they could text and a limited number of satellite phones for emergency use only.Pompeo was greeted by North Korean dignitaries and boarded a Mercedes limousine. We climbed aboard a Chevy van, identified by logos on the spare tire and driver\u0027s console as \u0027The American Road.\u0027 The driver, whether or not he spoke or understood English, was non-communicative, so our questions about \u0027The American Road\u0027 went unanswered.  North Korean souvenirs postcards and book purchased by Matthew Lee, diplomatic writer for The Associated PressPyongyang had changed a lot in two decades. There were more tall buildings and more vehicles, but certainly still far fewer than in other world capitals. Also different were the smartly uniformed female traffic cops who had once directed a minuscule number of cars with precision gestures. They had moved from the middle of intersections to the corners, apparently due to the installation of stoplights.After a winding drive past grandiose memorials, museums, government offices and revolutionary billboards, we arrived at the city\u0027s main hotel for foreign visitors, the Koryo International, where many of us had stayed when Albright visited in 2000. The hotel re-opened last year after a renovation aimed at ridding it of its Soviet-style appearance, with gleaming marble floors and walls. The elevators, however, remained as slow as they had been 18 years earlier.With Pompeo\u0027s uncertain schedule, the Koryo lobby, bookstore, luxury goods market, coffee shop and traditional Korean restaurant were Carol\u0027s and my base for the next nearly 13 hours while he met and lunched with North Korean officials and finally left for closed-door talks with Kim, just an hour after receiving confirmation that the meeting was, in fact, on. We waited for news over endless cups of coffee.The bookstore offered some respite. It sold treatises by Kim Il Sung, North Korea\u0027s founder and the current leader\u0027s grandfather, and by Kim Jong Il on their life and politics. There was also a book of anecdotes about Kim Jong Un that had a chapter on the importance of well-fed dolphins. Postcards depicting North Korea\u0027s military might - missiles raining down on a geographic feature adorned with the Stars and Stripes and the Statue of Liberty under siege - were big sellers, according to the clerk. Dollars, euros, yen, Chinese yuan all happily accepted, she said.But essentially we had a long, boring wait.Still, the Koryo can offer up surprises.          The three men arrived back in Joint Base Andrews in the early hours of Thursday morning. They were greeted by President Trump and Melania Trump. They began their journey on the same plane as Pompeo and the journalists but got onto a different, smaller, government plane in Japan as they refueled Eighteen years ago, it was the appearance of a German aid worker, Norbert Vollertson, who seized on the rare presence of foreign correspondents to risk expulsion by illegally driving one of them out of town to show him squalid living conditions and human rights abuses. He was later deported.On Wednesday, it was when hotel staffers suddenly began to stare in rapt attention at televisions tuned to North Korean state television. It was a special report, breaking news to North Koreans about Kim\u0027s two-day trip earlier that week to Dalian, China, to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping. He\u0027d traveled by plane not train: the first trip abroad by air by a North Korean leader in decades. The trip was treated as an epic and historic event that analysts said could have been a test flight to prepare for Kim\u0027s upcoming summit with Trump.After Pompeo finally returned from his 90-minute meeting with Kim, he gave a \u0027fingers-crossed\u0027 response when asked if the American prisoners would be released. About 10 minutes later, a North Korean emissary arrived to give him the good news: They would be released. We would be heading home soon.    Both planes stopped in Anchorage, Alaska, to refuel on their way back. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo\u0027s plane is pictured A small team of medical personnel and officials were dispatched to collect the three detainees. The rest of us, including Pompeo, drove to the airport to board the plane for the long journey back to Washington.As the prisoners arrived, we caught a glimpse of them leaving their vehicle and walking up stairs to the plane. Unlike Warmbier, they were ambulatory and appeared in good spirits as they boarded. They were sequestered in the middle section of the plane with curtains closed.They were transferred to another, smaller government jet in Japan, and we would not see them again until they arrived at Andrews and emerged from their aircraft with Trump. We watched online on our cell phones from a distance as we and our plane were held far from the event, too far to make out faces or any details.In 2000, I had written a story comparing Pyongyang to a real-life version of \u0027The Truman Show,\u0027 the 1998 film about a man living in a reality created for television. Standing on the tarmac in the wee hours of Thursday morning and staring at a live feed of the prisoners\u0027 return on my iPhone while Trump greeted them hundreds of yards away, that sense returned."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/11/23/4BFB4BC800000578-0-image-a-31_1526077047583.jpg","title":"Former Labour leader Neil Kinnock accuses Jeremy Corbyn evasion duty","story":"    Former Labour leader Neil Kinnock, who has warned Jeremy Corbyn he will commit a \u0027serious evasion of duty\u0027 if he doesn\u0027t back Britain remaining in the single marketFormer Labour leader Neil Kinnock has warned Jeremy Corbyn that if he fails to back plans to keep Britain in the single market this would be a \u0027serious evasion of duty\u0027.Lord Kinnock, who led his party from 1983 until 1992, said his refusal would expose working people to \u0027the rockslide of hard Brexit\u0027.He slammed Mr Corbyn\u0027s claim that being part of the single market restricts the UK\u0027s ability to intervene in British industry, branding it an \u0027infantile leftist illusion\u0027.\u0027It would be a serious evasion of duty if Labour did not seize this chance to protect our country from the rockslide of \u0027hard\u0027 Brexit,\u0027 the peer wrote in The Independent. \u0027By supporting continued EEA participation we can end the prime minister\u0027s deference to the cliff-edge kamikaze squad and force her, or her successor, into the pragmatic patriotism of putting country before party.\u0027 Brexit-hating peers who voted to keep Britain inside the...Peers vote to scrap the official Brexit date from the...Share this articleHe added: \u0027I respect our Labour leadership in the Lords and I value loyalty.

They have been published in newspapers, magazines and on websites around the world.          1.

Mr Markle and the photographer book time to use one of the computers, but are secretly planning to choreograph a photoshootIn all of them Mr Markle appears to be unaware they are being taken. But we can today reveal they were in fact contrived and shot with his co-operation. It is not known if he was paid to take part.The faked images include Mr Markle apparently:Being measured for a suit to wear to the wedding – in fact the ‘tailor’ was an assistant at a party goods shop recruited for the job as the suit hire store the photographer planned to use was closed.Being caught browsing a book of British landmarks in a branch of Starbucks – although he actually arrived at the cafe with the photographer, and set up the shot.Working out with weights to get in shape for the big day – but the pictures appear to have been taken on a waste tip, an unlikely place to exercise but away from prying eyes.The revelation that Mr Markle has been co-operating with a paparazzo behind the backs of his daughter, Prince Harry and Kensington Palace officials will cause huge embarrassment to the Royal Family in the run-up to the wedding. It will be galling for Harry who, in a BBC documentary last year, hit out at the paparazzi for the way in which they pursued his mother, Princess Diana. She was killed in Paris in 1997 after being chased by photographers.And shortly after his relationship with Meghan became public in 2016, the Prince made a heartfelt plea for the media to respect the privacy of Meghan and her family.Last night, just hours ahead of our exposé, represenatives of Mr Markle wrote to editors around the world and to British newspaper watchdog the Independent Press Standards Organisation. Editors were told that he was suffering as a result of media intrusion and did not want to participate in photocalls or interviews.          4.

The renowned John Hansard Gallery, once out on the verges of Southampton University, to which it belongs, has moved into a specially designed building in the city centre. The exterior and interior are the work of two different architects, the developer went bust and too many cooks were involved in the broth. To describe the project as a long story would be the merest understatement: it has been going on for nearly 20 years.But the good news is that the bad news – the exterior – doesn’t matter. Outside is an undistinguished shop-front of grey bricks speckled with sporadic beige, the default look of so much of today’s high-rise housing (the gallery morphs into flats at the back). Standing opposite is its exact twin, the Nuffield theatre, separated only by a narrow alley of tapas bars. The signage is hideously civic and almost comically inadequate for such important institutions. The name is absurd – why call these two entirely separate venues (three if you count the film charity City Eye) Studio 144? And both the theatre and the main galleries are hoisted up above more cafes and restaurants, as if they could hardly stand on their own two feet.But the interior of the new JHG is as well suited to contemporary art as anything launched in those two decades, from the Turner Contemporary in Margate to the Jerwood in Hastings. Indeed, for art lovers, the south coast is an ever-growing chain of beacons: from Margate, with its exceptional programme, to the Folkestone Triennial and the impressively adventurous De La Warr in Bexhill-on-Sea from the great Towner Gallery in Eastbourne (its funding recently, disastrously, threatened by its own council) to Pallant House in Chichester, with its museum-class British art shows and onward now to Southampton.Considering that Southampton already has its venerable City Art Gallery, housed in the neoclassical Civic Centre, with a permanent collection running from Turner and Monet to Chris Ofili and currently showing George Shaw’s terrific My Back to Nature, you might say the city centre is already rich in art. But unlike practically every other gallery in the world, this one doesn’t open on a Sunday. So there is even more scope for the JHG, which is aiming for six times the modest visitor figures of its campus days.There is underfloor heating for cold weather, a vividly appealing children’s suite and panoramic windows in two spaces to lure a curious public in from the main boulevard outside. The decor is standard white cube – polished concrete, glass, steel and selected Scandinavian wood floors – but the configuration of galleries is excellent. Small rooms open into larger galleries and finally into a colossal double-height prism of a space with picture windows the size of a multiplex screen overlooking the wide piazza below. Crowds gather and disperse, children run, skateboarders race across the pale Portland stone to the colonnaded Guildhall opposite. It’s like being in a box at some vast public theatre.For its inaugural show, the curators have chosen the German art star Gerhard Richter (born 1932). With two-dozen works (or 275, if you include all the panels in two major installations) running all the way back to 1977, this is effectively a condensed retrospective. And because Richter is famously questioning of all the usual distinctions in painting – figurative versus abstract, mechanical reproduction versus painterly touch and so on – it’s a particularly judicious selection.His Mirror paintings, in which pigment adheres to glass, are shiningly reflective in outward appearance yet inherently opaque. Look into them, drawn by their greens, greys and blues, and you see yourself doubled, then mistily silhouetted (they are angled in pairs in gallery corners). The colour recedes and so does the clarity of your own visage.Mustang Squadron shows an array of warplanes flying in formation, in silent black and white. Close by it hangs 14 Feb 45, an aerial image of a cityscape that one cannot quite make out. Are we too high up for visibility, is the photographic print blurred, or are we simply blind to what we see – namely Dresden, bombed on that February day. The analogy between the two images is clear.There are all-grey paintings, their surfaces so flawless they look like photographs of paintings and there are black-and-white photographs of coloured paintings that transform inidual brushstrokes into lunar landscapes. 4900 Colours fills the double-height gallery from floor to ceiling with its panels of coloured squares in innumerable permutations. A vision of apparent estrangement – they look, and are, entirely random – the installation nevertheless holds the eye completely with its glowing-all-over scintillation.The lighting is superb, particularly in the room devoted to 48 Portraits, which have never looked so poignant. A gallery of modern heroes – Wilde, Stravinsky, Mann, Planck – these are facsimiles of black-and-white paintings based in turn on formal photographs, so that the sense of remoteness is deep, as if to ask what the painter could ever know of these people. Yet together they are a shrine to the dead, pivoting on the one mask that turns directly to us: the intensely moving face of Franz Kafka.For such a monastically reserved painter, Richter is extraordinarily prolific. Yet even this relatively small survey carries a full sense of his anxious, doubting intellect. It includes a self-portrait in which Richter is both there and not there, three times over, a photographic ghost haunting his own studio.Richter will be followed by shows featuring the work of John Latham, Anya Gallaccio and Siobhán Hapaska. Philip Hoare, marvellous writer, curator and film-maker, author of Leviathan, or The Whale, is working on a centennial celebration of Wilfred Owen for the colossal video wall in the foyer. Any gallery that starts as it means to go on, like this, deserves every future success."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7d130bf3c3424235fe7e409bc97c032eeb2379b9/0_312_5000_2999/master/5000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=08a655f621f45fe6e183ba7ca8bf706c","title":"martin parr butlins by the sea big picture","story":"An early Martin Parr picture of a crowded pool in Filey, North Yorkshire shows a spirit of social realismMartin Parr took this photograph in 1972, when shivering in crowded public baths was the archetypal experience of knock-kneed British seven-year-olds. At the time Parr, aged 20, was a student of photography at Manchester Poly. His real education, though, came from his paid holiday work as an official snapper at Butlin’s by the Sea in Filey, North Yorkshire. This picture, part of an exhibition of Parr’s early work opening next week, was taken in his first year on the job, as a “black and white walkie”. He graduated the following summer to the coveted status of “colour walkie”, able to take pictures at the HawaiianCaribbean beachcomber bar, where a tropical storm was conjured every half an hour.You could say that Parr’s mature style as a photographer followed from that promotion. The colour-saturated images of fast food and sunburnt flesh, with which he made his name in the 1980s with series such as The Last Resort, were still to come. And you could also say that the shift in Parr’s style mirrored a shift in British society. His holiday subjects became more singular, atomised those left behind by packaged fortnights to Greece and\u0026nbspSpain.This picture comes from just before that great migration, and looks recognisably in the spirit of the social realist photographers – Henri Cartier-Bresson, Bill Brandt – who had turned their affectionate lenses towards working families at play. In Parr’s photograph the swimmers – notably skinnier than those of today – appear to be all in it together. The only ision seems that between shallow and deep end.

Now, with Pops: Fatherhood in Pieces, 54-year-old Chabon has collected his essays about parenting four teenagers.A few years ago, Chabon’s wife, the novelist Ayelet Waldman, wrote a controversial essay for the New York Times in which she claimed to love her husband more than her children (and to be the only one of her married friends still having regular sex).

If you are parenting properly, you’re parenting yourself out of a job.In the introduction to Pops, you recall a long-ago conversation with an older author who told you that you had to choose between being a great novelist or a father.I realised I wasn’t interested in the question of balancing one’s art and one’s life as a parent. I’m not saying it isn’t a problem, but I was trying to consider a different question – what difference does it make in the end, either way? Either your books will be forgotten or even if you are remembered in 100 years, you won’t be around to enjoy it.You write about a discussion with your daughter in which you talk about how important it is to be a “freakozoid”. How do we encourage our children to embrace their own weirdnesses?My daughter went to fifth grade one day wearing a dress on top of jeans, a green rubber apron with blue frogs all over it and a Martha Washington bonnet that we’d bought on a family trip to Washington’s home at Mount Vernon. When your kid has an impulse like that you either say: “Go change your clothes, people are going to make fun of you, you look ridiculous” or you say: “See you this afternoon.” If you choose the latter option then you take a step in the direction of encouraging your kid’s freakozoid tendencies.You write about your children by name. Do you ask their permission? Do you worry about their right to private lives?Everything you write is drawn from the people you know. You can do all this sweating and agonising about whether it’s going to embarrass them or make them angry and often it just sails right over them and they don’t even recognise that you’re talking about them.What’s the last really great book you read?I just reread for probably the fifth time The Queen’s Gambit by Walter Tevis. I had to teach it at the State University of New York. Every time I read it I’m overcome afresh with admiration for it and with awe for the control of its performance.How do you organise your books?Alphabetically, in the most part. We have a house where we live here in Berkeley and we have a summer house in Maine, which is full of all the books we couldn’t fit in here. There are some glassed-in shelves in our house in Maine in which, one summer’s day a few years back when I didn’t have a whole lot else to do, I organised them by colour. That looks pretty spectacular.Which classic novel did you read recently for the first time?I’m not sure if it quite counts as a classic, but I just read Sebald’s Austerlitz for the first time. I loved it – it’s beautiful. It was the one of his that I hadn’t read.Which book would you give to a young person?Books that I loved as a child and which I then reread to my children who also loved them were The Dark Is Rising series of novels. They are so fantastic. Also Lloyd Alexander’s Chronicles of Prydain, based on Welsh mythology and The Phantom Tollbooth by Norton Juster.Finally, there’s Harriet the Spy by Louise Fitzhugh, which I mostly loved because she wanted to be a writer when she grew up.What books do you read for sheer pleasure?I go back to Edgar Allan Poe, Raymond Chandler. There’s a little-known American thriller novelist called Ross Thomas. I’ll pick one of his books up and I’ll only sometimes have to read a chapter or two to re-establish contact with whatever it was that was comforting and familiar about it• Pops: Fatherhood in Pieces by Michael Chabon is published by Fourth Estate (£10).

The referendum, as the pollsters remind us, was a cultural phenomenon linked more closely to people’s attitudes to immigration and sovereignty than to economic success – a situation that persists today. Still, it would be satisfying to rewind and show that the reason many now believe Britain must stay connected to the EU for five years or so relates to complex customs rules and how they cannot be reconciled with open borders.Parliament only took notice when MPs on the Brexit select committee damned the government’s dithering. The committee’s message was that keeping the Irish border open and at the same time installing border controls with the EU couldn’t work.Ever since their report last December, the border contradiction has travelled through Whitehall like a virus, forcing civil servants to drop what they are doing in a desperate bid to find a cure. As one senior civil servant put it, officials are too busy finding a way to put the right export stamp on a sheep’s backside to think about anything else.That Britain has fallen off the investment agenda of most major businesses is a sad and irrefutable fact. It’s true some domestic businesses have found extra cash for investment: after all, Britain is a nation of almost 65 million people with 32 million of them in employment. It’s a big market.But the economic data remains weak and most of the spending is simply to keep abreast of digital developments. In other words, IT investments are being made just to stay in the game. Productivity has risen a little, but mainly as a result of a fall in hours worked to achieve the same outputs, rather than an increase in output from the same number of hours worked.Even the most confident Brexiters have noticed the economy flagging under the weight of the customs union uncertainty.It’s such a quandary that last week Tory MPs were openly considering adding another three years to the transition deal just to give the brightest minds in the civil service enough time to sort it out. That would take the UK’s membership of the customs union to 2023.They recognise that any attempt to stay inside an economic zone with the EU – whether that be the “Norway option”, under the banner of the European Economic Area, or the “Swiss option”, which involves negotiating upwards of 100 separate trade agreements – comes with a demand for free movement of labour. That, as we know, is an unacceptable outcome for Leave voters.These Tory MPs support Theresa May’s attempts to cobble together a technological solution and recognise that, from a standing start, it may take until 2023 to finish the job.However, that amounts to five more years of uncertainty and five more years of being a rule-taker from Brussels without the ability to strike fresh trade deals.But Johnson and Hannan are not anti-immigration. They would allow free movement of labour as the price of economic security, though they both seek the have-cake-and-eat-it option of signing separate trade deals. This places them at odds with Tories facing Ukip-sympathising constituents, who put immigration at the top of their list of concerns. Most importantly, it puts them at odds with Jacob Rees-Mogg.With the government’s supporters split several ways, it is difficult to see how an agreement can be struck that takes us past 2020. One faction or the other would need to retreat from their central demands.For this reason, most large businesses have prepared for an immediate exit from the EU next year and the single market and customs union in 2020. It’s a sensible plan."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9e45d518ca0ffd53e31e36ebc66c989386ce1f67/1092_514_3591_2154/master/3591.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=70ce1edb33ae5584073159fbe6d8aaab","title":"turn 40 what learned hadley freeman","story":"Here’s what I’ve learned“I’m gonna be 40! Someday!” Sally sobs in When Harry Met Sally. I have long considered Sally to be my cinematic alter ego so I think of this upcoming week as Sally Albright’s Midlife Crisis, because this Tuesday I turn 40. Not someday any more – now.I’m like Sally in pretty much every regard, from the fussy eating to the dislike of wagon wheel coffee tables, but on this subject we differ. I’m genuinely excited about my 40s. My teens were a mess of hormones and mental health issues. My 20s were lost in a vortex of terrible boyfriends and worse drugs. My 30s were a dream, and by “dream” I mean one of those anxiety dreams that turns your bed into a river of sweat, as I was hit by personality-altering fertility panics. My 40s are the decade when I can just live, unencumbered by the neuroses that, in my case, were largely just a symptom of being young and insecure. As Danny Glover would say, I’m\u0026nbsptoo old for that shit.Being 40 means I know stuff. More than when I was 30, and even more than when I was 20. I like that. I’ve spent four decades getting pretty much everything wrong, and now that I know the below I\u0026nbspreckon I should get everything right in the next four.1 As you age you gain so much more than you loseI am not one of those women whose looks improve with age. My cousin recently posted a photo of us in our 20s and I spent three solid days staring at it, not even breaking for meals. “Look how much prettier I once was!” I shouted at passers-by. “Those bright eyes! That unlined forehead! And I had no idea!” Sure, I could weep for all the boys I could have kissed back then but felt too ugly to do so, but those boys were never really all that. And I’m glad I never thought of my looks as my USP, because it means my sense of self is not bound up in them. Instead, I’ve got better at the things that matter to me. I’m more self-confident, which has made me a more stable person and better writer. I no longer judge myself by how others see me, or put up with men patronising me because I am femalehave a funny namewould choose the works of Steve Guttenberg as my Mastermind subject. In\u0026nbspshort, I don’t assume everyone else knows better than me, because experience has taught me I invariably know better than the men who patronise me. And that is worth the wrinkled forehead.Yes, it’s harder to get pregnant over 40 than it is under 30, and yes, women should know this. But the way we are obsessively harangued about this is a trick to make us turn off our intelligence and become baby-obsessed just as our male colleagues are making career strides. When I hit my mid-30s I started, quite frankly, to go mad. I\u0026nbspdated men who in normal circumstances I wouldn’t have spat on if they were on fire and I stayed with them in the belief they were “my last chance” (they weren’t). One night one of these idiots dumped me and, crazed with self-loathing, I went to a party thrown by one of my bosses, where I\u0026nbsppromptly got wrecked, was caught taking drugs in the loo by said boss and then insisted everyone watch me dance to Chaka Khan. Are\u0026nbspthese the actions of a sane person? They are not. So be aware of your options, but don’t become obsessed by them and don’t feel powerless before them. Most of all, don’t do drugs at your boss’s party. Learn from your elders!3 Don’t hide behind your youthI started writing for this paper when I was 20 – yes, as in half a lifetime ago – and because I spent so long working with people older than me I got a little too used to thinking of myself as that stock figure, The Comedy Chaotic Young Person. This meant that I often coasted (of course I came to work hungover – I’m basically a child!), underestimated myself (I can’t possibly write a serious article, I’m basically a child!) and thought my novelty value lay in my youth (Me! Basically a child!). I am definitely a grown-ass woman now so I can’t hide behind the smokescreen of youth and inexperience any more. Instead, I take personal responsibility for what I say and do. This, I honestly believe, is good for the soul.4 Finally, do everythingWell, not everything (see point 2). But the only real regrets I have about my youth are the things I didn’t do because of self-doubt: the jobs abroad I didn’t take, the books I didn’t write. Do it all now, young women, not because you won’t have time when you’re older (although you won’t), but because you shouldn’t let self-doubt hold you back from anything, and it holds too many of us back from everything. And\u0026nbspif there’s one thing I wish for my birthday, it’s that this no longer be true of the next generation.

The draft investigation states that the trust allegedly spent £99,000 refurbishing a former caretaker’s house, later to be rented out to a member of staff. It claimed £10,000 of work had been done without quotes having been obtained, while no rent had been paid.It alleges the trust spent £3.26m on services from six companies without providing evidence of any contracts having been signed. It also alleges that the trust had contracts with four consultancy companies, together worth £326,044, without the work having gone out to tender. Meanwhile, a school within the trust spent £1,064 on two rooms for two nights at the Hyatt Regency hotel, Birmingham, with £507 of this for a room where the guest did not turn up.The report seen by the Observer was a draft version. A final version has not yet been published and could differ from the draft.Silver Birch, which runs four primary school academies educating nearly 2,000 pupils in the London boroughs of Waltham Forest and Redbridge, also allegedly spent nearly £5,000 on four laptops for management. The findings are contained in a draft investigation report by the Education and Skills Funding Agency, which oversees academies. It is the second time in four years that the trust’s spending has been examined.“Neither could explain the in-year deficit that the trust incurred and did not show any understanding of what an in-year deficit was.”The findings come after the Commons public accounts committee concluded that “too often academy trusts are falling short” of the “highest standards of governance, accountability and financial management” and that the Department for Education is often “too slow to react”. The draft report highlights 11 alleged breaches of the Academies Financial Handbook, a government document setting out spending rules for academies. Several “novel or contentious payments” should have been sent to the ESFA for approval in advance, the report suggests.A spokeswoman for the trust said the overseas fact-finding mission had been “approved”. She said it had been part-funded by a group called the National Leaders of Education, which contributed £6,000 to the trip’s cost of £12,117. The remaining £6,117 came from the schools’ budget.In relation to the other allegations, she said: “As part of its recent review ESFA raised an inquiry in relation to the manner in which certain payments were made, evidenced or demonstrated value. Further information and evidence by way of clarification has already been provided to the ESFA. The payments referred to were made in accordance with trust policies and procedures. “Changes already under way and further measures introduced in response to the ESFA enquiries have dealt with many of the points raised. A final report has not as yet been published.”The Education Department said it did not comment on leaked documents, but added: “The department investigates all allegations of financial impropriety.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/84efc7000973784e078680faf9bfcabc9a9a6c32/0_139_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fd7947dab178d313111235bf303424b3","title":"incentive compensation nuclear waste boreholes communities","story":"Compensation offered to encourage local communities to allow test boreholes is described as ‘completely inadequate’MPs from both major parties have attacked the government’s latest incentive to entice communities into volunteering to host Britain’s first deep underground store for nuclear waste as “completely inadequate”.Ministers have offered up to £1m per community for areas that constructively engage in offering to take part in the scheme, and a further sum of up to £2.5m where deep borehole investigations take place.The aim is to find a permanent underground geological disposal facility (GDF) that could store for thousands of years the waste from Britain’s nuclear energy and bomb-making programmes. The scheme could involve building stores under the seabed to house highly radioactive material. It is predicted that the UK is likely to have produced 4.9m tonnes of nuclear waste by 2125.But critics say the inducements offered by the government – part of the consultations it launched this year – to ensure local cooperation are “simply not good enough”, and point to the example of France, which has a similar amount of nuclear waste. It offers around €30m (£26.5m) a year as local support for districts neighbouring the site at Bure, in north-east France, and has also offered €60m in community projects.“The government’s offer in its consultation is simply not good enough. These communities are being asked to perform an important public service and should be properly recompensed,” said Rebecca Long-Bailey, the shadow business secretary.In 2012 the government’s attempt to encourage local areas to host nuclear waste facilities ended in failure when councils in Cumbria and Kent rejected proposals for underground stores to be built within their boundaries. These were the only communities to show significant interest at the time and remain the main candidates for sites now that the government has relaunched its nuclear store programme.The government is seeking to dispose of the UK’s nuclear waste underground because current storage facilities are both ineffective and expensive to maintain. A GDF would involve sealing the waste in rock for as long as it remains a hazard.The plan was also criticised by the Conservative MP Zac Goldsmith, who said the UK should stop making nuclear waste and stop building new reactors.“We are still pouring untold billions of taxpayer money into propping up an industry that the free market would have killed off years ago,” he said. “In return, we will be compounding the catastrophe of a nuclear waste build-up, which we are no closer to solving than we were when the industry was born.”Nina Schrank, energy campaigner at Greenpeace UK, added: “The lack of seriousness with which the UK government treats nuclear legacy issues makes it predictable that their quest for a suitable site has been so unsuccessful that they are looking again at the Irish Sea, which Sellafield turned into one of the most radioactively contaminated seas in the world.”A government spokesperson said: “The GDF will be a multibillion-pound project that can provide substantial benefits to host communities. This includes skilled employment for hundreds of people for decades to come, spin-off benefits such as infrastructure investment, as well as positive impacts on local service industries that support the facility and its workforce.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a310e813be9479ebcb7e830ee78c474f6a98d526/0_123_2096_1258/master/2096.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b36d0d4aa74b34bacb0f4627e659755d","title":"the week in wildlife in pictures","story":"A nesting stork, a rescued bobcat, and flamingos at sunset are among this week’s pick of images from the natural world"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a0003e6863183800e89933de709ef9c1cb415015/0_24_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=545385efdea977e26d2d6e78275ae087","title":"the edit pendant necklaces","story":"Whether it’s a golden crab or a prancing zebra, a pendant necklace adds  the perfect finishing touch to a colourful top or white blouse"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c092a2de732812879668a65e6dbebd86d38d2c44/0_80_4074_2446/master/4074.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5781fc220f4d92110eeda913192a2a70","title":"premier league 2017 18 fans verdicts arsenal liverpool","story":"Featuring: Le Gaffer’s send-off, Roy Hodgson’s Palace resurrection, a Wagner statue, and Pedro as Harley Quinn• Part 2: Manchester City to West HamHaving papered over the cracks with cup wins in recent seasons, there was no bridging the chasm between first and sixth this time. Grim away showings illustrated Arsène Wenger’s fading motivational capacity. But at least – after the hopes of a fairytale ending were quashed by Diego Simeone – we had a final bit of Wengerball against Burnley, giving Le Gaffer a fitting send-off at the Grove. All in all, though, 510 is about right.Starsflops There were a few tantalising hints that Aubameyang might deliver. Otherwise the only positives were unexpected goals and assists from Monreal and the fresh blood: Reiss Nelson, Ainsley Maitland-Niles and Konstantinos Mavropanos. The rest went through the motions, while Hector Bellerín and Alex Iwobi went backwards.Summer targets We need a manager who’ll focus on building from the back. One who’ll hopefully prioritise a world-class, dominant presence between the posts, a replacement for Laurent Koscielny (if we haven’t already found one in Mavropanos – Sven Mislintat’s first discovery?) and a dedicated defensive midfielder whose only ambition is to protect and serve.Best and worst away fans The invasion of 20,000 Cologne fans certainly made an impression. Credit also to Burnley for their chorus of “Only one Arsène Wenger” (after chiding us with “You’re only here for the T-shirts”).Moment that made you smile For all the emotion of Arsène’s leaving do, there was huge relief at having been put out of his and our misery. For the first time in two decades, we’re going in to a summer feeling eager anticipation, without a scooby of what it might bring.It’s been a struggle – it feels like some of this squad may have had their last season here. But while it hasn’t been a comfortable ride, Eddie Howe did well to pull the team out of the bottom three, and there were great wins against Arsenal and Chelsea. One of the club’s biggest problems now, though, is keeping up with fans’ expectations. Just staying up is no longer seen as making progress. 610Starsflops Nathan Aké and Lewis Cook are the two players that really excelled, but Asmir Begovic and Ryan Fraser have had decent seasons, too. As for flops – Jermain Defoe never found his form. Apart for a brief flash against Crystal Palace, he hasn’t looked like he fits in yet with the team.Summer targets There have been lots of rumours about a £12m move for Bristol City striker Bobby Reid – but Howe also has to find some young defenders, even though our own Jack Simpson is ready to step up. In midfield, Chelsea’s Kenedy and Fulham’s Tom Cairney would be on my list.Best and worst away fans The worst were Stoke – they never have anything good to say about any other team, and they really won’t be missed. The best were Liverpool, who do show respect and are keen to talk football.Moment that made you smile Those interview analogies from Carlos Carvalhal were amusing – an improvement on the standard press conference lines. Shame he’s not sticking around.A fantastic season. The brilliant group of players that got us promoted gelled with some superb new signings and they all worked their socks off under Chris Hughton, who must be manager of the year. Securing our Premier League status by beating Manchester United in our last home game was a dream come true. 910Starsflops So many stars … new boys Pascal Gross, Maty Ryan, Davy Pröpper, José Izquierdo and Ezequiel Schelotto. But then our oldies – Bruno, Gaëtan Bong and Glenn Murray – were outstanding, too, as were Lewis Dunk, Shane Duffy and Dale Stephens. Anthony Knockaert, meanwhile, saved it for the last game – he was on fire against United and should take that outstanding display into next season, when hopefully we will see more of Jürgen Locadia.Summer targets We could strengthen, but given the shrewd way the club is run and the success of our under 23s, we have probably got it all covered. And our 22-year-old goalkeeper Christian Walton, on loan at Wigan, won the League One golden glove.Best and worst away fans Everyone loves coming to the Amex. Manchester City fans were the happiest. Crystal Palace were the worst, again.Moment that made you smile We were 2-0 down at Huddersfield, it was snowing, and everyone sang: “If you hate Palace, take off your shoes,” and waved them in the air.It’s been absolutely brilliant – way beyond anything we could have dared hope for. Back in August I was just looking for us to avoid relegation worries, but it went way past that, and now we find ourselves in Europe. Sean Dyche continues to prove himself a tremendous manager for us. His decision in January to sign a new deal was the best news possible. 1010Starsflops It’s always difficult to pick out stars here because it’s all based on team performance. But it would be wrong not to single out Nick Pope and James Tarkowski, who earned deserved England calls. The only possible flops are last summer’s signings Jon Walters and Nahki Wells – but both, particularly Walters, have been held back by injuries.Summer targets I’m sure we’ll have a central defender on the list, and we’ll probably also need another striker. It’s just about adding layers to build up the squad.Best and worst away fans Many have filled the away end and some added to the atmosphere. Manchester United were probably the noisiest. The worst were Swansea – they just didn’t turn up.Moment that made you smile Half-time on the opening day of the season at Chelsea, staring at the big screen showing the scoreline CHELSEA 0 BURNLEY 3. Even then, we couldn’t have known at the time just how good the season was going to be.A frustrating nine months. Relationships have broken down between manager and board, manager and players and, to a degree, manager and fans. Antonio Conte has gone from charming to brooding, stubborn and scowling: it’s all rather familiar. The FA Cup is still up for grabs but, as we know only too well, José Mourinho has a habit of winning cups. Conte sadly doesn’t. 510Starsflops N’Golo Kanté once again shone, and Olivier Giroud made a difference. Eden Hazard has been inconsistent, though we’d be lost without him, while Álvaro Morata is our outstanding flop. Boy did he flop – dramatically, on to his backside mostly. Sometimes, you just know that the fit isn’t right.Summer targets As good as Giroud has been, we still need a striker – possibly even two. Players who have a firm grip on gravity, ideally. We also need some quality to replace Victor Moses (Davide Zappacosta is not the answer), a younger Cesc Fàbregas and some more steel: as a team we are too lightweight. We need players who are happy to mix it up when necessary – John Terry, Didier Drogba, Diego Costa, Michael Ballack, even Frank Lampard were never bullied.Best and worst away fans Roma were loud and energetic, showing how much grounds in this country have been sterilised. Arsenal were like tourists.Moment that made you smile Giroud’s FA Cup goal against Southampton – like an action scene from Platoon, the Saints players falling in his wake as our new favourite hipster took them out. And David Luiz’s fancy‑dress birthday party also guaranteed a snigger or two. Special mention to Pedro for going as Harley Quinn. Fully admire his “go big or go home” attitude.As everyone knows by now, in mid-October we were on zero wins, seven defeats and zero goals. So to be going into the final day with a chance of a top-half finish is just astonishing. And it’s all happened despite the most crippling injury list ever seen at Palace, our only striker forgetting how to score, and a dire transfer window. What a job Roy Hodgson has done. 810Starsflops Wilfried Zaha has been the shining light: we didn’t win a game without him. Luka Milivojevic led by example, James Tomkins was a stalwart, and academy product Aaron Wan-Bissaka made a great start. As for flops: three goals from Christian Benteke all season is simply not acceptable, and surely means his departure. And if anyone knows why we signed Erdal Rakip from Benfica on loan in January, I’d love to hear it.Summer targets We’ve already lined up a very good keeper in Vicente Guaita, who joins in July. But strikers, more than one, are an absolute priority. Another winger wouldn’t go amiss either – someone like Michail Antonio or Ademola Lookman. The dream signing would be to bring in Ruben Loftus-Cheek on a permanent transfer. It’s been a pleasure to see him develop into a player who looks destined to board the plane to Russia.Best and worst away fans Huddersfield sang their hearts out, loving the 3-0 massacring they inflicted on us. But Man City gave their side no backing when they were under the cosh.Moment that made you smile Milivojevic giving Benteke the ball to take a late penalty in April when we were 4-0 up against Leicester. It almost brought a tear to the eye.Back in August there was real optimism. With Ronald Koeman in charge from the start and plenty of new signings in, I was confident we’d consolidate this season, make it into the top six and do well in the Europa League. It didn’t quite work out that way. Two months later we were at the wrong end of the league, embarrassed in Europe, and looking for a new manager. David Unsworth came in as caretaker for a few games before the board picked Sam Allardyce – who is comfortably worse than both of them. 210Starsflops Jordan Pickford has been outstanding in goal, and should, without doubt, be England’s No 1 this summer. New signing Cenk Tosun has done well too, when he’s had some service. Allardyce has to be our top flop – he’s all “me, me, me” and just doesn’t get Everton. Yannick Bolasie, meanwhile, is a circus act.Summer targets Just one: a new manager. Anyone in place of Allardyce.Best and worst away fans The best were Huddersfield, who never stopped singing. Hajduk Split fans were awful.Moment that made you smile Seeing Séamus Coleman return to the side in January after his horrific broken leg. His last-minute sprint when he outpaced two players to get a cross in was wonderful. A marvellous Evertonian.Shutting out the champions then drawing at Stamford Bridge was quite some way to stay up. It’s the latest in a series of remarkable achievements over the last two years from a club that’s always being written off. David Wagner has given us this brilliant ability to come up with the goods when the chips are down. He’s not only the reason we survived, but he is why we’re here in the first place. Get that man a statue! 1010Starsflops Last year’s play-off hero and demigod Christopher Schindler has been an absolute rock at the back and is one of the most underrated players in the Premier League. It didn’t work out for Scott Malone, though. He tore us apart last season when playing for Fulham, but has looked a long, long way off the level we’re at now.Summer targets If we could get Terence Kongolo on a permanent deal it’d be an absolute coup and solve our left-back problem. We also need serious pace up top and on the wings. Steve Mounié and Laurent Depoitre have been great but both are target men, so our play can get one dimensional.Best and worst away fans Liverpool were very disappointing considering their reputation. West Ham enjoyed thrashing us. “We’re West Ham United, we clap with our hands” in reference to our ‘clappers’ made me chuckle.Moment that made you smile Our FA Cup tie against Manchester United when the VAR system produced wobbly lines for an offside decision … Keep VAR out of our beautiful game.On the surface it looks like a relative success, but our league position belies our quality. I predicted that if we abandoned our style we’d struggle, and Claude Puel’s unpopular revolution has proven that to be true. It’s incredible that, given the dirge we’ve endured this season, we’ve been so comfortable in the table. The bottom half must be truly diabolical … I’ll give it 610 for the season 310 for the manager.Starsflops Jamie Vardy was robbed of the official player of the year award, won by Harry Maguire. Without Vardy’s goals who knows where we’d be now. As for flops: he’ll for ever be our greatest ever captain but Wes Morgan has well and truly entered the twilight of his career. Kasper Schmeichel has also seen a remarkable dip in form.Summer targets Recruitment is crucial for us this year, with Riyad Mahrez surely on his way. The unrelenting push for a new brand of football and an ageing squad means we could do with reinforcing every position on the pitch.Best and worst away fans Newcastle were best, but they played us off the park and Sunderland had just gone down, so they had every reason to be chipper. Southampton were disappointing.Moment that made you smile When the visiting Spurs fans were goading Vardy with crude chants about his wife’s appearance on I’m a Celebrity, only for him to rifle home a beautiful volley. It shut them up mid-sentence.We’ve had worse. We didn’t quite make the top spot and we need a point today to guarantee a top-four finish – though of course if we do it right in Kiev that won’t matter. This really is Jürgen Klopp’s team now, with all the rollercoaster rides that brings. He has made us a united force, and he gave City a masterclass in tactics away in the Champions League. After today, Kiev here we come! 910Starsflops No real flops: we’ve improved massively as a unit. Trent Alexander-Arnold has learned fast, Andy Robertson has been phenomenal, Virgil van Dijk looks like he’s played at the back for us for ever and James Milner is revitalised. Sadio Mané is back to his best at just the right time, and I can’t heap high enough praise on Bobby Firmino. Oh, and then there’s Mo Salah.Summer targets I was keen on Roma keeper Alisson until we put seven past him. It’d be great to have another defender on Van Dijk’s level – Toby Alderweireld? And we need more in midfield. Naby Keita is coming but it’d be great if Nice’s Jean Seri joined him.Best and worst away fans The best were all those who don’t whine about our lack of “famous atmosphere”. As ever, usual suspects for worst, but a special mention to Stoke and their fiver-waving antics.Moment that made you smile Hearing the ref’s whistle after what seemed like the hundred and ninety‑eighth minute away to Roma.• Part 2: Manchester City to West Ham"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c01d4e908f3aef41eb68cede3b77858736954fe3/166_1251_9377_5625/master/9377.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d18c5d2496494d59b595723be85da0cc","title":"arsene wenger arsenal arseblog","story":"Arsène Wenger’s head fell off and rolled across the glass table before plunging on to my living room floor. Last week, an hour after Arsenal had lost to Atlético Madrid, to ruin the fleeting dream of Wenger’s final match as manager being in the Europa League final, I had lifted up the old bobble-head and prepared to move it back to the window sill.Wenger was placed on the glass table in front of the television and Arsenal were rejuvenated. We beat Bayern 2-0 in Munich, only to suffer a familiar Champions League exit on away goals. But the mysterious force of the bobble-head had to be relied upon from that night as one Arsenal pattern – defeat in the last 16 – was replaced by another, in the habitual struggle to make the top four. With mini-Arsène in place, Arsenal went on an unbeaten 10-game run to steal fourth spot from Spurs by a point.Over the last two seasons of Wenger’s 22 years as manager, as the top-four tradition slid away, the world ided Arsenal’s fans into Wenger Out or Wenger In camps. It was hardly more subtle in our house. Should mini-Arsène watch the next game or did he deserve to be consigned to the window sill in his long zippered coat?Since Wenger announced his decision on 20 April to leave the club on Sunday, he has been on the glass table for every game. Yet the bobbled Arsène could not spook Diego Costa or Diego Simeone as Arsenal lost their last meaningful match under Wenger. The roll of his head, as I picked him up, felt symbolic.Andrew Allen, another Arsenal fan, endured a more testing ordeal that night. As deputy news editor at Arseblog, the celebrated Arsenal fan website which its founder and chief writer, Andrew Mangan, began in 2002, Allen was bereft of words as he tried to start his post-match analysis. “It’s very rare I get the responsibility to write the main blog,” Allen says, “and I knew if we won it’s easier to write. But, after we lost, I sat in front of the laptop for an hour trying to find an introductory paragraph. I couldn’t do it. Eventually I began jotting down moments from all these years under Arsène. It spiralled out of control and at three in the morning I was still there, down a YouTube rabbit hole, with the occasional tear and glass of wine. It poured out.”The next morning I still felt sad that Wenger’s last game in charge will be away to Huddersfield, rather than at home in France, in Lyon, against an old enemy, Marseille, in a European final he longed to win. But, turning to my usual read of Arseblog, there was no match report. Instead, the headline read: “No European Trophy. No Happy Ending. But…”Allen then listed 197 moments and memories, mishaps and milestones, stretching from “Three League titles. Thierry Henry. Giroud’s scorpion kick. Chu-Young Park. Paris in the pouring rain. Santi’s dancing feet. It’s Thierry Henry, he’s scored, he’s scored for Arsenal in the Bernabéu! Wright breaking Bastin’s record. Cesc’s mullet. Sol on a free. Abou’s ankles. Broccoli” to “Blackcurrant shirts. Giroud’s abs. It’s only Ray Parlour. Henry looping it over Barthez. Pizzagate. Pires … it was in from the moment he hit it! Santi’s cup final free-kick. Together. The Invincibles. 22 years. Thanks for the memories, boss. Thank you so much.”He has equally evocative memories of that sun-kissed afternoon at the Emirates as, after a 5-0 demolition of Burnley, Wenger felt the Arsenal love again. “It was very emotional,” Allen says. “I sit next to my mum and dad and all three of us didn’t look at each other when Wenger spoke. I didn’t want my mum to see me tearing up and I don’t think she wanted me to see her tearing up. His name was sung with passion and it was a kind of joy. It took me over the edge.”Mangan, who lives in Dublin, flew in for the game. As the voice of Arseblog, he has probably written more words about Wenger than anyone else since 2002. “I won’t ever write as many words about another inidual,” he says. “Arsène has been a constant in my life for 16 years – and the six years before I started the website.“For a long time Arsenal fans have been ided into unnecessary camps of Wenger In or Out. But the vast majority have a far more nuanced view of the last 22 years. So being there, listening to the fans sing with one voice about Arsène, felt cathartic. It felt healing.“Of course it’s not the same as a European final in Lyon – and that’s why I was devastated last week. We all thought: ‘Please, please, let him win a European trophy.’ Of course I’m going to Lyon anyway. I have tickets, the hotel is booked. It was a choice between Arsène Wenger and Diego Costa. Diego won.”Allen sighs when asked who he might support in the final. “I don’t know. Me and my friends just might take a big Arsène banner.”Wenger has described his career at Arsenal as “a love affair”. Mangan hesitates when considering the phrase as a fan and writer who has examined Wenger’s attributes and failings so closely. “A love affair is too passionate for me. That stems from the frustration of the last years. It’s a relationship built on love and respect for a guy who came in when nobody knew him. He proved himself as a great manager and a great man. He was successful and he changed English football – and the perception of foreign managers and players. He was so brilliant there was always a yearning for him to replicate that in later years and it didn’t quite happen. I wanted Arsenal to win under Arsène – because of this respect, admiration and pride when you heard him talk about Arsenal, football and society.“Of course he’s an obsessive. On his birthday they asked him what was he going to do and he said: ‘I’ll watch a second ision German game.’ The journalist urged him to celebrate his birthday. Wenger said: ‘I’ll put some candles on the top of my TV if that makes you happy.’ Arsène’s real passion was always football. That’s probably not too healthy but it’s a fundamental part of why he was in this job so long.”The Arseblog writers offer an often painful insight into Wenger’s failings. “In some ways his biggest fallibility was his willingness to be a force field who ensured all criticism centred upon him,” Allen suggests. “His refusal to throw players under the bus was beautiful but sometimes the players needed to be called out. Some of the signings were very odd – remember André Santos – but you never knew whether Wenger had more money to spend.”How did Allen do in his exam? “I was studying Russian history at UCL, which is slightly niche. But I scraped through. Then, at the start of 2004-05 season, after we’d won the league and gone unbeaten, the first seven games were fantastic. I remember playing Middlesborough on another glorious summer day and my brother and I said: ‘How many will we score today?’ You know it can’t go on like this for much longer – but you never want to look that far down the line.”Amid the poignance of Wenger’s leaving there is the thrilling uncertainty of a new era. “I definitely have feelings of excitement around a new manager,” Mangan stresses. “What’s going to happen now? Who is it going to be? What kind of football does he like? What kind of a man is he? Who will he sign? How many of Arsenal’s values will be upheld? It would be awful to get a manager like Mourinho with no interest in young players. Maybe that’s just us being romantic Arsenal fans. Maybe we need to be more pragmatic.”Mangan and Allen would choose Massimiliano Allegri, the Juventus manager, to replace Wenger. “I like the idea of Allegri,” Mangan says. “He’s more defensively minded than Wenger. With our attack a manager who focuses on the defensive side, with the right organisation and personnel, could make everything gel. It’s hard to imagine, when you’ve got Mkhitaryan, Lacazette, Aubameyang, Özil and Ramsey, a new manager will do what Jack Charlton did to John Aldridge – and make them defend from the front and inhibit their attacking quality.“After 22 years there is excitement about something fresh and new. Even the uncertainty is interesting. We don’t know what the new guy is going to do or how he’s going to do it. We don’t know how it will work with the director of football, head of recruitment and chief executive all taking a prominent role. It’s a brave new world.”An Allegri-shaped world? “It’s just a gut feeling but they might go with somebody younger and less experienced,” Mangan says. “The power dynamic has been so weighted in favour of the manager they might go another way. If it’s Allegri or Luis Enrique they will have to defer to them. My gut says they might go for Mikel Arteta or Patrick Vieira.”Our Wenger bobble-head will be moved back to its final resting place, in my office. I like the idea of a mini-Max Allegri on the glass table but Allen also suspects it could be a different name. “I’m open to something left-field,” he says. “But every two or three years we’ll probably be changing our manager and that will be really hard to get used to. After Arsène, we’re in the madhouse with everyone else now.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/77ca8a69f2a9d398bef870d9e7c9faab5ceb35e3/0_184_2048_1229/master/2048.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=612a40a63917c542ce3c2a54acbb7a97","title":"ethiopia railway boom promises turn to dust","story":"Villagers, lured by new jobs and rich rewards for selling their land, now face poverty and heartbreak as claims of corruption engulf £25bn transport project.‘They promised us we would get jobs there,” says Tadele, nodding at the grand, almost baroque edifice at the bottom of the hill. Adama’s new railway station, yellow bricks golden in the afternoon sun, is still a symbol of hope for the 43-year-old who lives in a village overlooking it. But its promise is dimmer than it was.A stint on the payroll of the Chinese firm that built Ethiopia’s new railway ended sourly. After six months he was fired, for reasons he disputes. Now, like many in his village and in small towns all along the railway from the Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa, to Djibouti, the tiny nation and synonymous Red Sea port that borders Ethiopia, he is frustrated, impatient – and unemployed.Ethiopia’s new £2.5bn, 750km (466-mile) line began commercial operations at the start of the year, making it Africa’s first fully electrified cross-border railway. Built and financed by Chinese investors and contractors, and shadowing the route of an earlier French-built track, the Addis Ababa-Djibouti railway lies at the heart of Ethiopia’s development aspirations. By linking the landlocked country to the sea and lowering transport costs for imports and exports, the government hopes to kickstart industrialisation and transform a poor, agricultural nation of nearly 100 million people into a middle-income one by as early as 2025.And it is much more than that. “The railway project is a transport project,” explains Dr Getachew Betru, former chief executive of the state-owned Ethiopia Railways Corporation (ERC). “But it is also a hinterland development project.” The plan is for eight railways to eventually crisscross this vast, erse land, knitting together the relatively fertile highlands with the historically neglected lowlands that are mostly inhabited by nomadic people. New stations, some of which rise incongruously from seemingly empty expanses of barren bushland, are visualised as “transport-oriented development zones”: future temples of commerce boasting malls, hotels, and golf courses.The story of the railway is a parable of “developmentalism”, the east Asian-inspired model of top-down development championed by the Ethiopian People’s Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF), which has ruled the country unchallenged for 27 years. This approach, with its flinty dedication to grand infrastructure projects such as dams, industrial parks, mass housing and railways, has delivered impressive economic growth in recent years. But it has also kindled political tensions, which, since exploding on to the streets in 2014, have threatened to topple one of the continent’s most authoritarian regimes.Since February, Ethiopia has been under a state of emergency, the second of its kind in as many years. That month the then-prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was forced to resign, leading to the appointment in late March of Abiy Ahmed, a young reformist who has lately echoed the demands of the protesters for greater democracy and an end to autocracy.The railway embodies these contradictions. “It’s the physical manifestation of the country’s politics,” says Biruk Terrefe, a graduate researcher at Oxford University who has studied the project. A journey along it eastwards from Addis Ababa takes in some of the most visible signs of Ethiopia’s recent development: new factories, irrigated sugar farms, shimmering rows of giant polytunnels with cut flowers bound for Europe and America. Electrical pylons hug the tracks all the way to the border with Djibouti while the road beside it is mostly smooth and well paved. In the shadow of some stations new towns are being built from scratch, as rural migrants arrive in the hope of work and urban speculators eagerly anticipate the coming boom.But what appears as development often looks very different to those who live near the tracks. The most deeply festering grievance is land, which in Ethiopia is all state-owned and – as one of the country’s few natural resources – a key faultline in the country’s politics. Around 300 hectares were required for each new station, according to Getachew, much of which was farmland, since the compensation costs of demolishing homes and businesses in city centres would have been too high. Most was in the region of Oromia, home to Ethiopia’s largest and lately most rebellious ethnic group, the Oromo, who have long complained of “land grabs” by other ethnicities.This put the ERC and its Chinese contractors on a collision course with farmers when construction started back in 2011. In the Oromo district of Mieso, an arid dust bowl 150km west of the major city of Dire Dawa, Yusuf Mohammed seethes as he hammers away at a small construction site. “People are really angry about the new railway. More than 300 people here lost their land, including my relatives, but they are not seeing benefits,” he says.He blames corrupt officials for unfair compensation. “People were intimidated, they were forced to give up their land almost for free.”His friend Jemal points to a vast, hulking station in the near distance. “All this area was mine,” he says. “They took three hectares but only paid me for one: 100,000 Birs (£2,700) – that’s almost worthless now!”A local official supports his allegation. “There were committees who estimated the value of the land for the farmers, and presented the price to the railway managers. I believe there was embezzlement by those committees and the managers,” he told the Observer under condition of anonymity. “One farmer’s land was estimated to be worth 250,000 Birs (£6,700) but in the end only 100,000 Birs was deposited in his bank account.”In March a parliamentary committee strongly criticised the ERC for compensation payments, with MPs reporting that thousands of “tearful” farmers had complained that they had not been treated fairly. The ERC responded that valuations were carried out by local administrations, not the corporation.Ibrahim, a 17-year-old who lives in Awash National Park, where a second railway line is currently being built by a Turkish firm, is more sanguine. “The railway benefited the people – even those who lost their land got compensation,” he says. But he adds that when construction began in early 2015 a band of furious locals tried to prevent it. “People were very angry,” he recalls. “They said: ‘Don’t do this don’t do it on our land.’ There was a confrontation one night between the people and the contractors. People resisted, and 10 people died.”A spokesman for the ERC denied the incident took place the local administration refused to comment.Communities along the line retain a special attachment to the old railway, opened by Ethiopia’s then-emperor, Menelik II, in 1901. Residents of Awash and Dire Dawa, in particular, look back on the previous rail era, which had drawn to a close by the end of the last century, with dewy-eyed nostalgia. Scepticism towards its 21st-century replacement is commonplace. “The new train is simply passing through,” says Teshome, a 40-year-old tradesman in Awash, pointing to the decaying courtyard of the station, which has not been replaced. “The old train had so much importance for the city. Passengers used our restaurants and hotels, all services. But this time such things won’t happen.”Biruk, the Oxford researcher, sees in this a fundamental problem for the government and the ERC. “Some locals perceive the railway as an Addis-based elite project,” he says. “A symbol of the regime.”The Chinese Railway Construction Corporation (CRCC) said it hired more than 20,000 local workers in Ethiopia and 5,000 in Djibouti. But former employees complain of low wages and, like Tadele in Adama, of poor treatment by their Chinese managers. Since construction ended there have been few new jobs, in part because the rail services will be staffed by Chinese controllers, technicians and station masters for the next five years.“There is no development here yet,” says Mintesinot, a 36-year-old former soldier in Mojo, home to a new dry port – an inland point for goods transfer to a sea port. He brandishes a piece of paper, revealing he is registered as unemployed. “They told me I would get work at the dry port, in the customs office. That’s what they told us, but it hasn’t happened yet. It will never happen. Of course the railway is important for the country – but what is that importance if the youth here do not get jobs there?”There are some grounds for optimism. The new prime minister has been widely welcomed by young Ethiopians, especially in Oromia. A new land law, with higher compensation for expropriated farmers, is expected soon. Miriam Driessen, another Oxford researcher who has studied Sino-Ethiopian labour relations in the road construction sector, says that over time there has been “gradual improvement” in both wages and working conditions for Ethiopian employees.But the lesson of the railway is that development-from-above breeds special resentment when grand promises are perceived to have been broken. “I was hopeful that the railway would change my life,” says Samatra Ahmed, a 27-year-old son of a farmer in Dire Dawa. “I hoped I would be employed there – and then later start my own business. But after the government took the land, all the promises vanished.”This article was supported by the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/39bed51595042251ff65e08bd336dd5ff9299f1a/0_129_3861_2317/master/3861.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=42a9674b4e72c3490227cf9bc0074c97","title":"fabric swaps hedonism meditation mindfulness nightclub","story":"Fabric, in London’s Clerkenwell, is famous for its vibrating dance floor and late-night partying. But on Tuesday the nightclub will play host to an altogether different mind-bending experience.More than a thousand people are expected to gather at the venue, where pumping beats will by replaced by deafening silence for what is being billed as the biggest group meditation ever held in Britain.Self-styled meditation guru Will Williams is staging the event to launch his new book, The Effortless Mind. The aim, he says, is to attract a new generation to “the inner joys of meditation”.Fabric epitomises the “old hedonism”, he says – a drink-and-drugs-fuelled dance scene from which people traditionally stagger home at dawn. “I want to bring a new hedonism into its space. It’ll be a dynamic, energised night but we’ll all wake up the next morning feeling fantastic,” he says. So it will be mocktails, not cocktails, on the menu.Williams knows only too well the pain of the morning after the night before. A former booking agent for bands and musicians, he used to “indulge in every bit of debauchery you can think of”. But, a decade ago, his life changed after a friend persuaded him to try meditation. At first, he saw it as a means to conquer insomnia and a “brilliant cure for hangovers”. But he was soon hooked and moved to India to study with “the masters” for three years. Experimenting with different types of mindfulness, he kept coming back to vedic meditation. “It doesn’t involve chanting, religion, or uncomfortable sitting positions,” Williams says. “It’s easy, it’s cool, it works.”But he didn’t stop at his own personal enlightenment. Williams calculated that taking the art of ancient eastern meditation and turning it into a thriving western business was the lucrative way forward.He now runs meditation studios in two venues in central London (a three-day course costs around £300) and plans to expand across the country. Williams has no shortage of converts to what he describes as a path to “deeper fulfilment”. One of his newest is Take That’s Howard Donald. After two decades of dismissing “the whole joss-stick-burning thing” that other members of the group embraced, Donald says he now swears by it.“It’s helping me be more creative, but without the drugs,” Donald, who has just turned 50, said. “The thoughts and colours are amazing, the golds, the reds, the blues – I don’t know what they mean, but the visions you get in your mind, they’re beautiful.“The song ideas are flowing even when I’m in the middle of a meditation – sometimes, I just want to cut it short and get the dictaphone out,” he says.“You get emotional sometimes. But that’s good, it’s about letting stuff out, clearing your body, bit by bit.”While grateful that Donald is positive about his experiences, Williams is keen to distance himself from the meditation and celebrity love-in. He worries that it can inspire some, but make others cynical. “We need to show that wisdom, meaning, joy, purpose – it’s about you, me and everyone. We’re all going through the same emotional challenges, whoever we are,” he says.“Meditation is a vehicle, a drug if you like, and a really powerful one.”• To order Effortless Mind by Will Williams for £12.74, go to bookshop"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5356268d0933f18536c664abd0dfbeb019a680f6/0_139_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=56cd793fa8358567cbca8b7592f4ac3e","title":"rachel cooke pineapple hawaiian pizza food snob authentic","story":"We might be a nation ided over the pros and cons of a Hawaiian pizza, but other toppings are also beyond the paleWhen I began thinking about this column, I hoped to take a deep, scholarly e into the realm of the Hawaiian pizza, the abominationdelicacy (delete as applicable) that, according to recent research by YouGov, now ides the nation more than any other foodstuff.But in the end, this proved to be impossible. No book I own has any advice at all on the matter of whether pineapple can ever make an acceptable topping for pizza nor have I been able to locate a definitive history of this controversial dish, said to have been invented by a Greek Canadian called Sam Panopoulos at his restaurant in Ontario some time in 1962. (He was “inspired”, I gather, by certain sweet and savoury Chinese dishes rather than by a malevolent belief that some people simply do not deserve the good things in life.)As a result, I cannot, on this occasion, play the neutral referee, for which reason I’m just going to let the bigotry pour out of me, like cheap prosecco into a large measure of Aperol.Why would you do that? Add chunks of pineapple to a pizza, I mean. I find it hard to think of anything worse – though according to the trade magazine Pizza Today, various radical experiments involving dates, other fruit and “salumi marmalade” are currently underway in the land of the pepperoni. These do indeed sound at least as bad as pineapple, a fruit that pulls off the rare feat of being at once both too tart and too sweet, and which overwhelms whatever happens to be in its path. (This includes, incidentally, some hangovers as a student, I used sometimes to keep a carton of pineapple juice on the window ledge of my college room expressly for the purpose of seeing off a particularly heinous kind of Guinness-induced headache.)Pineapple, which contains an enzyme that is used commercially as a meat tenderiser, and which eats away at the hands of cannery workers unless they wear gloves, is no friend of gentle mozzarella or delicate parma ham. It’s not a friend of anything really, unless you’re the director of a new production of Abigail’s Party and have a bunch of cocktail sticks to hand.It is a fruit that belongs only in 18th-century oil paintings in pina coladas (kitsch, but undeniably delicious) and on the top – or bottom – of a freshly baked upside-down cake. Put it on a pizza, and you’ve committed a crime against good taste. Plus, said pizza will soon be really soggy.Some will say all this is snobbery on my part, and perhaps it is, for I have to admit to Matilda’s Miss Trunchbull tendencies when it comes to pizza. The longer the menu, the less happy I am. I like my pizza to be minimalist, the culinary equivalent of a Mondrian, or even a Ben Nicholson when my friend, C, used to order that old Pizza Express number involving leeks and raisins, I always used to feel slightly funny, as if she’d been caught admiring a Beryl Cook or something (C is a brilliant and celebrated painter).You want oregano and garlic, the toppings that were stowed on board Neapolitan ships, the better that sailors could make pizza away from home (hence marinara) also, the mozzarella and fresh basil that were added later in honour of the visit of an Italian queen to Naples (margherita).But while olives, anchovies and cured meat are just about acceptable modern additions, I draw the line at fleshy hunks of tuna, mounds of grassy rocket and slug-like grilled aubergines. Ditto hard-boiled eggs. Chilli is good, but in its invisible form (cayenne), I think, rather than as oil-slicked peppers.I ate the best pizza of my life not on some Italian street corner, nor even in New York, but in Chelmsford, made for me by a friend’s Calabrian mother. It was pretty fiery, as was she: a woman I can no more picture with a tin of pineapple in her hands than I can a Chanel handbag or a delicate paper fan."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e63cde662357a3d526b6159277f727493e2b69c4/62_553_1916_1149/master/1916.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=82baf9f8753b7811764cead27c842053","title":"united airlines tomato juice planes","story":"United Airlines has reversed their plan to remove the beverage from flights after outrage from customersUnited Airlines know a thing or two about weaselly management-speak. Last year when a passenger was forcibly removed by police from an overbooked flight, bleeding and screaming, their spokesman initially called it as an “involuntary de-boarding situation”. CEO Oscar Munoz doubled down, referring to the removal as “re-accommodating the customers”.This week the airline announced they were “streamlining” their onboard menu items on flights under four hours – their way of saying customers would be getting less food and fewer options. Muffins would replace hot breakfasts, wraps would replace full lunches, and tomato juice as a beverage option would be phased out.Customers were quick to express their outrage, and today United U-turned on the tomato decision. So why is the beverage – which is not particularly popular under normal circumstances in America – drunk so much on planes?There have been a number of scientific investigations trying to answer that question. In 2015, Robin Dando, a physiologist at Cornell, found that exposure to loud noises, like that of a jet engine, dulls sweet flavours but intensifies the umami taste present in tomato juice. Five years earlier, German airline Lufthansa commissioned research into the popularity of tomato juice when they realised they were serving 53,000 gallons a year. Researchers from the Fraunhofer Society found people enjoyed it more on planes because our taste and smell receptors are less sensitive at altitude, which means people enjoy the freshness of the juice without the earthy, mulchy taste.Those research-based accounts seem somewhat contradictory, though: can the taste of the drink be both enhanced and dulled? Even if they can, do ordinary passengers know that before they order the drink?It’s more likely there is a psychological basis for the popularity. Choosing a drink on a flight is an unusual situation: you have to decide when the trolley comes to you whether you’re thirsty or not. The beverage is normally free – meaning you want to extract as much value as possible. Tomato juice hits an odd sweet spot: it’s the only drink on the trolly that feels healthy, extravagant and unusual – plus you’ve seen so many other people order it, it becomes a tradition, the same way you eat popcorn at the cinema or hotdogs at a baseball game.There might be another reason too, which goes back to United “streamlining” the food options. With less free food available on flights, many people are hungry when the drink cart comes around but don’t want to pay for a meal. Tomato juice has a lots of fibre and high water content, and makes you feel full even when you’re not. It’s basically a cold soup you could even call it a free meal.So congratulations to United for realising their huge screw-up and reinstating it. Or, as a United spokesman put it, in the company’s inimitable style: “With all of our food offerings, we monitor customer feedback and what they would prefer and adjust accordingly.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/86c9b6e19db208848681af123d3a0753bb7bc003/0_1241_3723_2232/master/3723.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=24f34890aa172159dc366099ac5eb3ab","title":"yotam ottolenghi tamarind recipes","story":"This sweet and sour fruit lends great flavour to prawn stew, asparagus salad and glazed pork chopsThe sharp and sweet acidity of the tamarind fruit is a much-loved tool of Indian and Pakistani cooks, as well as other parts of Asia and the Middle East. But it has never become a key player in western larders, which is a shame, because it shouldn’t be restricted to one cuisine. I often interchange tamarind with vinegar or citrus, and it’s already familiar to Brits through Worcestershire and HP sauces, where it provides the familiar, sharp kick.This southern Iranian dish features fresh fenugreek, which can be found in Middle Eastern shops and online. The leaves add a more herbaceous dimension than the seeds, although the latter would work here, too. It’s important to cook the herbs, because that creates the deep flavour. Serve with rice.500g raw king prawns, peeled and deveined4 tbsp olive oil1 tsp ground turmeric 5 garlic cloves, peeled and crushed Salt and black pepper100g tamarind pulp1 onion, peeled and finely chopped 2 green chillies, finely chopped5 spring onions, finely sliced80g coriander leaves, finely chopped, plus 5g finely shredded leaves, to serve 50g parsley leaves, finely chopped50g fenugreek leaves, finely chopped (or 2 tsp fenugreek seeds finely crushed in a spice grinder)1 tbsp plain flour1½ tsp ground coriander1½ tsp ground cumin1 tsp ground cinnamon⅛ tsp ground cloves¼ tsp chilli flakes1 tbsp soft brown sugarMix the prawns with a tablespoon of oil, the turmeric, one crushed garlic clove and half a teaspoon of salt, then leave to marinate.Soak the tamarind in 200ml hot water for 20 minutes, then use your hands to separate as much pulp as possible from the seeds and fibre. Strain into a sieve, pressing down on the pulp to extract as much liquid as you can: you should end up with about 160ml tamarind liquid.Heat two tablespoons of oil in a large saute pan on a medium heat, then sweat the onion for 10 minutes, until soft and lightly browned. Add the rest of the garlic and half the green chillies, and cook, stirring, for a minute. Add the spring onions, herbs and fenugreek, and cook on a medium-low heat for 20 minutes, stirring often, until deep green.Add the flour, spices, chilli flakes, a teaspoon and a half of salt and a generous grind of pepper, cook for 30 seconds, then add the tamarind liquid, sugar and 500ml water, and simmer for 10 minutes, until the sauce thickens and comes together.Meanwhile, heat the remaining tablespoon of oil in a frying pan on a high flame. Fry a third of the prawns for two minutes on each side, until golden brown, then move to a plate.Stir the remaining raw prawns into the sauce and cook for three minutes, until just cooked through.Serve the stew from the pan or a large bowl, sprinkled with coriander, the fried prawns and the remaining green chillies.This sharp, fresh mint sauce is a condiment for keeping in the fridge. I guarantee you’ll find yourself reaching out for it with increasing regularity: it’s great with lamb or pork, spooned over rice or mixed with vegetables.I prefer to extract tamarind paste from compressed pulp. Shop-bought pastes vary greatly in concentration of flavour and are generally sharper and more intense than paste you make yourself, so add it gradually, until you get a level of acidity you like.Prep 8 minCook 3 minMakes 1 small jar – about 180ml2 tsp shop-bought tamarind paste, or a lemon-sized piece of tamarind pulp 35g mint leaves15g parsley leaves, roughly chopped1 tbsp white-wine vinegar1 tbsp honey1 anchovy fillet, drained½ tsp ground cardamom½ tsp ground Iranian lime (optional)2 green chillies, deseeded and finely chopped1 small garlic clove, peeled and crushed1 tsp dijon mustardZest of 1 lime, finely grated2 tbsp olive oilSaltIf using, soak the tamarind pulp in 60ml lukewarm water for a few minutes, work with your hands until the pulp falls away from the seeds, then pass through a fine sieve to make a thick paste. It will keep in the fridge for up to a month.Blitz two teaspoons of shop-bought tamarind paste – or two to three teaspoons of the homemade paste – with the remaining ingredients, two tablespoons of water and a quarter-teaspoon of salt: you should end up with a thick, green paste. Spoon into a clean jar and refrigerate for up to a week.This light, simple salad is perfect alongside a meat or veggie main. Counterintuitively, the sharp sauce complements the gentle flavour of the asparagus, rather than overpowering it. Gently mix the salad mere seconds before serving, to keep the thin asparagus slices as fresh as possible.Prep 5 minCook 10 minServes 4 as a side400g thick-stemmed asparagus, woody ends snapped off1½ tbsp olive oil1 tbsp lime juice15g mint leaves, roughly shredded30g pistachio, very lightly toasted and roughly choppedSalt2 tbsp mint, lime and tamarind sauce (see previous recipe)Using a peeler or mandoline, slice the asparagus lengthways into fine strips and mix in a bowl with a teaspoon and a half of oil, a teaspoon and a half of lime juice, half the mint leaves, half the pistachios and an eighth of a teaspoon of salt.In a small bowl, stir the mint, lime and tamarind sauce with the remaining oil and lime juice and an eighth of a teaspoon of salt.Just before serving, spoon the sauce over the asparagus, and sprinkle on the remaining mint and pistachios.Brining chops doesn’t only add flavour to the meat – it also makes them incredibly tender.

My picture editor at the Observer, Peter Crookston, knew I was in the US on my way to get married in Vancouver, and he sent me a telegram. ‘Get down to Birmingham, Alabama.’ So I did.”Photographer Colin Jones is casting his mind back 55 years, to a time when the slow pace of communications made journalism both simpler and more confusing. “I wasn’t sure what was happening in Alabama. I wasn’t sure what to expect. But I had my cameras with me.”Jones soon discovered he was flying into the cauldron of the civil rights movement just as it was boiling over. That April in 1963 Martin Luther King had written from the city’s jailhouse: “Birmingham is probably the most thoroughly segregated city in the United States. Its ugly record of brutality is widely known.” This was why Birmingham had been selected for the next phase in the struggle for equality.It began with economic boycotts, sit-ins, marches and fruitless attempts to negotiate on the part of African Americans. The response came in the form of bombings, mass arrests, and police and Ku Klux Klan-led violence.Jones, who was 27 at the time, found the segregation shocking, he says: the ubiquitous “no blacks allowed” signs the extreme poverty of the African American neighbourhoods in contrast to the air-conditioned, whites-only department stores. “I didn’t think America was as bad as this. It was like South Africa during apartheid, which I’d seen.”Days before Jones arrived in Birmingham, the authorities had broken up a protest by schoolchildren with high-pressure fire hoses and attack dogs on the orders of the notorious public safety commissioner Eugene “Bull” Connor. Jones’s images record the immediate aftermath – the wreckage of homes destroyed by rioting (with clean washing hanging among the rubble) released protesters emotionally sharing their grievances the recently bombed AG Gaston Motel (King had stayed there the home of his brother, AD King, was also bombed the same night) and opposing ranks of African American protesters and white law enforcement – which made for intrinsically dramatic compositions.Neither side objected to being photographed. The police were almost conceited, Jones says, proudly brandishing their weaponry. African Americans on the street (mostly men) often filled him in on what was going on and pointed him in the right direction. They even invited him into a meeting at the 16th Street Baptist Church, the headquarters of the campaign.The Birmingham campaign was not in vain. The media coverage and worldwide shock brought the civil rights issue to the attention of President John Kennedy. In June, he set in motion what came to be the 1964 Civil Rights Act, telling the nation: “The events in Birmingham and elsewhere have so increased cries for equality that no city or state or legislative body can prudently choose to ignore them.”That September, however, in one of the worst atrocities of the era, white supremacists bombed the 16th Street Baptist Church during a Sunday morning service, killing four young girls.Jones would have loved to have gone on following events, he says, but he had places to be, like his wedding in Vancouver. He sent his rolls of film to London without having seen any of his images. Some of them he had never seen at all until his visit to the Observer office last week. “When I first started here, I didn’t know one end of the camera from the other,” he says.His career took him around the world, from Swinging London to Asian poverty, Soviet Russia to Afro-Caribbean immigrants in 1970s London. In Alabama, there was an aspect of “right place, right time”, but Jones’s images seem to convey the whole story, emotionally as well as factually. “People often say you’ve got to have a ‘good eye’,” he says. “But it’s not your eye that takes the pictures, it’s your brain.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d57d52fe9b75328229f7a89a7018281d5b7a21bc/3_7_2908_1746/master/2908.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3165f5ec1072a93ae2c2ef255276ed05","title":"salary what get paid talk about it makes brits cringe","story":"There’s nothing that makes Brits cringe more than discussing our salaries. Have the gender pay revelations changed that?How much do you earn? There are few questions that British people find so excruciating – or rude. Walking around Bristol on a heaven-scented spring day, buttonholing random strangers about their personal finances, I sense most would prefer it if I were asking when they last masturbated, or passed stool, or voted Conservative.“I’d say that’s a cheek!” says a gentleman in his 80s. But why? “I’m British, that’s why. My business is my business.”I try a younger guy in athletic gear, performing stretches by a park bench. “If you ain’t paying me, I ain’t interested,” he says. A model neoliberal citizen.I approach a couple of mothers in the park and cast a shadow over their picnic rug. One is a stay-at-home mum the other is not. “It’s not something you want to talk about in front of your friends, is it, what you earn?” the latter says. “Some people are underpaid, some people are overpaid, life isn’t fair.” Her friend pointedly attends to her child. I apologise for ruining their lunch.It’s awkward, isn’t it? The median annual income in the UK, according to the most recent Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings, is £28,677 for full-time employees. Jeremy Corbyn’s last published tax return puts his income at £136,762 Theresa May’s was £117,350 but she hasn’t published one since she became prime minister David Cameron never published a tax return, but he did publish his earnings in light of the Panama Papers scandal: £200,307 from salary and rent in 201415. José Mourinho is on a reported £15m at Manchester United and is apparently unhappy. Chris Evans makes more than £2.2m at the BBC. A nurse starts at £22,128. It ought to be one of the least personal things about us – a simple data point, one that’s not so hard to estimate, surely – and yet clearly it’s emotive. “I don’t think that’s a very nice conversation to have publicly at all,” as Kate Winslet told the BBC when pressed on the issue of gender pay disparities in Hollywood a couple of years ago. “It seems quite a strange thing to be discussing out in the open like that. I am a very lucky woman and I’m quite happy with how things are ticking along.”How much do I earn now that I’m freelance? Not enough to turn down a commission from the , but a lot more than the national average: let’s leave it there for now. As I ask these “vulgar” questions of friends, family members and random strangers, I detect two main reasons for squeamishness. One, you might earn too little and be ashamed. Two, you might earn too much and be ashamed. Revealing your salary might bring a twitch on either string, depending on who you’re talking to.A fellow freelance writer on £26,000 confesses: “I do find it shameful to talk about because I feel like it’s not very much for someone who has had a lot of advantages in life.” At the other end of the income scale, there’s often a fear of being judged for having made certain compromises. “I wouldn’t share my salary because I’m quite embarrassed that I’m earning too much and still don’t feel it’s enough to live a comfortable London life,” says a friend who works in recruitment in the City. Another who classes herself as a “high earner” say she doesn’t want to be labelled a “corporate whore”.“I like to be on equal terms with people irrespective of our salaries,” she says. “While I regularly get the extra round or pay for dinner for friends who might not have as much cash, I don’t like there to be an expectation that I will do those things.” There are further reasons, too. “It makes me feel self-conscious and embarrassed about my relatively modest living arrangements and asset accumulation given my high salary. And I don’t like knowing when people earn more than me. It leads me to question whether I’m sufficiently successful and leaves me feeling dissatisfied with my lot.”The people most willing to share their figures, I find, are those who take a certain pride at having succeeded on their own terms. In 2012, Jack Monroe was on income support and in debt, with a food and fuel budget of less than £10 a week and a son to feed now she is a successful food writer with a couple of bestselling cookbooks to her name and a company employing four members of staff. “Mine is the last salary to be paid at the end of each month,” she says. “I pay my staff well. I don’t want the people I work with to find themselves in difficult circumstances.” She pays herself £21,000 a year which, given she works about 50 hours a week, she estimates as about half what she pays her cleaner (£14 an hour). “I probably don’t get paid as much as I should, but that’s a hit I’m prepared to take as I’m used to living on not much money. It’s a real skill being financially resilient and keeping your head.”My old university friend Simon, who has cerebral palsy, tells me he earns “closer to £40,000 than £50,000” as a policy research manager. “Very few people ever ask me this question as most of the occupants of our village who go down the pub seem to be either scientists for biopharma or financial masters of the universe which makes my salary seem puny,” he says. “Nonetheless, in terms of providing the nice things my family need, I feel well paid, and in terms of what my father gets paid – all I have ever really aspired to – I am doing OK as well. For me, it is also about being a disabled person – my quality of life is far better than many other people in my position typically expect and I feel profoundly lucky.”Still, a headline figure can be misleading. You might earn £10,000 working for a charity because you’re a saint you might also be married to a management consultant who makes six figures by laying other people off. You might turn down that slightly compromising commission because you have impeccable ethical credentials you might also have a trust fund. Also: which number do you choose? It’s customary to cite pre-tax income on job adverts in the UK, but it’s not in France and many other European countries – which immediately changes your relationship to that figure. If you’re self-employed, do you cite gross income (ie all the money you earned in a year), net profit (ie all that minus expenses) or post-tax income (ie all that minus the amount you pay in tax)? How do assets come into it?And what about benefits, tiny amounts, really, but which often incite just as much envy and resentment as, say, the £3.4m home secretary Sajid Javid is reckoned to have earned when he was at Deutsche Bank? It gets complicated. The first person I encounter in Bristol is Kirsten, 49, walking with a crutch with Snoop, her staffie cross. “We saved each other,” she says. Following failed surgery on a degenerative spinal condition, she lives on disability benefit and volunteers at a local hospital for the chronic pain management programme. “I don’t really know how much I get… I mean, I sort of know. But I’d rather not say.”She’s used to difficult conversations about pay. Before her operation, she spent most of her career administering mental health services for the local authority (“But that was cut due to funding reasons”) and went on to work in human resources for a small firm that recruited healthcare professionals. “It was so hard to make everything fair,” she says. “I’d be fighting for iniduals who’d been on minimum wage for a long time. There was a bit of hypocrisy going on in management, them all getting bonuses and the people at the bottom being on minimum wage.” Her current benefits are OK: “But it’s been a hard slog to fight for them.”People on lower wages – and especially on minimum wage – are generally fine with telling me. I catch Theresa, 54, a contract cleaner, just as she finishes her shift at a supermarket. “I was fortunate when I had my family because my husband had his own business, so I was ‘kept’ for a while. But then my husband got ill and was unable to continue with that. The benefits weren’t enough. He was lucky to find this cleaning job, but he found it a struggle with his medical condition – he lives on painkillers – so we were able to job-share. When he’s struggling I step up the pace and the company’s happy. And because we do a good job, we get sent here, there and everywhere as overtime.” The ability to share hours and fuel costs with her husband is a bonus. “But what goes in comes out.” After rent, council tax, bills and so on, she’s left with “pennies”.But she says she’s lucky. She likes the variety of locations, and the hours (approximately 5am-1pm) mean she can look after her grandchildren after school, so that her children can go to work. “My daughter-in-law starts work at five, finishes at one, comes home, hands my son the keys, and off he goes until 11 at night. If they do it that way, they don’t have to pay for childminders. And still at the end of the day, they haven’t got anything for what I call the little luxuries – you know? And that makes me quite cross.”Mickey, 58, is philosophical about the £23,000 he is paid as a park keeper by the council. “It’s not bad – but I could be earning more,” he reflects. “I used to have my own company and run my own contract here, but then the council took over and employed me.” He hasn’t had a pay rise for six years, so in effect his pay has gone down. But as a public sector employee, he can at least look up what his bosses are earning. According to the Bristol city council website, its highest paid positions are strategic directors (on £136,000) the salary ratio of highest-paid to lowest-paid employees is about 10:1. (Private companies will soon be obliged to publish this data, too.) However, the highest-paid roles are being replaced by new, even higher-paid roles: executive director (£135,000-£165,000), level two director (£94,000-£120,000) and level one director (£85,000-£105,000).But Mickey is philosophical. “They do a job,” he says. “They get paid the going rate. There are no tensions.” Indeed, he reckons his job is more enjoyable than theirs. “I grew up round here. My dad worked here. This is special, the best place in Bristol. I’d do this for no money.” Let’s hope no strategic directors read this.I notice Ed, 44, sitting at a table by the park cafe, tapping at his laptop in aviator shades. “I can tell you what I earn, but it’s weird – I’m not a normal 9-5 type person,” he says. “It’s nothing at the moment.” He recently returned from Austin, Texas, where he launched a craft cider business that paid him an annual salary of about $85,000 (£62,500) he sold most of his shares for about $2m (£1.47m) and is currently working out what to do next. In the meantime, that “nothing” includes an annual idend of about £25,000 a year from a cider bar he owns in Bristol.“I’m in an exceedingly lucky position,” he says. “I come from a pretty poor background. None of my old friends is a particularly high flyer – I’m kind of the friend that my mates take the piss out of for being rich. People tease me about what I’m going to do with the money.”He has always been of a “tax the rich” mindset, but now he has to adhere to that himself. “One of the things I hate is that when you go to see any accountant, the assumption is you want to pay the minimum amount of tax. That agenda is unhealthy.” To his surprise, his US accountant recently told him he was exempt from paying $370,000 tax he thought was due on the capital gains in his business, owing to a piece of post-financial crash-era legislation. So now he’s figuring out what to do with it. “I’d like to do something with a bit more social worth than just getting people drunk,” he says. “Maybe something political.”I speak to a couple of retirees whose dogs are entangled: David, 88, and Sue, 73. “We’ve just met,” David says. “She’s from Yorkshire, I’m a Bristol native.”“I’ve lived in Bristol 27 years, thank you very much.”David spent most of his career as a schoolteacher and a local government officer before that when I ask how much he earns, he says “nothing”, besides his state pension and his teacher’s pension. How much is that? “Aha!” he says. “I’m not telling you because you can find out.”“The same with me,” Sue adds. “It would be easy for you to find out. My state pension is the very basic state pension and it’s topped up by the very basic pension credit.” (She eventually discloses that it’s £120 a week, plus £101 top-up.)David considers reticence to be a British trait. Sue isn’t convinced. It depends where in Britain you’re from and when you were born. “I come from a mining village near Wakefield where everybody knew everybody’s business, so attitudes were completely different,” she says. “People were careful with money because there wasn’t a lot of it to go round. That’s the difference between then and now. There is too much of an attitude now of, ‘I want it, I’ll go out and get it.’ Then, if you couldn’t afford it, you didn’t have it.”“How much do you earn then?” David asks me.I still find these numbers a little limiting. How do you factor in security, for example? I have no pension, no sick pay or holiday, no idea what I will be doing next month, and recently lost my one regular source of income, so my bank balance fluctuates wildly. Or joint income? My wife, also a freelance writer, earns much less, so it’s ended up being me who pays all the bills, childcare, rent and so on. Or hours worked? Usually 60 a week? Journalism is not a growth industry. With a rough average of 40p a word, I must publish about 175,000 words a year, about two novels’ worth, to sustain it… And yet, I’m white and male, I’m not scraping sewers or toileting the elderly, and I feel the need to provide hundreds of extra words to justify my privilege (also: I’m paid by the word). I suppose my main worry is not what I earn now so much as what I’ll earn in the future. Is the industry sustainable? What will I do when I’m old? How does anyone else manage? The wider narrative since 2008 has been one of decline: work more, expect less, hope you get lucky. Short of envious of my fellow citizens, I’m simply impressed that anyone can make it work.I approach a man who’s quietly drinking a beer while looking after his baby daughter. He’s a stay-at-home dad for three days of the week and earns £15,000 from a couple of days lecturing at Bristol University. His wife works at Airbus and is the main breadwinner. “We had lots of clear conversations about how best to make it all work, economically and emotionally – and I’m certainly not resentful because we’re in a happy position where one of us can spend time with the children,” he says. “I think the conversation has matured. People recognise that to earn a stupid amount of money, you have to make sacrifices elsewhere.”Does he think Swedish-style salary transparency would help matters here? He sighs. “It would require such a change of mindset. Post-Brexit, I’ve lost a bit of faith in humanity, to be honest. As things roll on, that concept that we’re going through progress… you kind of think, huh. Maybe we can regress sometimes, too?”Three Hare Krishnas on a hill are playing a harmonium and chanting mantras in harmony. When I tell them I am going around asking people how much they earn, they all laugh.“That’s such a boring question!” says Jahnava, 45. “I thought it was going to be something juicy.” She works for a charity called Coracle, which provides her a salary of about £5,000. Woah, that’s not much, I say. “I rely on the Lord.” You would say that. What about food, shelter? “It’s provided by the charity.”Her friend Ellis, 22, has long blond hair and a shirt with lobsters and bananas on it. “I don’t know how much I earn – I don’t have a job right now,” he says. “I’m looking to get a portering job in the hospital, which would be about 18 grand, I think.” How does he support himself in the meantime? “I don’t know.” He laughs. “Jobseeker’s allowance. And lovely people around me.

From channelling your inner Kate Moss and Love Island contestant to ditching the Woodstock look, here’s how to survive itYes, that’s even if you can remember them. Use the 90s revival as an excuse to be comfortable and look cool. You will need a pair of dungarees (think TLC), some tiny sunglasses (The Matrix) and a bumbag (Vanilla Ice … or not). Bonus: wannabe Spice Girls (yes, that is intentional) can even dig out, we mean buy, ginormous-soled Buffalo trainers. After all, what better way to walk through miles of mud?Nineteen sixty-nine is a long time ago. Enough time, you might think, for the Woodstock look to be to solely the territory of BBC4 documentaries and those who actually, you know, live in Woodstock. To be clear, a festival in 2018 is not an excuse to pretend you saw Hendrix do the Star-Spangled Banner, or wear flowers in your hair. Fringing and headbands are not OK. And anyone who commences body painting – unless they’re Keith Haring and Grace Jones at the Paradise Garage, obvs – is seriously in breach of the fashion commandments.The unwritten rule that you don’t wear the band’s T-shirt to the gig has been broken by fashion – soz, musos. Now, merch is the statement you want to make in your field of choice. It can take the form of caps – Kendrick Lamar’s What Happens on Earth Stays on Earth – or T-shirts. Bieber’s are a merch classic, and we can only imagine what Beyoncé and Jay-Z will bring come their tour in June.So, there’s you. You booked your ticket ages ago and had the date marked in your diary for months. Then there’s RihannaLady GagaGwen StefaniPJ Harveydelete as appropriate. They arrive at the site by osmosis, or possibly a helicopter, and remain backstage until they perform, unscathed by the surroundings, in anything from a dress made of mirrors to a perspex headpiece with Hellraiser vibes. Last year, Rihanna wore a Gucci chainmail bodysuit to Coachella, just to hang out in her trailer. Imagine trying to use a Shewee in one of those.Sure, in other ways, Moss’s lifestyle is not exactly easy to attain: the Count boyfriend, the holiday schedule, the house in the Cotswolds. But her festival look is by numbers – in a good way. Moss knows that when you’re out in the wilds, you should stick to the classics: jean cut-offs, sunglasses, wellies and a biker jacket. It may not be the height of innovation but is the best thing when you’re battling an easterly gale and trying to keep the lager in your cardboard cup unharmed. Goals.Alexa Chung is the patron saint of modern festival dressing. She has done it all: PVC trousers, slip dresses and over-the-knee socks, often with a Barbour, usually with a bit of side eye. These are clothes that suit someone walking through the backstage area pretending they don’t notice photographers. They are not the kind of thing to wear when “having a wash” translates to using a couple of wet wipes in your wonky tent.Wings seem to have faded from fashion, but the vestiges of the child’s dressing-up-box remain. Paris Hilton has a lot to answer for: her Coachella look last year involved a rainbow frock and cat ears. And it goes without saying, no Native American headdresses, bindis or anything that can be perceived as cultural appropriation. Not in a festival, not IRL, not anywhere. Not OK.

Like Spotify, Apple Music, which has 40 million subscribers, still carries an extensive selection of Kelly’s songs in its library.Kelly, who faces longstanding allegations of mistreatment of women, recently saw a concert in Chicago cancelled after the #MuteRKelly movement accelerated boycott efforts, with help from the Time’s Up campaign against sexual harassment and assault. He denies abusing anyone and faces no current criminal charges. On Thursday Spotify, citing its new policy against hateful content and conduct, announced that Kelly’s music was no longer available on its owned and operated playlists and algorithmic recommendations. His music can still be found by those who search for it, but Spotify will not promote it. Apple did not announce its move and declined to comment further. The rival streaming service Pandora declined to discuss how it is now treating Kelly’s music in its curated playlists, but said it had decided not to promote “artists with certain demonstrable behavioral, ethical or criminal issues”, adding that it approached “each of these scenarios on a case-by-case basis”. At the Greensboro Coliseum in North Carolina on Friday night, demonstrators stood outside. Some criticized arena officials for declining to meet with a coalition of women’s groups that signed a letter alleging a “long term history of sexual misconduct” by Kelly. “It’s important for the black community to stand up and hold him accountable for his actions,” said Omisade Burney-Scott, a member of Sistersong, a reproductive rights group. On stage, Kelly interspersed references to God with suggestive lyrics and salty language. “Sometimes, some storms ain’t gonna stop,” he told the audience. “As long as my fans are calling for me, I’m gonna be on that stage, singing these songs.” The singer invited audience members to join him, while stage hands passed out T-shirts that read “Turn Up R Kelly”. “I’ve been through a lot,” he said, thanking fans “for y’all to fight for me all these years”.  Kelly said he was approached backstage to tone down his songs and language because there were families in attendance. “Let me ask y’all something,” he said. “Can I do my show tonight?” He then launched into his sexually suggestive repertoire. At one point, he rubbed a fan’s phone between his legs. He persuaded another to wipe his face, tongue and crotch with a towel. One fan, Clarissa Kelley of Lancaster, South Carolina, said: “Everybody has some skeletons in the closet. I’m not going to tear him down, every good thing he does, because of something negative in his life.”In 2008, Kelly was acquitted on child abuse images charges after a video circulated appearing to show him having sex with a teenage girl. More women have come forward in recent years accusing him of sexual misconduct. In response to Spotify’s move, Kelly’s management issued a statement. “R Kelly never has been accused of hate, and the lyrics he writes express love and desire,” it read. “Mr Kelly for 30 years has sung songs about his love and passion for women. “He is innocent of the false and hurtful accusations in the ongoing smear campaign against him, waged by enemies seeking a payoff. He never has been convicted of a crime, nor does he have any pending criminal charges against him.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7fae5334cb75df4c40d47e12de8c761cfb7137f3/0_20_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=186bc4bf80f2937b4caa181d342568e7","title":"stevie wonder kanye west slavery choice","story":"Stevie Wonder has called out Kanye West for saying slavery is a choice, calling the idea “foolishness” and likening it to Holocaust denial. Wonder brought up West without prompting during an interview on Thursday after a show at a West Hollywood club. “There’s been a lot of talk about what was said by Kanye,” Wonder said. “I want people to understand that the truth is the truth and a lie is a lie. “We all know that slavery was not a choice. So I just think that people need to understand that if you know your history, if you know the truth, you know that’s just foolishness.” Wonder said saying slavery was a choice was like saying the Holocaust was not real.West made the remarks in an interview with TMZ earlier this month. “When you hear about slavery for 400 years, for 400 years, that sounds like choice,” West said. He defended his statements and did not back down from them on Twitter after widespread criticism. An email to his representatives seeking a response to Wonder’s comments was not immediately returned. Wonder spoke softly, not angrily, and said he also felt sympathy for West, especially over the rapper losing his mother, who died after having cosmetic surgery procedures in 2007. “You know he lost his mother, the horrible thing that happened,” Wonder said. “I don’t know if he had a chance to really mourn about all that.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/49c9316817994bf7144c2dd538b8c707c65743ce/0_157_3526_2116/master/3526.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=64e6fb77c04265843185f24b3b721a40","title":"the rise of donald glover childish gambino","story":"The award-winning writer, actor, singer and rapper has dominated the internet with his provocative, politically charged hit This is America, the latest step in an illustrious, unconventional careerTry, if you can, to watch This Is America, the new music video from Childish Gambino, while keeping your eyes off the man in the camera’s gaze. It’s not easy. You may have to watch it twice, maybe three times, probably more. In the clip, Childish Gambino is a dancing, running, alternately homicidal and joyous streak of shirtless charisma. Your eyes want to follow him, soak him in. But if you do, you’ll miss the point he seems to be making in the video, an enigmatic and provocative effort that has accumulated over 74m YouTube views and hundreds of thinkpieces in the six days since its release.So instead, try directing your attention on all that’s happening in the background as Childish Gambino – the musical moniker of multi-hyphenate artist Donald Glover – moves through a spare industrial space in a succession of meditative tracking shots that serve as steady foundation for the frenetic action they capture.There are children in school uniforms doing dances of African and American origin. There is a white horse with a hooded rider. There are police. There are people running across the upper level of the space that looks increasingly like a prison as the video progresses. There are chickens, girls on bicycles, money in the air, mobs running in riot-like pandemonium. There are kids lost in their cellphones, car fires, SZA sitting on the hood of what appears to be a 1986 Camry.While Childish Gambino is surely the star – playing the role some have suggested is America itself – viewed in context of the background action, the video is dizzying, hypnotic treatise on racism, gun violence, joy, spirituality, hip-hop and entertainment in the United States. Its symbolism has been linked to Jim Crow, Michael Jackson and the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse. YouTube videos investigating these Easter eggs have more views than many actual music videos.Since debuting This Is America during last week’s episode of Saturday Night Live – for which he served as host and musical guest – Glover has refused to reveal the video’s message, telling TMZ “that’s not for me to say.” What’s certain is that This Is America is a brilliant, career-defining moment. “This is one of the great performers in modern America,” says TV host Touré, whose books include 2012’s Who’s Afraid of Post-Blackness? “He’s showing a really interesting ability to do soul music, television, movies, comedy and drama and to make art that has political substance, but not so much that it becomes propagandist or preachy.”This Is America has dared us to decide what to make of it. The video’s background action commences immediately after the video hits it pivot point: Childish Gambino pulling a gun from his pants and shooting a hooded man in the back of the head, execution style. This is when he declares the song’s guiding principle: “This is America.”The implication is that the brutal violence and general mayhem is no different than daily life in the US, where guns, entrenched racism and police brutality against black Americans dominate the headlines. Gambino goes on to kill a gospel choir in a moment evoking the 2015 Charleston massacre, in which nine people died during a prayer service at one the country’s oldest black churches. The guns are handled with great care, being wrapped in red cloth some believe symbolizes red-state second-amendment reverence. Meanwhile, limp bodies are casually pulled out of the frame.Others view This is America as a clear critique of the way such violence is digested by a culture in which mass shootings and the killing of unarmed black men are so common that we have become numb to them, distracted by entertainment in the same way the video’s joyous dance sequences distract us from chaos in the background.The video was directed by Hiro Murai, who also directs Atlanta, the half-hour series Glover, 34, writes, produces and stars in. (His brother Stephen serves as co-writer and head story editor.) The show follows rapper Paper Boi (Brian Tyree Henry), his cousinmanager Earn (Glover) their friend Darius (Lakeith Stanfield) and Earn’s girlfriend Van (Zazie Beetz) as they maneuver through the Atlanta rap scene. In its two seasons Atlanta has been widely celebrated, and awarded, for its honest, melancholic, darkly funny and often surreal take on black America.“Atlanta is the best show on TV, period,” Chris Rock said in a March New Yorker profile of Glover. Jordan Peele noted: “For black people, Atlanta provides the catharsis of ‘Finally, some elevated black shit.’”In fact, Peele used Childish Gambino’s biggest hit Redbone during the opening credits of Get Out, his Oscar winning 2017 horror film about the daily terrors of being black in America. The biggest hit from Childish Gambino’s 2016 LP Awaken, My Love! Redbone is a slinky gospel slow ride showcasing Gambino’s soulful (and surprisingly high-pitched) vocals. “Stay woke,” the song’s chorus implores, a message that for Get Out’s protagonist Chris was a foreboding warning of the threats to come. “Stay woke, that’s what this movie is about,” Peele said of the song during a 2017 interview with HipHopDX. “I wanted to make sure this movie satisfied the black core movie audience need for characters to be smart and do things that intelligent, observant people would do.”Redbone won the 2018 Grammy for best traditional R\u0026ampB performance, an award Glover presumably put on his shelf alongside the two Emmys and pair of Golden Globes he’s picked up for Atlanta. The album from which Redbone came itself earned three Grammy nominations and demonstrated a marked evolution from Childish Gambino’s first two albums, which were defined by a jokey internet humor, more straightforward beats and rhyming and lyrics the Pitchfork review of 2013’s Because The Internet equated to a Christmas ham.Awaken, My Love! found Childish Gambino dropping the structure of his previous output in favor of lushly layered psychedelic fun in the tradition of George Clinton and vocals reminiscent of Prince at his most soulful. Lyrics evoked the same surreal sense of dread that permeates some of Atlanta’s best scenes – “All I see is zombies  Feeding all around us  All they eat are people  and you won’t survive,” Gambino sings on Zombies – and forecasted the complicated racial politics of This Is America. Childish Gambino debuted the album with three shows in California’s new age desert nexus of Joshua Tree, performing in glow-in-the-dark body paint. Cameras were expressly forbidden. “He always had technique and talent and was always clearly a good rapper,” says Touré. “But it was this funny kind of jokey hip-hop. To see him develop into a very soulful, Parliament-style sort of R\u0026ampB artist, it’s extraordinary.” “It sounds like I’m sucking my own dick – ‘Oh, he thinks he’s great at everything,” Glover said in the New Yorker, describing his lifelong ability to identify the algorithms that would make him successful at anything he attempted, “But what if you had that power?” What Glover was saying is that he knows he does, and there is little reason to doubt him. He can rap while perfectly executing the South African Gwara Gwara, start a massive cultural conversation and earn unbridled praise in the process. (“Donald Glover is a Genius,” Erykah Badu tweeted after the video’s release, while Janelle Monáe’s tweet of just Glover’s name received over 5,000 retweets.) He makes one of the decade’s landmark television shows and has won many prestigious awards. At the end of the month, he joins one of the most successful movie franchises of all time as Lando Calrissian in Solo: A Star War Story. Next year, he’ll play Simba in the live-action reboot of The Lion King. He left his gig as a staff writer for 30 Rock after three years because he wanted to focus on acting, and left his role in the beloved series Community because he wanted to focus on music. He’s suggested that the next Childish Gambino album will be his last, as he’s bored with the project. Given the scope of his career thus far, Glover’s statement indeed seems less self-fellating and more a sober assessment of the extraordinary gifts he’s fully aware he possesses. Gifts that, much like in the extraordinary joy and terrible violence of the video, are hard to look away from.

Now grime rules the roost, with Stormzy’s only UK festival set happening here this summer. Wireless also boasts one of the youngest crowds on the festival circuit, and as such the energy levels will likely put to shame anyone over the age of 25.Does it pass the festival Bechdel test?

Pop genius Dua Lipa is the only female solo act to grace the main stage and even though the likes of Sigrid, Nadia Rose, Kate Nash, Hinds and Dream Wife are featured lower down the bill – and the quarter-female Wolf Alice headline the BBC Radio 1 stage – there is still a blind spot when it comes to women being invited to play bigger slots.See also TRMSMT, Isle of Wight, RIZE festivalWho Vampire Weekend, St Vincent, Feist, Josh T Pearson, Oh Sees, Ezra Furman, Omar Souleyman, Julia Holter, Mulatu Astatke, Lucy DacusWhat Small but perfectly formed, End of the Road has its roots in alt-country, but also welcomes indie big-hitters and experimental folkies.

Namely, that after 11 consecutive Reading and Leeds festivals (plus a dozen or so Glastonburys, a handful of T in the Parks, a sprinkling of Indietracks and the occasional depressing event set up in a massive Portuguese car park and most probably headlined by Muse), your memories are likely to be somewhat squiffy. They’re the kind of memories that have been doused in several litres of Lightning Strike cider, left to marinate in a hedge for four days and woken up with ill-advised tribal facepaint. And, like the bearded man in the healing fields who claims he can levitate through the 17th dimension, they’re probably not to be trusted. So when I check my own festival memories I have to wonder if many of them actually happened. Did I really see a baby in a buggy crowdsurfing through a packed field? Can it be true that I carried one of my friends across a mud-plagued Glastonbury site while he told passing strangers that he was the supreme ruler of the universe, only to then watch him pass out in a toilet block and urinate on himself? Was the night I spent inhaling toxic plastic fumes as tents and toilet blocks were set ablaze around me a figment of my imagination, a fever dream brought on after eating an undercooked chicken pad thai?Whether it’s watching Kevin Rowland confuse an entire crowd by wearing white stockings and suspenders or witnessing Michael Eavis redefine the very definition of the term “singing” while onstage with Stevie Wonder, the thing about festival memories is that they often take on a strange, hallucinatory air. Sure, you buy your ticket to watch Oasis or Beyoncé or Skepta – but then you come back telling friends that actually you went to see six shows by a fully grown man pretending to be a lobster while singing Christmas songs instead.That is the whole glorious point. The best festivals should exist at the point where reality and surreality meet, and your mind is no longer completely sure what’s happening. There should be giant spiders spouting fire, DJ sets that involve you climbing onstage to dance in your wellies, and deep and meaningful conversations about life, the universe and where you put your last piece of chewing gum.You’re left with a muddy mountain of experiences, many of which are hard to verify and almost all of which have no application once back in the real world. It’s unlikely that many potential employers out there are going to be impressed by your ability to fashion semi-waterproof shoes out of two Sainsbury’s bags and a lanyard. Remembering where your tent is located at 5am after several hours in the rave fields might be a game-changer at the time but it doesn’t really translate to anything particularly useful in the office environment. But that’s not important. What’s important at a festival is that you had the best possible time – and that’s especially likely to be the case if you can barely remember any of it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/11ad8d3ca1b4608bde39fe7f5f200670f6015c8d/0_0_4886_3119/master/4886.jpg?w=700\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bd60450d4578bb65640c9e70bc98314b 700w","title":"students plan summer of defiance on brexit","story":"It is exam season at the University of Kent and students are longing for the academic year to be over. Many are flitting between revision and the exam halls on their 1960s campus. Others are sprawled on the lawns, poring over laptops and books, with Canterbury cathedral visible in the distance.These are anxious times for this generation of students. Many fear that, however well they may do academically, life after university will be much more difficult for them than it was for their parents. They worry about the burden of debt after graduation, house prices that seem impossibly high and beyond their reach, and fierce competition for decent jobs.On this campus, though, there is one over-arching concern about their futures that sharpens the sense of generational unfairness: Brexit.The University of Kent calls itself “the UK’s European university”. It has huge numbers of European students and lecturers and boasts its own outposts or “study centres” in Athens, Brussels, Rome and Paris. It is fiercely proud of its European links. The 28 flags of the EU nations fly above its buildings.The president of the Kent students’ union, Ruth Wilkinson, describes a mood of increasing defiance over the Brexit issue. The student body here has a reputation for packing a big political punch, and she knows its power: at last June’s general election a large student vote for Jeremy Corbyn delivered the first ever Labour MP in previously staunchly Tory Canterbury. It was one of the political sensations of a tumultuous election night. Now she wants to have an even bigger impact – by helping to stop Brexit.“The thing is that young people voted overwhelmingly to remain in the EU, and it is our future,” says Wilkinson. “We are the people who are going to live with the consequences of this for the rest of our lives – and our children – and this is why we’re so passionate about it. This is going to massively damage our futures.”Once exams are over, politicians from all parties will begin to feel the full force of young people’s Brexit anger, she says. The protests will be far bigger and better organised than the outcry over student fees after the Tory-Lib Dem coalition came to power in 2010. “This is a case of ‘we’re not taking this’. We’re not just going to be standing shouting in the streets, we’re going to be influencing in every possible way we can.“Students stereotypically protest – and we’re going to do that. On top of that we’re going to lobby our MPs to influence them. We’re going to be influencing through these open letters, we’re going to be networking with every possible person we can, to make sure we get a people’s vote on the Brexit deal. This is the biggest issue affecting my generation, for generations.”Sam Mortimer is a first-year physics student at Kent who is also critical of both the Tory government’s handling of Brexit and the Labour opposition’s failure to articulate a clearer line against it. “I voted Remain for a lot of reasons,” he says. “We’re economically and diplomatically stronger in Europe, and we’ve left the EU for exactly the wrong reasons. It’s been very anti-immigrant and xenophobic. I don’t trust the current government to deliver what they said.“To have an opinion of Labour’s Brexit policy, you’ve got to know what it is – which nobody really does. Corbyn needs to make up his mind on what Labour stands for. He’s been allowed to get away with being vague. I’d be a lot happier if Labour opposed Brexit.”Kent University’s student union is one of 60 across the UK – representing 980,000 young people in colleges and universities – who by Saturday night had signed a letter to be sent to their local MPs calling for a “people’s vote” (a second referendum) on the eventual Brexit deal that Theresa May brings back from Brussels. The organisers say some student unions were reluctant to sign, out of respect for Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn – who opposes another referendum – but most did so enthusiastically.The letter and signatories have been coordinated by the campaign group For our Future’s Sake (irreverently known as FFS for short). It was only launched a few weeks ago but is already making waves in universities and colleges, providing a vehicle through which students and student groups can articulate and coordinate their anti-Brexit protests.Amanda Chetwynd-Cowieson, the group’s co-director, said it was there for young people “who have passed the point of frustration with the government’s complete lack of progress or success with the Brexit negotiations, and the Labour party’s inability to oppose them. Brexit is the biggest threat facing future generations, and we believe that a people’s vote on the terms of the deal will show that this is not the future that young people want. The youth are revolting.”Amatey Doku, a vice-president of the National Union of Students, said 120 elected officers of student unions across the country had signed up. “When so many elected officers, representing nearly a million young people, call for something with one clear voice they need to be listened to. Students and young people overwhelmingly voted Remain and cannot see how the government can deliver a Brexit deal that works for them. As an elected representative of 600 student unions, the NUS is calling for a people’s vote on the Brexit deal.”Among the bigger universities whose unions have signed the letter to parliamentarians are Birmingham, Durham, Cambridge, Swansea, Leeds Beckett, Lancaster, St Andrew’s, Liverpool John Moores and Westminster.The letter says that there are now a massive number of young people (estimated to total 1.4 million) who were too young to vote in the referendum, but who have since become eligible to do so, and that they deserve a say. So, too, do the millions who feel they were misled during the campaign.“When the European Union referendum happened, and a slim majority of the voting public voted to leave, we accepted this,” the letter says. “We believe there were legitimate grievances that led to a Leave vote, both economic and social. However, the world is now a different place, both economically and socially. Promises made during the campaign have not been kept.” It adds: “Because of all of this we call on our elected leaders to deliver on a people’s vote on the Brexit deal so that young people can once and for all have a say on their futures.”The political impact of a well-organised revolt by young people on Brexit could be pivotal over the coming months. If MPs in marginal seats with large or significant numbers of students hear growing calls for a people’s vote, they will ignore them at their peril.Melantha Chittenden, national chair of the Labour students group in the Labour party, said pressure was growing on the party leadership to be more robust in fighting Tory plans for a hard Brexit. She suggested Corbyn should back a people’s vote on the final deal. “Students want the Labour party’s policy to reflect their views and that means having a proper debate and vote on Brexit at the Labour party conference this year.Back on the campus at Kent, union president Wilkinson sounded a word of warning to the Labour leader, suggesting that his Euroscepticism might lose him support among the same student voters that backed him so decisively a year ago, unless he listens to their views.“Young people are overwhelmingly in favour of remaining in the EU, so my word of warning to the Labour party would be to not take that opinion lightly and make sure students’ views are heard. Young people are a massive part of the electorate and they’re the future voters as well, so the party absolutely needs to take that into consideration when they make their choices.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/02a94e36afe741ce2174b3475536cb264edea0bd/136_0_5446_3271/master/5446.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4d1cb46eed37fa3068a33822a5df1479","title":"guernsey assisted dying vote most profound moral issue","story":"Flags and bunting fluttered over Guernsey last week as the island celebrated the 73rd anniversary of its liberation from five years of Nazi occupation – a period of privation, curfews and summary executions.In the capital, St Peter Port, crowds were cheerfully winning and losing money on crown and anchor, an 18th-century dice game still popular in the Channel Islands. Celebratory pints were being drunk.At a service in the Town Church, the Dean of Guernsey, Tim Barker, gave thanks for “our continuing freedom and self-determination”. Guernsey, a crown dependency, has had its own government for more than 800 years, setting taxes and passing legislation. The island has its own bank notes and its own language, though this is spoken by a tiny and dwindling proportion of the 63,000 population.With that autonomy comes political responsibility. This week, Guernsey’s parliament, the States of Deliberation, will debate and vote on a proposal that could see it become the first place in the British Isles to legalise euthanasia. If passed, the move is likely to reignite the debate in the UK, three years after Westminster MPs decisively rejected a bill that would have allowed doctors to help terminally ill people end their lives.Sitting in his garden in the seaside hamlet of Cobo, Martin MacIntyre, 56, hopes that a majority of the 40 elected deputies – all independent: there are no political parties on the island – will back the proposal. But any legislation will be too late for him: he was diagnosed with terminal cancer 13 months ago.“When I was first told, I thought about death every few minutes,” he says. “Now that I’ve accepted it, I’m not angry any more. The sun is shining, the birds are singing, and every day is a bonus. How lucky am I? But I would like to be able to decide how and when I die. I don’t want to die in severe pain or mental anguish I don’t want my wife to go through that either. No one wants to die, but I’d like the option of having some control when the time comes, and to be at home with loved ones.”The proposal – a requête, similar to a private member’s bill in Westminster – initially called for an agreement in principle on assisted dying, with details to be worked out over an 18-month consultation. But last week, Gavin St Pier, the island’s chief minister and the requête’s lead proposer, tabled an amendment clarifying the scope of the proposed law and removing any suggestion that the island could become a euthanasia destination.St Pier’s amendment calls for a law along the lines of the “Oregon model”: the US state has since 1997 allowed assisted dying for people with a diagnosed terminal illness who have less than six months’ life expectancy and full mental capacity. Similar legislation has been passed in six other US states, as well as Canada and the Australian state of Victoria. New Zealand is also considering legislation.The Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg have more permissive laws, based on applicants’ suffering but not requiring a terminal diagnosis. Switzerland allows assisted dying on compassionate grounds to residents and non-residents. In Guernsey, there have been no public opinion polls on the issue, but there has been lively debate on social media, phone-ins and newspapers and at a couple of public meetings.“The island is quite conservative,” St Pier says. “An issue like this is outside the comfort zone of many. People are expressing strong views, but it hasn’t become ill-tempered. It has felt like a mature conversation.”He adds: “I don’t believe the public mood here is significantly different from elsewhere,” pointing to UK polls which consistently show a majority in favour of assisted dying. But Guernsey’s deputies are more ided, he says. “This has the potential to be close, with perhaps one or two votes deciding it.”If the law is passed, there would be a detailed policy report and further votes before assisted dying became legal, with the process probably taking at least three years, according to St Pier. Any law would need Privy Council approval and, possibly, legislative change in Westminster to avoid medical professionals practising in Guernsey being prosecuted under UK law.Chief minister since 2016, St Pier has lived in Guernsey since 1995 and describes himself as “fiscally conservative, socially liberal”. He says he has advocated self-determination at the end of life for some time. Nine years ago, his father died of cardiovascular disease at the age of 77. “About two weeks before, he said he’d had enough. His leg had been amputated, he was riddled with infection and he knew he was terminally ill. His palliative care team were superb, but his wasn’t the death he wanted. And that is the reality for most people.”Opposwition to the proposal has been led by churches, the British Medical Association (BMA) and the Guernsey Disabilities Alliance. A key government committee has refused to back the proposal, saying it is not a priority and investigations would be a drain on resources.In March, the Catholic bishop of Portsmouth, Philip Egan, sent an emotive letter to be read out in the island’s RC churches. “Let there be no death clinics in Guernsey,” it said. “I appeal to Catholics to mobilise. Speak out against this proposal. It is never permissible to do good by an evil means.”An open letter from 53 Christian ministers and officials in Guernsey also opposed the proposal, saying it was “seen as a threat by people living with various disabilities, vulnerable people and ultimately, perhaps, by all of us, as we approach the end of our lives. Every life is a gift that is precious and worthy of defence. Living life in all its fullness will include darker times, pain and sorrow. This is part of the rich ersity and tapestry of life that also provides opportunities for care, generosity, kindness and selfless love.”Only terminally ill Victorian residents over the age of 18 and are living with intolerable suffering.\u0026nbsp They must have a life expectancy of less than six months, or 12 months if the patient is suffering a neurodegenerative illness such as motor neurone disease. Mental illness or disability will not be considered alone as a reason.Anyone wanting access has to make three requests to a medical practitioner, including one in writing. The patient\u0027s eligibility would then be determined by two experienced doctors, of whom one must be a specialist.There are 68 separate safeguards in the legislation. These range from strict eligibility requirements to severe penalties for those abusing the scheme, including life in prison for any doctor found to have coerced or encouraged a patient to consider voluntary assisted dying. Doctors are prohibited from raising the subject with patients – a patient must ask.Patients will be prescribed a lethal dose of drugs that can be self-administered at a time of their choosing. The drugs would need to be kept in a locked box. If a patient is unable to take the drug themselves, lethal injection can be administered by a doctor.The drug to be used is not specified in the legislation. An implementation taskforce will work with a university pharmacy department to research available medications and appropriate formulations.\u0026nbspPentobarbital, better known under the brand name Nembutal, is used elsewhere as a euthanasia drug, but is prohibited in Australia under federal legislation.\u0026nbspThe law comes into operation in June 2019.\u0026nbsp“The deliberate taking of life, or aiding someone to take their own life, is a significant change to the moral and ethical compass of society. This is one of the most profound moral issues we can face. This is an issue that touches deeply on what it is to be human.”The BMA position since 2006 has been “to oppose assisted dying in all its forms, and support the current legal framework, which allows for compassionate and ethical care for the dying to enable people to die with dignity,” says Parkin."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5ec6bcbd5df2b1fe435c2dc256e2964228e4c8d1/0_0_3418_2052/master/3418.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6ba94a8d79904cef8cebd8024b10cfb5","title":"one in five  turned down for universal credit rules too complex","story":"Fears are emerging over the complexity of the government’s new welfare system after data revealed that one in five applicants is being turned down because they are failing to comply with the application process.Ministers have already been forced to slow down the rollout of universal credit and to ensure that claimants receive their payments sooner after concerns that some were waiting well over a month for funds and were facing mounting rent arrears. Some welfare campaigners now fear that the complexity of the application system has left thousands of applicants falling foul of the rules.According to data released under the Freedom of Information Act, which analysed applications for universal credit over one month, a fifth were turned down because of “non-compliance with the process”. Of those, half failed to book an initial interview. The rules state that if the applicant has not called a helpline to set up an interview within a week of making their application, their claim may be closed.With around 100,000 new claims for universal credit each month, this could mean that tens of thousands of people will not receive a payment.A spokesman for the Department for Work and Pensions said the figures “don’t capture the reasons” for people not completing their application. “It may be they’ve found higher-paying employment and no longer need support,” he said. “Almost 800,000 people have already applied for universal credit successfully, and anyone struggling with the process can call the helpline or visit their local jobcentre, where staff will help them.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d3d4ced51a18a6db00be7c55124374aa871d5954/0_118_4724_2834/master/4724.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9e87bdf6a862807ec5b16d3cf67365f0","title":"ireland pakistan test cricket day two match report","story":"Soon after 10am, the Irish players gathered together on the outfield while the chair of selectors, Andrew White, set down a scruffy cardboard box full of handsome new caps. He handed them out one by one, the first to captain William Porterfield, then the rest in alphabetical order, Andy Balbirnie, Ed Joyce, Tyrone Kane, Tim Murtagh, Kevin and Niall O’Brien, Boyd Rankin, Paul Stirling, Stuart Thompson and Gary Wilson. The first Irish Test XI. At least a couple of them started to cry from pride. Then, their coach, Graham Ford, cut them short. “Let’s get moving.”The Irish cricket community is small, but proud and enthusiastic. Over the years a lot of boys and men who love or loved the game have entertained daydreams of playing in a Test match for Ireland. In their minds, it might have looked just like this Saturday. A bright, warm May morning at the pretty little ground, hardly a cloud in the sky, and 5,000 fans in the grandstands, family and friends and team-mates all around and the opposition reeling. This after Porterfield, following Friday’s washout, had won the toss, and became the first captain to choose to bowl in his country’s first Test.Porterfield’s side were stacked with right-arm medium-fast bowlers, his two openers, Murtagh and Rankin, much the best and most experienced of them. The next, Thompson and Kane, have played a handful of first-class games between them, and the last, Kevin O’Brien, is strictly part-time. But Pakistan’s batting line-up was callow, too. They had given a debut to Imam-ul-Haq and Faheem Ashraf, their No3, Haris Sohail has played two Tests before this, and their No5, Babar Azam, 11. The pitch was damp and grassy and Porterfield reckoned Pakistan’s batsmen might be vulnerable.Porterfield was right. They looked nervous from the first ball, which was a slapstick bit of business. Murtagh, ever so tense after the “spine-tingling” cap ceremony, over-pitched so the delivery landed right up by Azhar Ali’s feet.“That first ball is something I’ve been thinking about for a while,” Murtagh said. He’d been telling himself to “bowl a magic ball, bowl a magic ball” and instead “I missed my length by about a yard” so it came out as a floaty yorker. Azhar patted the ball down to the ground, stared at it for a split second, then set off on a quick single.Imam came haring up from the non-striker’s end and as he ed for the line he collided with both the keeper, Niall O’Brien and Kane, who was sprinting in from square-leg. Imam was knocked flat and for a moment it looked like he might be seriously injured. He passed his concussion test though and was back on his feet and batting again five minutes later. As Murtagh said: “The first ball in Test cricket’s probably never taken so long.”In the stands, everyone seemed to know each other, but not what to expect from this Test. The Irish crowd know the game, and love it, so were quick and keen to applaud Imam when he hit the first four, through cover. They were quicker and keener, mind, when Rankin got Azhar out soon after, caught at second slip, and then Murtagh dismissed Imam lbw with the next ball. Murtagh was bowling brilliantly and almost had Asad Shafiq caught at slip later in the over.Porterfield chose this as the moment to make his first change and brought on Kane. A group of his club-mates were watching, unable to believe that their pal, a 23-year-old who has not played so much as a county match, was now a Test cricketer.They seemed every bit as nervous for him as he must have felt himself. Kane started with a no-ball but after that he settled into it well, his second over a maiden. As Porterfield said, he bowled better than his final figures, 18-2-84-0, suggested.As the morning wore on, Pakistan rallied, and Shafiq and Sohail batted through to lunch.The afternoon ebbed and flowed. Thompson found that Test cricket was as easy as whanging the ball down and waiting for the batsmen to play a bad shot. He had Sohail caught in the gully and Sarfraz in the slips. In between, Murtagh got Azam and Rankin did for Shafiq, who was the only man in the top order who settled. Shafiq put together a careful 62 before Rankin switched to bowling short and had him caught at square-leg.At that point Pakistan were 159 for six. But they finished well. Faheem and Shadab Khan rattled their way to half-centuries so by the close they were 268 for six, as Ireland’s fielders flapped at a couple of catches. It had been a long day, the first of many."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c3a80b37ef7e25afb3925db1b168685499603e78/0_141_4228_2537/master/4228.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9fa1870c7ccfd36e25a0e1f5996cb407","title":"players championship golf tiger woods sawgrass","story":"• Simpson on 19 under with seven-shot lead after round three• Woods enjoys best round of his season to move to eight underOn a day in which Tiger Woods rolled back the years, Webb Simpson needed only to do likewise but with days. The kind of Woods performance which golf cherished as much as its returning hero himself will inevitably count for nothing tangible should Simpson – who is enjoying a comeback of his own – continue apace. Simpson was unlikely to match the Friday heroics which saw him shoot 63 and duly did not.The 2012 US Open champion had cause to be perfectly content with a 68 on the basis it affords him a seven shot Players Championship lead with only 18 holes to play. Simpson is in the territory whereby conceding this tournament would be wounding enough were it not the PGA Tour’s flagship event. The only apparent danger to the 32-year-old is that he has entered uncharted territory. Simpson’s 19-under tally has Danny Lee, who carded a Saturday 70, such a distant second he requires binoculars. Dustin Johnson is one adrift of Lee at minus 10. The rest, surely, are playing the tournament within the tournament. Woods relished this Sawgrass Saturday just as much as those desperate for the 14-times major winner to approach anything like his former self. Maybe all parties needed it until now, fevered hype around the American amid his latest return from back surgery had not been endorsed by results. Actions will always speak louder than the upbeat words consistently offered by Woods.A seven-under-par 65 was the highlight of the 42-year-old’s season thus far. The scale of reaction as Woods was in the middle of his charge only served to highlight once again what impact he has on a sport that not so long ago looked like it may have to resign itself to life without him.He had survived the Players Championship cut by one shot. His third round start suggested he had been offended by that lowly position. Woods birdied four of his first five holes. He reached the turn in 30. By the time he reached the 13th tee, the former world No 1 was eight under par – nine under for the tournament – and broadcasters broke with convention by cutting a deal to begin their live coverage earlier than scheduled.A bogey at the 14th and four subsequent pars dulled hope of a course record but Woods was purring when assessing his morning’s work. This marked his lowest career round – from 66 – at the Players and best against par in any event since day two of the WGC-Bridgestone Invitational in 2013.“I finally got off to a good start,” Woods said. “I birdied the first couple of holes and I just kept it rolling from there. I hit a lot of good shots. It was nice to see a few putts go in 65 was probably as high as I could have shot, which was kind of nice.“Eventually I was going to put all the pieces together and today, for the most part, I did that. To be eight-under through 12, realistically I probably could have got a couple more out of it and got to 10 for the day. That wasn’t that bad a tee shot at 14 but I ended up in a spot where I didn’t have much of a shot. I don’t make birdie at 16, 17’s a sand wedge in to the green. But I’ll take it.”A curious aspect of Woods’s comeback from the depths of physical despair is that even before this performance he was showing a 20-shot improvement over weekend rounds from days one and two. “I wish I knew what the difference was,” he said.A Saturday quirk related to Jordan Spieth, who had helped his compatriot survive the halfway cut with an 18th-hole bogey on Friday. The Open champion returned to match Woods’s 65. This was highly useful to the mindset of Spieth, who has had a curiously low-key year, save a closing 64 at the Masters that came close to snatching the Green Jacket from Patrick Reed.As far as Spieth is concerned, improvement with putter in hand will trigger the kind of spectacular run he is capable of. “I didn’t try and do too much, I recognised that my game is actually in a really good place right now,” the three-times major winner said. “Sometimes this game can tear you down and make you think some of the best parts of your game are some of the worst parts of your game when really it’s so close. With the top players there’s such a fine line that it’s always something simple.”As if to offset any theory the exploits of Woods and Spieth simplified Sawgrass conditions, the PGA champion Justin Thomas had to make do with a 68."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/10bbf877f5d48a3d4cf692b24ca4440f8863fc68/0_176_5239_3143/master/5239.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=59e6f8f4c276469583fe1621c4426283","title":"racing 92 leinster european rugby champions cup match report","story":"Irish rugby’s remarkable year shows absolutely no sign of ending. By no stretch of the imagination was this a classic final but it is impossible to deny the scale of Leinster’s achievement in becoming only the second team in history to win four European Cups. Given Ireland’s Six Nations grand slam and potentially a Pro14 title as well, the 2017-18 season has been a rhapsody in green and blue.While the margins in Bilbao were distinctly slim, the soon-to-retire Isa Nacewa slotting the winning penalty with less than two minutes remaining, there can be no disputing Leinster’s consistency.Even if Rémi Talès’s last-gasp drop-goal attempt had not been deflected wide, Leinster would have fancied outlasting opponents who were already down to their third-choice fly-half within three minutes of the kick-off. The great Dan Carter pulled out late with a tweaked hamstring, denying the former All Black a fairytale finish to a wonderfully successful career, and the South African Pat Lambie soon followed, limping from the fray having been collared high by Johnny Sexton. With the influential Maxime Machenaud and Dimitri Szarzewski sitting injured in the stands, Racing did well to come as close to glory as they did.The total absence of tries will not remotely bother Leinster’s director of rugby, Leo Cullen – the first man to win the tournament as both a player and a coach – and Stuart Lancaster, who will savour this outcome as much as any Irishman. England’s former head coach has had his share of tough times but his decision to reboot his career in Dublin has been richly rewarded.As Cullen conceded afterwards, however, it “wasn’t pretty” from the outset. Teddy Iribaren is miles down the French scrum-half rankings but the unsung 27-year-old possesses the sweetest of left boots and came close to wrenching the title away from Nacewa’s side.From the opening exchanges, when a high tackle wide out on the left by Garry Ringrose cost three points, Leinster knew they were in a battle for the title.Racing were also harassing their opponents on the gain-line and at the breakdown. A collapsed maul gave Iribaren, who has Basque heritage, the chance to restore Racing’s lead and only when Leinster opted for more of an aerial game did the French side start to look more uncertain. Leinster were also guilty of making some odd decisions. Awarded a penalty barely 15 metres out, Sexton opted not to kick for goal or the corner, instead taking a quick tap and giving the ball to Dan Leavy, who was instantly turned over. It was an uncharacteristic piece of slack game\u0026nbspmanagement.The final was not an easy match, either, for the referee, Wayne Barnes, forced to adjudicate on any number of hairline infractions in a claustrophobic first 40 minutes. If Nakarawa was slightly fortunate not to receive a yellow card for sticking out an involuntary hand and blocking a promising Leinster attack, it merely underlined just how narrow the margins were and the ambiguity of the law. A deliberate, cynical slap down of a potential scoring pass is clearly deserving of 10 minutes in the bin but players and supporters are now appealing for pretty much anything.The contest needed something more uplifting to captivate the neutral, royally entertained the previous evening by Cardiff Blues’ last-gasp victory over Gloucester in the Challenge Cup final.It did not materialise in the third quarter as both sides were sucked into an increasingly error-strewn, staccato dogfight. Jordi Murphy was penalised for not rolling away, giving Iribaren another straightforward three points, and Sexton made a complete hash of a long-range penalty attempt which, in golfing terms, barely made the fairway.The fly-half made amends six minutes later to level the scores again, only to watch yet another penalty attempt drift just wide. A high tackle by Leavy on Henry Chavancy gave Racing another chance but this time Teddy proved less steady. The possibility of extra time began to loom but Nacewa’s two late penalties, after Sexton slipped and tweaked his groin, ultimately spared his team-mates that brutal fate. “It was tough – torturous in many ways – to watch that last 20 minutes,” said Cullen. “Maybe that makes it that bit more special, to have to go through that pain.”Whether it inspires millions of Spanish kids to rip down their Real Madrid and Barcelona posters and stick up pictures of Tagdh Furlong instead is doubtful but, as a gospel-spreading exercise, this weekend has been a definite success. Next year the finals weekend will be held in Newcastle, where some Leinster supporters have apparently already booked hotel rooms. It may well prove a very shrewd investment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/99a43d694ecf6e2e168e00f52358176845b7f906/77_0_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9c136b8e25e2cd9c0f2af21504c53701","title":"nine endorphin boosting ideas to get you outdoors this spring and summer","story":"Time outdoors has a hugely positive impact on our mental health and wellbeing. Whether you fancy paddleboarding around the coast or zipwiring across the treetops, here’s how to unlock a healthier, happier you this spring and summerFrom reducing blood pressure to alleviating symptoms of depression, countless studies have proved that being outdoors and in contact with nature is beneficial for both physical and mental health. In these milder months, there’s no excuse not to be outside as much as possible. Here are nine ideas for inspiration.Ride a waveThe north Cornwall coast, with its big Atlantic seas, is Britain’s premier surf destination, with Fistral beach at Newquay probably the country’s best-known surf beach. But there are great places to learn to surf all around the UK. If you’re after a board experience with a less steep learning curve, stand-up paddleboarding offers the chance to take to the water in an easy-to-learn fashion. As well as the exhilaration of surfing the waves, paddleboarding can be a means of exploring the wonders of Britain’s tranquil inland waterways.Get started: Surfing England (surfingengland.org) has information on surf clubs and learning to surf. The British Stand Up Paddle Association website (bsupa.org.uk) has information on where to learn.See colours in bloomSpring and summer are the best times to explore England’s most glorious gardens. Among the Royal Horticultural Society’s (RHS) stunners is its flagship garden, Wisley in Surrey. Home to one of the world’s largest plant collections, it’s a riot of flowering bulbs and blossoms in spring, with fragrant roses and colourful mixed borders in summer. The RHS also runs summer flower shows around the country, including the world-famous Chelsea flower show. The National Trust is  to more than 200 gardens and landscaped parks, many attached to its historic houses, with Studley Royal water gardens at Fountains Abbey, also a world heritage site, among the best known.Freewheel through forest trailsZip along peaceful country lanes between summer hedgerows, pedal past glowering mountains above Scotland’s Glencoe pass as part of a tour or expedition, race with other cyclists, or even head off-road along forest trails on a mountain bike. Cycling can provide high-adrenaline sport or light, relaxing exercise, but whichever way you ride, getting on a bike gives you an up-close view of the countryside that you’d never get from a car.Get started: Cycling UK (cyclinguk.org) can help you get on the road, with advice on everything from buying a bike to cycling groups and routes.Escape to the countryCity dwellers craving a rural fix should seek out one of the many regional annual outdoor shows, a celebration of farming and rural life, with sheep and cattle competitions, horse and dog shows, sheep-shearing contests and farm machinery displays. These days, though, the events are also packed with family-friendly entertainments, ranging from air displays and carriage-driving races to skateboarding and marching bands. Local producers showcase their food and drink, and makers display arts and crafts.Get started:UK County Shows (ukcountyshows) has countrywide information and links to inidual shows.Swim in scenic surroundingsWhat could be a more perfect summer idyll than plunging into a cool lake or river on a hot, sunny day? Wild swimming – taking a dip in rivers, lakes, streams and waterfalls – has a growing number of fans. Popular spots to swim include Ullswater in the Lake District and lochs throughout Scotland, while rivers in the Brecon Beacons are home to stunning waterfall plunge pools. In the south of England, Pangbourne on the river Thames is one of many popular locations, and there are even urban swims to be had in London’s Serpentine and Highgate ponds.Get started: There’s information on locations throughout the UK and all-important safety tips tips at wildswimming.Soar into the treetopsThere’s a special kind of thrill to hurtling through the treetops suspended on a wire. Locations range from urban parks (such as Heaton Park in Manchester and Battersea Park in London) to mountains and forests. Zip World, with locations in Wales, offers a variety of adventures through forest, over a quarry and even – this one’s for the fitter and more adventurous – underground in caverns. Go Ape has locations throughout England, Scotland and Wales, and a collection of mainly forest-based attractions.Kayak along the waterwaysBritain has thousands of miles of rivers, lakes, reservoirs and canals canoeing (single-ended paddle), or kayaking (double-ended paddle), is a great way to explore them. Assuming you don’t have your own canoe, you’ll need to join a club or go to an activity centre, where staff will generally help new paddlers with an induction session. Sea kayaking is a lot of fun, too, and more experienced paddlers may enjoy canoe polo (just as it sounds) or white-water canoeing. Get started: British Canoeing (britishcanoeing.org.uk) has information on canoe clubs and activity centres around the country, and on canoe hire.Walk this wayWhether it’s a Sunday stroll or a serious hike, there’s no simpler – or cheaper – way to explore Britain’s great outdoors than on foot. The British countryside is laced with public footpaths all you need to get going is a pair of walking boots or sturdy trainers (plus a map and weatherproof gear if you’re going far). Among myriad footpaths, 16 national trails pass through some of the country’s most iconic landscapes. They include the South West Coast Path, with 630 miles of trails snaking around the Dorset, Devon, Cornwall and Somerset coasts, and northern England’s hilly Pennine Way.Get started: National Trails (nationaltrail). In addition, Ramblers (ramblers.org.uk) has suggestions for hiking routes on its website.Combine your love of music with the outdoorsPack your tent and wellington boots and head for one of the country’s iconic music festivals this summer. These days the biggest international names (from Beyoncé to Ed Sheeran) vie to play them: there’s no other way to see so many top artists in a single location. Glastonbury is taking a break in 2018, but there are many others picking up the slack, from Bestival to Latitude, the Isle of Wight festival, V and many more.

A good nosy at their previously unseen personal possessions and artefacts, that’s what. This summer, that’s exactly what London’s V\u0026ampA museum delivers in the much-anticipated Frida Kahlo: Making Her Self Up. The majority of this collection of jewellery, letters, photographs and items from her wardrobe (including hand-painted corsets) was only recently discovered, having been shut away for 50 years since her death. Consider this essential for demystifying the Mexican artist and sartorial icon, and it’s a lot cheaper than going all the way to Mexico. Granted, the exhibition is indoors, but you can combine your visit with a stop-off at the V\u0026ampA’s garden cafe, a hidden oasis in the centre of the museum, where you can sit at one of the courtyard tables or picnic on the lawn.vam.ac.uk from 16 JuneArrange a bouquet of flowersYou don’t have to be embarking on a second career as a florist to appreciate a beautifully arranged bunch of flowers, although a workshop at The Narcissus Flower School in Edinburgh could well send you in that direction. From learning to hand-tie a spring wedding bouquet to perfecting a festival-ready floral crown, this is the place to go this summer for cutting-edge botanical design. The highlight in the programme has to be The Foragers Garden Party workshop, which caters to all al fresco needs, from rustic barbecues to afternoon tea. Bring it on.narcissusflowers 21 June (and various dates)Learn a new craftStep away from the sandy beaches and seafood and head straight to The Studio at Burlingham Hall in Norfolk to get your hands – rather than your toes – dirty this summer. Artist Victoria Hall runs a two-day workshop for beginners in the art of paper marbling at this picturesque country estate. You’ll learn about the history, get familiar with watercolours, and tackle various paper patterns (including curl and comb designs). In fact, you’ll have a range of eclectic designs under your belt by the end. And if you don’t leave feeling like a born-again artist, you’ll certainly have the materials to make some pretty alternative Christmas cards.burlinghamhall 16-17 AugustGo down to the woodsHead to the Latitude festival for late-night poetry, light installations, and the biggest comedy, theatre, and arts line up in its 12-year history. Held in Suffolk’s picturesque Henham Park, Latitude is renowned for its eclectic arts programme, with a bit of yoga and lake swimming thrown in for good measure. This year it’s all about Bridget Christie and Tim Key in the comedy selection, while the Killers and Alt-J are definitely headliners to be reckoned with. But it’s the addition of enigmatic music and fashion icon Solange to the bill – her first time heading up a UK festival – that’ll be a real feast of the senses.latitudefestival 12-15 JulyFill up at a foodie festivalIs your idea of heaven on a hot day hitting up a beer garden?

Dishes from Kerridge’s own Michelin-starred Marlow pubs The Hand and Flowers and The Coach will pop up at the four festivals, alongside others from throughout Britain, and there’ll be chef demonstrations and a whole foodie village to shop in. Let’s not forget the soundtrack – brought to you live by the likes of Tom Odell and Razorlight.www.pubintheparkuk various dates between 17 May and 9 SeptemberSee a film under the starsIf you see one film this summer, just make sure it is outdoors. When it’s warm outside (and even when it’s not) there is no shortage of quirky film events, but Picnic Cinema – run by the arts organisation and charity Eden Arts, in Penrith, Cumbria – pulls out all the stops. You can dress up, bring your own picnic (the clue is in the title), and even sleep over. With music, dancing and surprise entertainment, amid spectacular scenic views, you may even forget you’re there to watch a film. Last year, revellers got suitably attired for Pulp Fiction, Withnail and I and The Wicker Man so we can’t wait to see what this year has in store.

Not that you’ll have much time to sit with your head in a book at Hay festival Wales, where Margaret Atwood leads a stellar line up of about 800 inspirational, thought-provoking discussions and panels. She’ll speak on The Handmaid’s Tale and beyond, while Philip Pullman, joined by Marina Warner and folklore academic Jack Zipes, promise tales of wonder, magic, and hope. Don’t miss the brilliant Letters Live, which returns for a fifth year.hayfestival 24 May-3 JuneWatch iconic bandsWhen it’s live music you want, settling on which summer festival to go to can be tricky, but this year’s Isle of Wight festival will take that decision out of your hands. It’s a special one, marking 50 years since its inauguration, and as a result, the festival has been appealing for stories from anyone who was there in 1968, watching Jefferson Airplane and T Rex et al. This year’s line-up also nods to nostalgia, with performances from Depeche Mode and Van Morrison.isleofwightfestival 21-24 June"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1f1cea9943fe6bba7682c2c7ec2d8e7fcf1729ec/0_0_3336_2002/master/3336.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5f1cc2f6bb95403414d8fde29322bee0","title":"facebook brexit russia unresolved 40 questions","story":"Mike Schroepfer, Facebook’s chief technology officer, was the second executive Facebook offered up to answer questions from parliament’s select committee for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS).He took his place in the hot seat in the wake of the first attendee, Simon Milner, Facebook’s (now ex-) head of policy for Europe, who answered a series of questions about Cambridge Analytica’s non-use of Facebook data that came back to haunt the company in the furore that followed the Observer and New York Times revelations from Christopher Wylie.But new evidence released by the United States Congress suggests adverts were targeted at UK Facebook users, and paid for in roubles, in the months preceding the short 10-week period “regulated” by the Electoral Commission but when the long campaigns were already under way.This is the latest episode in a series of miscommunications between the company and British legislators, which has come to a head in the week the Electoral Commission finally published the findings of its investigation into the Leave.EU campaign.Damian Collins, the chair of the DCMS committee, said: “We asked them to look for evidence of Russian influence and they came back and told us something we now know appears misleading. And we’re still waiting for answers to 40 questions that Mike Schroepfer was unable to answer, including if they have any record of any dark ads.“It could be that these adverts are just the tip of the iceberg. It’s just so hard getting any sort of information out of them, and then not knowing if that information is complete.”Preliminary research undertaken by Twitter user Brexitshambles suggests anti-immigrant adverts were targeted at Facebook users in the UK and the US.One – headlined “You’re not the only one to despise immigration”, which cost 4,884 roubles (£58) and received 4,055 views – was placed in January 2016. Another, which accused immigrants of stealing jobs, cost 5,514 roubles and received 14,396 impressions. Organic reach can mean such adverts are seen by a wider audience.Facebook says that it only looked for adverts shown during the officially regulated campaign period. A spokesperson said: “The release of the set of IRA adverts confirms the position we shared with the Electoral Commission and DCMS committee. We did not find evidence of any significant, coordinated activity by the IRA operatives directed towards the Brexit referendum.“This is supported by the release of this data set which shows a significant amount of activity by the IRA with only a handful of their ads listing the UK as a possible audience.”Collins said that the committee was becoming increasingly frustrated by Facebook’s reluctance to answer questions and by founder Mark Zuckerberg’s ongoing refusal to come to the UK to testify.Milner told the committee in February that Cambridge Analytica had no Facebook data and could not have got data from Facebook.The news reinforces MPs’ frustrations with a system that last week many of them were describing as “broken”. On Friday, 15 months after the first Observer article that triggered the Electoral Commission’s investigation into Leave.EU was published, it found the campaign – funded by Arron Banks and endorsed by Nigel Farage – guilty of multiple breaches of electoral law and referred the “responsible person” – its chief executive, Liz Bilney – to the police.Banks described the commission’s report as a “politically motivated attack on Brexit”.Leading academics and MPs called the delay in referring the matter to the police “catastrophic”, with others saying British democracy had failed. Liam Byrne, Labour’s shadow digital minister, described the current situation as “akin to the situation with rotten boroughs” in the 19th century. “It’s at that level. What we’re seeing is a wholesale failure of the entire system. We have 20th-century bodies fighting a 21st-century challenge to our democracy. It’s totally lamentable.”Stephen Kinnock, Labour MP for Aberavon, said it was unacceptable that the Electoral Commission had still not referred the evidence about Vote Leave from Christopher Wylie and Shahmir Sanni – published in the Observer and submitted to the Electoral Commission – to the police. He said: “What they seem to have done, and are continuing to do, is to kick this into the long grass. There seems to be political pressure to kick this down the road until Britain has exited the EU.”He accused the commission of ignoring what he considered key evidence, including about Cambridge Analytica. The commission had found Leave.EU guilty of not declaring work done by its referendum strategist, Goddard Gunster, but said it had found no evidence of work done by Cambridge Analytica.“The whole thing stinks,” Kinnock said. “I wrote to the commission with evidence that the value of work carried out by Cambridge Analytica was around £800,000. The glib way it dismissed the multiple pieces of evidence about the company was extraordinary. I just think it is absolutely not fit for purpose.”Gavin Millar QC, a leading expert in electoral law at Matrix Chambers, said: “Our entire democratic system is vulnerable and wide open to attack. If we allow this kind of money into campaigning on national basis – and the referendum was the paradigm for this – you have to have an organisation with teeth to police it.”Damian Tambini, director of research in the department of media and communications at the London School of Economics, described the whole system as broken and said there was not a single investigatory body that seemed capable of uncovering the truth. “The DCMS has found itself in this extraordinary position of, in effect, leading this investigation because it at least has the power to compel witnesses and evidence – something the Electoral Commission can’t do. It’s the classic British solution of muddling through.“The big picture here is it’s possible for an inidual or group with lots of money and some expertise to change the course of history and buy an election outcome. And with our regulatory system, we’ll never know if it’s happened.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/39ef41941614c89a23c08234400863d95cf77143/35_497_4299_2579/master/4299.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0421d7b0a1cdaad0cec7ec01a88fbbf0","title":"stage invader storms uks eurovision set","story":"Singer SuRie carries on after invader shouts ‘Nazis of the UK media, we demand freedom’A stage invader has stormed the stage in the middle of UK singer SuRie’s Eurovision performance in Lisbon.The man grabbed the microphone from the 29-year-old singer on Saturday night and screamed “Nazis of the UK media, we demand freedom” before he was wrestled from the stage.The man has since been widely identified as serial stage invader Dr ACactivism who tried to hijack The National Television Awards in January before host Dermot O’Leary pushed him from the stage.And in April 2017 he was identified as the man who tried to disrupt the live final of The Voice.According to his Twitter bio, he is a philosopher, activist and DJ based in London and has written a self-published e-book.SuRie, real name Susanna Marie Cork, clapped in time to the backing track while the camera cut to British fans in the Altice Arena in Lisbon after the Londoner managed to grab her microphone.Once it was back in her hand she sang the lyrics, “Don’t give up,” to huge cheers from the crowdPresenter Graham Norton told viewers: “We are still reeling, there was a stage invasion.”There was an outpouring of support for the singer on social media.JK Rowling wrote: “That was everyone who’s ever been on stage’s worst nightmare and it must have been scary, but what a pro, what a recovery.” Former Eurovision contestant Cheryl Baker tweeted “love your heart” to SuRie and added: “Where was the security?

The Hawaiian Volcano Observatory reported that the new fissure opened a mile north-east of the last fissure and east of the Puna Geothermal Venture plant. No significant lava flow was reported immediately. Plant workers this week removed 50,000 gallons of pentane gas stored at the site.

The attorney general, Jeremy Wright, told the House of Commons that the prime minister Theresa May had written to Belhaj and Boudchar to apologise for the “appalling” treatment they had received.After the statement, Straw conceded publicly for the first time that he had authorised some of MI6’s actions, despite previously telling MPs that allegations of his involvement in rendition were conspiracy theories. Rifkind, a former chairman of the ISC who served in various cabinet roles under Margaret Thatcher and John Major, told the BBC: “I think it’s absolutely vital and in the public interest that the role of the prime minister and ministers at the time in this affair should become better understood. “Tony Blair was prime minister. He has been uncharacteristically silent, so far as I am aware not a word has he said. Jack Straw said he would love to give evidence to the ISC on those matters relevant to national security where he can’t speak openly.“What is not known is the extent to which the then prime minister and other ministers were party to what MI6 was doing. And we know that Mr Blair took a very strong personal interest in Libya.”Belhaj and Boudchar fought a protracted legal battle over their claim that they were kidnapped and returned to Gaddafi’s regime in a move linked to Blair’s infamous “deal in the desert” with the Libyan leader. “They could quite easily come to the judgment either that ministers, in their view, did not know, or were not involved, or that ministers were ... right up to their necks, as it were. “There will be no reason of national security why either the involvement of the prime minister, or ministers, or their non-involvement, should not be, not only investigated, but the results announced to parliament and to the wider public.” He added that the committee had the right to decide on its own authority whether to carry out such an investigation. During the 2011 Libyan revolution, documents also came to light revealing MI6’s role in the rendition of a second Libyan opposition figure, Sami al-Saadi, who was kidnapped along with his wife and four young children. Straw has said he would be happy to give evidence to the ISC, stating that he sought to act at all times in a manner consistent with his legal duties while foreign secretary. But that would be done behind closed doors, and MPs have called for Straw to give evidence before parliament about his role in the kidnap and mistreatment of the two families. Human rights groups, meanwhile, say there needs to be a broader inquiry, independent of government.

The names mooted in the Italian press include the League’s deputy leader, Giancarlo Giorgetti Giampiero Massolo, chairman of shipbuilder Fincantieri and ex-chief of the secret service, and Elisabetta Belloni, the foreign ministry’s secretary general.In any event, the candidate is likely to be someone who will heed Mattarella’s thinly disguised warning to the coalition on Thursday against retreating from Europe. M5S has softened its stance on the EU, saying it would like to open discussions on “some treaties” rather than pull Italy out, while Salvini has said he wants to “defend Italy” within the bloc.If the talks fail, both Salvini and Di Maio have said they want new snap elections. In a further turn of events on Saturday, that could mean Italy’s four-time ex-premier Silvio Berlusconi getting another chance at re-entering government. Italian newspapers reported that the 81-year-old had his ban on seeking office lifted by a Milan court on Friday, meaning he can run for one of the two houses of parliament.

Guards and researchers will be withdrawn, and the area shut off.Chinese geologists believe the mountain over the main site was likely to have collapsed after North Korea exploded its largest ever nuclear weapon last year, making it unsafe for further testing and requiring radiation monitoring.But Kim’s move to formally decommission the test site and invite foreign journalists to a highly sensitive military site to observe its shutdown is another gesture of goodwill before the 12 June summit with Trump in Singapore.It comes after the Pyongyang government released three American citizens it had been holding. The men, who Trump had described as hostages, were handed over to newly confirmed secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, on his second trip to the North Korean capital to prepare for the summit.He described his meetings with Kim as substantive and said he had offered US economic help to North Korea if the country gives up its nuclear weapons.Many long-term analysts are sceptical that Kim, who only announced in December that the country’s nuclear forces were completed, will give up such a hard-won prize even for extremely generous aid.The fate of autocrats like Saddam Hussein and Libya’s Muammar Gaddafi, who gave up their weapons programmes only to be toppled in western-backed military actions, has been noted in Pyongyang.Trump’s decision to pull out of the nuclear agreement his predecessor Barack Obama forged with Iran may also give Kim pause for thought about the durability of any deal he makes with a US president.For now, however, Kim appears to be on a diplomatic offensive, offering concessions many thought he would try to use as bargaining chips at the meeting with Trump, including the prisoner release and decommissioning the test site.Foreign journalists will be invited to observe the shutdown of the facility where North Korea has tested several generations of nuclear weapons, “to ensure the transparency of discontinuance of the nuclear test”.“A ceremony for dismantling the nuclear test ground is now scheduled between May 23 and 25, depending on weather condition,” the report said.Correspondents from the United States, Britain, Russia, China and South Korea will be flown in a special charter flight from Beijing to the newly expanded resort town of Wonsan, then take a special train to the remote test site in an “uninhabited deep mountain area” near the northern border. They will sleep and eat on board the train, but a press centre will be set up so they can “transmit … about dismantlement of the test ground which they have covered on the spot”."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3486846.1525704399!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"overcome by the pong of a pine marten den count yourself lucky","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tPine marten: the distinctive smell of its scat is often described as like that of Parma violets. Illustration: Michael VineyA friend who lives on a windy hilltop, in a house nestled in trees, called to tell of a strange smell in her woodshed. There was something, perhaps, going on in one corner, behind a pile of tools. She had glimpsed a furry tail.This is the season when furry animals have babies – and a leafy hilltop adjoining conifer forestry made the pine marten, notorious for siting its nursery in attics and sheds, the likely candidate.A listen at the door was rewarded by sounds of mewing from the corner, as of kittens. The scatter of droppings on the floor matched that of Martes martes, or the Irish cat crainn. We retreated, happy that Ireland’s rarest mammal, long in slow revival after centuries of decline, was staking out a new domain above the western shore.What might have clinched the matter was the distinctive smell of the scat, so often described as like that of Parma violets, even by people without great experience either of the flower or of the scented English sweet of the same name.As a connoisseur of the musky, unmistakable aroma of otter spraint – sampled from the greenest, best-fertilised tufts of grass on stream banks – I was quite looking forward to a new olfactory experience. The overwhelming fragrance of the shed, however, was that of Jeyes Fluid, my friend being one of many householders repelled by the alternative odour, redolent of violets or not.I did not have to go far online, indeed, to find a blog complaining of “having to move downstairs” to escape the pong of a pine-marten den in a roof space. So mixed, indeed, are responses to these intrusions that the Vincent Wildlife Trust has put a special leaflet online: The Pine Marten in Ireland: A Guide for Householders. It could be prudent reading for people now returning to their rural holiday houses.The shortage of natural den sites in Ireland (notably in trees old enough to have big holes) has made houses and sheds attractive to female martens seeking seasonal warmth and safety. They are a long-protected species, and will abandon their kits if disturbed.The two or three young themselves will want to play by night – martens are largely nocturnal. So their noisy skittering on bedroom ceilings can be unwelcome. But from March to July, action to evict a family could bring prosecution under the Wildlife Act.The Vincent trust readily admits that martens “do not make good house guests” and urges proofing the house against invasion. But the animals are superlative climbers and can squeeze through gaps as big as their head (5cm for females).A second leaflet, supported by the National Parks and Wildlife Service, addresses more of the martens’ misbehaviours. How to eExclude Pine Martens from Game and Poultry Pens describes in detail electric fencing to protect the gun clubs’ pheasant chicks and ways of making a henhouse martenproof.All this may stir questions about what pine martens are “good for” and reinforce the wilder concerns for newborn lambs and babies left out in their prams. The predatory diet of this much-abused native mammal includes neither (except, at times, bits of dead lamb) and embraces even frogs, snails, beetles and blackberries. More helpfully to humans, it is a control on rodent populations and its hunting of rats and mice, bank vole and white-toothed shrew extends even to grey squirrels.This, as recent Irish research has shown, can help restore numbers of the native red squirrel. The red is lighter and more agile, and can retreat to the far ends of branches, while the bigger grey also spends more time on the ground and is easier to catch.This study, carried out in Co Wicklow woods by Dr Emma Sheehy of the University of Aberdeen, found the fur of grey squirrels, but not of reds, in marten scats. It has had wide attention in Britain, where restoration of the marten in Scotland, Wales and northern England and conservation of red squirrels are priorities.In Ireland, meanwhile, the research has been intensive, including genetic study of DNA from marten hairs left in sticky tubes baited with raw chicken. This helped the large-scale assessment of the marten population published last year by the National Parks and Wildlife Service.Led by Dr Declan O’Mahony of Northern Ireland’s Agri-Food and Biosciences Institute, the report identified 134 inidual martens at sites spread across the island, with an average low density of about one animal per square kilometre of forest. Combining this with other data, the total population in Ireland was estimated at 3,043. This confirmed the pine marten as a settled and stable resident, but still one of the rarest mammals in Ireland."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Ecologist Matt Hodd (42) who founded local poetry event had last been seen near riverNational Lottery says winner of year\u0026rsquos biggest sum so far bought ticket in west of IrelandThomas Doherty (27) found dead in Crawford Square area on Saturday morningSpeakers decry \u0026lsquolitany of falsehoods\u0026rsquo as they urge retention for Eighth AmendmentAirline says complications following an aircraft change meant four fans left behindSimon Harris says he would like to see Irish laboratories screening smear testsArchbishop of Dublin expresses his sadness at the tragic death\u0026lsquoThis is not a vote of Yes or No . . . it\u0026rsquos whether we want to make healthcare safe and regulated\u0026rsquoIreland is likely to support UK proposal at EU summitNew awards to recognise respect, loyalty, selflessness, courage and integrity of membersInvestigation underway after blaze breaks out in early hours of Saturday morning\u0026lsquoI find a serious sense of healing in it and a connectedness to those who have gone\u0026rsquoCalls returned after check on records, data quality, and linking with health professionals \u0026ndash HSECoffee keeps the Salthill crowds going but there\u0026rsquos no sign of Ed SheeranHSE director-general\u0026rsquos final months in office marred by multiple controveriesNo side claim Facebook and Google announcements are the result of Yes lobbyingWoman put on 15-month waiting list because of clear test despite \u0026lsquoserious symptoms\u0026rsquoRelatives from top 10 countries, including Syria and Iraq, are eligibleFurther accountability needed in cervical screening crisis, says Government"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3492319.1526069967!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"200 000 people to participate in annual darkness into light event","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t More than 10,000 people turned out for Darkness into Light in the Phoenix Park, Dublin last year. File photograph: Sasko LazarovPhotocallAn estimated 200,000 people will take part in the annual Darkness Into Light fundraising event in the early hours of Saturday morning. This “contagion of hope” as it has been billed attracted 400 people to the first event in 2009. Now in its 10th year, it will embrace thousands of dawn walkers in 180 venues across the Ireland and worldwide.The first Darkness Into Light event this year will take place in Wellington and Christchurch, New Zealand. Most events overseas will be run by Irish emigrants or those of Irish extraction living abroad. Darkness Into Light is Pieta House’s biggest fundraising appeal and raises more than €4 million to operate its services. Each person participating pays €25 to do the walk. Pieta House offers counselling for those who are thinking of suicide and also consolation to families who have lost somebody to suicide. The event begins in darkness at 4.15am, as thousands of people walk a 5 kilometre route while dawn is breaking. Funds raised from Darkness Into Light help keep Pieta House’s counselling services free for those in need of help.Pieta House chief executive Brian Higgins has ascribed the popularity of the event to the ubiquity of suicide in society. Some 399 people took their own lives in 2016. It is estimated that each suicide directly affects 130 people and so 50,000 people every year are impacted by these deaths. The cumulative impact over the year, he says, is that everybody knows somebody who has died by suicide or knows somebody affected by it. “I think we have generated a conversation about suicide and some of the causes of suicide,” he said. “There are so many people who are touched by it and the public are engaged on the issue.“Thanks to the generosity of all our participants and supporters, all of our services remain free, but the demand for them is ever-increasing. We all need to wake up to the stigmas that lead people to the point of self-harm or suicidal crisis and subsequently to the doors of Pieta House to seek help.”The biggest gathering will be in Dublin’s Phoenix Park where it all began in 2009. An estimated 14,000 people are expected to gather there for the walk from Chesterfield Avenue into the light. It looks like it is going to be dry across the country for the walks though showers will be heavy across the country on Saturday afternoon.

Irish support for her “customs partnership” proposal will be forthcoming only if she faces down the hard Brexiteers in her cabinet. Photograph: Tolga Akmentolga AkmenAFPGetty ImagesThe Government expects British prime minister Theresa May to push ahead with proposals for a new “customs partnership” which it believes could pave the way for a soft Brexit, and which Dublin will support at next month’s European Union summit.The  understands the British government has told Dublin about the proposals, and the Government is likely to back Ms May at the summit.However, Irish support will be forthcoming only if Ms May faces down the hard Brexiteers in her cabinet and her government shows progress on a common understanding of the border “backstop”, the commitment to maintain an open border even without agreement.Downing Street has told Dublin it has problems with the backstop, but that Ms May’s proposals on a customs partnership would lessen the importance of the arrangement.Government sources agree that the potency of the backstop would be decreased and that it would become “less important” for Ms May if she put forward a customs proposal. It would make it “less offensive” to the DUP, which supports Ms May’s government.While further work would be needed on any customs proposal – even if Ms May gets it through her cabinet – it would “point to a direction of travel” from the UK government of where it wants to go, say sources. It would not be “a solution in itself”.The proposal would see British officials collect tariffs on behalf of the EU for any goods coming to the UK that were subsequently destined for an EU member state. The EU has already rejected this model, and a willingness to look afresh – even if it only “provides the basis” for future talks, according to one source – will be seen as a softening of the Irish and EU position. Earlier this week, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said of Ms May’s customs proposal: “The view of the EU is that it isn’t workable in its current form but it is something that perhaps we could make workable.”The backstop – which would ensure no ergence in customs and trade rules between the Republic and Northern Ireland without agreed solutions on how to avoid a hard border – was agreed in principle in December, although the UK has rejected the EU’s legal interpretation of it.However, in tandem with the customs proposal, the British government must “at a minimum” table its own interpretation of the backstop in the weeks before the June summit.It was further argued that the tabling of a customs proposal would make it easier for the backstop to “go green” – be agreed – and this would “leave space for the legal experts” to iron out the details over the summer.In effect, the mooted move would mean the EU taking Ms May’s proposal seriously in order to help her agree to the backstop. Senior Government figures believe the DUP’s priority is now that the North should be treated no differently to the rest of Britain, even if this means staying in a UK-wide customs partnership which would replicate many of the features of the customs union.DUP leader Arlene Foster has said Northern Ireland must move in “lockstep” with the rest of the UK.Although Ms May has said she could not accept the EU’s interpretation of the backstop, the Government is adamant the fallback option must be included in any Brexit deal. “We still need the backstop,” said a senior Government source."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3493531.1526160235!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"winning ticket for 8 5m lotto jackpot sold in co galway","story":"There was one winning ticket in Saturday’s lotto jackpot, which was worth more than €8.5 million.The National Lottery said the lucky ticket was sold Co Galway.The winning numbers were 5, 6, 14, 19, 22, and 30, with the bonus number 24.It is the biggest National Lottery win of the year so far.In January, a Dublin family syndicate collected a €38.9 million jackpot in the EuroMillions draw.

File photograph: Airbus Defense \u0026 Space38 NorthPleiades CNESSpot Image via APNorth Korea said it will hold a “ceremony” for the dismantling of its nuclear test site from May 23rd-25th in what would be a dramatic but symbolic event to set up leader Kim Jong-un’s summit with US president Donald Trump next month.North Korea’s foreign ministry said all of the tunnels at the country’s northeastern testing ground would be destroyed by explosion, and that observation and research facilities and ground-based guard units would also be removed.Pyongyang said it planned to invite journalists from the US, South Korea, China, Russia and Britain to inspect the process.Mr Kim had revealed plans to shut down the nuclear test site during his summit with South Korean president Moon Jae-in last month.Following the meeting, Mr Moon’s office said Mr Kim was willing to disclose the process to international experts, but the North’s statement on Saturday did not include any mention about allowing experts on the site.The announcement came days after Washington said that the summit between Mr Kim and Mr Trump would be held on June 12th in Singapore. Seoul, which shuttled between Washington and Pyongyang to set up the Trump-Kim meeting, has said Mr Kim has genuine interest in dealing away his nuclear weapons in return for economic benefits.However, there are lingering doubts about whether Mr Kim would ever agree to fully relinquish the weapons he probably views as his only guarantee of survival.Mr Kim declared his nuclear force as complete in December, following the country’s most powerful nuclear test to date in September and also three flight tests of intercontinental ballistic missiles designed to reach the US mainland.At a ruling party meeting last month, North Korea had already announced that it has suspended all tests of nuclear devices and missiles and the plan to close the nuclear testing ground.North Korea has invited the outside world to witness the dismantling of its nuclear facilities before.In June 2008, international broadcasters were allowed to air the demolishing of a cooling tower at the Nyongbyon reactor site, a year after the North reached an agreement with the US and four other nations to disable its nuclear facilities in return for an aid package. – AP"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3490565.1526048208!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit and ireland the border is a sideshow if you re an eel","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tAttempts to conserve the Irish branch of the European eel have been complicated by BrexitThe autumn spawning migration of the European eel (s. Anguilla anguilla) to the Sargasso Sea is one of the great animal migrations.It is an arduous 6,500km journey from Europe’s inland waterways for the seriously endangered species which is threatened by historic overfishing and the degradation and loss of its habitats due to land reclamation, the construction of dams and reductions in water quality.And now attempts to conserve the Irish branch of the family have been, at the very least, complicated by, of all things, Brexit, their fate tied to the prospects for maintaining a frictionless border between North and South on the Erne river at Ballyshannon.The decline of eel stocks in Lough Erne, where commercial fishing has been halted, has been attributed in part to the attrition of both elvers entering the river from the Atlantic and of developed silver eels descending from Lough Erne through the turbines of the ESB hydroelectric power station.The EU requires member states to develop eel management plans and to take measures to ensure that at least 40 per cent of adult eels can escape from inland waters to the sea where they spawn. On the Erne that has meant the seasonal deployment of lorries with aerated water tanks to transport trapped live eels around the turbines.The protection of the eel is just one of 142 areas of North-South co-operation that are underpinned by joint obligations to EU regulations and to the Belfast Agreement, and which form a key part of the Irish strand of the Brexit discussions.They are a measure of the complex interdependence of both the cross-Border relationship and the scale and scope of the talks process.For the most part there is no question of the UK wishing to repudiate any of programmes that range from environmental projects to cross-Border hospitals, but EU negotiators and their UK counterparts have to work on legal language to copperfasten their post-Brexit future.The eels – provisions for safeguarding the EU’s management plan and regulating the cross-Border transport of live animals – will have their special place in Annex 2.8 of the Irish protocol to the Brexit orce deal, the Withdrawal Agreement, currently being discussed by the two sides.Discussions about the controversial Border “backstop” – an agreement would fully align Northern Ireland with the rules of the EU to avoid a hard border – have tended to catch the headlines and eclipse what can seem the more humdrum but nevertheless vital issues.As the protocol makes clear, however, the range and detail of the discussions is huge – as well as ensuring free trade in goods, the protocol says it shall also “be implemented and applied so as to maintain the necessary conditions for continued North-South co-operation, including in the areas of environment, health, agriculture, transport, education and tourism, as well as energy, telecommunications, broadcasting, inland fisheries, justice and security, higher education and sport”.Guaranteeing many of these, Irish officials stress, is also dependent on unhindered movement across the Border – the necessity for a Border deal permeates the entire protocol.It also contains provisions to safeguard the Common Travel Area between the Republic of Ireland and the UK, for joint citizenship provisions for Northern Ireland, and to “respect the constitutional status of Northern Ireland and the principle of consent”.It requires the UK to guarantee that there is “no diminution of rights” caused by its departure from the EU, including in the area of protection against forms of discrimination enshrined in EU law.The Irish protocol currently runs to eight pages of the 129-page Withdrawal Agreement, which is now being turned into legal treaty language.The challenge EU leaders have set themselves is to complete broad agreement on the treaty text by June, so that it can be finalised by October and then be put to member states and the European Parliament for ratification ahead of the UK’s departure at the end of March, 2019.The Withdrawal Agreement contains the agreement on transition, or the “implementation period” as the UK calls it, and, like the rest of the text, it stands or falls on agreement on the whole package, including the Irish protocol.The important parallel discussions now under way on the “future relationship” between the EU and UK, essentially the future trading relationship, are also conditional on no “backsliding” on the agreements made in December in the “Joint Report” between the EU and UK which is reflected in the Withdrawal Agreement.Brussels and Dublin are adamant that unless the UK honours its commitment to the “backstop” provision of that December agreement, the future relationship talks will stop and the Withdrawal Agreement and the transition deal will be put in jeopardy.Those talks are set to produce a political outline of a future trading relationship which will be approved with the Withdrawal Agreement, although not having the same legal standing. A trade treaty can be agreed only once the UK is no longer an EU member-state.The Withdrawal Agreement text is colour-coded to reflect different stages of agreement – currently 15 per cent of the protocol is in green, effectively agreed, 37 per cent remains in yellow, on which there is political agreement on objectives but not on drafting, and 47 per cent is white or uncoloured, unagreed. There is much still to do.Most of the protocol white text reflects how the EU sees the operation of the “backstop” arrangement – the Border fallback guarantee should the UK prove unable to come up with and agree with the EU-preferred scenario for preventing a hard border.The Withdrawal Agreement text on safeguarding human rights post-Brexit remains in yellow – the UK is understood to accept in principle that there should be “no diminution of rights, safeguards and equality of opportunity” in the North. However, the language proposed by the commission remains problematic, and the full enumeration of such rights in the annex to the treaty protocol has yet to be agreed.The range of these rights goes well beyond the issues of discrimination, equality and identity that are traditionally seen as central to the conflict – gender rights legislation, for example, or carers’ rights, or family law arrangements, including custody and maintenance issues, may have their roots in EU legislation.Although most of such regulations will be incorporated automatically into UK law by means of the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill, campaigners in the North worry over the abandonment by the UK of obligations under the EU’s Charter of Fundamental Rights.“The EU Charter acts as an important constitutional safeguard underpinning human rights protections in Northern Ireland and its removal weakens the quality and range of human rights protections available here,” the Northern Ireland Human Rights Consortium warns.The EU’s protocol text proposes that “The United Kingdom shall continue to facilitate the related work of the institutions and bodies set up pursuant to the 1998 Agreement, including the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission, the Equality Commission for Northern Ireland and the Joint Committee of representatives of the Human Rights Commissions of Northern Ireland and Ireland, in upholding human rights and equality standards.”Irish officials are said to be concerned at the lack of specific commitments to ringfence such funding.Other non-Border issues such as UK adherence to EU “state aid” rules – to prevent unfair competition through state subsidies – and the challenge of customs-free “transit” for Irish lorries and goods across the UK to EU markets also remain unagreed.Although not mentioned in the Irish protocol, and in theory an issue for the post-Brexit future relationship talks, because it is an issue of specific concern to Ireland and not other member-states, Irish officials are keen to see the issue taken up in the Irish talks strand.The UK signalled as far back as last August that it is willing to sign up to membership of the Common Transit Convention to facilitate the transit trade in both directions, and there are precedents using seals on lorries. But there are concerns at how the Irish lorries will be able to bypass potentially long customs queues at ports such as Dover.

The helicopter will have twin, counter-rotating blades which will power through the thin Martian atmosphere at almost 3,000 rpm – about 10 times the rate of a helicopter on Earth.The helicopter has solar cells to charge its lithium-ion batteries, and a heating mechanism to keep it warm through the cold Martian nights.“The altitude record for a helicopter flying here on Earth is about 40,000 feet. The atmosphere of Mars is only one per cent that of Earth, so when our helicopter is on the Martian surface, it’s already at the Earth equivalent of 100,000 feet up,” said Mimi Aung, Mars Helicopter project manager.“To make it fly at that low atmospheric density, we had to scrutinize everything, make it as light as possible while being as strong and as powerful as it can possibly be.”Controllers on Earth will command the Mars Helicopter, through a system of commands send from the ground, rather than a real-time joystick.The full 30-day flight test campaign will include up to five flights of incrementally farther flight distances, up to a few hundred meters, and longer durations as long as 90 seconds. On its first flight, the helicopter will make a short vertical climb to 10 feet, where it will hover for about 30 seconds.Please review our commenting policyBomber Command veterans call for their comrades to be honoured with a full campaign medalOne in three nurses do not have time to carry out basic patient careRich list: record number of women among the 1,000 wealthiest people in Britain Paris terror attack: Knifeman shot dead by police after killing one and injuring fourThe Queen\u0026#39s official approval of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle\u0026#39s marriage transcribed on vellumDennis Nilsen, Britain\u0026#39s second worst serial killer, dies in prison aged 72Meghan Markle profile: The actress, blogger, yoga-lover - and breath of fresh air for the British Royal family Royal wedding 2018: Schedule and timings for Harry and Meghan\u0026#39s big dayHow to watch Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s royal wedding on TV next weekPrince Harry and Meghan Markle: Royal wedding details and latest newsRussia Today will not lose licence over nerve agent attack in Salisbury, Ofcom rulesTories battle image problem in fight to capture youth voteMillions of dogs threatened by rise of \u0026#39anti-vax\u0026#39 pills made from diseased flesh sold online, warns RSPCANewsagents and corner shops to sell \u0026#39porn pass\u0026#39 access code to allow adults to visit X-rated sitesWife \u0026#39not informed\u0026#39 husband was dying just yards away in GP surgeryBritain\u0026#39s Got Talent, episode 5: a new Paul Potts emerges and Alesha hits her golden buzzer for familiar faceRoyal wedding guest list: Who did Meghan Markle and Prince Harry invite?Comment: Is it wise to legalise euthanasia in a culture that has such a low opinion of disability?Jake Gyllenhaal and Bradley Cooper go head to head in rival Bernstein films We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":null,"title":"watch prince harry meghan markles royal wedding tv next week","story":"There\u0027s not long to go until Prince Harry and Meghan Markle\u0027s royal wedding. The invitations have been dispatched, the cake is being iced and the final flouishes are being added to the wedding gown. For everyone else, cushions must be plumped and snacks must be sourced.As with previous royal weddings and milestone celebrations, you can expect hours of television coverage streamed live from the lawns of Windsor Castle and the heights of St George\u0027s Chapel nave. This wedding will go beyond the heights of Suits, in which Ms Markle stars, or The Crown. There will be as much tradition and pomp as any drama or history series ever needed. Expect cheering crowds in any weather packing the pavements of Windsor and thousands celebrating in their local communities at street parties across the nation. To make sure you catch every second on TV - including the dizzying spectacle of the FA Cup Final which falls on the same day - read on.  Not long to go... Prince Harry and Meghan Markle on the day they announced their engagementThe Prince and Ms Markle are set to be married on Saturday, 19 May. Clear your diary.The hour-long ceremony will begin at 12:00pm sharp at St George’s Chapel in Windsor, but expect several hours of TV coverage first as the excitement and anticipation builds.The service, conducted by the Dean of Windsor, will end around 1pm when Prince Harry and Ms Markle have taken their vows - officiated by The Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby.Yes, you\u0027ll be able to catch all the action from your sofa. The wedding and procession will be televised live on networks around the world. A single pool camera will capture the nuptials so many channels will be able to broadcast it. In the UK, the BBC, Sky News and ITV will cover the day with big-name presenters.The BBC broadcast will be anchored by Huw Edwards, Kirsty Young and Dermot O\u0027Leary from the grounds of Windsor Castle. The cameras will roll from Saturday morning, as Young and O\u0027Leary cover the build-up from the castle\u0027s moat, whilst newsreader Edwards presents from the equally spectacular roof of the Windsor Guard Room.They will be supported by a team of roaming presenters including The One Show\u0027s Alex Jones and former Strictly Come Dancing champion Ore Oduba, who will capture the excitement on the ground. The BBC has announced that a television licence will not be needed to watch the wedding, allowing communities to screen the event at street parties and gatherings.  ITV\u0027s output will be presented by Phillip Schofield and Julie Etchingham, using a purpose-built studio in Windsor, and Sky News will be in Windsor as well, making sure no angle is missed.Live coverage of the ceremony will be broadcast on big screens around the UK, including in Belfast, Salisbury, Leeds, Swansea, Winchester and Portsmouth.It\u0027s highly unlikely that we\u0027ll catch a glimpse of the two wedding receptions. They are private events for guests only. Prince William and his wife Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, travel to Buckingham Palace, after their wedding ceremony at Westminster Abbey in London, 2011As Harry and Meghan will enter the chapel at 12:00 B.S.T, North American viewers will have an early start if they want to catch the action live.   The first footage will be available from CBS\u0027 This Morning, which airs at 4:00 E.S.T (1:00 PT). NBC takes its entire Today show to Windsor for their coverage beginning at 4:30 E.S.T (1:30 PT), and ABC News and Good Morning America will begin at 5:00 E.S.T (2.00 PT).Meanwhile, BBC America will broadcast a live simulcast of the UK\u0027s BBC One from 4:15 E.S.T (1:15 PT), and HBO begins their live coverage at the more accommodating time of 7:15 E.S.T (4:30 PT). All of these American broadcasters are set to provide online and mobile coverage of the big day,  but ensure you are a paid subscriber to watch BBC America or HBO.Another alternative is to find one of almost 200 cinema screenings across the US for a 10am (local time) screening of ITV\u0027s broadcast, only a few hours after the events unfold in Windsor. Canadian\u0027s can turn to national broadcaster CBC from 4:00 E.S.T (1:00 PT) for live coverage, or opt to follow their live CBC News blog with updates from the goings-on at Windsor. Whist CBC\u0027s World Report radio programme will air from 6:00 E.S.T (3:00 PT) for a special royal wedding breakfast edition.On the opposite side of the globe, New Zealanders can tune-in from 22:30 for TVNZ\u0027s simulcast of BBC One for the ceremony set to begin at 23:00 Wellington-time. The national broadcaster will also show a highlights package the next day, for anyone wanting an early night.     Australian\u0027s have a choice of ABC, Seven, SBS, and Nine for Aussie-led coverage from Windsor, or a BBC One simulcast via Foxtel, all kicking-off between 19:00 and 19:30 AEST.The wedding at Windsor will be streamed straight to online streaming services, news sites, and mobile apps.Head to BBC iPlayer or ITV Hub for a live online broadcast in the UK (with a TV licence), or CBSN Live and ABC News in the US.    Windsor Castle from the airThe FA Cup finalfalls on the same day as the royal wedding. The game between Chelsea and Manchester United will kick-off at 17:15 BST on BBC One, so football-loving royalists can have their cake and eat it. However the BBC\u0027s one-off TV licence dispensation does not apply to the FA Cup final, so find a screen somewhere near to your royal wedding celebrations.    Prince William, the Duke of Cambridge, usually attends the final and presents the cup to the winning captain in his role as Football Association president. However, he will miss the event this year to fulfil his role as Prince Harry\u0027s best man.You can expect the wedding to attract a large audience in the UK and abroad. About 27 million Brits and 23 million Americans watched the wedding of Prince William and Kate Middleton in 2011.The BBC\u0027s coverage of William and Kate\u0027s wedding attracted 67.2 per cent of the television audience share that day, attracting 18.7 million viewers to BBC One during the ceremony. More than  a million people used BBC iPlayer to watch the coverage.In 2011, the BBC had faced intense criticism for choosing Huw Edwards to anchor the presenting team rather than more seasoned royal broadcasters such as David Dimbleby. They were also criticised for using Fearne Cotton to provide coverage from outside Buckingham Palace.WATCH: How Diana, the in-laws and Prince Louis will fit into the Royal WeddingAs excitement builds before the wedding day, a host of broadcasters will deploy in-depth documentaries and extended Harry and Meghan coverage.ITV have already aired a one-off feature entitled Invitation to a Royal Wedding.

It is said to have become a very special place for the couple in their relationship so far. The Lord Chamberlain\u0027s Office at Buckingham Palace is responsible for organising royal weddings, but Harry and Ms Markle are leading the show. However, under the guidance of Harry\u0027s private secretary, Edward Lane Fox, the Lord Chamberlain\u0027s Office is dealing with the ceremonial aspects of the day.The service will begin at 12pm.The core aspects of the wedding, including the church service, associated music, flowers, decorations and reception, will be paid for by the Royal Family, with Ms Markle’s parents both set to attend.Copy of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle: The story of their relationship, in picturesFormer Suits star Ms Markle told last year how she could not wait to say yes to the prince when Harry got down on one knee as they cooked a roast chicken dinner at his home, Nottingham Cottage in the grounds of Kensington Palace.Indicating the depths of his feeling for his bride-to-be, the prince revealed in a television interview: It was this beautiful woman just sort of literally tripped and fell into my life, I fell into her life.Invitations have been posted to 600 lucky guests, with a select 200 close friends invited to an after party at Frogmore House, Windsor. The couple do not have an official list of political leaders on the guest list which means neither Prime Minister Theresa May or US President Donald Trump will be going, and former US President Barack Obama has also missed out. Royal sources said the guest list will be restricted to those who have a direct relationship with the couple, and was taken both because St George’s Chapel is relatively small, and because the prince is not in the direct line of succession.As well a dress code, the Royal guest list also reportedly includes \u0027critical guidance\u0027for the big day. The instructions ban cameras and bulky bags, adding that guests will be asked to surrender mobile telephones\u0085 and any devices used for image capture.They further specify that guests should not wear medals, in a list of suggestions about accessories that includes: No swords.Some members of the public have received an invitation to wait in the grounds outside the chapel to watch the bride and groom and their wedding guests arrive and leave.Read more about who they are here.Invitations for Prince Harry and Meghan Markle\u0026#39s wedding in MayOther guests will include members of Ms Markle\u0027s family - her mother Doria Radlan and father Thomas Markle Snr - and of course many members of the royal family.Tennis star Serena Williams and Ms Markle\u0027s former Suits co-stars Sarah Rafferty, Patrick J Adams and Wendell Pierce could also be on the list.The invitations were produced by Barnard \u0026amp Westwood, which has held the Royal Warrant for Printing \u0026amp Bookbinding by Appointment to Her Majesty The Queen since 1985.Die-stamped in gold and then burnished, the invitation features The Three Feather Badge of The Prince of Wales. They also reveal that the dress code is Uniform, Morning Coat or Lounge Suit, or Day Dress with Hat.Prince William and Prince Harry in borrowed policemen outfitsThe Duke of Cambridge will be Harry\u0027s best man, missing the FA Cup final to be at his brother\u0027s side.The Duke, who has always been the front-runner for the supporting role at the May wedding, is honoured to have been asked, Kensington Palace said.Prince George and Princess Charlotte look almost certain to be page boy and flower girl. The siblings already know the score - they performed those roles at the wedding of Pippa Middleton, the Duchess of Cambridge\u0027s younger sister, to James Matthews in May last year.  Kensington Palace has announced that Ms Markle will have no adult bridesmaids \u0027because she\u0027s unable to choose between her friends\u0027, and will instead be surrounded by children as page boys, bridesmaids and flower girls.Jessica Mulroney and Meghan Markle in 2016Friends including Jessica Mulroney, Misha Noo Lindsay Roth, Benita Litt, Janina Gavankar and Priyanka Chopra are expected to be seen as part of the congregation.Bookmakers suspended betting on the designer of Ms Markle\u0027s wedding dress in March when British couture company Ralph \u0026amp Russo pulled ahead to become 13 favourites.The label, helmed by Australians Tamara Ralph and Michael Russo (a couple in real life) have shot to prominence after a string of celebrity endorsements.In 2014, Angelina Jolie wore the label to Buckingham Palace to receive an honorary damehood, in 2016 Gwyneth Paltrow to the Oscars. Add to that list of fans Beyonce, Rihanna and, finally, Meghan Markle herself, who chose a £56,000 embellished couture gown for the official photos taken to mark her engagement to Prince Harry.Before betting was suspended, London-based designer Erdem was at 31. Ms Markle\u0027s stylist and close friend Ms Mulroney runs a bridal store in Toronto was said to have helped the bride choose her gown.Read more about Ralph and Russo here.The couple will be making their vows at St George\u0027s Chapel, which last hosted a royal wedding in May 2008 when Peter Phillips - son of The Princess Royal - married Autumn Kelly. Prince Edward also wed Sophie, the Countess of Wessex, there in June 1999.  The traditional ceremony will be conducted by The Dean of Windsor, The Rt Revd. David Conner while the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, will officiate as the couple make their marriage vows.Miss Markle, who was a UN women\u0027s advocate, is unlikely to opt to obey the prince. They will probably choose the Series One (1966) Book of Common Prayer ceremony, just as the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge did, which allows the bride to drop obey him and serve him from the religious proceedings.Harry also has to decide whether to wear a wedding ring. William does not wear one.The regiments Prince Harry served with in Afghanistan will also have a “special place” during the ceremony. Household Cavalry troopers will line the staircase at St George\u0027s Chapel, while streets within the precincts of the castle will be lined by members of the Windsor Castle Guard from 1st Battalion Irish Guards, and by Armed Forces personnel from the Royal Navy Small Ships and Diving, which has the Prince as Commodore-in-Chief, and the Royal Marines, where he is Captain General.The 3 Regiment Army Air Corps, where Prince Harry served as an Apache Pilot in Helmand Province, Afghanistan, will also be represented, as well as The Royal Gurkha Rifles, his comrades in Afghanistan in 2007, and RAF Honington, where he is Honorary Air Commandant.Read more about St George\u0027s Chapel here.WATCH: How Diana, the in-laws and Prince Louis will fit into the Royal WeddingAfter the ceremony, among the first people to congratulate the couple will be some of the 2,640 charity workers, community champions and local school children who are being invited to watch the wedding from inside the walls of Windsor Castle. Then at 1pm, the newlyweds will then undertake a two mile tour of Windsor greeting well-wishers.

The 180-ft long room, traditionally used for state banquets, seats up to 162 people and was redesigned in a modern Gothic style – with walls lined with suits of armour – following the fire at the castle in 1992.The second evening reception, for 200 close friends and family, will be thrown at Frogmore House by the Prince of Wales. Standing about half a mile south of Windsor Castle in Windsor Home Park, Frogmore House has been a Royal Residence since 1792. It is where Harry and Ms Markle posed for their official engagement photos in November.The location of the venue - away from the Castle - will offer the pair privacy as they celebrate with friends and family.Scant details have emerged about the receptions so far, but we do know that the couple have asked Claire Ptak, an east London pastry chef, to make an organic lemon and elderflower wedding cake.Kensington Palace said Ms Ptak, owner of the Violet Bakery in Hackney, will create a cake for the Royal wedding incorporating the bright flavours of spring.

But Ms Markle, who is an accomplished public speaker, is expected to break with tradition and deliver her own as well, offering “affectionate” praise of her new husband, thanks to the Queen and a few suitable jokes.The former actress, is “ready” to speak at the reception, should her father Thomas Markle choose to avoid the limelight, the Sunday Times reported earlier this year.Mr Markle, an award-winning Hollywood writing director who now lives a quiet life in Mexico, is expected to walk Ms Markle down the aisle, but may not make a formal speech.At the wedding of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, reception speeches included words from best man Prince Harry, the groom’s father the Prince of Wales and Michael Middleton, who affectionately described how he knew his daughter’s relationship was serious when her boyfriend landed a helicopter in his garden.Meghan Markle and her mother, Doria Radlan at the Invictus GamesIn February, one of the five original Spice Girls Mel B hinted that the Spice Girls were expected to reunite for the Royal wedding. The singer, known to fans as Scary Spice, claimed she had received a proper invitation during an appearance on a television chat show.Fellow Spice Girl Victoria Beckham also appeared to let slip she was attending the big day during an appearance on The Late, Late Show with James Corden earlier in April. Asked if she would be among the guests, she said: I, uh, I, I don\u0027t know...However, it has recently been reported that the Spice Girls have no plans to perform at the wedding, and have not been rehearsing for the event.Victoria and her husband David were invited to the 2011 royal wedding. Prince Harry with the Spice Girls in 1997Ms Markle will become an HRH and a senior royal after marrying Harry. She is also expected to become a duchess, as Kate Middleton did when she became the Duchess of Cambridge after saying her vows in 2011.By tradition, male members of the Royal family receive a title from the monarch on their wedding day, and the vacant title Duke of Sussex is regarded as the most likely choice for the Prince, meaning Ms Markle would become HRH The Duchess of Sussex.Like Prince Harry, the previous Duke of Sussex lived at Kensington Palace, and he also married for love, rather than choosing brides who fitted the traditional royal mould.Read more about royal titles here.Prince William and his wife Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, outside Westminster Abbey on their wedding day in 2011The wedding is on a Saturday, so there will be no new bank holiday declared.Although the public were given a day off to celebrate the weddings of Prince Charles to Diana Spencer in 1981, Prince William to Catherine Middleton in 2011, and Princess Anne to Mark Phillips in 1973, no such national holidays were awarded for Prince Andrew or Prince Edward.However, it\u0027s not all bad news because pubs and bars will be allowed to do away with the usual curbs on opening hours on the wedding weekend. Ministers plan to extend licensing hours across Britain to allow venues to remain open until 1am on the nights of Friday 18 and Saturday 19 May - which is also the day of the FA Cup final.There will also be lots of street parties planned across the UK.

The southern African nation is best known among travellers for the enormous Sossusvlei sand dunes of the the Namib Desert, but reports suggest that the couple are looking instead at a safari trip to Hoanib Valley Camp in the country\u0027s north west.Botswana, where they holidayed in the early days of their whirlwind relationship, is also a good bet, (Ms Markle\u0027s engagement ring features diamonds from Diana\u0027s personal collection, and a stone from Botswana), but wherever they go, the newlyweds will be looking for seclusion away from the limelight as they start their married life together.Other destinations could include Tuscany, Hawaii, Turkey and the Philippines.Read more about the honeymoon options here.Prince Harry and Meghan MarkleRoyal Wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan MarkleBomber Command veterans call for their comrades to be honoured with a full campaign medalOne in three nurses do not have time to carry out basic patient careRich list: record number of women among the 1,000 wealthiest people in Britain Paris terror attack: Knifeman shot dead by police after killing one and injuring fourThe Queen\u0026#39s official approval of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle\u0026#39s marriage transcribed on vellumDennis Nilsen, Britain\u0026#39s second worst serial killer, dies in prison aged 72Meghan Markle profile: The actress, blogger, yoga-lover - and breath of fresh air for the British Royal family Royal wedding 2018: Schedule and timings for Harry and Meghan\u0026#39s big dayHow to watch Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s royal wedding on TV next weekRussia Today will not lose licence over nerve agent attack in Salisbury, Ofcom rulesTories battle image problem in fight to capture youth voteMillions of dogs threatened by rise of \u0026#39anti-vax\u0026#39 pills made from diseased flesh sold online, warns RSPCANewsagents and corner shops to sell \u0026#39porn pass\u0026#39 access code to allow adults to visit X-rated sitesWife \u0026#39not informed\u0026#39 husband was dying just yards away in GP surgeryBritain\u0026#39s Got Talent, episode 5: a new Paul Potts emerges and Alesha hits her golden buzzer for familiar faceRoyal wedding guest list: Who did Meghan Markle and Prince Harry invite?Comment: Is it wise to legalise euthanasia in a culture that has such a low opinion of disability?Jake Gyllenhaal and Bradley Cooper go head to head in rival Bernstein films No Ring No Bring?

She inherited her position and stake in the company from her father Freddy Heineken when he died in 2002.She appears on the list alongside her husband, Citigroup banker Michel, 73, with a fortune of £11.1bn, up £1.8bn on last year. Her rise to the title of wealthiest woman in The Sunday Times Rich List has been attributed in part to the successful launch of a new alcohol-free beer.Topping the list this year is British-born industrialist Jim Ratcliffe, whose fortune stands at £21.05bn.Jim Ratcliffe: the billionaire who wants to arrest Britain\u0026#039s manufacturing declineThe 65-year-old, who is chairman and CEO of Ineos - Britain’s largest privately-owned company - bought a box in the Royal Albert Hall for a record £2.76m last year.Mr Ratcliffe is now worth £21.5bn, up from £15.3bn last year, which The Sunday Times says is mostly due to the newspaper having greater detail about the businessman\u0027s assets, adding £50m for two superyachts, hotel interests in The New Forest and a large property portfolio.Ineos sells more than 60m tons of chemicals annually for use in the packaging, food, construction, textile, white goods, and car manufacturing industries, employing over 18,500 staff.Jim Ratcliffe is among three Ineos names in the top 20Ineos\u0027s director Andy Currie and finance director John Reece shared in his fortunes, joining Mr Ratcliffe in the top 20, taking joint 16th place with fortunes of £7 billion each.The number of people who inherited their wealth has gone down, with 94 per cent of the rich list being comprised of self-made entrepreneurs.  Financier Ernesto Bertarelli and his wife Kirsty saw the biggest decrease in wealth, losing £1.48 billion due to falls in Ernesto\u0027s pharmaceutical company stakes, the list\u0027s author said.Among others whose fortunes have declined is Jamie Oliver, who no longer appears on the list, having closed a number of restaurants in the past year.Jamie Oliver is no longer on the listArcadia boss Sir Philip Green’s fortune has also dropped in wake of the collapse of BHS and a row over its pension schemes after he sold the business for just a £1 to a man twice declared bankrupt.Falling sales at his flagship brands Topshop and Miss Selfridge as well as his promise to contribute £363 million towards the pension deficit led to Sir Philip\u0027s fortune dropping by £787 million to £2 billion.At second place in the list were the Hinduja brothers, Sri and Gopi, worth £20.64 billion. Their fortune jumped by £4.44 billion on 2017, with their India-based car manufacturer Ashok Leyland and Mumbai-based IndusInd Bank having a particularly successful year.British-American industrialist-turned-media mogul Sir Len Blavatnik came in third place with £15.26 billion to his name.Jim Ratcliffe was at 18 on the list last year, but the compilers said this was down to the success of Ineos and the availibility of further detail on the business. Some of his wealth is in the form of two superyachts, hotel interests in The New Forest and a property portfolio.Mr Ratcliffe made his money in the chemicals industry as the founder of Ineos Group. He remains its chief executive  majority owner. His firm is currently locked in a legal battle with the Scottish government over its moratorium on fracking. The Hinduja brothers were first last yearThe Hinduja brothers have dropped one place after topping the list last year. But their fortune still jumped by £4.44 billion on 2017, with their India-based car manufacturer Ashok Leyland and Mumbai-based IndusInd Bank having a particularly successful year.The Hinduja group has investments in oil and gas, IT, energy, media, banking, property and healthcare.Sir Len Blavatnik, 60, was knighted this year for services to philanthropy. His recent donations include £50 million to fund the Tate Modern\u0027s new wing, and £5 million towards the Victoria and Albert Museum\u0027s new entrance, as well as funding the Blavatnik School of Government at Oxford University.He was second in the list last year. Sir Len made his money when he sold his stake in Russian oil company TNK-BP and as owner of Warner Music, as well as through investments. Simon (L) and David Reuben are brothersDropping one place form last year, brothers David and Simon Reuben made their money from property, metals and online business. They were born in Mumbai and raised in Britain. Lakshmi Mittal is chairman of ArcelorMittalAlso down one place is the steel magnate Lakshmi Mittal. He is chairman and CEO of the world\u0027s largest steelmaker ArcelorMittal. He was born in India and lives in London.The highest-placed woman on the list, Charlene de Carvalho-Heineken, and her husband Michel owe their fortunte to the Heineken beer dynasty.They have gone up the list, from 10th place last year.Granddaughter of the founder of Tetra Pak, Kirsten Rausing and brother Jorn own packaging company TetraLaval. They were in eighth position on 2017\u0027s rich list.Alisher Usmanov made his money in mining and investment. He has a stake in iron ore and steel giant Metalloinvest. He drops three places from fifth last year.The Irish-Canadian Weston family owe their fortune to the food and retail industry. They run supermarkets in Canada and also own a number of shops including department store Selfridges. The family were seventh in last year\u0027s list. Hugh Grosvenor, 27, is the country\u0027s youngest billionaire. He inherited the title of 7th Duke of Westminster when his father died two years ago.

The ceremony, which takes place on Saturday May 19, will be held in Windsor it will include two wedding receptions and a carriage procession, as well as the service.Prince Harry and Ms Markle have broken tradition by choosing to hold their wedding on a Saturday, as royal weddings usually take place during the week. The wedding of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge was held on a Friday and the wedding of the Prince of Wales and Diana, Princess of Wales was held on a Wednesday on both occasions the public were given an extra bank holiday.While Downing Street have said there are no plans to give Britons a day off for this year\u0027s royal nuptials, pubs and bars will be allowed to stay open until 1am on Friday May 18 and the day of the wedding itself.Amber Rudd, the former Home Secretary, opened a consultation on the plans in January. She said: “The Royal wedding will be a time of national celebration, and we want everyone to be able to make the most of such an historic occasion.“I hope that this relaxation of the licensing hours will allow people to extend their festivities and come together to mark what will be a very special moment for the country.”Here is everything you need to know about how the big day will unfold.WATCH:  How Diana, the in-laws and Prince Louis will fit into the Royal WeddingThe service will take place at St George’s Chapel in the grounds of Windsor Castle, which last hosted a royal wedding in May 2008 when Peter Phillips - son of The Princess Royal - married Autumn Kelly. Prince Edward also wed Sophie, the Countess of Wessex, there in June 1999 plus Prince Harry was christened there in 1984 by the Archbishop of Canterbury, Robert Runcie.Members of the public who have been invited to watch from the grounds of Windsor Castle will  begin to arrive from 9am.Guests will arrive between 9:30am and 11am by coach. Two driving routes have been suggested, with guests required to meet at the Windsor Farm Shop – founded in 2001 after the Duke of Edinburgh had an idea to support local businesses by selling produce.There, three miles away from the venue, guests will be put through security checks and asked to show identification they will then be ushered onto buses to travel to Windsor Castle, where they will alight at the castle\u0027s Round Tower and enter the chapel through the south door.Instructions reportedly sent to the guests ban cameras and bulky bags, adding that guests will be asked to surrender mobile telephones\u0085 and any devices used for image capture.The rules further specify that guests should not wear medals, in a list of suggestions about accessories that includes: No swords.At 11:20am, members of the Royal Family will arrive and enter the chapel through the Galilee Porch. Some will arrive in state car from the Royal Mews, including Bentleys, Rolls-Royces and Daimlers.A view of the Quire in St George\u0026#39s Chapel at Windsor Castle, where Prince Harry and Meghan Markle will have their wedding servicePrince Harry and his brother and best man the Duke of Cambridge are expected to arrive at the chapel\u0027s west steps at 11:45am. It is assumed they will enter the grounds on foot, giving Prince Harry the opportunity to walk past the crowds in the grounds. He will pass 200 representatives from charities he is associated with, who are expected to gather in the horseshoe cloister at the bottom of the steps.The Queen will be the final member of the Royal Family to arrive for the service, and is expected at 11:55am.The service will begin at 12pm, with Ms Markle due to arrive at the chapel\u0027s west steps at 11:59am.She has chosen her mother, Doria, to travel with her to the wedding, travelling from their overnight accommodation to St George’s Chapel by car. The decision breaks with UK tradition, which usually sees the bride travel with her father before he gives her away in the wedding ceremony.Instead, Ms Markle wanted to include both parents in her wedding day. When the car stops at the castle, her mother will exchange places with the bridesmaids and pageboys. Ms Ragland will enter the chapel by the Galilee Porch.The most beautiful royal wedding dresses of all timeMeghan\u0027s father will meet her at the chapel\u0027s west door, before walking her down the aisle.The traditional ceremony will be conducted by the Dean of Windsor, The Rt Revd. David Conner while the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, will officiate as the couple make their marriage vows. Under the guidance of Harry\u0027s private secretary, Edward Lane Fox, the Lord Chamberlain\u0027s Office is dealing with the ceremonial aspects of the day.It is assumed that Ms Markle is unlikely to opt to obey the prince and will probably choose the Series One (1966) Book of Common Prayer ceremony, just as the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge did. This allows the bride to drop the phrases obey him and serve him from the religious proceedings. Harry must decide whether to wear a wedding ring William does not wear one.The regiments Prince Harry served with in Afghanistan will also have a special place during the ceremony. Household Cavalry troopers will line the staircase at St George\u0027s Chapel, while streets within the precincts of the castle will be lined by members of the Windsor Castle Guard from 1st Battalion Irish Guards, and by Armed Forces personnel from the Royal Navy Small Ships and Diving, which has the Prince as Commodore-in-Chief, and the Royal Marines, where he is Captain General.The 3 Regiment Army Air Corps, where Prince Harry served as an Apache Pilot in Helmand Province, Afghanistan, will also be represented, as well as The Royal Gurkha Rifles, his comrades in Afghanistan in 2007, and RAF Honington, where he is Honorary Air Commandant.The service will end at 1pm and the newlyweds will leave the chapel at the west steps, before leaving the castle by carriage. Prince Harry and Ms Markle will be driven for two miles along Castle Hill, the High Street and into Windsor town centre before returning along the beautiful, tree-lined Long Walk for their reception.Kensington Palace has said: Prince Harry and Ms Markle are very much looking forward to this short journey which they hope will be a memorable moment for everyone who has gathered together in Windsor to enjoy the atmosphere of this special day.While we don\u0027t know for sure how long the procession will take, a similar procession in 1999 by Edward and Sophie took 15 minutes.The best photo opportunity will be the West Steps of St George’s Chapel, when the bride and groom and their families emerge after the service. If you are lucky enough to be in Windsor on the day, head for the grass of the Horseshoe Cloisters opposite those steps for the view.The Ascot Landau open carriage stands in the Royal Mews at Buckingham Palace in LondonThe newlyweds will make their journey through Windsor in an open-topped Ascot Landau carriage, Kensington Palace has confirmed. It is the same carriage Prince Harry used in the procession at the wedding of Prince William and Kate Middleton, when he was surrounded by small bridesmaids and page boys.Crown Equerry Colonel Toby Browne, who runs the royal mews where the carriage was selected, said: The fair weather option, the Ascot Landau, it was selected because it\u0027s a wonderfully bright, small, lovely carriage. Very easy for people to see, the passengers can sit up quite high - so there\u0027s lots of visibility for everybody.It was built in 1883, it\u0027s one of five that we have, most of them are down in Windsor, we always keep one in London for occasions.If it rains on the wedding day, the wet weather option is the Scottish State Coach. Built in 1830, a new top was created in 1969 with large windows and a partial glass roof, to allow spectators to see the passengers.Six horses, Windsor Greys, will be included the procession ride.A team of four, Milford Haven, Plymouth and father and son Storm and Tyrone, will pull the Landau and two others - Sir Basil and Londonderry - will be outriders.All have been involved in high profile events before, including the Spanish state visit last year, Royal Ascot, Trooping the Colour, the State Opening of Parliament and the Lord Mayor\u0027s Show. They will be waved off by members of both families and the congregation will leave the chapel to see the newlyweds leave, before going to St George\u0027s Hall for the lunchtime reception hosted by the Queen.While Prince Harry and Meghan Markle are touring Windsor, guests from the congregation will wait for the happy couple in St George\u0027s Hall to celebrate the first of the day\u0027s two receptions.

Half a mile away from Windsor Castle, the 17th century Grade I country house is owned by the Crown Estate and is part of the Frogmore Estate on the ground of the Home Park.Prince Harry and Ms Markle\u0027s engagement photos were taken in the grounds of Frogmore House. The images were taken by photographer Alexi Lubomirski, who has also been chosen to take the photographs on the wedding day. Lubomirski, the British-born son of Peruvian-English mother and a Polish-French father, also happens to be a Prince himself: his full title is His Serene Highness Prince Alexi Lubomirski.It is expected that member of the Royal family, Ms Markle\u0027s family and intimate friends of both the newlyweds will be at the evening reception – although Princess Charlotte and Prince George will no doubt have been put to bed after their big day in the limelight.It has been announced that Prince William will be Prince Harry\u0027s best man. The decision means the Duke, who is President of the Football Association, will not attend the FA Cup final, which is happening on the same day as the wedding.Scheduled to start at 17:15, the FA Cup final will see Chelsea and Manchester United go head to head for the title. Windsor Castle is about an hour\u0027s drive from Wembley Stadium, which would have taken the Duke of Cambridge away from the proceedings for at least two hours.The Duke’s own stag do is reported to have been held on a Devon estate, Hartland Abbey, where he and close friends indulged in drinking, clay pigeon shooting, surfing and games.Prince Harry went on to tease his brother mercilessly during a none-the-less heartfelt best man’s speech at the wedding reception, allegedly wearing a fez, mimicking the lovestruck conversations between a young Kate and William, and ridiculing his bald spot.Royal Wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan MarkleBomber Command veterans call for their comrades to be honoured with a full campaign medalOne in three nurses do not have time to carry out basic patient careRich list: record number of women among the 1,000 wealthiest people in Britain Paris terror attack: Knifeman shot dead by police after killing one and injuring fourThe Queen\u0026#39s official approval of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle\u0026#39s marriage transcribed on vellumDennis Nilsen, Britain\u0026#39s second worst serial killer, dies in prison aged 72Meghan Markle profile: The actress, blogger, yoga-lover - and breath of fresh air for the British Royal family How to watch Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s royal wedding on TV next weekPrince Harry and Meghan Markle: Royal wedding details and latest newsRussia Today will not lose licence over nerve agent attack in Salisbury, Ofcom rulesTories battle image problem in fight to capture youth voteMillions of dogs threatened by rise of \u0026#39anti-vax\u0026#39 pills made from diseased flesh sold online, warns RSPCANewsagents and corner shops to sell \u0026#39porn pass\u0026#39 access code to allow adults to visit X-rated sitesWife \u0026#39not informed\u0026#39 husband was dying just yards away in GP surgeryBritain\u0026#39s Got Talent, episode 5: a new Paul Potts emerges and Alesha hits her golden buzzer for familiar faceRoyal wedding guest list: Who did Meghan Markle and Prince Harry invite?Comment: Is it wise to legalise euthanasia in a culture that has such a low opinion of disability?Jake Gyllenhaal and Bradley Cooper go head to head in rival Bernstein films No Ring No Bring?

Serendipitously, at the start of this bicentennial year, I found myself invited to a wedding in what used to be called Karl-Marx-Stadt, since renamed Chemnitz, in the former East Germany. Communism may have formally collapsed with the downfall of the Soviet Union, yet it has not been extinguished.The world’s most populous state and rising superpower, China, is officially communist, albeit nominally. And socialist ideas remain prevalent throughout the world. The resurgence of socialism could be seen in the Chavismo new left wave of Latin American politics (admittedly now in the process of being rolled back). In the US, self-proclaimed socialist senator Bernie Sanders could well have been as unlikely an occupant of the Oval office as Donald Trump – if the Democratic National Committee had not conspired against him.In the UK, unapologetic socialist Jeremy Corbyn  swept to the leadership of Her Majesty’s opposition, appointed Trotskyist John McDonnell as shadow chancellor (McDonnell recently told the Financial Times that their aims for Britain are socialist), pronounced socialism as no longer a dirty word to a delirious conference, before garnering 40 per cent of the vote in the general election. In France, Jean Luc Mélenchon performed respectably in the first round of the French elections, commanding nearly 20 per cent of the vote. In Greece, the left-wing Syriza government remains in power – even though its manifesto has been crushed by international finance capital. Its former finance minister and firebrand Yanis Varoufakis describes himself as a lapsed Marxist. His recent essay penned in  cites Marx’s analysis as both the key to understanding our present predicament and the way out of it.John McDonnell says he won\u0027t be a Marxist ChancellorIn 2015, socialism was the most searched word on Merriam Webster’s online dictionary. Socialism does not carry historical baggage for a younger generation left behind by the iniquities of capitalism. A Harvard study found that a majority of millennials reject capitalism and a third are in favour of socialism. This is what might be called the revenge of Marx the rehabilitation of one of the world’s historical philosophers. Marx inverted Hegelian doctrine into dialectical materialism, affirming that it was material relations that were responsible for consciousness and social relations  –  not the other way round. In 2011, back when it was still unfashionable to confess to being Marxist, Oxford University literary theorist Professor Terry Eagleton boldly decreed that the bearded prophet had been right after all. Eagleton is no longer alone.A slew of books herald the end of capitalism, in the words of economic sociologist Wolfgang Streeck, and announce that we are entering the epoch of Postcapitalism, according to the gospel of journalist and author Paul Mason. The most dangerous philosopher in the West, Slavoj Zizek,  according to The New Republic magazine ,  is communist one of his recent tomes, Living in the End Times, conjures up the apocalyptic sense of the death throes of capitalism.Of course, it wasn’t meant to be like this. Marx’s ideas had apparently been discredited with the collapse of communism and consigned to Trotsky’s dustbin of history. Hadn’t history proven that communism was not a historical inevitability? Then came the 2008 financial crash and the demise of political economist Francis Fukuyama’s ‘end of history’. A decade of austerity was the death knell for the ideological vacuum. The fall-out has seen a polarisation between authoritarian nationalism and progressivism between dystopia and NOT dystopia, if you like.Neoliberalism​  always presented itself as depoliticised, in that the free market is akin to an all-enveloping atmosphere and as irresistible as a force of nature. Its allocation of resources and outcomes supposedly only required mere supervision through technocratic managerialism. In reality, it could not have been more ideological, operating through the corporate capture of the state and hollowing out of the institutions of civic society. Global capitalism appeared to be indomitable and impregnable, in so far as it was the hegemonic system. Yet at the same time, the delayed reaction of a series of political earthquakes, in the form of the Arab Spring and a wave of authoritarian populism, has exposed its vulnerabilities. Even if these events have not challenged the fundamental basis of the system, its neoliberal globalisation variant is under attack.Yanis Varoufakis was at the forefront of Greece’s radical left coalition (Getty)Mao Zedong’s description of capitalism as a paper tiger seems as pertinent as ever. Marxism bequeathed a rich legacy of thinkers, ranging from Lenin and Trotsky to the Frankfurt school, as well as the likes of Antonio Gramsci, Fredric Jameson and Alain Badiou. It was once unthinkable to break with Marxist orthodoxy on the left. Until, as American Marxist Marshall Berman relates in his modern classic All that is Solid Melts into Air (taking its cue from the famous phrase in the Communist Manifesto), a group of disaffected French post-structuralists and postmodernists, namely Michel Foucault, Jacques Derrida and Roland Barthes, did just that. Disillusioned by the defeat of May 1968, when an uprising against De Gaulle resulted in his party emerging even stronger than before, they broke ranks.Raoul Peck: I Am Not Your Negro director on his film about Karl MarxPub where Marx and Engels discussed communist theory shuts downKarl Marx is \u0027back in fashion,\u0027 says shadow chancellor John McDonnellIs Jeremy Corbyn, in the words of his favourite philosopher Karl Marx,\u0027We can learn a great deal from Marx\u0027, says Jeremy CorbynIn the intervening decades, the battles of identity politics have been significant but they have also been hampered by the lack of a structural, systemic understanding of how capitalism operates. Where resistance has mirrored the fragmented, atomised, hyper-inidualism of neoliberalism then it has often been doomed to failure. All of which is very much bound up with the Cold War victory of the US empire. The CIA saw its chance, according to a recently declassified research paper. The agency read French postmodern theory, concluding that its questioning of the objective basis of reality could be used to undermine the Marxist doctrine of historical and teleological inevitability. Millions of dollars were pumped into front organisations such as magazines, publishing houses and favoured academics, in order to push postmodern ideas and to create a centre left, thus demarcating the outer boundary of respectable ideas – anything beyond which could be denounced as dangerous and radical lunacy. After all, the strategy of ide and rule has generally been the preferred one of the ruling class.Karl Marx: social, political and economic theorist in picturesKarl Marx: social, political and economic theorist in picturesGerman social, political and economic theorist Karl Marx.

The statues, created by artist Ottmar Hoerl, are part of an exhibition at the Museum Simeonstift Trier that were created to commemorate the 130th anniversary of the death of Marx in 1883. Marx, who was born in Trier, is the author of The Communist Manifesto, and his ideas on the relationship between labour, industry and capital created the ideological foundation for socialist and communist movements across the globe. Marx was familiar with the methods of the ruling class. He was often on the run from European authorities, eventually finding refuge in the relative tolerance of London where he ided up his time between his smoke-filled home (Soho then later Kentish town), the British Library and watering holes. His rebellious life  –  immersed in the struggles of the 19th century, from the 1848 revolutions to the Paris commune  –  lent itself, naturally, to the counterculture of the late 20th century. And now to the glamour of the big screen. A new Marx biopic – The Young Karl Marx   from I Am Not Your Negro director Raoul Peck  –  has been released. Marx’s starting point, outlined in his 1844 letter For A Ruthless Criticism of Everything Existing to fellow philosopher Arnold Ruge, is a philosophical tabula rasa comparable to a Cartesian wiping of the slate clean. This position of ‘Kritik’, adopted by the young Hegelians, gradually evolved into praxis for Marx. Hence, in Theses on Feuerbach (1888), Marx states “the philosophers have only interpreted the world, in various ways the point, however, is to change it”.The Communist Manifesto itself was not merely a political and economic tract. It is a call to arms, as well as a work of canonical sublimity and literary fecundity by turns poetic, inspired and visionary. Author and journalist Francis Wheen’s biography describes the Damascene moment at which Marx anoints the word ‘proletariat’. It descends on to the page like a thunderclap across the landscape, presaging the revolutions to come of the 20th century. In the wide-ranging debate Die Judenfrage, or The Jewish Question, Marx posits that the liberal definition of freedom is limited. The motto of ‘Liberté, Egalité, Fratérnité’ of the French revolution is just that  –  a good slogan. To take one example, equality does not relate to power or wealth but merely denotes equality before the law.Marx formulates that consciousness is generated by the mode of production, in a classic inversion of the Hegelian system. He defined alienation as the quintessential state of mind and being under capitalism, corresponding to the economic relations of commodification, exploitation and oppression. It is a state of mind that is little understood by the billions who experience it daily. Thus, bourgeois society is predicated on economic inidualism, private ownership and self-interest. The relations between iniduals, including intimate relations, are thus egoistical. Pure self-interest becomes the prime driver of not just economic processes but all relations. Under capitalism, every entity, no matter how sacred, can be transformed, exploited and sold for profit. This is what Marx meant by the intrinsic process of commodification. And it is this limitless commodification which extends into every sphere, including sex, the body and relationships.Lenin (left) and Trotsky were two of the 20th century’s greatest revolutionaries inspired by Marxism (Getty)Online pornography, social media  and dating apps are merely the latest extrapolations of this relentless commodification. Furthermore, social roles and relations are engendered by historical modes of production. Thus, the agrarian, feudal world corresponds to the social strata of monarchy aristocracy and the church dominating and exploiting the peasantry. Similarly, the industrial, urbanised world corresponds to the social structure of the bourgeoisie exploiting the proletariat. In a memorably thunderous passage in The Communist Manifesto, Marx extrapolates this connection between social and economic relations to define free trade: “It has resolved personal worth into exchange value, and in place of the numberless indefeasible chartered freedoms, has set up that single, unconscionable freedom  –  Free Trade. In one word, for exploitation, veiled by religious and political illusions, it has substituted naked, shameless, direct, brutal exploitation.”Marx outlined the history of mankind as the history of class struggle in which the classes are opposed in a dialectical paradigm. Thus, we move from antiquity with the duality of slave owner and slaves to the feudal age of lord and serf to the capitalist age of the bourgeoisie and the proletariat. It is these same unsustainable contradictions that Marx later proposes will bury capitalism, when the burgeoning proletariat become the ‘gravediggers’ of the bourgeoisie. This ‘final’ stage will usher in communism, completely transforming and reconfiguring the previous relations into a classless society. Marx outlines that communism, in abolishing private property, also abolishes alienation and wage bondage, leading to worker emancipation and, by extension, universal emancipation. Nevertheless, Marx subscribes to the enlightenment belief in the rationality and logic of mankind to create a narrative of progress. The bourgeois capitalist system is perceived as a necessary step in this progression, enabling the transition from a feudal, agrarian society into an urban, industrialised one. Thus, the bourgeoisie is portrayed as having played a revolutionary role in transforming the world. In its propensity for upheaval and turmoil, capitalism never ceases to alter the world.A monument to Karl Marx in the German city Chemnitz, formerly Karl-Marx-Stadt (Getty)The dialectical materialist analysis of the history of class struggle played out in the contradictions of Marx’s own life. Whether in his marriage to the aristocratic Jenny Von Westphalen, or his friendship with industrialist Friedrich Engels, which enabled the genius of Marx and offset the penury of his journalism and political activities. Some of the most switched-on uber capitalists and masters of the universe concede that Marx’s basic analysis of capitalism has never been improved upon. Trump billionaire backer and donor Peter Thiel states that the breakdown of the status quo points either towards libertarianism or Marxism. Billionaire investor Warren Buffett  infamously once said: “There’s class warfare, all right, but it’s my class, the rich class, that’s making war, and we’re winning.”The Marxist critique of capitalism hinges on its innate tendency towards concentration and centralisation of wealth. In Capital Volume 1, Marx fleshes out the M-C-M circuit (in which M is money and C is commodities). This circuit guarantees the expansion of capital, providing the economic basis of capitalism as a mechanism for limitless capital accumulation. The resulting crises of overproduction and capital accumulation are resolved through the enforced destruction of productive forces, the conquest of new markets and more thorough exploitation paving the way for more extensive and destructive crises. Fracking might be viewed as the ultimate metaphor for this process, whilst Uber is emblematic of the same hyper-exploitation.French economist Thomas Piketty’s work, updating the original title to Capital in the Twenty-First Century, using a large amount of historical data, has further corroborated Marx’s theories on the concentration of wealth. Unsurprisingly, several decades of neoliberalism have been the greatest testament to how a deregulated capitalism, red in tooth and claw, siphons wealth to the top 1 per cent or even 0.1 per cent. Recent figures show that the wealthiest eight billionaires in the world (whom you could fit into a people carrier) have as much wealth as the bottom half of the global population, or some 3. 5 billion people. Astonishingly, the equivalent figure was the 62 wealthiest billionaires in 2016. Back in 2010 it was more than 300. This is how rapidly wealth is being sucked up to the top  – this may be termed the vacuum-up effect as opposed to the myth of trickle-down economics.Stefan Konarske, left, as Friedrich Engels and August Diehl as Karl Marx in ‘The Young Karl Marx’ (Rex)Whilst Victorian capitalism was dominated by small-to-medium-sized companies, the middle decades of the 20th century witnessed a shift to statist capitalism. In effect, the Soviet Union and the People’s Republic of China  represented variations on this theme. Since then the age of globalisation has been ushered in with multinational corporations straddling the globe – many of them larger than the states they operate in. The movement of vast pools of capital on a global scale is historically unmatched. Mega mergers seem to be rarely out of the headlines. In other words, the centralisation Marx predicted 150 years ago is panning out.There is a one-way trend towards the control of capital by an ever smaller number of players. Neoliberal doctrine emphasises the virtues of competition. Yet the reality of deregulated free markets, most evidently in financial services, has been monopoly, cartels, collusion and rigging. This is evidenced by the big four dominance in every sector from banking, accountancy, magic circle law firms, to high street supermarkets, energy companies and privatised utilities. The contradictions of the system have now attained a new level of absurdity.Capitalists presently invest in existing money, be it financial instruments, housing or debt, in order to make profit. In fact, this financialisation of the economy has superseded the traditional profit-making processes of manufacturing. Unlike manufacturing, this financialisation does not create value. Instead it creates asset bubbles of financial and housing speculation, which eventually burst, as happened on a seismic scale in the 2008 crash. Since the 1970s there have been a series of escalating market crises  – yet even this volatility is profitable for hedge funds.Civil unrest in France in 1968 was described as a social revolution against capitialism (Getty)So if late capitalism is economically, socially and ecologically unsustainable, not to mention bankrupt, then whither to from here? One of the obtuse criticisms of Marx has been the lack of a blueprint, despite the fact that a participatory, truly democratic society would need to emerge organically rather than following a roadmap. Marx posited revolution as “the driving force of history”. The overthrow of the existing state and the dissolution of property would lead to liberation extending to the dissolution of the bourgeois conceptions of family, marriage and all nation states. This liberation from national barriers would then bring everyone into connection with the production of the whole world for the pleasure of their consumption.Under communism, Marx daintily describes how one would be able to hunt in the morning, fish in the afternoon, rear cattle in the evening and criticise after dinner (naturally). Communism would appear to truly represent the end of the history, or at least the end of history, as class struggle :  “Communism is the riddle of history solved and it knows itself to be this solution.” Marx formulates that human emancipation can only be achieved by going beyond the bourgeois framework material emancipation translates into spiritual and sensuous emancipation. Only the resolution of the material modes of production, beyond the paradigm of economic inidualism, private property and self-interest, can liberate consciousness and revolutionise social relations  –  such that there is the capacity, the capability and propensity for free behaviour and genuine ties between iniduals based on love, warmth and affection, rather than purely calculating and cold self-interest.The exultant victory lap of all-singing, all-dancing capitalism has been remarkably brief the unipolar moment of American triumphalism short-lived. Only recently, US defence secretary Jim Mattis  announced that the era of great power politics has returned. Undoubtedly, a set of progressive ideas is coalescing amongst the new left  –  a green economy, public and democratic control of the economy, full automation. This 21st century manifesto is embodied in such books as Inventing the Future. The critical question remains of the vehicle necessary to bring about this transition.There is no doubt that 21st-century global capitalism is far more sophisticated and resilient than that of pre-revolutionary Tsarist Russia. The transition of capitalism to an alternative political and economic system will likely play out over a protracted period, even if it is catalysed by revolution. Much in the same way that feudalism evolved into capitalism through the dual industrial (economic) and French revolutions (political), in which the bourgeoisie superseded the aristocratic order preceded by the 17th-century English civil war.Or to leave the last word to Marx: “No social order is ever destroyed before all the productive forces for which it is sufficient have been developed, and new superior relations of production never replace older ones before the material conditions for their existence have matured within the framework of the old society.”Youssef El-Gingihy is the author of ‘How to Dismantle the NHS in 10 Easy Steps’, published by Zero booksor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

They did so this year with added piquancy because it was the 50th anniversary of the famous “Mai 68” when, in the Latin Quarter of Paris, the Left Bank, the whole month was devoted to riotous assembly led by students. In contemplating these events, I recall Wordsworth’s often quoted phrase: “Bliss it was in that dawn to be alive” – unless, of course, you were struck by a cobblestone hurled by a student demonstrator or soaked and knocked off balance by a police water cannon.Presumably those who were demonstrating in Paris last Tuesday have now resumed their normal lives. The point about May 1968, however, is that they didn’t go back to college or to work the next day, they carried on, some of them for the whole month. Why was that? After all, economic growth had been unusually strong, the country was calm, both politically and socially, inflation was weak, living standards had been rising and there was little unemployment.Was it in a way a very 1960s thing? That question is prompted by a French historian of the period, Éric Alary, who observes that “May 68 is seen as a period when audacious moves seemed possible and during which society profoundly changed”. For that is an accurate description of the nature of the 1960s, whether in Western Europe or in North America.At the same time, there was a big rise in the sheer number of young people as a result of an increase in the birth rate in the closing stages of the Second World War and for some years afterwards. Thus, in France, the under-20 cohort rose from 30.7 per cent of the population in 1954 to 33.8 per cent in 1968. At the same time in France (1967), the school leaving age was raised from 14 to 16.  Two men take evasive action during a Paris street riot on 30 May (Getty)This required a massive expansion of teaching staff and building. As a result, students often found themselves being taught by hastily trained teachers in hastily built class rooms. In France, as in Britain, this was followed by a big expansion of the university sector. There was inevitably something ramshackle about it all, and students noticed. Yet the command structures of educational establishments remained unchanged. Nonetheless, universities are never just academic establishments full stop. For their campuses and their indoor and outdoor spaces lend themselves to meetings and debates and even to organising mini demonstrations. The intellectual gods of these 1960s students were Marx, Freud and Sartre, the French existentialist philosopher. In a famous passage, Sartre wrote that “God does not exist, and as a result man is forlorn, because neither within himself nor without does he find anything to cling to”. This struck home. For as Bob Dylan sang in 1965 – “How does it feelHow does it feelTo be on your ownWith no direction homeLike a complete unknownLike a rolling stone?”One had either to start things on one’s own without adult backing, or not at all. This was an unprecedented and intoxicating freedom. As the French student leader Dany Cohn-Bendit told the Paris demonstrators in May 1968: “There are no marshals and leaders today. Nobody is responsible for you. You are responsible for yourselves.”In fact, as is the way of things, Mai 68 began not in central Paris, but in Nanterre, a suburb seven miles to the northwest, and not in May but on 22 March. The construction of the university of Nanterre campus in a bleak shanty town had begun in 1962. In the spring of 1968 it was still not finished. The building were exceedingly functional and contained some 12,000 students. They were particularly shocked to find themselves living and doing their studies in what was in effect a building site. They demanded, too, the right to circulate freely between the residences of males and female students, still forbidden in what one might call pre-1960s style. There was a lot of justified discontent.Daniel Cohn-Bendit  was known as ‘Dany le Rouge’ because of his politics as well as the colour of his hair (Getty)Some 150 students, including far-left groups together with a small number of poets and musicians, occupied a building. The police surrounded it. After publication of the students’ wishes, they left the building without any trouble. But then they took their protest movement to the Sorbonne in the very middle of the Latin Quarter. That was how Mai 68 started.In a drastic action, the authorities shut down the University of Nanterre on 2 May. The students who had decamped to the Sorbonne were bound to think that this was a hostile act, an outbreak of war between the university authorities and the student body. It had been natural to head to the Sorbonne, France’s premier university, which had the prestige of its ancient foundation 700 years earlier. This meant nothing to the police, of course, who invaded the Sorbonne the next day.In response, on 6 May the national students’ union and the union of university teachers organised a protest march. It was one of the key events of the month. The head of the Paris police was obsessed by the need to protect the Sorbonne and its surroundings from a massive invasion by the students. He placed 1,500 officers in defence. But then came 6,000 protesters in waves. Overnight the confrontation was particularly violent. Thousands of cobblestones were ripped up and used as projectiles by the demonstrators. The police responded with teargas grenades. Dozens of gendarmes were taken to hospitals. Students were wrenched from the arms of the police by their colleagues.The next day, students, teachers and increasing numbers of young workers gathered at the Arc de Triomphe to demand that all criminal charges against arrested students be dropped, that the police leave the university and that the authorities reopen Nanterre and the Sorbonne. But negotiations broke down. When the students returned to their campuses to find that the police were still in occupation, a near revolutionary fervour began to grip them.The lyrics of Bob Dylan captured the sense of isolation and alienation felt by many young people (Redferns)The events were broadcast on radio as they occurred, and the aftermath was shown on television the following day. This demonstration of heavy handed police brutality brought on a wave of sympathy for the strikers. Moreover, in a highly significant move, the major union federations called a one-day strike and demonstration for Monday, 13 May. The workers were going to march with the students.They had their own grievances. There had been sporadic industrial trouble since the beginning of the year. More than half of them put in a 48-hour week. They feared that their standard of living had ceased to improve. Unemployment, albeit from a low base, was beginning to rise. As a result this was no longer a Paris event, for workers took to the streets throughout France. Their slogan was “Ten years! That’s enough!” referred to Charles de Gaulle’s long period as president.French politicians Michel Debre and Andre Malraux at the tomb of the unknown soldier, demonstrating their support for De Gaulle (Getty)The events the next day, 14 May, were as important. For workers began occupying factories, starting with a sit-down strike at the Sud Aviation plants near the city of Nantes. If students could occupy their universities, then workers could seize control of their factories. By 16 May, workers had occupied roughly 50 factories throughout France and 200,000 were on strike by 17 May. That figure snowballed to two million workers on strike the following day (18 May) and then ten million, or roughly two thirds of the French workforce on strike the following week (23 May).The unions assumed that the workers simply wanted more pay. So, when they were able to negotiate substantial pay increases with employers’ associations, they thought their job was done. But workers had also demanded the ousting of the De Gaulle government and in some cases demanded to run their own factories.The demonstrations and the strikes went on. Meanwhile on the morning of 29 May, De Gaulle suddenly boarded a helicopter and left the country. He went to the headquarters of the French military in Germany and called a meeting of Council of Ministers for 30 May back in Paris. On that same day, the unions led 400,000 to 500,000 protesters through Paris chanting “Adieu, De Gaulle”. The head of the Paris police carefully avoided the use of force.Sensibly De Gaulle responded by dissolving the National Assembly and calling a new election for 23 June. He ordered the workers to return to work immediately, threatening to institute a state of emergency if they did not. The Communist Party agreed to the holding of the election. Immediately revolutionary feelings began to fade away. The police retook the Sorbonne on 16 June. And the Gaullists won the greatest victory in French parliamentary history.The May days of 1968, it turned out, had been a convulsive moment, nothing more enduring than that.

Scientists want to test how “heavier-than-air vehicles” will operate on the red planet, Nasa said in a release. “The idea of a helicopter flying the skies of another planet is thrilling. The Mars Helicopter holds much promise for our future science, discovery and exploration missions to Mars.” Nasa administrator Jim Bridenstine said about the drone-like machine. What fake Mars colony Biosphere 2 looks like today “After the Wright brothers proved 117 years ago that powered, sustained and controlled flight was possible here on Earth, another group of American pioneers may prove the same can be done on another world,” Thomas Zurbuchen, associate administrator for Nasa’s Science Mission Directorate, said at the agency headquarters in Washington.The Mars Helicopter will not be manned but operated autonomously similar to how a drone is here on Earth. It has the potential to be much faster – and more complicated to pull off – than travelling the rocky and dirt-covered surface of Mars. However, unlike a drone “we don’t have a pilot and Earth will be several light minutes away, so there is no way to joystick this mission in real time,” MiMi Aung, project manager at the agency’s Jet Propulsion Lab, said. Instead, the helicopter will be able to receive a set of commands for flying a mission and carry them out on its own, Ms Aung explained. Nasa\u0027s canny decision to commission sumptuous vintage-inspired posters by Seattle design firm Invisible Creature has firmly placed space travel back where it belongs: in the imagination of travellersIt is particularly fitting that the Nasa commission went to Don and Ryan Clark, who have been running Invisible Creature since 2006, undertaking projects for the likes of Nike and TargetWe were ecstatic, just because our grandfather was an illustrator at Nasa for 30 years, says ClarkThe artwork harks back to the Jet Age-era posters commissioned by Howard Hughes\u0027 Trans World Airlines and its rival United in the 1950s and 1960s, when the work of David Klein (for TWA) and Stan Galli (for United) glamorised and essentially branded this new age of air travelIt doesn\u0027t matter that Nasa has no plans for a Grand Tour of Jupiter, Saturn, Neptune and UranusIf global travel is for daydreamers, going beyond the atmosphere is for true space cadetsOne of the main challenges is that helicopters here on Earth have only reached an altitude of 40,000 feet (12,192 metres), but Mars’s atmosphere is 1 per cent that of Earth’s. This means that when the new helicopter is on the surface of the planet, it will already be the equivalent of 100,000 feet up in the Earth’s atmosphere. “To make it fly at that low atmospheric density, we had to scrutinise everything, make it as light as possible while being as strong and as powerful as it can possibly be,” Ms Aung said. Nasa lander to dig into the Mars surface to answer deepest mysteriesNasa and ESA to bring soil from Mars to try and find aliensMission to Mars will launch within a decade, says SpaceX president“Nasa has a proud history of firsts,” Mr Bridenstine said. According to Nasa, “the full 30-day flight test campaign will include up to five flights of incrementally farther flight distances, up to a few hundred metres, and longer durations as long as 90 seconds, over a period. On its first flight, the helicopter will make a short vertical climb to 10 feet (3 metres), where it will hover for about 30 seconds”.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

That is precisely what we will do.” or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Fishing accounts for 41 per cent of the islands’ exports and two-thirds of the corporation tax received by its treasury. UK threatens less EU security cooperation if locked out of GalileoAny negative impact from Brexit on the islands’ economy is likely to be a thorny issue for Brexiteers, for many of whom the Falklands is a touchstone issue.Speaking after recent trips to Brussels and London the chair of the islands’ eight-person legislative assembly told The Independent that potential disruption caused by exit from the single market “would put at risk the current profitability of our fishing industry and would impact both the wider economy and government revenue”.The Falkland Islands government also says “any material change that results in less beneficial importexport access could be potentially catastrophic for the Falkland Islands economy and people”, according to a report drawn up by the UK Overseas Territories Association.The British government says it has “prioritised securing the freest and most frictionless trade possible with the EU”, although in fact it has pledged to leave the single market and customs union.Any material change that results in less beneficial importexport access could be potentially catastrophic for the Falkland Islands economyThe islands mostly export loligo squid to Spain, a seafood that accounts for 89 per cent of their exports to the EU. The Falklands provided over a third of the loligo squid imported by Spain last year once it arrives in the port of Vigo it enters the EU supply chain and is distributed around the world.Representatives of the islands’ fishing industry believe that the “worst case scenario” of having to trade on World Trade Organisation rules as advocated by some Brexiteers would cause a £9m hit to revenues because of tariffs – a large sum for the 3,400-population archipelago that would amount to more than £2,600 per person.The islands’ fishing association says cultivating other markets for squid would be “difficult”, especially in Asia, where “demand is highest but competition is strong, and both political and tariff barriers exist”. In the event of a “no deal” Brexit the islanders say they would be left with no choice but to seek support from the British state to prop up their fishing industry.Theresa May has pledged to leave the single market, stating that remaining in it would be incompatible with properly leaving the EU. The British government hopes to secure tariff- and quota-free access to EU markets for fish and seafood through a free trade agreement – but Seafish, a non-departmental public body that supports the British fishing industry, says Brexit has caused “considerable levels of uncertainty” for the sector.While not technically a member of the single market the Falkland Islands currently enjoys preferential access as a result of its status as a self-governing UK overseas territory and Britain’s membership. It pays no tariffs and is exempt from quotas.Teslyn Barkman, one of the eight elected members of the Falkland Islands’ legislative assembly told The Independent: “We have worked hard over many years to establish and grow our fishing industry – it really is a Falkland Islands success story, and one that has allowed us to stand on our own two feet financially.“As a result of our current tariff- and quota-free access to the EU single market, our fishing companies have been able to develop strong markets across Europe for our premium loligo squid, which is our primary export.  Brexit so far: in picturesBrexit so far: in picturesBoris Johnson MP, Labour MP Gisela Stuart and UKIP MP Douglas Carswell address the people of Stafford in Market Square during the Vote Leave Brexit Battle Bus tour on 17 May 2016.

But I have also said that the virtue, in excess, fills graveyards.“In this case, not continuing in the EEA would mean endangering – sacrificing – thousands of skilled and decently paid jobs and, with them, the life chances of countless families and communities.”May has found another way to stall making a decision on BrexitThis is the truth about the politics behind EurovisionWill Sainsbury’s-Asda sell 73 stores or more than 200? We can’t let the Home Office threaten migrants’ right to strikePolice look at evidence Brexit campaign chief committed crimesEarlier this week Mr Corbyn’s office reiterated arguments previously set out by the leader that remaining in the single market as it stands would hamper his interventionist industrial agenda if he won power.In particular, Mr Corbyn has concerns about what he sees as restrictive state aid rules and regulations that might interfere with his plans to reverse the privatization of public services.But Lord Kinnock rubbished the claims as being “based on falsehood”, adding: “Neither the EEA nor the EU are part of the socialist superstate of neocon delusion, or of the global capitalist adventure playground of infantile leftist illusion.“The EEA is a mixed-economy agreement of 31 democracies ‘to promote continuous and balanced strengthening of trade and economic relations between the contracting parties with equal conditions of competition and the respect of the same rules’.Brexit so far: in picturesBrexit so far: in picturesBoris Johnson MP, Labour MP Gisela Stuart and UKIP MP Douglas Carswell address the people of Stafford in Market Square during the Vote Leave Brexit Battle Bus tour on 17 May 2016.

Don’t stop on the side of the road,” Doug Bos, the owner of the zoo, told CBC News in January, when the footage was shared. “If everybody would listen to the video, that’s what the message was – don’t do this.”Where not to visit if you love animalsWhere not to visit if you love animalsChimpanzees are forced to perform demeaning tricks on leashes and are often subject to cruel training techniques. Animals who are confined to small, barren enclosures and forced to perform unsurprisingly show symptoms of stress and depression. Chimpanzees have been documented rocking back and forth, sucking their lips, salivating and swaying against enclosure perimeters in distress.Some marine parks use bottlenose dolphins in performances and offer visitors the opportunity to swim with dolphins. Unfortunately, people are often unaware that these animals are captured in the wild and torn from their families or traded between different parks around the world.Tigers are forced to live in an unnatural and barren environment and have to endure interactions with a constant stream of tourists. Since tigers never lose their wild instincts, across the world they are reportedly drugged, mutilated and restrained in order to make them “safe” for the public. However, every year, incidents of tiger maulings are reported at this type of tourist attraction.Sunning on the beach is great for humans – we can take a quick dip or catch a bite to eat when we get too hot or hungry. But it\u0027s pure hell for donkeys who are confined to the beach and forced to cart children around on the hot sand. Some donkey-ride operators at beach resorts in the UK even keep the animals chained together at all times. Some parks confine orcas to concrete tanks and force them to perform meaningless tricks for food - many die in captivity. Orcas are highly intelligent and social mammals who may suffer immensely, both physically and mentally, when they\u0027re held in captivity.Lions are confined to fenced areas so that they can easily be cornered, with no chance of escape. Most of them will have been bred in captivity and then taken from their mothers to be hand-reared by the cub-petting industry. When they get too big, they may be drugged before they are released into a hunting enclosure. Because these animals are usually kept in fenced enclosures (ranging in size from just a few square yards to thousands of acres), they never stand a chance of surviving.Every year, tourists travel to Pamplona for the Running of the Bulls. The bulls who are forced to slip and slide down the town\u0027s narrow cobblestone streets are chased straight into the bullring. They are then taunted, stabbed repeatedly and finally killed by the matador in front of a jeering crowd. The majority of Spaniards reject bullfighting, but tourists are keeping the cruel industry on its last legs. City streets are no place for horses. The animals toil in all weather extremes, suffering from respiratory distress from breathing in exhaust fumes as well as numerous hoof, leg and back problems from walking on pavement all day long. As easily spooked prey animals, horses subjected to the loud noises and unexpected sounds of city streets are likely to be involved in accidents, even deadly ones. The zoo community regards the animals it keeps as commodities, and animals are regularly bought, sold, borrowed and traded without any regard for established relationships. Zoos breed animals because the presence of babies draws visitors and boosts revenue, yet often, there\u0027s nowhere to put the offspring as they grow, and they are killed, as we recently saw with Marius the giraffe in Denmark. Some zoos have introduced evening events with loud music and alcohol which disrupt the incarcerated animals even further. At the time, a trainer said there were no safety concerns, as the bear was secured by a chain and the film had been taken before the Dairy Queen had opened for the day. Football team condemned after muzzled bear forced to deliver ballMan ‘trying to take selfie’ with bear is mauled to deathFirst polar bear bred in Singapore dies after five-year health battlePark staff accidentally kill one of world’s rarest bearsFemale bears evolve to hunting threat by raising cubs for longerThe zoo, located in Innisfail, Alberta, has now been charged under the Wildlife Act for taking the bear out without informing the authorities – one count relates to the ice cream excursion and the other for failing to inform officials the bear was being taken home nightly for bottle-feeding in 2017.The owners of the wildlife park, Mr Bos and Debbie Rowland, have said they plan to plead guilty. “We made a mistake. I’m embarrassed about it,” Mr Bos told . “Every time we take an animal off the property, we’re supposed to notify Fish and Wildlife, send them an email, and we forgot to do that in both instances.”The zoo’s permit has also been revised to include new conditions requiring the zoo to provide more details when transporting animals and to keep them in a cage, crate or kennel while in a vehicle.Members of the public will also be barred from having any contact with animals, including bears. or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

In many parts of the world, glaciers have been in retreat, creating dangerously large lakes that can cause devastating flooding when the banks break. Climate change can also increase rainfall in some areas, while bringing drought to others.Smoke – filled with the carbon that is driving climate change – drifts across a field in Colombia.A river once flowed along the depression in the dry earth of this part of Bangladesh, but it has disappeared amid rising temperatures.

The World Health Organisation has warned such pollution, much of which is from the fossil fuels that cause climate change, is a “public health emergency”.Water levels in reservoirs, like this one in Gers, France, have been getting perilously low in areas across the world affected by drought, forcing authorities to introduce water restrictions.Mr Van Gendt presented new figures about the Tesla battery’s performance, which also revealed it has now taken over 55 per cent of FCAS in the region.South Australia is now reportedly the only state that has experienced a decline in FCAS costs in recent months.Some estimates suggest the cost savings to consumers as a result of this decline have been up to A$35m (£19.5m) in the first four months of the Tesla battery’s operation.Lara Olsen, Tesla Energy’s regional manager of business development, also spoke at the event and explained that while other FCAS systems rely on volatile fuel costs, the wind power the battery relies on is fixed at a cheap and stable price.While local politicians in South Australia largely welcomed the giant battery as a key component in efforts to make the state more self-sufficient and provide affordable energy, there has been push back from the higher levels of government.Australian resources minister Matt Canavan even compared it to Kim Kardashian, stating that “it’s famous for being famous. It really doesn’t do very much.”Tesla’s new mega-battery in Australia responding in ‘record’ timeHowever, the success of the project has been recognised by the Australian Energy Market Operator, which has noted that it is capable of responding to outages much faster than conventional generators.South Australia has been hailed for the lead it has taken on renewable energy, with state Labour politicians lending their support to large scale developments including the world’s largest solar thermal plant. The Tesla battery is seen by experts as another jewel in the state’s green energy crown. To some extent the system’s efficiency has not been a positive thing for Tesla, which has stated that the speed of the battery is not being accounted for properly, resulting in the company missing out on payments.Nevertheless, its success has led to interest in further Tesla projects, with a solar-powered version set to be built in the Australian state of Victoria.While the Hornsdale Power Reserve battery currently holds the title of the world’s largest, Tesla CEO Elon Musk recently hinted at an even larger project set to be announced soon.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

true.But damningly for Tory Prime Minister Edward Heath, and all those who kept quiet about the findings in the early 70s, the document, known as FCO301048, was locked away under Official Secrets Act rules for almost five decades.The classified paper, dated April 1971, suggested the Government should keep the British public in the dark about what EEC membership means predicting that it would take 30 years for voters to realise what was happening by which time it would be too late to leave.That last detail was the only thing the disgraceful paper \u0026ndash prepared for the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) \u0026ndash got wrong.The document, known as FCO301048, was locked away under Official Secrets Act rules                France’s Emmanuel Macron uses German crisis to call

European Economic Community (the EEC effectively became the EU in 1993) was headed for economic, monetary and fiscal union, with a common foreign and defence policy, which would constitute the greatest surrender of Britain\u0026rsquos national sovereignty since 1066.He went on to say \u0026ldquoCommunity law would take precedence over our own courts and that ever more power would pass away from Parliament to the bureaucratic system centred in Brussels.The author even accurately asserts that the increased role of Brussels in the lives of the British people would lead to a \u0026ldquopopular feeling of alienation from Government.But shockingly politicians were advised \u0026ldquonot to exacerbate public concern by attributing unpopular measures\u0026hellip to the remote and unmanageable workings of the Community.\u0026nbspPrime Minister Edward Heath kept quiet about the findings in the early 70sThey were told to preserve the impression that the British Government was still calling the shots rather than an unelected body of foreign politicians \u0026ndash and that the ruse would last \u0026ldquofor this century at least \u0026ndash by which time Britain would be so completely chained to Brussels it would be impossible to leave.Document FCO301048, which has now been declassified under the 30-year rule, still shocks and angers Brexiteers.Annabelle Sanderson, a Brexit expert and former advisor to Nigel Farage said: \u0026ldquoDespite all the claims from politicians of many parties that the EU was not about becoming a central state this 1971 document shows that is exactly what the plan was.\u0026nbsp\u0026ldquoArch Remoaners from Labour, Lib Dems and the Tories need to check this out and ask themselves why they are MPs if they don\u0026rsquot actually want Westminster to be in charge of this country.\u0026ldquoWe voted for Brexit what needs to happen is a proper clean break from Brussels so we can once again become a sovereign nation with money being spent in this country on services we need and have Parliament and courts making and ruling on the laws.Document FCO301048 still shocks and angers BrexiteersThe writer and journalist Christopher Booker, one of the founders of the satirical magazine Private Eye, said: \u0026ldquoHere was a civil servant advising that our politicians should connive in concealing what Heath was letting us in for, not least in hiding the extent to which Britain would no longer be a democratic country but one essentially governed by unelected and unaccountable officials.\u0026ldquoOne way to create an illusion that this system was still democratic, this anonymous mandarin suggested, would be to give people the chance to vote for new representatives at European, regional and local levels.\u0026nbsp\u0026ldquoA few years later, we saw the creation of an elected European Parliament \u0026ndash as we see today a craze for introducing elected mayors, as meaningless local

She spoke little English, had only met her groom in the days before the wedding, and was only 17 years old.When she walked down the aisle at the Royal Chapel the nerves finally got the better of her - in explosive fashion.Augusta vomited all over her own dress - as well as the dress of her new mother-in-law Caroline of Ansbach, the Queen Consort, who was not best pleased.Nonetheless, the ceremony carried on and the marriage went through, albeit with some of the romance taken out of the situation.The day Lady Diana Spencer became Diana, Princess of Wales was the wedding of the century.

and it went up to £7.38 from April 1, 2018.The wage increased from £5.60 to £5.90 for 18 to 20-year-olds, and from £4.05 to £4.20 for under 18s.However, apprentices were only entitled to £3.50 if they are under-19 - this increased to £3.70 from April 1, 2018.In April 2018, the minimum wage for 25-year-olds rose from £7.50 to £7.83 an hour.The national limits are legally binding.Anyone who thinks they are not getting the National Living Wage or National Minimum Wage should complain to their employer in the first instance.If this does not get anywhere, the next step is to take the complaint to HMRC who will investigate.Those who are self-employed, voluntary workers, company directors and family members who live in the home of the employer and do household chores do not qualify for either rate.There is no difference in pay for those that live in London compared to elsewhere.The only discrepancy is for people working in agriculture or horticulture.Workers already employed before October 1, 2013 are entitled to the pay set under their contract of employment.This is a voluntary scheme aiming to recognise the actual cost of living, to which 3,000 employers have signed up.Under it, the lowest rate of pay is calculated according to the cost of living in the UK based on the changing cost of a basket of groceries.The amount is set by the charity Living Wage Foundation, and accredited employers include local authorities, NHS trusts, banks, retailers, charities and construction companies.The foundations calculations put the real Living Wage at £8.75 an hour - and £10.20 in London.These rates also apply to over-18s in recognition that young people face the same living costs as everyone else.And while companies are not legally entitled to pay more than the National Living and Minimum Wages, those which have signed up to the real Living Wage scheme have pledged to pay all workers those rates.The rate is calculated every November, and accredited employers are committed to any increases.While theres no legal obligation for your employer to pay you more than the National Living Wage (£7.50 from April 1, 2017), if your company is accredited by the Living Wage Foundation you should be receiving more than that.The foundations head of partnerships Graham Griffiths said anyone concerned can use their online whistleblowing service, and any employer not adhering to the Real Living Wage faced losing its accreditation.Graham said one area where it was challenging to pay the living wage were retail and hospitality but pointed to Ikea, Aldi and Lidl, which have agreed to pay the same rate.The scheme was launched in 2001 by parents in East London, and the foundation was set up in 2011.In 2005 following a growing interest from employers, the Greater London Authority established the Living Wage Unit to calculate what the lowest pay should ideally be.In 2008 Trust for London selected the scheme as a special initiative and made a grant of more than £1million to campaign for it and set up an accreditation scheme for employers.In April 2016 it became the inspiration for the governments higher minimum wage rate, which it rebranded the National Living Wage.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Shame on them.More MPs backed away from Tom Watson’s sinister “Section 40” bid to force papers into the death grip of Max Mosley’s Press-hating Impress crew.Watson’s sole aim was revenge against papers critical of Labour. He finally bottled out of a vote he knew he would lose. A malevolent conspiracy theorist, bully and liar . . . now a coward to boot.But the Labour lardbucket ­will not give up. Nor will his orgy-loving benefactor Mosley, nor Miliband, nor Hacked Off Hugh nor their weird, obsessive acolytes.The Tories will have to defend Press freedom again. They can begin by repealing Section 40, as their manifesto pledged.THE Lords’ latest sickening insult to democracy has surely hammered the final nail in the unelected chamber’s coffin.Their vote to stay in the single market is beyond belief in its stupidity, arrogance and insane ­willingness to expose the country to dangerous instability.It would mean surrendering control over immigration for ever — and never actually “leaving” the EU.The Lords’ role is to tweak and advise on laws, not impose entirely contrary policies because they don’t like how the country votes. They are telling 17.4million people: “You don’t count. We do.”How do they imagine Leavers would react if the biggest vote in our history was negated by unelected, ermine-clad party stooges, some on EU pensions?We genuinely fear the consequences.It was the Lords, too, who began the attempt to muzzle the Press. They are rotting our democracy from within.IT is appalling that the Government is ­considering a new witch-hunt into Army veterans of the Troubles.The vast majority of unsolved murders were by terrorists, mostly since given immunity by the Labour Government.Northern Ireland Secretary Karen Bradley has been advised she cannot legally exclude veterans. But too many Tory Ministers are cowed by civil servants and fail to do what is clearly right.Such as ending probes into old soldiers and facing any consequences with courage.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

There was a really big social expectation to have the best things and it was affecting school life for a lot of people.There was groups created around who had the best things but I think that has been taken away.

one of which is given some money.But while the person with the cash is obligated to share some of the loot with other player that portion can be as small as zero.And the Dutch scientists found that small men act more aggressively when there is no threat of repercussions, reports The New Scientist.Experts believe this proves that short man syndrome, also known as Napoleon Complex, is real and factors into the everyday lives of vertically-challenged males.In the study, the 42 volunteers were split into pairs and allowed to meet their partners – who were either little or large depending on their own stature.After allowing the tiny test subjects to see their physically dominant opponents, each player was given a separate room where they were asked to give up some cash.The shortest men in the study, measuring around 5ft7in kept 14 of their 18 tokens to themselves on average while the tall men, measuring about 6ft6in in height, only kept nine of their 18 credits.But when the small gents were faced with the threat of repercussion, they did not display aggressive behaviour and were more willing to share with their opponents.Lead researcher Jill Knapen said: “It’s probably smart for short men to be like this because they have less opportunities to get resources.Short blokes on average are less wealthy, less successful and less healthy than their taller counterparts, according to studies.Bigger men also enjoy better sex and love lives than small guys.Little men may also have to adopt a more defensive stance because of aggression from their larger peers.Mike Eslea at the University of Central Lancashire is sceptical about whether the type of behaviour displayed by small males can be explained by the Napoleon Complex.Speaking to New Scientist, he said: “They’re supposed to be publicly advertising their aggressiveness to compensate for their lack of stature.“To me this doesn’t suggest the Napoleon Complex exactly, it suggests something else.”"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000405240436.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"newlywed couple china honeymoon preston","story":"Legend Liang, 33 and his new wife Carmen, travelled 6,000 miles to spend their holiday not on a sandy beach under a palm tree but in the Lancashire city.He whisked Carmen from their home and spent three days in the town - even posing for photographs in their wedding attires at various landmarks.The couple proudly posed outside the citys Fishergate shopping centre, a university campus, outside a bus-stop, the Media factory building and in a park.Journalist Legend choose the former cotton mill town as he had studied there at the University of Central Lancashire campus ten years ago.He was keen to show Carmen some of his old haunts during a two week honeymoon in the UK during which they also visited Brighton and London.Legend, who studied international journalism for a year at the uni in 2008, decided no other place was going to bring the wow-factor than Preston.Legend, from Guandong in southern China, said: Preston is a very important place for me.I wanted to show my wife where I studied, where I lived in Whitendale Halls and on Fishergate, and how lucky I was to have the opportunity to live in a lovely small city which had an international perspective.It had been 10 years since the uni grad had stepped foot in the city famed for its 94 metre spire at St Walburges Church - which is the tallest in Britain.But Legend was amazed at the difference a decade made - with the campus now including its Xbox building - a green, grey and black-coloured media centre.He added: The Media Factory was a building site so its nice to see that looking so good, Fylde Building has gone and theres others being built while in the city centre the market has changed so much.The pair spent the last two weeks also visiting London, Brighton and Edinburgh as they flew back home to their native China on Thursday.Legend, a Guangzhou Yangcheng Evening News reporter, said his wife had enjoyed her trip to Preston as much as him - proving the 14 hour flight was worth it.He said: She thought London was a huge city, just like we have back home but Preston was really nice because she could see how UK people live and work in a small city with everything they need being close by.Legend studied at Guangdong University of Foreign Study, an international partner of UCLan since 1986, for two years before his move to Preston.He was taught in his home country by Matt Horn - the course leader of the international journalism franchise programme since it began in 2005.Matt said: Legend always showed the natural instincts required of a good journalist and is well respected in the city.UCLan and GDUFS have a long and happy history together and so I was delighted when Legend introduced his bride to be as I had taught her for GDUFS a couple of years after I was Legends teacher.Preston is famous as the location for the opening of the first KFC in the UK in 1965 and as the home of Preston North End FC."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000395754020.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"rubbish fly tipped england stretch 1600 miles moscow","story":"The bill for taxpayers rocketed 13 per cent last year, councils said.They revealed that in 2016/17 there were 492,139 cases where waste the size of a small van or tipper truck was illegally dumped.Put together the vehicles would form a 1,459-mile queue, with the amount of fly-tipped rubbish circling the M25 12 times.

Scott might be 26 years her junior but he always strikes me as the “older” one in the relationship.It’s that sheer zest for life that Barbara has, even at 80, that makes this diagnosis so very sad and hard to bear.Scott decided to speak out because he felt he could no longer protect his beloved wife from people outside their close circle of friends and family hearing the truth.He became worried her illness would make her do or say something out of ­character that could upset her and others.He wants to be able to take his wife on ­ outings, and for her to still meet the public who love her and who will now ­hopefully understand if she’s having a “foggy” day.Scott also needs to make sure he takes care of himself and doesn’t get completely worn out looking after his wife.He hasn’t been able to leave her alone in the house recently, but now the truth is out he can let others take over while he at least has half an hour to himself.Anyone who cares for someone with dementia knows it is utterly exhausting, stressful and worrying, no matter how much you love them.I salute everyone who quietly and patiently deals with these day-to-day ­struggles. Scott is now free of the burden of keeping the secret and I hope he is finding strength from all of the messages of support for Barbara.She’s been part of many of our most-loved shows and we’ve grown up with “Our Babs”.I remember watching her wiggle and giggle her way through the Carry On films, where her sheer talent and perfect comic timing marked her out as a little superstar.Who could forget her enthusiastic arm flinging exercise routine in Carry On Camping that ended with her bra pinging off?And that incredible bikini made up of three shiny red hearts in Carry On Again Doctor made my pal Dr Hilary Jones decide to take up a career in medicine.As she more than proved during her reign in EastEnders, Barbara has always been so much more than a bubbly blonde dolly bird.She is one hell of an actress and was in her element behind the bar of The Queen Vic.It was her and Scott’s decision to kill off Peggy Mitchell when her memory began to fade.Barbara was having difficulty ­learning lines so felt she couldn’t give her very best performance.As it so happens, the scenes leading up to her character’s death were some of the best that ­Barbara, or any soap actress, has ever given on the small screen. Quite simply she is the real deal.I’ve been lucky enough to ­interview her many times over the years and it’s like catching up with an old friend.She’s open and honest and has never tried to cover up her ­mistakes or to sugar-coat the ups and downs of her life.When work was thin on the ground she painted on a smile, climbed into her shiny fairy godmother outfit and worked her backside off in provincial pantos.She was always quick to credit EastEnders for giving her a career comeback.I’ve seen her talking to fans outside the ­studio, always happy to pose for pictures, sign autographs and have a chat.She would leave everyone with a smile on their face and some happy memories.Her own powers of recall and her very bright light may be diminishing, but Scott and all her friends and family, and the public who adore her, will ensure she is wrapped in a soft blanket of love.She’s a class act and a very special woman.TAKE a bow Shayne Ward and all concerned with the deeply moving and hugely important storyline of Aidan’s suicide in Coronation Street.The subject was handled with great sensitivity.We saw Aidan feeling isolated and alone in the crowded Rovers, witnessed his fearful despair and heard his father’s anguished screams of grief through the closed bedroom door.There was no need to see his cold, dead body to understand what had happened. This really was Corrie at its finest.Richard Hawley as devastated dad Johnny and Catherine Tyldesley as poor bereaved Eva were exceptional, but what made me really blub was the authentic speech by Gail (Helen Worth) looking out of her window on to the iconic cobbled street, talking about how we all need to look after each other and that no one should suffer in silence.It was beautifully written and impeccably delivered.That’s what Corrie is all about.IT’S the one time of the year when our inevitable failure to win a massive trophy in Europe is a source of fun and amusement rather than humiliation. Because tonight is Eurovision.Our plucky Brit doomed to failure this time is SuRie, above, who is actually a good performer with a perfectly acceptable song, but even if the UK entry was Robbie Williams belting out Angels, we would still be near the bottom of the table or even doomed to the dreaded “nul points”.Many theories are put forward for our dire results over the past two decades.Some believe there are too many countries taking part (Australia and Israel are bizarrely considered part of Europe) which makes for more tactical voting, combined with an anti- British backlash made worse by Brexit.I reckon it’s simply because we don’t take it seriously enough, for which I’m very grateful, because I truly love Eurovision.We know we won’t win so it’s just an excuse for a party, a chance to wallow in the whole wonderful campfest and to chortle at Graham Norton’s snarky comments.My perfect evening.WHEN Kim Kardashian is the most elegant and tastefully dressed woman in the room, you know that something has gone horribly awry.So it was at the ludicrous Met Gala in New York, which saw a procession of show-offs dressing up like extras from the Monty Python sketch about the Spanish Inquisition.Madonna looked like Dracula’s mad old aunty, Sarah Jessica Parker had a nativity scene on her head, and don’t get me started on Rihanna, who came as some sort of sexy bishop mashed up with a pearly queen.It made Kim’s skin-tight gold sheath Versace dress appear to be the epitome of class.We are told the Pope approved this farrago, which was pompously entitled Heavenly Bodies: Fashion And The Catholic Imagination.His endorsement should make you shudder – until you realise that’s how he always dresses.He’s also a man with a passion for red leather Prada slip-ons, so I suppose he is more connected to the weird world of fashion than your average parish priest.A great deal of money is raised for good causes at this tacky celebration of fame and fortune, and that’s all well and good. But maybe next year they should stay at home and write a cheque.One thing is certain.

The shocked OAP, unsure what to do with the pony, contacted World Horse Welfare who got in touch with the RSPCA.The animal charity today released pictures of the pony stranded in the small yard of the house surrounded by wheelie-bins, garden furniture and a rabbit hutch.RSPCA inspector Charlotte Melvin, who attended the property to check over the horse, said: You couldnt make this up.A 13-year-old girl responded to a plea on an online free ads site where a lady said she didnt want the pony anymore and that he would be put to sleep if no one had him.She gave her nans address and the next thing that happened was a man just came along and dumped the pony there, no words of advice or anything like that - and leaving a very shocked nan.We dont know where this poor pony came from but he clearly was not treated well before being abandoned.We have come to a dead end in trying to find out further information so we are appealing for anybody who can help us to get in touch.The pony, who has been named Mr Melvin Andrews, is now in the care of World Horse Welfare.Field officer Rachel Andrews who transported the animal to a private boarding establishment, said she hoped the incident was not the start of a new trend.She added: Were seeing sick or young ponies being dumped and abandoned when their owners no longer want them, and it would be a worry if online free ad sites are used in this way.Many provide advice on the commitment required to take on a horse.Every horse and pony deserves responsible ownership, which includes responsible breeding, selling and rehoming.Were just glad that Melvin the pony has settled in well at our Penny Farm Rescue and Rehoming Centre and has already shown himself to be lovely a little pony and we hope in time we can find him a good home.Anyone who has any information is asked to call the RSPCAs appeals line on 0300 123 8018 or World Horse Welfare at 08000 480 180.Last month, the RSPCA revealed that the number of horses rescued by the charity has reached a four-year high, as the equine crisis continues to have devastating consequences.The charitys annual Cruelty Statistics revealed that nearly 1,000 horses were rescued by the charity from cruelty, suffering and neglect last year (2017), and a staggering 928 horses are currently in the charitys care."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/old.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"oldest man america richard overton celebrates 112th birthday smoking 12 cigars day whiskey","story":"Richard Overton says he is in tip-top condition even though he smokes 12 a day as well as well as a helping of booze and coffee.When interviewed by local news station KSN, the Texan said: I feel fine every day.No pain and no aches.”Mr Overton also admitted a weakness for Dr Pepper, waffles, pancakes, cinnamon rolls and ice cream.But most of all he loves his Tampa cigars which he smokes on his porch while waving to his fans’ who honk their cars.And of course he likes a nice drink of an evening.Mr Overton told Fox News: Whiskeys a good medicine.

If Prince Harry and Meghan’s wedding is anything like our day it will be truly magical.“When we signed the register at The Guildhall we realised that we have become a part of Royal history - in just a few days time Harry and Meghan will sign the same one!“We couldn’t be happier or more grateful to the Sun on Sunday.”Delighted Natalie, a customer services rep, and Rich, who works in asset finance, said ‘I do’ in front of their loved ones on Friday.Their no-expense-spared prize wedding day cost in excess of £25,000 and included a lavish reception, vintage car, flowers, cake, rings, photographer, videographer and all the bridal outfits and suits. Every last detail was meticulously planned to ensure Rich and Natalie felt like a Prince and Princess and were treated to the wedding of their dreams, just eight days before Harry and Meghan marry next Saturday.And their big day meant even more to them, because Rich, 29, is a huge royal fan who met Princess Diana the day he was born.From a young age he would tell how, at less than two hours old, he was chosen for his meeting with Diana when she opened a maternity ward in the hospital where his mum Kath gave birth.He said: “My mum is so proud of meeting Princess Diana and shows that photograph to everyone.There has always been a royal connection for me, so to have been able to wed here in Windsor just a week before Prince Harry is brilliant.“This has been the best day of our lives, without a doubt. I know everyone says that about their wedding day, but this has been incredibly special.“Every detail was perfect and it all went to plan. Natalie looks beautiful and I’m so proud to call her my wife.“We can’t thank the Sun on Sunday enough. You’ve made us feel like royalty on the most important day of our lives.”Natalie, 24, added: “It has been a dream come true. We never would have been able to afford a wedding this beautiful and special. I know Meghan is getting married here next week, but today I feel like the Princess.”Rich and Natalie’s special day began at The Oakley Court Hotel - a stunning Victorian Mansion overlooking the River Thames with stunning grounds - where the bride and her bridesmaids had full hair and make up done.The stunning 1859 hotel, a stone’s throw from the Castle, can boast both King Edward VII and Napoleon IV as guests - and even played host to Harry’s Grandmother, HRH Queen Elizabeth in 2009.Portrait photographer Patrick Balls and videographers from Dom Balls Events were on hand to capture candid shots of the girls as they were pampered.There wasnt a dry eye as Natalies dad Mark, 51, saw her in her stunning wedding dress for the first time and proudly led his daughter to the 1939 Rolls-Royce Wraith called Victoria courtesy of Charismatic Cars that took them to The Guildhall in Royal Windsor town centre.Rich, his two best men and groomsmen - who were all kitted out in blue suits from Cookham Formal Hire and with button holes from Marks and Spencer - took selfies and giggled as they waited for Natalies big arrival.She looked beautiful as she slowly walked towards her happy groom with her attendants - bridesmaid Hannah Cawthray, 24, her nieces and flower girls Martha and India Pickering, aged six and one, and page boy Freddie Adamson, three - who were all dressed in beautiful outfits courtesy of Monsoon and Accessorize and carrying white and green bouquets from Marks and Spencer.The pair giggled before nervously holding hands and saying their vows in the same venue where Prince Charles wed Camilla in April 2005. The pair exchanged platinum wedding bands from Winsor Bishop Jewellers in a room lined with Royal portraits.And as the registrar declared them man and wife, Rich kissed a delighted Natalie and a ripple of applause rang around the room.Outside Royal fans, TV crews - from across the world - and locals applauded the pair and as they headed towards The Long Walk in front of Windsor Castle the couple waved at their new fans before returning to The Oakley Court Hotel as man and wife.The couple had a lavish reception courtesy of the hotel - with a Pimm’s reception and a BBQ feast that included burgers, tuna steaks, pork loin and salads.As the guests ate in the stretch marquee - with more stunning flowers from Marks and Spencer on the tables - singer Kelly Barnes performed.And it was there that the newlyweds met their VIP guests Harry and Meghan - lookalikes Rhys Whittock and Sarah Mhlanga, both 35.Rich laughed: “Now that they’ve been guests on our day we think they’ll return the favour and invite us to their big day!“It was great to meet them. A lot of heads turned to see them there with us. It was the icing on the cake for our day!”In his speech Rich praised his new bride adding: Natalie, you look stunning today, I love you so much and I always will. I know well have an amazing life together.The newlywed husband also took a moment to thank The Sun on Sunday adding: Were eternally grateful for everything thats been done for us.While Prince Harry will remember his mother Princess Diana on his big day this week, Rich also took a moment to remember his brother Barry, who also passed away in a car accident when he was just 23-years-old in 2004. Choking back tears Rich admitted how much he missed his big brother on the most memorable day of his life.He said: Baz was my best friend and I know hed have loved Natalie and looked after her, I know wed all give anything to have him here.The happy couple then cut their amazing cake from Marks and Spencer that included carrot, lemon, fruit and chocolate tiers.With all formalities out of the way, it was time to kick back, relax and let loose – just as Harry and Meghan will at their private reception at Frogmore House.The guests all headed to the hotels Windsor Suite and as the band ‘Get On Up’ started performing Rich and Natalie took to the floor for their first dance.Guests laughed, danced, drank and ate sausage and bacon baps until the early hours before the music wound down.Wedding planner Francesca Cook who organised the day and, together with her team of staff, made sure everything went without a hitch, said: “We were thrilled to plan and host the wedding - it was a truly special day.”Natalie’s mum Bridget, 56, said: “We have been excited ever since Natalie and Rich won the competition. Its been a wonderful day.And Natalie said: “I can’t stop smiling. I don’t want this night to end. I’m worn out but delighted - everything has been perfect.”And it was a perfect day when Rich was born at the Beverley Westwood Hospital, East Yorks, in 1988 and he was chosen to meet Princess Diana who was opening the ward that day.His mum, post lady Kath, now 61 and married to retired businessman Sam, 67, told us: “I instantly said yes! I love the Royals.“So to have my son now marry in a wedding fit for royalty, just before Harry and Meghan, is a dream. It’s been a perfect day.“Meeting Harry’s mother Princess Diana 29 years ago when Richard was less than two hours old is etched in our memories. We are very lucky to have these memories entwined in our lives.“Little did we know the day Richard was born would come full circle nearly 30 years later and now Richard and Natalie will have their own royal story to tell their children and grandchildren like we have. Rich, Natalie and The Sun on Sunday would like to thank:Additional reporting: Kelly Jenkins. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

In Labour strongholds, you\u0027d be hard pressed to find any.But after the PM lost her Commons majority in last year\u0027s general election, she doesn\u0027t have the votes in the Commons for a widespread expansion of the grammar school system.So she\u0027s now attempting to boost the ones that are there already, with a \u0026#16350m fund to create thousands of extra places, many for pupils from poorer backgrounds.She has found a willing accomplice in Damian Hinds, a grammar school boy from Altrincham in Manchester\u0027s leafier suburbs, who was promoted to Education Secretary in the January reshuffle.His two predecessors in the job, Justine Greening and Nicky Morgan, both of whom were sacked by Mrs May, didn\u0027t care for grammar schools at all.Ms Greening, who last week urged employers to discriminate against applicants from Eton, is a steelworker\u0027s daughter from Rotherham who went to the town\u0027s Oakwood Comprehensive School.As the Lib Dem education spokeswoman Layla Moran put it, rather colourfully: \"We now know what we suspected. Justine Greening was moved on to make way for a lap dog for Theresa May\u0027s pet projects.\"So why the PM\u0027s enthusiasm for grammars? She and other supporters claim they\u0027re good for social mobility. Opponents say they do the exact opposite.After all, a grammar school in every town suggests a secondary modern in every town too. But you won\u0027t find many Tory MPs who support grammar schools backing a return of secondary moderns for children who fail the 11-plus.Ah yes, Tory MPs! Looking at the politics of all this, surely a big motive for the PM in the Government\u0027s \u0026#16350m handout to grammar schools is pleasing Conservative backbenchers. or at least those on the Tory Right.That\u0027s because Conservative MPs who love grammar schools are largely the same ones who hate the European Union.They\u0027re also the same MPs who are currently holding the PM to ransom on Brexit and threatening to topple her if she caves in to Remainers. So cynics will regard the latest boost for grammar schools as a sop to the Tory Right, a bone tossed in their direction in the increasingly bitter Brexit dogfight - even if the Prime Minister does indeed appear to have an obsession with grammar schools.According to political journalist Rosa Prince\u0027s biography of Theresa May, The Enigmatic Prime Minister, it was at school that she became interested in politics.By the time she was in the sixth form she was apparently confident enough to announce that she intended to become Britain\u0027s first woman Prime Minister."},{"url":null,"title":"crystal meth found home office","story":"NewsCrystal meth found in Home Office HQ as new chief Sajid Javid boasts about drug sniffer dogsEXCLUSIVE: Police were called to the Home Office 10 days ago after crystal meth was twice found in toilets, but failed to launch an investigation\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByNigel NelsonPolitical Editor22:30, 12 MAY 2018Updated22:31, 12 MAY 2018NewsHome Secretary Sajid Javid poses proudly with a sniffer dog – as it emerged drugs were found in his own department (Image: sajidjavid/TWITTER)\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet politics updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailPolice were called to the Home Office after a stash of crystal meth was found four days after new Home Secretary Sajid Javid took over. The highly-addictive drug, also known as ice, and a pipe to smoke it with were discovered by security guards in a disabled loo. It was the third such incident in six months at the Home Office, which is responsible for overseeing the nationwide war on drug abuse. Yet Scotland Yard decided not to mount a full investigation – with Government officials unable to say why. The embarrassing revelation came on the same day Mr Javid, who took over after Amber Rudd resigned a fortnight ago, tweeted a picture of himself with a Border Force officer and a sniffer dog called Trigger at Heathrow Airport. He posted: “We have impressive four-legged friends helping sniff out drugs, cash and illicit goods. Go Trigger!” Crystal meth, which featured in cult US television drama Breaking Bad, carries severe penalties for its use.  The stash of it was found on May 3 at the Home Office’s Marsham Street HQ in London’s Whitehall, where 5,000 staff are employed. An insider said: “Everyone in the building is talking about this. “We’re the lead department in the war against illegal drugs so it’s hugely embarrassing when they’re found under our noses. “Our job is to break the bad guys. not to feature in an episode of Breaking Bad.” In December last year crystal meth and a pipe were also found in a different Home Office disabled toilet. And last month cocaine was discovered elsewhere in the building. Security is tight at the Home Office, which is also responsible for co-ordinating the battle against terrorism. Visitors must go through a rigorous security system which involves body and bag scans and being sniffed by automatic devices for bombs. But staff have passes which allow them entry through automatic gates and their bags are not searched. The Home Office shares the building with Defra and Housing staff but all the drug finds occurred at its end of the premises. Buying drugs from a dealer could lay any user wide open to blackmail.  Tonight the Home Office was unable to say why the police are not investigating further. A spokeswoman told the Sunday Mirror: “We take incidents of this nature extremely seriously.” But Shadow police minister Louise Haigh said: “The Tories can’t even run their own Whitehall departments, let alone the country. With 21,000 fewer police on the beat thanks to Tory cuts, it’s crystal clear it’s time for change.” The discovery came hot on the heels of Ms Rudd quitting as Home Secretary in the Windrush immigration row. Mr Javid, formerly the Communities Secretary, walked into the Home Office on Monday, April 30 and the drugs were found on the following Thursday.

Public sector workers, pensioners, students, families with children in pushchairs and people with disabilities were among more than 25,000 protesters who marched through central London calling for an end to Tory spending cuts and “poverty” pay. Waving placards and blowing whistles, they packed the streets and brought parts of the capital to a standstill at the TUC’s A New Deal for Working People demonstration. Addressing the rain soaked crowds in London’s Hyde Park, Mr Corbyn said: “Our whole movement exists to challenge the powerful and stand up for the powerless. That’s why in government, we will give workers and employees more power at work, by strengthening their rights and freedoms to organise together to improve their lives.”  To huge cheers, he promised a future Labour government would launch a massive house building programme and bring the railways, Royal Mail and water firms back into public ownership. He also said workers would get a greater say in the running of their firms and promised to stand up for exploited workers against fatcat bosses and to clamp down on tax dodging corporations. More than 120 coaches were hired by TUC organisers to bring protesters to the capital while unions block booked tickets on trains. Victoria Embankment, where the mass rally began at midday, was turned into a sea of giant balloons and banners with union messages demanding: “No more cuts, no more austerity” and “\u0026pound10 minimum wage now”.  Trade unionists chanting “Tories out” called for a new \u0026pound10 an hour minimum wage, a ban on zero hours contracts and better funding for public services. They included workers involved in current disputes at restaurant chains TGI Fridays and McDonalds. The TUC says real wages are worth \u0026pound24 a week less than before the 2008 credit crunch while nearly four million workers are stuck on zero hours contracts, agency work and low paid self employment. Public servants have had to put up with low or non existent pay rises for eight years. And years of Tory cuts have led to poverty, homelessness and despair for many, say unions. Unison general secretary Dave Prentis, addressing the rally, said it was time for an end to cuts, and the “greed and hate” that defined Theresa May’s government.  He said: “Most public service workers - the cooks, the cleaners, the carers, many of them women - earn less in a year than some people in this country make in a day. “It’s ordinary people who are suffering. The survivors of the Grenfell tragedy are still homeless a year on. “The Windrush generation have been denied the care they need and told to go home by a callous government. Ministers said they wanted a hostile environment - so let’s create one for them, the Prime Minister and the politics of austerity.” TUC general secretary Frances O’Grady - whose organisation celebrates its 150th anniversary this year - said the “massive turnout” sent out a strong message to the Government. She said: “UK workers are suffering the worst pay squeeze for two centuries. This means families are struggling to get by. Millions of kids are growing up in poverty despite having parents in work. “The success of this country depends on workers’ labour. The people who build cars, mend our roads, drive the trains, teach our children and tend the sick.”  Dave Ward of the Communication Workers Union added: “This is the start of a serious challenge for a new deal for workers.” Mother of two and shopworkers union shop steward Vanessa Kirk, 53, of Basingstoke, Hants, earns \u0026pound8.75 an hour as Co-op convenience store worker. She wants the Government to bring in a \u0026pound10 an hour minimum wage. She said: “There are no set shift patterns and it’s hard to get to concurrent days off. You get more and more put on you for no extra pay. I used to be happy but the pressure they put on you the less you enjoy it.” "},{"url":null,"title":"you can trust deliver theresa","story":"News“You can trust me to deliver\": Theresa May to insist Brexit has not run aground - despite ministers at war with each otherAnd she repeated her determination to quit both the single market and the customs union\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByNigel NelsonPolitical Editor23:01, 12 MAY 2018News (Image: Dinendra Haria/WENN)\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet politics updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailTheresa May will tomorrow insist Brexit has not run aground despite ministers at war with each other.

But splits in her Cabinet are now so serious the PM has been forced to set up rival teams to sort out her two options to replace the EU customs union. One is looking at the customs partnership Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson branded “crazy.” This would see the UK collecting EU duty on imports and giving refunds on goods destined for Britain.   That’s being thrashed out by International Trade Secretary Liam Fox and Environment Secretary Michael Gove in favour of it and Cabinet Office minister David Lidington who is against.   The so-called max-fac or maximum facilitation option will be chewed over by Business Secretary Greg Clark, Brexit Secretary David Davis and Northern Ireland boss Karen Bradley.

But despite the eight per cent reduction, the tubs will still cost \u0026shyfamilies the same at \u0026pound5.35.

But consumer champ-ions are not impressed, seeing shrinkflation as merely a sneaky way of raising prices.   Alex Neill, of watchdog Which?, said: “Time and again we’ve seen popular products shrinking while the price stays the same, and this latest example will leave ice cream lovers feeling cold.

Around 85 per cent of the world’s supply of vanilla pods comes from \u0026shyMadagascar, where a cyclone and \u0026shypolitical unrest have sent prices sky high.

Callum Crowley\u0027s horrified mum said she was told to expect the worst after the terrifying fall, which happened as he played with friends. The schoolboy, now 13, told mother Kate Sherwin: It\u0027s all my fault, I\u0027m going to die.  Incredibly he survived the ordeal, Wales Online reports, and Callum\u0027s family have hailed his \u0027miracle\u0027 recovery.  The schoolboy, who is now 13, had been playing with friends when he nearly fell to his death. Callum’s mother Kate Sherwin had been cooking dinner at their home in Cwmbran on May 6, 2017, when she received the news.  Kate, 35, said: “Callum’s friend Marcus came in crying and said Callum had had a fall but didn’t go into detail.”  It was only after rushing to Callum on Llewellyn Road in Cwmbran that the scale of the accident became apparent.  Kate said: “With the way Marcus was crying and behaving you could tell there was something more. Callum has ADHD and with that he has no fear at all. “When I got there there was a police officer before I turned the corner.” Kate found her son lying on the floor, still conscious. She said: “I turned the corner and saw someone was on the floor. A woman was floating over him. “He was crying - he said to me ‘it’s all my fault, I’m going to die’. I burst into tears.” Kate, who is now eight and a half months pregnant, said: “My first thought was that he had gone to the first level and fallen and had broken a leg or an arm so for safety they were keeping him still. “There was a woman who had seen him on the scaffolding so I said ‘how high was he?’ and she said ‘from the top ladder’. “I remember looking up and up and up until I got to the roof and on the roof there was a ladder.”   After being painstakingly moved from the pavement to the ambulance, Callum was taken to the Royal Gwent Hospital in Newport where a scan revealed the full extent of his injuries.  From there he was taken to Bristol, undergoing eight hours of emergency surgery before months of rehabilitation in Stoke Mandeville Hospital in Aylesbury. Kate said: “We were put in a family room and they wouldn’t tell us anything, they wouldn’t let us in. I just wanted to be there to hold his hand, stroke his hair and tell him I loved him. “They had to put him in a coma so they could scan him. That was when they found out about the severity of the injuries. He had bleeding on the brain, he had a punctured lung, internal bleeding and a ruptured spleen. His whole body was a mess. “We were told to expect the worst.” In the early hours of Sunday morning Callum’s family found themselves praying for a miracle as he went into surgery. Kate said: “They said there was a good chance he wouldn’t make it as he had to lie on his stomach [for surgery] because of his spine. We were told because of the internal pressure it could cause problems. “I have never prayed so much in my life. He went to the surgery at 3pm and was back out at 11. He had 12 screw bolts in his spine and two rods.” For Callum and his family the operation was followed by weeks of progress but also new worries. A further inflammation of the spine saw Callum go under the knife once again, while new concerns began to surface that he could not feel his legs. “At one point Callum stopped eating,” Kate said. “We tried everything to get him eating again, we would get his favourite food or bring food in. When friends came to talk to him he would have a bite or two just to please everyone.” Kate said: “They said there was a good chance he wouldn’t make it as he had to lie on his stomach [for surgery] because of his spine. We were told because of the internal pressure it could cause problems.

A community gardens project, a bread-baking initiative to help older people living in care homes and sheltered housing, and a children’s drama group are among those who will benefit this year. Up to \u0026pound3million has been awarded to 57 causes across the UK, making a massive impact on each deserving cause. It follows months of planning for the campaign, which led to a 2 week voting window to decide which which groups and organisations would finally be declared winners out of a shortlist of 95 projects across all 19 regions.  In each region, the three projects with the most public votes received grants of up to \u0026pound50,000 to help them continue their work to bring people together, build stronger communities and improve the lives of thousands of people across the country.

The Baking A Difference scheme, which started last year, uses bread baking to bring older people in care homes and sheltered \u2028housing together with local communities. “We are excited to get this funding because, although it is a simple idea, there are so many ways to explore it,” says project manager Fiona Smith. “Creative bread making sparks conversations, it keeps hands and minds busy, it offers physical activity and fun.” The money will help widen the project to other care homes and sheltered housing in Leicestershire, pay for the time and materials of a professional baker and train and mentor volunteers. “The idea is to create bonds of friendship and reduce feelings of loneliness, isolation or boredom,” adds Fiona.

Harry took Meghan to meet the Queen for afternoon tea at Buckingham Palace in October last year to introduce her to the woman he wanted to wed. Although the monarch was unlikely to have withheld her blessing, she would only have said no on the advice of the Prime Minister, whom she will have informed.  The official document states: Now know ye that we have consented and do by these presents signify our consent to the contracting of matrimony between our most dearly beloved grandson Prince Henry Charles Albert David of Wales KCVO and Rachel Meghan Markle. The wording differs from the instrument signed to give consent to the marriage of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge in 2011 when Kate was described as our trusty and well-beloved Catherine. For hundreds of years, the Royal Marriages Act 1772 required descendants of George II to seek the sovereign\u0027s consent before they wed, otherwise their marriages were deemed invalid.  But this law was repealed through the Succession to the Crown Act 2013, which came into effect in 2015 when all the Commonwealth countries, where the Queen is head of state, passed any necessary legislation. The new Act still requires the first six people in the line of succession to obtain the Queen\u0027s permission.  Harry was fifth in line when he got engaged, but is now sixth with the birth of Prince Louis. If Harry failed to get the Queen\u0027s approval, he and his future descendants would be disqualified from succeeding to the Crown. The Act was a radical shake-up of the rules of royal succession, removing male bias. Thanks to the new law, a member of the royal family can now also marry a Roman Catholic and not lose their place in the line of succession.  But a Roman Catholic royal still cannot be king or queen.

Just days away from her wedding to Prince Harry , the American actress has been warned never to rock the boat and beware some of the family.  In what many on the outside have seen as a turbulent preparation to the wedding amid family fallout, Diana’s former private secretary Patrick Jephson has written a book on how to be a successful royal newcomer. He has voiced his opinion on the need to fit in and avoid the sort of reception the American Wallis Simpson received when she married into the royal family.  The extremely controversial time in the United Kingdom’s history caused a constitutional crisis that led to the abdication of British king Edward VIII. But Mr Jephson says by following some simple steps the former Suits star has what it takes to be at the heart of the House of Windsor.  Mr Jephson’s guide for Meghan in his book The Meghan Factor, which has been adapted for the Daily Mail , includes advice like “don’t forget about the chaps”, “be true to yourself” and “steer clear of politics”.  He said: “Her job is to exist, preferably without rocking the constitutional boat. “And if, in the process, by the way she conducts her own life, she gently inspires us to do more and better with our own, then she\u0027ll probably be treated with respect and remembered with affection far into the future.”  Mr Jephson added that Princess Diana was always very aware of her own self worth and always tried to earn the awards she was given and it is important that Meghan does not form a “false sense of her own self worth”. After previously relying on her acting skills, Meghan has been warned to keep up the act, but has been told to remain authentic and give the public an honest reflection of who she really is.

Forecasters are keeping watch of a ridge of high pressure on course to skirt the British Isles and lure warm and sunny weather back towards the country. Values are expected to rise up to 4-8C above normal for the time of year on Monday and Tuesday as warm air from the south dislodges the current cool and unsettled westerly airflow. Some computer models are indicating highs could reach close to 20C in north-east England by Tuesday, and up to 15-19C elsewhere. The best of the weather will be in central and north-east England where high pressure will supply a brief window of sunshine and high temperatures.  However, scattered showers are still likely in the south and west on Monday, followed by further outbreaks on Tuesday - although these will be largely confined to north-east Scotland. The balmy outlook comes after forecasts of heavy rain and thunder in parts of the west this weekend as a series of lows from the Atlantic take charge. Temperatures will also dip below average in places over the two days, with risk of frost in Northern Ireland and Wales, before rising sharply from Monday.  Katie Greening, forecaster of The Weather Channel , said the mercury will spike early next week after a bout of cool and unsettled weather over the weekend.  She said: Temperatures will be unseasonably cool the time of year next week, but spiking slightly above average Tuesday. High pressure forecast, with sunny spells and fair weather likely. The warmest day will be Tuesday, with highs peaking at 19C in London. The higher temperatures will be as a result of the flow of warmer air from the south ahead of low pressure. In its wake temperatures will lower in the following northerly to north-westerly wind.” "},{"url":null,"title":"wedding marcher american bishop invited","story":"NewsWedding marcher: American bishop invited by Meghan Markle to give address will protest against Donald Trump days laterMeghan Markle personally invited Michael Curry to speak when she marries Prince Harry\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByAlan Selby22:59, 12 MAY 2018NewsRev Curry has a busy few weeks ahead (Image: REUTERS)\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThe American bishop invited by Meghan Markle to give an address at the Royal \u0026shyWedding is to march on the White House against Donald Trump four days later. Michael Curry will join a Washington protest over what he calls the president’s “dangerous” leadership. The first African-American to be primate of the Episcopal Church – a US offshoot of the Church of England – he has branded Trump’s America First policy “a theological heresy for the followers of Christ”. And the Most Rev Bishop Curry also blasted a “crisis of moral and political leadership at the highest levels of our government”.  His invitation comes months after the Royal Family confirmed Mr Trump would not be invited to the wedding. Rev Curry, 65, will give a reading at the ceremony in St George’s Chapel, Windsor, on Saturday. After his invitation was announced today he said: “The love that has brought and will bind Prince Harry and Ms Meghan Markle together has its source and origin in God, and is the key to life and happiness.” Rev Curry, from Chicago, has previously backed gay marriage and transgender rights. His latest attack on Mr Trump came in a letter to the president last week, which Mr Curry signed along with 22 other \u0026shyChristian leaders. It said: “We reject the resurgence of white nationalism and racism in our nation on many fronts, including the highest levels of \u0026shypolitical leadership.” Religious commentators also believe the letter accused Trump of repeatedly lying in office, even though it did not name him explicitly.

The image was innocently shared by a teenager who wanted to proudly show off his new pet. Dominic Ibaos, 16, was stunned when the picture was reported as an indecent image after he posted it in a group for animal lovers. The viewer saw the dog\u0027s bald body, wrinkled neck and pink head and thought it was a \u0027d**k pic\u0027. In reality it showed a rare Xoloitzcuintli - or Mexican hairless - puppy named Dimitri.  Dominic only realised it could be mistaken for something else after the same photograph was banned from a local animal lovers group. Facebook notified him that his image had been removed from the group because it ‘didn’t follow their community standards’. Luckily he saw the funny side after he shared the notification online the penis-lookalike puppy went viral with more than 60,000 retweets, likes and shares. However the teenager joked that it was hard for him to see his puppy as a penis. Dominic, from Davao City in the Philippines, said: “It’s really hard for me to see the penis perspective because when I look at it I always just see the puppy.  “I got a notification saying it had been blocked a few minutes after I posted it to the group. “At that time I didn’t realise it looked like a penis because when I first posted it to Facebook all I saw was a photograph of an innocent puppy. “It actually made me really angry for a moment, but I feel better about it now because people find it hilarious. “I find it really funny that it’s causing all this attention because it looks like a penis, yet the photo is something I can keep sharing because it’s also not. “It just makes me happy that people find it so funny. One person told me it was the best laugh they’d had for weeks.” Although three-day-old pup Dimitri was born in a litter of three to mum Daisy, he is the only hairless puppy.

We were both only 18 and we didn’t have the money for that.“The ceremony took place at 8.30am because it was the day of the students’ charity event when they would decorate floats and parade them around the city so all the streets were closing.“After the wedding ceremony, we went back to my mum and dad’s house for a small wedding breakfast before heading to the Palace Theatre and then the carnival.“On our wedding night we went home and our best man, my cousin David Cunningham, made us stovies.“It wasn’t a grand day and we definitely couldn’t afford a honeymoon but it was fantastic.“Although all the pictures are black and white, I remember John’s suit being a powder blue colour.”In the image seen here, the young girl gifting the happy couple a traditional horseshoe is Mary’s cousin June Kay, who is now 66 herself.Mary, a retired teacher, and John, a retired roofer, have two sons, Stephen and John, as well as six grandchildren and one great-granddaughter.It was one of their grandchildren who inspired Mary’s gift to John for their diamond anniversary.Mary said: “My granddaughter had asked why John never wore a wedding ring and the answer was he never had one to wear!“We were lucky to have been able to buy my wedding ring but John never got one.“For my gift to him this year, I bought him a gold wedding band which he now wears.“He bought me a dozen yellow roses but was shocked at the price of 12 flowers!”During their anniversary celebrations, the couple were visited at their Broughty Ferry home by Lord Provost Ian Borthwick who presented them with a bouquet of flowers and they also received a card of congratulation from the Queen.John said: “It has been 60 good years of happiness, laughter and banter. I wouldn’t change Mary for the world.“I was a lost man going down the wrong path until I met her.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/05/20180510_142748_edited-605x564.jpg ","title":"dundee people norrie seeking old friends from the 50s and 60s for a dundee reunion","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA former Dundee man is hoping to contact some old friends from the 1950s and 60s to organise a reunion.Norrie Webber, who now lives across the water in Newport-on-Tay, attended St Michael’s School in Graham Street and St Vincent’s in Pitkerro Road.He can recall finishing his secondary education at St Michael’s just as actor Brian Cox was starting his first year and remembers seeing him around the school, although they were not friends.Norrie, 74, went on to work in JF Irvine’s in Dundee and was one of the members of staff carrying out stocktaking duties when The Beatles made a detour through the shop to avoid huge crowds of fans and reach the Caird Hall during their visit to the city in 1964.Another popular haunt was Fortes Cafe in Dura Street where Norrie and his friends would meet up and enjoy the music.Anyone wishing to contact Norrie can do so by calling 07821 480595.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/05/5af41275e84ab-e1525953095948-423x564.jpg ","title":"dundee people paramedics thanked for helping dundee baby girl","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA mum-of-two has sent a heartfelt thank you to two paramedics who came to her aid when her 10-month-old daughter stopped breathing.Catriona Grant, 29, was at home with her youngest child, Rosie, when the tot started having breathing problems just before 11am last Saturday.The Perth mum called 999 immediately, and within minutes paramedic Irena Davidova and trainee technician Valerie Fairgray arrived at her home.Catriona thanked the Scottish Ambulance Service medics who helped her through the “horrible” experience.She said: “I put in an emergency call asking for an ambulance because Rosie couldn’t breathe all of a sudden.“The paramedics arrived within minutes but thankfully she had cleared her airway on her own in that time.“The crew who arrived were so kind and I just want them to be recognised for this.“They spent about 30 minutes checking her over.”Catriona, whose daughter Isla, three, was away at the time of the incident, said she wanted to show her gratitude to Irena and Valerie – both based at Perth Ambulance Station – for their “genuine kindness”.She added: “Rosie is doing fine now. It’s very scary when your child stops breathing properly, but the paramedics were so reassuring and thorough.“They treated us with such genuine kindness and it really struck me.“I want them to know how grateful I am and what a wonderful a job they did.

I still wanted her to be able to go on her walks, but I realised she could do with a little bit of help.“I had seen something similar to the doggy buggy when I was on holiday and decided to see if I could find something like it to help Aime out.“I went online and I got this doggy buggy.“It’s only just arrived, but when I put Aime in it she took to it like a duck to water.“She was happy to sit in it and looked as proud as punch sitting there.“I pushed her up and down the hall a bit and she was absolutely happy.“We haven’t been out in it yet but I’m quite sure it will be perfect for her.“She will be able to walk as far as she likes then I can pop her in the buggy and she can finish our walk in comfort.“I, too, suffer a little bit from arthritis, so the buggy is going to have the added benefit of giving me a little bit of support while out on a walk.“I can sometimes struggle a bit as well but by pushing the buggy I get support too, so it’s ideal both for Aime and me.”Jessie said other people are already beginning to ask her about the buggy.She said: “I found it quite easily and I’ve been told they are quite popular in America.“If it gives other people an idea of how to help out their beloved dog if it’s older or struggles while out walking, then I’ll be very happy.“Fingers crossed it’s a success.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/05/5af564f13d539.jpg ","title":"fashionistas get style advice at the overgate","story":"\t\t\t\t\tThe Overgate’s style studio was bang on trend as it hosted a special event as part of Dundee Fashion Week.Shoppers received pointers from two local fashion bloggers and were even given free eyelash extensions at yesterday’s one-off event.It saw shoppers browse must-have fashion staples for men and women from retailers including Debenhams, Topshop, River Island, New Look, Superdry, Topman, Oasis, Next and Quiz.The two women behind fashion blog Wardrobe Conversation, Helen Macdonald and Kimberley Grahame, were there to help those in need of style guidance.Helen said: “Helping style women is something we do all the time and it is really nice to be able to give out some advice.

There’s a few dodgy ones with the ball bouncing around and maybe a suggestion of a penalty but I felt we were well worth our three points.”County were furious at referee Andrew Dallas’ decision to book Michael Gardyne for diving with five minutes to go.Co-manager Stuart Kettlewell said: “I know there is human error in football but at the end of the day these decisions are massive.“But if you get a penalty at that stage of the game who knows what happens, you have an opportunity to get level and build momentum to win the game.“We would love to know who is accountable because we just get fobbed off all the time.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/05/5af564ee74570-e1526045769808-840x564.jpg ","title":"plans for affordable housing near new dundee super school","story":"\t\t\t\t\tThe second phase of a new housing development in the north-east of Dundee offering 28 affordable new homes has been unveiled.Housebuilders Merchant Homes and the housing association Home Group Scotland are behind the multi-phase plan to develop brownfield land between Haddington Avenue, Berwick Drive, Lothian Crescent and Dunbar Park in Whitfield.The homes will sit directly behind The Crescent community centre, and will be close to Ballumbie Primary School and the new North East Campus “super-school”.Proposals for the first phase of the development, containing 13 homes that will sit on Haddington Avenue, were unveiled earlier this year.In a planning statement submitted by Merchant Homes and Home Group Scotland (HGS), the firms said the development would suit the Whitfield area due to the ongoing residential regeneration that has unfolded over the last two decades.The land on which the new homes will sit was once the site of the Skarne-style blocks which dominated the Whitfield skyline.The new homes, the planners have pledged, will have affordable rents and be energy-efficient.The companies jointly said: “The proposal is for residential development that will provide a viable and marketable development consisting of private and affordable housing.“This is an awkward and challenging site in terms of shape, topography and existing services.“These factors have largely shaped the approach that has been taken to the development of the layout for the three phases.“Consequently, it is felt that the proposals respond to the client’s brief and the requirements of Dundee City Council’s Local Development Plan to provide a design solution of high quality, which harmonises with the location and provides a development of high quality for the future residents.”In all, the completed development will have 41 homes, all of which will have driveways, and 75% of the homes will have at least three bedrooms.HGS is also involved in other developments in the Whitfield area, such as the new-build homes which have been constructed on Summerfield Avenue.The developers have said the homes will look much the same as those that have been built already.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"ross county wide man michael gardyne on dundee and uniteds radar","story":"\t\t\t\t\tWIth survival assured on Tuesday night, Dundee boss Neil McCann’s “recruitment drive” for next season is up and running.And one possible arrival could be Ross County playmaker Michael Gardyne – though, the Dark Blues may well have competition from across the city on their hands.The Dundonian is out of contract at the end of this season and, with his roots down here, a move back might be on the cards.His history with Dundee United – where he played 37 times in season 2012/13 – however, makes Tannadice a more likely destination for the 32-year-old.That’s likely to be dependent on whether Csaba Laszlo’s men can win promotion to the top flight via the play-offs.The Dark Blues won’t comment on any possible signings but gaffer Neil has been able to get working on improving his squad for next season after the 1-0 win at Ross County saw them guaranteed a ninth-place finish.He said: “The plans we’ve been looking at over the past five or six months in terms of recruitment we can actually start to push forward with now and start a bit of a recruitment drive.“I don’t think you can ever push on it 100% until you know you’re going to be safe.“Tuesday’s win allows us to start forward thinking but there’s still business to be done.“I’m not going to disrespect Ross County by going into Saturday (against Partick) and taking the foot off the gas and go through the motions, because we have to be professional.”Partick sit two points ahead of the Staggies in 11th spot and still with the possibility of catching Hamilton and jumping to safety.
