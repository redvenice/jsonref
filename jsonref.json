Ali has three kids and being away with the national teams and then 10 days in isolation with the same rubbish again... we need solutions for that and they are still not there. “They have played in Brazil so they already had four days there not in a red list country and that’s what counts. Then another six days not in a red list country, then they can come back and start immediately - so even when they go from bubble to bubble to bubble, it is still 10 days and for us that is the solution.” The Brazilian duo’s absence adds to Klopp’s selection issues as he has also lost Curtis Jones, who came back injured from England Under-21 duty, while fellow midfielder Thiago Alcantara is still not ready to return from a calf injury. It has not helped the Liverpool manager’s preparation and he is still not happy Saturday’s kick-off was not pushed back to the evening to give him an outside chance of fielding Alisson and Fabinho. “As you know, Atletico are not playing at the weekend and something like that would never happen here,” said Klopp. “And if it would happen then it would be ‘Oh my god, how can they do it for them?’. We ask only for a few hours that would have made it a little bit more likely they could have played but bringing them in for 12:30, there’s no chance for them. “If we had played seven o’clock then we would have probably tried it but neither Watford nor the Premier League was open to that kind of thing - their understanding of fair competition. We made the decision a while ago.” Having spent the past week bending over backwards to kow-tow to fans, it seems remarkably tin-eared of the new regime to leave a man few if any fans want at the club in charge.“I don’t think it depends on Patrick, we construct our offensive game in a collective manner,” he said. “Of course having a player that converts the chances increases the possibility of getting more goals. You asked me if it worries me, I say yes. “I would like that we create more chances at goal and increase the efficiency. Both things have a margin for improvement and of course, if Patrick were here, we would enjoy the contribution that he makes. But in a parallel way we are ready to be at the same level in the games when he is not there.”  Bielsa is hoping to include Raphinha in his matchday squad at Southampton after the winger marked his full international debut with two goals for Brazil against Uruguay in Manaus – over 8,000km away from Saint Mary’s - in the early hours of this morning. “Football is a state of your mood, but muscular tiredness affects your performance and puts the players at risk of injury,” he said. Bielsa will also be monitoring Kalvin Phillips, with the midfielder bidding to recover from a calf strain that forced his withdrawal from England’s squad. “He has possibilities to play and we will decide between Friday and Saturday,” Bielsa said. Stuart Dallas and Mateusz Klich are both available following international duty with Northern Ireland and Poland respectively, while Jack Harrison has recovered from a knock which kept him on the bench in Leeds’ first win of the season against Watford two weeks ago. Defenders Robin Koch, who will have minor surgery in America to resolve a pelvic problem, and Luke Ayling (knee) remain sidelined.  “When we won our promotion in the play-off final they won the Champions League,” said Frank, referring back to a fateful day in May day for two clubs separated geographically by just six miles. “I think that’s a very good picture of the difference between the two clubs. It is a team with world-class players and, with the transfer of Romelu Lukaku, it is more or less complete. They have top quality players in every position and one of the best managers in the world in Thomas Tuchel. I don’t think there is a weak spot. “Every game in the Premier League is a big game, but to face the European champions and the number one in the Premier League is a huge challenge. But we love that challenge and we believe in ourselves. We can’t wait for the game.” “We signed him because of the quality he gives us and we know what he can give us,” said Smith. “He shows that every day in training and it won’t be long before he’s in the team. We have never put any pressure on trying to handle any price tag or numbers because the players aren’t in control of that. That is what someone is willing to pay for them. “Their job is to go out and work hard every day and be ready to perform in the arena on a match day. I have seen a player there who is able to do that. He’s getting to where we want him to be. He got injured during pre-season so he was lacking the fitness in the first couple of games. He was getting up to speed, scored his first goal against Brentford, and then had to go off with Argentina. “We played very well at Chelsea and decided to go with the same system and unfortunately he didn’t get the nod in the Everton game. He has a lot of qualities but the one I have seen over the last three or four weeks is a drive and desire to succeed. I think all players need that and he has that in abundance.” Douglas Luiz and Emiliano Martinez will only return from international duty with Brazil and Argentina today but Smith expects to have them in his matchday squad for tomorrow’s derby. Leon Bailey remains out with a hamstring injury but he could be in contention for next Friday’s trip to Arsenal while Bertrand Traore (thigh) is being assessed and Keinan Davis and Morgan Sanson are back in training. “I don’t really react, or get involved in any kind of speculation, especially when there is someone who I have the utmost respect for sitting in that job, that the speculation is about,” he said.  “For me, I am in a very big job and a very big role here that I am very much fully focused on. We have got a top of the table clash at the weekend and it’s a game I’m very much looking forward to. “I’ve certainly got one eye on Newcastle, in terms of watching Brucey get his 1000th game. He’s a great character of the game, someone who I’ve got a personal relationship with, and have the utmost respect for. I’ve really looking forward to seeing him get his 1000th game. I think it’s a mammoth achievement.”“They’re a top side,” said Sean Dyche ahead of tomorrow’s game. “Top manager and top group of players. They’ve spent a lot of money but very wisely in my opinion with some top talents and then moulded it into a very good unit. “These are very tough challenges. But we have beaten them, we’ve drawn against them. We won at Liverpool last year, we won at Arsenal. Things can change but statistically it’s very tough.” In summer signing Maxwel Cornet, Burnley do have a player who has scored four goals in three games against Pep Guardiola’s men while playing for Lyon. The winger has been out with a hamstring injury but could return this weekend.  “Other than the true match fitness, which usually finishes off with playing, we’re hoping he’s fit and well and ready to go,” said Dyche. “He’s got a nice attacking threat, which is obviously why we brought him to the club and the scouts promoted the idea of bringing him to the club. Good all round early doors. “He’s getting better with his English, he’s adapting, his manner’s really good, he’s got a nice smile on his face, he wants to play. So far I’ve been impressed by him, not just his abilities. I don’t think Pep will be that worried about Burnley but he’s never lacked respect of what we’re trying to achieve.” Burnley skipper Ben Mee is unavailable after testing positive for coronavirus so Nathan Collins could start, while summer signing Connor Roberts is in contention for the first time. Matej Vydra and Charlie Taylor are doubts. All those evacuated were iniduals deemed to be at the “highest risk” in a country which has been under the control of the Taliban since August. The refugees left the cvountry yesterday. Football’s world governing body said it had received assistance in the evacuation effort from the government of Qatar, the country which will host next year’s men’s World Cup. “Fifa would like to express its sincere thanks to the government of Qatar for its support facilitating extensive discussions and for ensuring the safe passage of these iniduals, deemed to have been at the highest risk, on to a Qatar Airways charter flight from Kabul, Afghanistan to Doha, Qatar,” they said in a statement. “The Fifa leadership has been closely co-ordinating with the government of Qatar since August on the evacuation of the group, and will continue to work closely on the safe evacuation of further members of the sporting family in the future.” Taliban officials were quoted last month saying women and girls would be banned from playing sport, saying it was “not necessary”. Afghanistan’s women’s team withdrew from Asian Cup qualification in Tajikistan last month. Performance in the Asian Cup finals will dictate which teams from the continent qualify for the 2023 Women’s World Cup in Australia and New Zealand. Female players from around the world, including Chelsea’s Norway international Maren Mjelde, are contributing to a fund established by world players’ union Fifpro to support footballers evacuated from Afghanistan. In light of this news, it’s worth revisiting this sensational article written by our own Suzanne Wrack about the dedicated crew of people who helped the women’s national football team and others to flee the Taliban over two remarkable weeks back in August. The 24-year-old, who moved to Arsenal from Brighton during the summer, also admitted that he doesn’t watch a huge amount of football in his spare time. “Football is so intense,” he said. “You come in every day giving 100 per cent. All I want to do is go home and not think about it, then come in in the morning fresh and ready to give 100 per cent again. I watch myself for analytical reasons. I watch England, maybe, but I’m always busy doing something. I wouldn’t just sit down and watch a game.” The Saints skipper is suspended following his deserved but somewhat unfortunate red card in defeat at Chelsea prior to the international break so Ibrahima Diallo is likely to get a rare start in midfield. On-loan Chelsea forward Armando Broja will return to contention having been ineligible to play against his parent club, but striker Che Adams will miss out after suffering a muscle injury while on international duty with Scotland. Leeds head coach Marcelo Bielsa has not ruled out winger Raphinha, who scored twice for Brazil in their 4-1 win over Urugay on his first start for his country in the early hours of this morning. Leeds will be without striker Patrick Bamford, who remains sidelined with an ankle injury. Kalvin Phillips will be assessed after withdrawing from the England squad last week due to a calf strain. “We’ve only played seven matches and it’s not like we’ve been the incredibly dominant team and deserved to win all the games,” said Potter. “The margins have been quite tight, they’ve gone in our favour this time. A lot of the time last year they didn’t. “A lot of the performances and performance data was good last year but because we hadn’t really got the points you couldn’t turn round and say our xG (expected goals) is this or our performance data is this. “We were down the bottom of the league and fighting relegation so you’ve just got to keep working. In terms of our performance level, the players have been consistent over a period of time and, as is often the case in football, sometimes you get the rub of the green and sometimes you don’t. “You have to deal with those two sides of the coin in the same way, not think you’ve cracked it when it’s going your way and not think it’s the end of the world when it goes the opposite way.” Steve Bruce has defied the expectations of many – himself included, one suspects – by remaining in situ under Newcastle’s new owners and looks certain to take charge for his milestone 1,000th game in management when his side host Tottenham Hotspur on Sunday afternoon.  We’ll hear from Steve and lots of other top flight managers ahead of the weekend’s action, while bringing you any other news and talking points that happen to present themselves as the day unfolds.

Photograph: Gareth ChaneyCollins PhotosThere is likely to be a “significant removal” of Covid-19 restrictions at the end of next week, Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney has said, despite concerns about a recent turn for the worse in a number of pandemic indicators. A further 1,627 cases were reported on Thursday, and rising infection numbers, hospitalisations and test positivity rates have caused alarm in health and political circles ahead of the proposed removal of most remaining pandemic restrictions from next Friday, October 22nd.HSE chief executive Paul Reid on Friday said the the recent rise in case numbers is “not a panic button” moment but an early warning signal.Mr Coveney told reporters in Cork that he did not think the Government would “abandon plans to remove restrictions at the end of next week”. He said the question was whether they would be able to do so “as much as we would have liked”. “We have seen a 12 per cent increase in the number of people testing positive in the last week - of course that is a concern. It’s not a big surprise, but it’s something we need to watch,” he said.“The Government will do what we always do when we make a decision in relation to Covid. We will take public health advice, we will look at the science and we will make an informed decision.“I think the likelihood is that there will be a significant removal of restrictions at the end of next week, but whether we will be able to go as far as we would have liked or as far as we had announced would be the case remains to be seen.”Earlier, Minister for Health Simon Harris said perspective was needed in the discussion on the further easing of restrictions given more than 90 per cent of adults in the State are vaccinated against the disease. He told RTÉ’s Morning Ireland that the Government did not face a binary choice whether to proceed with reopening or to pause. There could, he said, be a third option where some restrictions were eased while “retaining vaccine certs or face masks for a bit longer”. He said any advice over the easing of restrictions needed to come from doctors not politicians.Vaccine protectionMr Reid told RTÉ’s Today with Claire Byrne programme that Covid-19 vaccines were protecting people from illness, hospitalisation and death, but that the evidence suggested the small proportion of unvaccinated people was having a disproportionate impact on the health service.He said that while “just 8 per cent” of the adult population remained unvaccinated, 67 per cent of those in intensive care were unvaccinated, with the cohort 17 times more likely to be hospitalised if they contracted the virus.Mr Reid said people returning to offices and engaging in more social activity were a factor in the rising case numbers. “This is a very early warning for us all,” he said. Regarding a Covid-19 vaccine booster campaign, Mr Reid said the HSE was ready and willing but was awaiting expert advice from the National Immunisation Advisory Committee (Niac). In the meantime, however, he said there was a need to encourage the 300,000 or so people who had not had a vaccine, and 70,000 who had received a first but not a second dose, to do so. Niac chair Prof Karina Butler said there were several factors behind the recent growth in Covid-19 infections but the “real elephant in the room” in the debate was the high level of unvaccinated people in the country.She said it was necessary to examine why that was the case and to fill the gaps in information to give those people the trust and confidence that getting vaccinated was the way forward.Prof Butler said now might not be the best time to give booster vaccines to the general population and that it could be more beneficial to wait longer and to help instead with the global vaccine distribution.She told RTÉ’s Morning Ireland there was no specific date on which Niac would be giving advice to the Government on a wider booster programme as work was ongoing collating evidence. Prof Butler said Niac was also reviewing evidence on the impact of infection on those under 12. “The first goal was to get everyone vaccinated, and that is still the prime focus if we want to reduce circulation and protect those for whatever reason the vaccine hasn’t fully protected them,” she said. “As always we are following the evidence. We know that immunity is quite long-lasting.”Under pressureMr Reid acknowledged that the hospital system was under pressure with the numbers presenting to emergency departments some 20 per cent above pre-pandemic levels. “This is going to be a very challenging winter,” he said, adding private hospitals would be part of the solution.HSE chief operations officer Anne O’Connor earlier told Newstalk there were just 100 available hospital beds in the State last night out of the 12,000 across the health system.She said the health service was going to do things in a different way to try to keep people out of hospital amid rising pressures due to Covid-19 and other matters.“It’s only October, but it’s like the first week in January” she told Newstalk Breakfast of the numbers attending emergency departments. “Hospitals are very busy – there are significant numbers attending emergency departments, far in excess of what we saw in 2020 and 2019.”Ms O’Connor said the HSE intended to focus on community care, utilising nursing homes for step down beds and home support to create extra capacity. “It’s about having a range of options,” she said.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"covid 19 vaccine tracker how many people have been inoculated in ireland","story":"It has been over a year since the first case of Covid-19 was confirmed in the Republic of Ireland. Since then, over 300,000 people have been diagnosed in the State, and over 5,000 people have died.Globally, over 200 million people have been diagnosed and over 4\u0026nbspmillion have died since the virus was first identified in China in December 2019.Four of these have been authorised for use in the EU - one from AstraZeneca, one from BioNTech-Pfizer, one from Moderna and another from Johnson \u0026amp Johnson (Janssen).The EU has put in place purchase agreements with Sanofi-GSK\u0026nbspand Curevac, and\u0026nbsphas concluded exploratory talks with two other vaccine producers - Novavax and Valneva.Ireland, along with all other EU member states, will get a proportional amount of every vaccine that is approved for use by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) according to its population.But how do these other vaccines work, and when will they be approved for use here? Have there been any reported side effects? And when can you expect to receive a vaccine?The  Vaccine Tracker will be updated daily as the country embarks on the largest inoculation programme in the history of the State.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 70°C.EMA approval: Granted on December 21st.Overview: Developed by New York-based Pfizer and German company BioNTech this vaccine has a brand name of Comirnaty. It uses messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, which has instructions for producing a protein from Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. The person’s immune system recognises this protein as foreign and produces antibodies and activates T-cells (white blood cells) to attack it, giving them immunity. The vaccine will last for six months when stored at -70C, and five days when stored at between 2 and 8 degrees Celsius. The EU has approved the withdrawal of six doses from each vial.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, headache, muscle and joint pain, chills and fever. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 546,000 in April, 738,000 in May and\u0026nbsp844,000 doses in June, with 5.4 million doses in total expected by the end of 2021.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 20°C.EMA approval: Granted on January 6th.Overview: Developed by Boston-based company Moderna, this vaccine is manufactured for EU states at partner plants in Switzerland, France and Spain before being distributed across the continent. Like the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine, it uses mRNA technology to produce a Sars-CoV-2 protein, which the body then attacks to give immunity. It will last for up to six months when stored at - 20°C. The first Moderna vaccine was given in Ireland on January 16th.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, chills, fever, swollen or tender lymph nodes under the arm, headache, muscle and joint pain, nausea and vomiting. Less common was redness, hives and rash at the injection site. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 383,000 by June and 870,000 doses by the end of 2021.How many have been vaccinated here?Dose: Two doses, between 4 and 12 weeks apartEMA approval: Granted on January 29th.Overview: The OxfordAstraZeneca vaccine (also known as Vaxzevria) was thought of as a potential game-changer because it can be transported and stored at 2 degrees to 8 degrees for up to six months, making it much easier to move around and administer. It is also much cheaper, costing about $3-4 per shot, compared with $20 for the PfizerBioNTech jab, with the former being made on a not-for-profit basis for the duration of the pandemic.It is based on a harmless chimp cold virus that cannot grow inside human cells. Scientists have tweaked this virus so that it carries genetic material containing the instructions for a protein of the coronavirus. Once the vaccine has been administered, our bodies produce the coronavirus protein, triggering an immune response.During the trial, a dosing error led to the serendipitous finding that when clinical trial participants were given half a dose followed by a full dose, the vaccine had a higher efficacy than when participants were given two full doses, with 90 per cent efficacy in the former case and 62 per cent efficacy in the latter. This led AstraZeneca to announce in November a new global trial of the vaccine with the half dosefull dose regime.In January, a bitter row broke out between the European Union and AstraZeneca after the pharmaceutical company drastically revised downwards the number of doses it could deliver the bloc.\u0026nbspWhile the EMA approved the use of this vaccine for all ages, doubt was cast over its efficacy in the over 65s due to the lack of data from Astrazeneca’s clinical trials in this cohort. As a result, Germany, Austria, Sweden, Poland and Belgium have opted not to approve this product for their older population.Following suit, Ireland has also decided to use the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine for the over 70s where possible, not the AstraZeneca jab.It would not be the first time this jab led to a\u0026nbspsignificant reorganisation of our vaccination plans.Reports of serious blood clots, mostly in women aged under 60, led the\u0026nbspNational Immunisation Advisory Committee (Niac) to first defer the use of the vaccine on March 14th, before resuming it\u0027s use on March 20th.However, on April 12th, Niac\u0026nbsprecommended that AstraZeneca should not be given to people aged under 60, once again leading to a reorganisation of the rollout. This was revised to people aged over 50 on April 27th. On June 28th, Niac revised its advice again and said the vaccine could be given\u0026nbspto people aged under 40, although the mRNA shots were preferable for that age group.How many will Ireland get?\u0026nbspLatest projections are 224,000 in April, 262,000 in May and 327,000 in JuneStorage: Lasts for up to two years frozen at –20° C, and up to three months refrigerated at 2-8° C.EMA approval: Approved on March 11th.Overview: The EMA started a rolling review of this single dose vaccine from Janssen, the Belgium-based subsidiary of Johnson \u0026amp Johnson on December 1st.On January 29th the company announced the results of its Phase 3 trial: the vaccine had an efficacy of 72 per cent in the United States, 66 per cent in Latin America, and 57 per cent in South Africa.This vaccine uses double-stranded DNA to deliver a protein from the SARS-CoV-2 virus into the body, thereby creating immunity. It is different from others on the market in that it requires just one injection. The EU has agreed an initial contract for 200 million doses, with an option to buy 200 million more.On February 16th the company applied to the EMA for\u0026nbspseeking authorisation for its single-dose vaccine, and it was approved on March 11th.However, on April 13th the company paused deliveries of its vaccine in Europe pending an investigation of rare blood clot cases that have halted its rollout in the US. The blood clotting conditions reported in recipients of the Johnson \u0026amp Johnson vaccine in the US are the same rare condition linked to the AstraZeneca vaccine.On April 20th, the EMA\u0027s review of these issues found a possible link to very rare cases of unusual blood clots with low blood platelets, and agreed a warning should be included in the product information.\u0026nbspHowever, it concluded\u0026nbspthe overall benefits of the vaccine\u0026nbspin preventing Covid-19 outweigh the risks of side effects, and so Janssen announced it would resume deliveries to the EU. In Ireland,\u0026nbspNiac initially recommended that the jab be used only for people over the age of 50, but this was revised to include the under 40s on June 28th. Those aged 18-34 can apply to get the Janssen vaccine at pharmacies around the country.How many will Ireland get?\u0026nbsp2.2 million doses in total,\u0026nbsp600,000 between April and June.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: US company Novavax has developed a Covid-19 vaccine which stimulates an immune response by delivering spike proteins into the body. These spike-proteins are grown and harvested from insects. Similar technology is used in the production of vaccines for influenza and HPV. The European Commission has concluded exploratory talks with Novavax with a view to purchasing up to 200 million doses. The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 3rd.Overview: In September the EU signed a deal to purchase 300 million doses of this vaccine. It is based on the same technology as one of Sanofi’s seasonal influenza vaccines - more conventional than the mRNA used by Pfizer and Moderna - and it was thought it could play a big role in ending the pandemic. However, despite positive results from Phase 1 trials, news came in December that Phase 2 trial results showed an insufficient immune response in older adults. Phase III studies were expected to start in December, but the companies now plan to begin a phase 2b study in February with a different formulation of the vaccine. Even if their new formulation is successful, they do not expect the vaccine to be available until the end of 2021.Storage: Will last for at least 3 months at 2-8°C.Overview: The German company CureVac began its final Phase 3 trials in December, with results expected in the first quarter of 2021. It uses the same mRNA technology as the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines, but can be kept at normal refrigerator temperatures. The company has signed a deal with the EU to supply 405 million doses, pending regulatory approval.The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 12th.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: Valneva is a French company which has created a Covid-19 vaccine based on their Japanese encephalitis vaccine. It delivers a chemically inactivated coronavirus and uses an adjuvant (immunity booster) to create immunity. It entered clinical trials in December and reported positive results from these initial phase 1 and 2 trial in\u0026nbspApril 2021, while announcing it was entering\u0026nbspphase 3 trials on 4,000 people.On January 12th the European Commission concluded exploratory talks with the company for the supply of 30 million doses, with the option to buy a further 30 million.When might you be vaccinated?Over 80 per cent\u0026nbspof people in Ireland aged over 18 are now fully vaccinated, with over 90 per cent in receipt of at least one dose.

Photograph: Nick BradshawFormer Stormont first minister Peter Robinson has accused the EU of “irrational political prejudice” and warned that it must “go back to the drawing board” over the Northern Ireland Protocol. The ex-DUP leader described reforms to the post-Brexit arrangements outlined by European Commission vice president Maros Sefcovic on Wednesday as an “upgrade” but insisted “much more movement will be required” to bring unionists on board.He suggested triggering the contentious Article 16 of the protocol - which allows the EU or UK to unilaterally suspend aspects of its operations if either side considers them to be causing “economic, societal or environmental difficulties” - may be necessary “to achieve that goal”. Mr Robinson also accuses the SDLP, Alliance and Sinn Féin of a “grovelling endorsement” of the EU’s proposed reforms, which would scrap most checks on goods moving between Britain and the North.The de facto Irish Sea border was erected under the protocol, agreed by London and Brussels, to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland and protect the EU single market after the UK pulled out of the bloc. “What gets me most is the irrational political prejudice and overbearing haughtiness of the EU, who think that it is a greater priority to ensure there is no hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland than between Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom of which we are part,” Mr Robinson wrote in his weekly column for The Newsletter. Favoured by nationalistsHe alleged that Mr Sefcovic was only interested in protecting gains from the Belfast (Good Friday) Agreement which are favoured by nationalists. The 1998 peace deal was “damaging” and “it is heresy for any unionist, especially with the benefit of hindsight, to praise” it, he wrote. Mr Robinson said the agreement “threw the jail gates open for terrorists to flood out, destroyed the RUC, allowed Sinn Féin into government while republicans held on to their bombs and guns, continued murdering, relentlessly persisted with their criminality, while refusing to support the police or recognise the authority of the courts”.He said he was “unimpressed” by the SDLP, Sinn Féin and the Alliance party offering a “grovelling endorsement of the EU proposals”. “These parties welcomed the protocol in its original form and there would have been no change if it had been left to them,” he wrote. “They are content to maintain the denial of democratic accountability for laws that will be made by the EU and imposed in Northern Ireland. They accept that the EU should be both advocate and judge in its own cause when there is a dispute about trading matters.‘Sleight of hand’“They endorse the constitutional sleight of hand that declares Great Britain to be a ‘third country’ in relation to Northern Ireland trade and they applaud maintaining checks on goods entering Northern Ireland from Great Britain.”Mr Robinson said the EU was also completely ignoring “ the constitutional, legal, and democratic implications of the protocol and seems to think it is only the trading element of the protocol that needs to be considered.”“Even in that narrow perspective they fall short. If the problem was limited to the costly compliance requirements and time-consuming checking of goods within the United Kingdom the answer is the removal of those checks, not a reduction in their number,” he wrote.

Photograph: Getty ImagesThe official wizard of New Zealand has been cast from the public payroll to spell the end to a 23-year legacy.The wizard, Ian Brackenbury Channell (88), had been contracted to Christchurch city council for the past two decades to promote the city through “acts of wizardry and other wizard-like services”, at a cost of $16,000 (€9,728) a year. He has been paid a total of $368,000.The wizard, who was born in England, began performing acts of wizardry and entertainment in public spaces shortly after arriving in New Zealand in 1976. When the council originally tried to stop him, the public protested. In 1982, the New Zealand Art Gallery Directors Association said he had become a living work of art, and then, in 1990, the prime minister at the time, Mike Moore, asked that he consider becoming the wizard of New Zealand.“I am concerned that your wizardry is not at the disposal of the entire nation,” Mr Moore wrote on his official letterhead.“I suggest therefore that you should urgently consider my suggestion that you become the Wizard of New Zealand, Antarctica and relevant offshore areas . . . no doubt there will be implications in the area of spells, blessings, curses, and other supernatural matters that are beyond the competence of mere Prime Ministers.”Since then he has performed in Christchurch, rain-danced in New Zealand and Australia during droughts, and was awarded the Queen’s service medal in the 2009 Queen’s birthday honours. But he has also encountered controversy with off-colour comments about women.In an April screening of channel Three’s comedy current affairs show New Zealand Today, the wizard said he liked to tease women by telling them they were devious, and said “they use cunning to get men who are thick”.“I love women, I forgive them all the time, I’ve never struck one yet. Never strike a woman because they bruise too easily is the first thing, and they’ll tell the neighbours and their friends . . . and then you’re in big trouble.”The council said it had sent the wizard a letter thanking him for his services to Christchurch over the past decades and informing him they were closing the book on his contract, a council spokesperson, Lynn McClelland, said.The wizard said the council had decided to stop paying him because he did not fit “the vibes” of the city. He said he was a provocateur.“It implies that I am boring and old, but there is nobody else anything like me in Christchurch.“It’s just they don’t like me because they are boring old bureaucrats and everyone likes me and no one likes them,’’ he said.The wizard is a well-known face to Christchurch residents, but in recent years, his presence has diminished, and sightings have become rare. He says that is because the council has made him invisible and would not respond to his suggestions to improve tourism.“But when they cancelled this honorarium, everyone got furious, they have awakened a hornet’s nest here, it’s hilarious. The next few months are going to be real fun.” –  Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"inside","story":"Growing energy, security and diplomatic links between Moscow and Beijing worry WestDecembrist rebels and their aristocratic wives embraced \u0026lsquoreal Russia\u0026rsquo in Siberian exileFears for permafrost as tusk hunters feed Chinese market starved of elephant ivoryInside Russia: Melting permafrost threatens critical infrastructure and feeds global warmingStalin\u0027s popularity growing as Kremlin focuses on Soviet triumphs, not tragediesInside Russia: Party wonders how far it cane press Putin after years in soft \u0026lsquosystemic opposition\u0026rsquo roleInside Russia: More protests planned as officials reject calls to address e-voting complaintsMoscow Letter: Poet\u0026rsquos statue has been a magnet for generations of Russian dissentersOn the eve of an expected sham election, many of Putin\u0026rsquos political opponents are already jailed or dead"},{"url":null,"title":"boosters masks and vaccine passes help israel push latest covid 19 wave into retreat","story":"A woman shows her green pass, issued to fully vaccinated Israelis, before entering a show at the opera house in Tel Aviv, Israel. Photograph: Dan BaliltyThe New York TimesFour months into one of its worst Covid-19 outbreaks, Israel is seeing a sharp drop in new infections and severe illness, aided by its use of vaccine boosters, vaccine passports and mask mandates, scientists and health officials have said.Israel was struck by its fourth coronavirus wave in June, fuelled by the fast-spreading Delta variant.Rather than imposing new lockdown measures, the government bet on a third booster dose of the Pfizer vaccine for people age 12 and up, mandated face coverings and enforced use of a ‘Green Pass’ - proof of vaccination, recovery from the illness or a negative test for the virus - at restaurants and other venues, even for children.Since peaking in early September, daily infections in Israel have fallen more than 80 per cent, with severe cases nearly halved.“Day by day we are breaking the Delta wave,” prime minister Naftali Bennett said, crediting government policy for “close, smart and flexible management allowing life alongside coronavirus”.Israel’s ‘Living with Covid’ strategy, which has not come without cost or controversy, has kept schools and the economy open.The Israeli Health Ministry on Thursday presented the latest safety and effectiveness data from its booster campaign to a panel of advisers to the US Food and Drug Administration considering authorisation of additional booster shots.The data show that among people over 60 - the first group to receive boosters - infections began declining rapidly about two weeks after third doses were administered, while still climbing among other age groups.Reproduction rateA data analysis by Doron Gazit and Yinon Ashkenazy of the Hebrew University’s Covid-19 monitoring team showed the virus’ reproduction rate - its ability to spread - began a sharp fall among each age group following the third shot.Two months into the Delta wave, vaccinated people over the age of 60 made up more than half of severe Covid-19 cases. The majority were over 70 with health conditions that put them at higher risk.Since administration of boosters, mostly unvaccinated, often younger, people are bearing the brunt of serious illness. They make up about 75 per cent of hospitalised patients in severe condition, while those vaccinated with two or three shots account for a quarter of such cases.A third dose has so far been effective in curbing severe breakthrough cases among vaccinated people age 40 and up, according to the health ministry.There is less available data for teens and young adults. However, the ministry said its findings so far show that a third dose has not increased the risk of myocarditis, a rare heart inflammation, in younger people.Ran Balicer, who heads the Israeli government’s coronavirus expert advisory panel, said a combination of measures had curbed the Delta surge.“These include the masks mandate, the Green Passes, the massive testing both with PCR testing and rapid antigen tests. But undoubtedly, the most important impactful factor in bringing down the Delta summer surge was the mass vaccination campaign with booster doses,” Balicer said.In England, where boosters have been administered to roughly 5 per cent of the population, masks have largely been abandoned and vaccine passports are not mandatory, Covid-19 cases are on the rise.PrematureSome scientists said Israel’s decision in late August to approve a third vaccine dose for young adults and teens was premature, lacking clear evidence of a benefit. They argue the focus should still be on convincing unvaccinated people to accept the shots.The US and several European countries have so far authorised boosters only for older adults, people with weakened immune systems or workers at high risk of coronavirus exposure.The World Health Organisation has pleaded with wealthier nations to hold off on boosters while many countries struggle to access vaccines.“Israel rushed, even gambled, when it came to approving a third dose for the whole population and not to specific age groups as other countries did,” said Hagai Levine, professor of epidemiology at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem. “In the midst of a pandemic you sometimes have to make a decision based on partial evidence...Nevertheless, the jury is still out on third doses for the entire population.”Bennett has been criticized by some scientists for rejecting tougher measures that would have kept Delta infections lower from the start. They included government health officials who feared the ‘Living with Covid’ policy exacted too heavy a toll.“We have 1,400 people who died in this wave. So there are benefits to keeping the economy open and there is some cost to that,” Sharon Alroy-Preis, head of public health at Israel’s Health Ministry, told The Jerusalem Post conference this weekPossibly avoidedBy September, hospitals strained to care for Covid-19 cases that could have perhaps been avoided, doctors and health officials said.“It’s a good policy, but it has its price,” said Yael Haviv-Yadid, head of the critical care ward at Sheba Medical Centre, whose unit saw an influx of young, unvaccinated patients. “The teams are very tired, burned out.”So far, 3.7 million people have taken a third shot, more than a third of Israel’s population.“Israel was the first country to deal with the combined challenge posed by the Delta variant and mass waning immunity, but it is definitely not the last” Balicer cautioned.“Other countries that will be faced with this complex challenge will have to figure out their own balance,” he added, “and the costs can be high.” - ReutersStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"banksys shredded artwork sells 186m record artist","story":"A partially shredded Banksy painting has sold for £18,582,000 at auction.His artwork Love Is In The Bin was sold in London by auction house Sotheby\u0027s, which said the fee was a record for the street artist.The painting, originally titled Girl With Balloon, hit headlines in 2018 when it partially self-destructed at the conclusion of a previous auction in which it had been sold for £1.1 million.The canvas was passed through a secret shredder hidden inside the large frame, leaving the bottom half in tatters and only a solitary red balloon left on a white background in the frame.Love Is In The Bin outperformed its price estimate of between £4 million and £6 million.Girl With Balloon, which depicts a small child reaching up towards a heart-shaped red balloon, was originally stencilled on a wall in east London and has been endlessly reproduced, becoming one of Banksy\u0027s best-known images.Alex Branczik, chairman of modern and contemporary art at Sotheby\u0027s Asia, said: It is almost three years to the day since one of the most ingenious moments of performance art this century made auction history.It has been a whirlwind to follow the journey of this now legendary piece and to have it back in our midst, offering it tonight in the very room it was created by the artist.Banksy is no stranger to making headlines and this latest chapter in his story has captured imaginations across the world - we can only begin to guess what might come next.The seller of the artwork, who placed the £1 million winning bid on Girl With Balloon, previously described the shredding of the artwork as surreal.They added that he became the accidental - but very privileged - owner of Love Is In The Bin.In March, Banksy raised more than £16 million for health projects by auctioning Game Changer, a hand-painted image showing a young boy playing with superhero dolls.While Batman and Spiderman are discarded in a bin, the child clutches a figure of a masked nurse wearing a cape.More from NewsFrom a plague of moths to the beauty of bubbles: The winners of the Close-Up Photographer of the Year competitionDon\u0026#39t blame trade unions for taking Boris at his word\u0026#39Hero\u0026#39 policeman had arrow lodged in his back as he saved others10 facts you never knew about Guy FawkesMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"could jeff bezoss space race help save planet","story":"It’s rare for Prince William to inhabit the same atmosphere as Gil Scott-Heron. But the future heir’s tart response to Jeff Bezos flying William Shatner to space this week – “We need some of the world’s greatest brains and minds fixed on trying to repair this planet, not trying to find the next place to go and live,” the Duke of Cambridge said – had echoes of Scott-Heron’s influential 1970 spoken-word track, Whitey on the Moon.Over clattering percussion, Scott-Heron pretty much nailed the disinterested shrug of people at the hard end of the world’s problems at seeing Neil Armstrong’s landmark 1969 moon walk: “A rat done bit my sister Nell, with Whitey on the moon. Her face and arms began to swell, and Whitey’s on the moon,” his languid vocals proclaim.Certainly, at first sight, the regular transport of wealthy people into low Earth orbit – a prospect now closer than ever – seems like the answer to a question the planet wasn’t asking.SpaceX’s Falcon 9 rocket burns kerosene and Virgin’s VSS Unity uses a solid carbon-based fuel, hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene and liquid nitrous oxide. Which, Eloise Marais, associate professor of physical geography at University College London, estimates burn 200-300 tonnes of carbon dioxide per launch. Split between four or so passengers, this compares highly unfavourably with the one to three tonnes of carbon dioxide per passenger for long-haul flights. While there were only 114 rocket launches in the whole of 2020, Sir Richard Branson’s ambition alone is for 400 flights per year.But might such forays have their uses for the whole of mankind after all?Space travel and the environmental movement have been strange bedfellows ever since the Pioneer 1 satellite used the first practical solar panels in 1958. Satellites have been driving innovation in solar panels ever since, and have proven crucial in determining crop health, forest fires, glacier coverage, the spread of urban development and damage to the rainforests.Indeed, space travel has been a rich source of new green tech. The hydrogen and fuel cell technologies invented to take Apollo astronauts into space are now touted as a clean, reliable (albeit achingly expensive) alternative to batteries that can power anything from aeroplanes, such as the Pathfinder and Helio prototypes, to warships. Home insulation – hello there, Insulate Britain – owes much to spacesuit design.Meanwhile, NASA is a leader in green engineering. By necessity, all human space travel involves recycling practically everything – water, air and food – so the space agency has been responsible for breakthroughs in water filtration, waste water treatment and soil cleaning agents. It is also one of the world’s biggest researchers into the science of hydroponics – growing crops without using land resources.“Space-based technologies and space-derived information are central to climate knowledge, science, monitoring and early warning,” says Nick Shave, chair of UKspace, the trade association of the British space industry. “In the future, new applications of satellite data, combined with satellite positioning and communications technologies, will help drive down carbon emissions as well as providing key capabilities required to manage the devastating effects of the climate emergency to countries and communities around the world.”The link between the environment and space travel is even more far-out than that. Bill Anders, crew member of the Apollo 8 mission, became the first human to witness the Earth peeking over the Moon’s horizon in 1968. Anders had been snapping the Moon’s surface on a scouting mission for future landings when he took the photograph later known as Earthrise. That single snap is credited with inspiring the first Earth Day in 1970, about which Anders later said: “We came all this way to explore the Moon, and the most important thing is that we discovered the Earth.”California’s environmental movement of the early 1970s gave birth to the Whole Earth Catalogue, a compendium of product listings, how-to diagrams and educational ephemera intended for the back-to-the-land movement, which featured Earthrise on its first cover. Published quarterly in 1971 and sporadically thereafter, its biggest influence was on Silicon Valley: founders of Airbnb, Stripe and Facebook, early-internet architects including Larry Brilliant, Lee Felsenstein, Ted Nelson and Steve Jobs, described the Catalog as “Google in paperback form, 35 years before Google came along”.This freak-powerbillionaire crossover means that while SpaceX’s Falcon Heavy emits more CO2 in a few minutes than the average car would in more than two centuries, in 2019 it carried a NASA-funded test satellite known as the Green Propellant Infusion Mission, to replace the outrageously polluting and ferociously lethal hydrazine. The new hydroxyl ammonium nitrate fueloxidizer blend – called AF-M315E for short – can be carried around without wearing a hazmat suit, is more efficient and emits more water than CO2.By comparison, Bezos’s rocket, Blue Origin, is powered by a mix of liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen, meaning its carbon footprint – in flight, if not in construction – is zero. Given Blue Origin’s reusable launch vehicle, the project’s biggest overall source of CO2 is likely to be the crew and passengers’ flights to its Texas launch site. Just don’t mention the CO2 given off by Amazon’s server farms…And then there’s the real out-there thinking of Elon Musk. Musk has credited his drive to many things – including growing up in apartheid South Africa and leaving aged 17, rather than serve in what he called “a fascist army” – but the man’s absolute conviction that the Earth is doomed explains his unsettling desire to move to Mars.“A lot of my motivation comes from looking at things that don’t work well and feeling a bit sad about how it would manifest in the future,” he has said. “If that would result in an unhappy future, then it makes me unhappy, so I want to fix it.”Alongside the Tesla, the car that made electric vehicles cool at last, he’s proposed ‘Hyperloop’ high-speed transportation systems, using reduced pressure tubes to reach speeds around 600mph – which Branson has neatly whipped from under his nose with the all-electric Virgin Hyperloop’s first successful test earlier this year. Musk has put up $100 million for carbon capture technology, and given up on cryptocurrencies due to their voracious dependency on electricity.The UK is clinging on to the edge of all this. British rocket maker Orbex is pioneering bio-propane fuel that chief executive Chris Larmour says can cut CO2 emissions by 90 per cent, compared with traditional launch fuel. “Climate change is real, and we don’t want to make it worse,” he explains.After Brexit, the UK is no longer part of Galileo and EGNOS, the EU-owned satnav systems, but we’re hustling to get involved in its Copernicus Earth Observation programme, and we’ve still got a role in the soon-to-be carbon-neutral European Space Agency. “The UK has already taken a lead in committing to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2050,” says Shave. “The next step should be properly investing in our space industry to help us become a world leader in action as well as words.”If we start to dream of space again, perhaps we can start to get a genuinely global perspective. If we can solve problems down here by trying to put someone on the Moon, what could we achieve if we all got a chance to see Earth rise?More from NewsFrom a plague of moths to the beauty of bubbles: The winners of the Close-Up Photographer of the Year competitionDon\u0026#39t blame trade unions for taking Boris at his word\u0026#39Hero\u0026#39 policeman had arrow lodged in his back as he saved others10 facts you never knew about Guy FawkesMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"masterpiece worthy monet","story":"Standing on a \u0027Monet bridge\u0027, visitors to Cornwall\u0027s Trebah Gardens might well feel like they are immersed in a living masterpiece by the French impressionist. Despite being deep into autumn, Mallard Pond is a work of art with a stunning display of mostly blue hydrangeas. Two acres of hydrangeas border its banks, creating a wall of colour in late summer months and seen in this photograph as dotted pastels across the landscape.They were originally planted in 1949.

On that day the history of England changed for ever. But should we give greater prominence to another battle nearly 130 years earlier, Brunanburh in 937, which some historians argue consolidated Anglo-Saxon England – even if they disagree over where it was fought? It was certainly an epic English victory over an alliance of Vikings from Dublin and Celts from the far north and west. But the English triumph was short lived. The Vikings were soon back. The Danish king Knut (Canute) conquered England in 1016. And then of course came the Normans.So is the history of the rather short and troubled Kingdom of the English really so important? Did they leave much of a heritage apart from a few small churches, fragments of literature, and some beautiful manuscripts and metalwork? William the Conqueror and his successors after 1066 carried out what we might now call cultural genocide, wiping out or dispossessing the political and cultural elite, systematically demolishing nearly all the great buildings, changing religious traditions, and seizing the kingdom’s wealth.For some Victorians, who approved of the idea of progress through imperial conquest, the Anglo-Saxons were merely “lumbering about in potbellied equanimity” until civilised by the Normans. We have long put that idea behind us. In cultural terms, the English could claim primacy over the thuggish Normans. In particular, Old English literature was unique in a Europe dominated by Latin. The country was more efficiently governed than perhaps anywhere else in Europe, and with a high level of participation by its people. We must not idealise: this was a brutal warrior society, with many of its people enslaved. Yet its rulers, unlike those after 1066, did not need to live in castles, fortified against their subjects.Why then did the English lose – however narrowly – on that October 14? Partly bad luck. Partly that England was surrounded by enemies, attracted by its wealth: Harold was defeated at Hastings largely because he had just had to fight another battle against invading Vikings at Stamford Bridge. Partly because the Anglo-Saxons were incorrigibly factious.So what did the Anglo-Saxons do for us? They left an effective system of government, which outlasted conquest: England survived under new management, escaping the fragmentation of much of the Continent. Some of the system they created is with us still. They left us a myth of liberty: the idea that before the imposition of “the Norman yoke” the people were free, and one day would be free again. Myths are important, and for centuries this one – perhaps containing a grain of truth – inspired demands for rights. The most popular version, of course, is the legend of Robin Hood.Above all –against heavy odds – the Anglo-Saxons left us the core of the English language, preserved by ordinary people and by the Church. In a greatly simplified form, and with large infusions from Latin and French, an English language and literature survived and finally replaced French and Latin. The language of Chaucer and Shakespeare is not the language of Beowulf, of course. And yet today the hundred most frequently used words in what has become the world’s language are all derived from Old English.Robert Tombs is the author of ‘The English and their History’More from NewsFrom a plague of moths to the beauty of bubbles: The winners of the Close-Up Photographer of the Year competitionDon\u0026#39t blame trade unions for taking Boris at his word\u0026#39Hero\u0026#39 policeman had arrow lodged in his back as he saved others10 facts you never knew about Guy FawkesMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"bernard henri levy cancel culture churning imbeciles","story":"“I’ll tell you what cancel culture is,” says Bernard-Henri Lévy. “It’s a school of imbecility churning out ever more imbeciles. And it’s profoundly dangerous.” I hadn’t imagined the French “rock star” philosopher would be a fan, but this is gold. In a climate where interviewees are all too often fearful of saying the wrong thing and opinions are watered down to nothing, a conversation with the man known only as BHL in France is as robust and satisfying as a Sunday roast. And he’s only just getting started. “Every relationship we have with another human being should be both welcoming and worrying,” Lévy goes on, warming to his theme. “It’s essential to have both, and for your convictions to be challenged and imperiled by another’s. So in that way cancel culture goes against the very contract of life it’s the opposite of life – and living.”With his trademark black Charvet suit, crisp white shirt (still unbuttoned, if not quite to the navel these days), and of course the baroque hairstyle that inspired one satirist’s line “God is dead, but my hair is beautiful”, the wealthy son of a timber magnate looks perfectly at home in the softly-lit Knightsbridge hotel bar in which we meet. Yet this is a man who has spent the past 50 years travelling to war-torn countries across the world, a man who somehow even managed to get to Bangladesh (catching the last plane out when the first lockdown was announced), the Greek island of Lesbos and Afghanistan over the course of the pandemic. And his forthcoming book, The Will To See: Dispatches from a World of Misery and Hope, charts the terrifying and inspiring scenes and people he came across on those travels.Before we get to the big battles, however – the ones that really matter – I’m curious to know how he feels about another little clash: the one going on right now between our two countries, after a recent series of diplomatic spats. “You know Brexit really wounded us,” he tells me. “It’s not that I feel there’s any real resentment for Brits out in France… It’s more of a disappointed love.” But that wound can heal? “Oh, France and England will always find a way to meet in the middle. And Brexit might not be forever. Johnson won’t necessarily be there for much longer, will he? So maybe then our friendship can be reborn.” Ask Lévy what he thinks of our Prime Minister, and a small smile plays on his lips. “We crossed paths when he was a journalist and in Brussels…” And? “There’s a word you Brits use: ‘jolly’.” It’s said with a moue of distaste. “Well, he’s ‘a jolly guy’.” But do you want a jolly guy in charge of the country? “I don’t. But hey, maybe British people do.”When you’ve witnessed the kinds of things BHL has in Eritrea, Bosnia or Afghanistan – which he has visited seven times over the years – one can see why “jolly” might be given short shrift. Yet in The Will To See he writes that he never experiences “any real fear, nor any special pride in not fearing”.Over the course of previous trips Lévy had got to know the legendary commander Ahmad Shah Massoud, who was assassinated by the Taliban in 2001. But until last year he hadn’t seen the former resistance leader’s eldest son since he was a boy. “I spent hours with him last year and he talked a lot about his heritage. I was struck by the physical and moral resemblance: the strength of his desire to carry on his father’s work, as well as by his sense of duty. It’s always surprising to see someone who is not made for war deciding to enter into one. Because this is a man who likes gardening and astrology – a man who is not made for war.”Biden’s decision to pull out of Afghanistan in August was “infuriating” for two reasons, he tells me. “Firstly, because Biden didn’t actually have to follow through with Trump’s plan. He reversed a lot of Trump’s decisions, so why not that one? That was the first catastrophic error. And secondly because of the way in which he did it.”The oft-touted concept of a “forever war” “is absurd”, Lévy scoffs. “It wasn’t a ‘forever war’ but a military and diplomatic presence there to dissuade Islamists from coming back and setting up their Al-Qaeda training camps again – to stop them preparing new attacks against Afghan women and the West.” In which case that presence should have remained there forever? “Why wouldn’t you? America has been in Germany for 75 years and in South Korea for the past 50. How many American military bases are there all over the world? Leaving 2500 men in Afghanistan was not absurd. My theory on interventionalism has always been this: it will inevitably cost more not to intervene – and in every sense. In lives, in money, in honour.”On his first visit to the country in 1981, Lévy helped set up Radio Free Kabul. Then in 2002, when sent by former president Jacques Chirac on an official mission to find ways of building a nation out of the chaos left by the Taliban and American bombs, the philosopher created and financed one of the first free papers in Afghanistan, the now-defunct News of Kabul. So he’s deeply saddened by the way the media have chosen to concentrate on the “evil” West rather the heinous acts perpetrated by the Taliban.“People have lost all sense – all intelligence! No society is perfect, but the Taliban are the absolute worst,” he says with a shake of the head. “And there had been so much improvement. I had seen first-hand a civil society affirming itself, a democratic revolution that was starting to spread. There was a flourishing of the press and a very large number of women had started to liberate themselves. So I’m absolutely shocked by the idea that ‘we failed in Afghanistan’. We did not fail. There were errors and failures of course: there was money lost to corruption and a bad president. But having that presence there had meant an extraordinary eclosion, which I had personally witnessed.”In his book, Lévy makes the point that “even the most archaic cultures” can evolve and reform themselves, alongside religions. “Think about it. Christianity reformed itself, Judaism reformed itself, and Islam is absolutely compatible with French or British cultures. It too can reform itself. But we need to stop seeing cultures as blocks,” he insists. “Back in Voltaire’s time drawing and quartering was still practised in France, but thankfully there were Frenchmen who believed that particular practice should be removed from our culture. Similarly, the death penalty existed in our country until 1981. England was once a chauvinist country, imbued with racism, but look at you now! Then there’s the American way of life, which is absolutely respectable, but the possession of weapons of war is not consubstantial with their culture. So why the moment we start to talk about poor countries do certain cultural aspects become sacred things that one cannot touch? It’s madness.”I’m aware that time is pressing and that Lévy’s publicist is ready to whisk him off to an event before he heads back to Paris, but before she does I want to know about the second part of the equation in his book title. The “misery” is all too clear to see, after all. But where does he see “hope”? “Oh I’ve found hope in the least humane places: in the refugee camps of Lesbos, for example, where I saw people who had lost everything able to stand up straight and keep their dignity. When you see the incredible resistance human beings can have to everything that has tried to destroy them? That is the incarnation of hope.” And with that, BHL vanishes into the night.The Will To See by Bernard-Henri Lévy is published by Yale University Press on 26th October. £16.99.More from NewsFrom a plague of moths to the beauty of bubbles: The winners of the Close-Up Photographer of the Year competitionDon\u0026#39t blame trade unions for taking Boris at his wordNorwegians praise \u0026#39hero\u0026#39 policeman who saved others from bow attack with arrow lodged in his back10 facts you never knew about Guy FawkesMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"dont blame trade unions taking boris word","story":"Imagine you are the leader of a public sector union contemplating putting in a cheeky demand for a pay rise – one you know that your members have not earned through greater productivity. You know that it is likely to end up with a long strike which could cost your members dearly in lost earnings, and that there is no guarantee that they will enjoy a pay rise at the end of it. You are trying to weigh up your chance of success – and then the Prime Minister comes on the radio telling us how he is going to turn Britain into a ‘high wage economy’, trying to make-out that a supply chain crisis is a good thing because it is helping boost pay, and that as a nation we can have our cake and eat it. How do you react? You are going to conclude that your chances of extracting a pay rise from the government has just increased immeasurably.It should come as no surprise, then, that Unite is threatening a lorry driver strike in the run-up to Christmas. It is a direct result of Boris Johnson signalling a lack of fiscal responsibility. In the case of lorry-drivers – most of whom work in the private sector – it is easy to attack Unite for its bone-headedness – why the need to threaten strikes when a labour shortage is pushing up wages anyway? Rather than strike, it should be telling its members: if you don’t like your pay and conditions and your current employer won’t offer you a rise, resign and offer your services to one of the many other companies who are currently screaming out for HGV drivers.But wage demands and strikes aren’t going to end with lorry drivers. Already we have had strikes at DVLA, as we have had on Scotrail. Once unions get wind of the idea that there is easy money on offer, pay demands are going to mushroom. And much of it will come down to Johnson’s own character. It is a good thing in many respects to beam with optimism, to make out we are all going to get rich from doing our everyday jobs. But when you are Prime Minister, loose talk can end up costing taxpayers a fortune.I would like to be able to come down on Rishi Sunak’s side in the obvious and growing tensions between Number 10 and Number 11 over fiscal discipline, although his record isn’t great either. It was he who came up with the Eat Out to Help Out scheme, subsidising our pub lunches. So, too, Dominic Cummings bears responsibility from beyond the political grave – it was he who advocated the suspension of fiscal discipline during a pandemic so as to offer rockstar salaries to hire the best people, culminating with consultants on Test and Trace earning £7,000 per day. Trouble is, everyone working for the public sector thinks they are invaluable – and in most cases they are right that they are of more use than the people who designed our lousy Test and Trace system. Why, they reason, can’t we too have a slice of this very rich government procurement cake?The government went into the pandemic already running a deficit. It is coming out of it with a hole in the public finances such as we have never seen in peacetime. Yet still, somehow, the government has managed to give the impression that there is free money on offer to anyone who wants it. This has not been lost on the unions.More from NewsFrom a plague of moths to the beauty of bubbles: The winners of the Close-Up Photographer of the Year competition\u0026#39Hero\u0026#39 policeman had arrow lodged in his back as he saved others10 facts you never knew about Guy FawkesBonfire Night 2021: the story of Guy Fawkes, gunpowder, treason and plotMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"public told retake pcr tests false negatives government run","story":"Members of the public have been urged to book for further testing after 43,000 PCR tests at government-run sites resulted in false negatives.NHS Test and Trace have suspended testing operations provided by Immensa Health Clinic Ltd at its laboratory in Wolverhampton, following an investigation into reports of people receiving negative PCR test results after they have previously tested positive using lateral flow tests.The majority of those affected appear to be from the south west of England, but people in Wales and the south east are also understood to be impacted. An investigation led by the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) is underway attempting to confirm the cause of the problem, but early indications predict that more than 10 per cent of the 400,000 samples processed by the lab could be wrong. The agency estimated 43,000 people may have been given incorrect negative PCR test results between Sep 8 and Oct 12.A spokesman said: This is an isolated incident attributed to one laboratory but all samples are now being redirected to other laboratories.NHS Test and Trace is now contacting the people that could still be infectious to advise them to take another test.Close contacts who are symptomatic will also be advised to take a test in line with normal practice.  Dr Will Welfare, Public Health Incident Director, UKHSA: We have recently seen a rising number of positive LFD results subsequently testing negative on PCR. As a result of our investigation, we are working with NHS Test and Trace and the company to determine the laboratory technical issues which have led to inaccurate PCR results being issued to people. We have immediately suspended testing at this laboratory while we continue the investigation.A video in January as a result of a Sun investigation purported to show workers at the lab scuffling inside the West Midlands base. Immensa and its Italian owners Dante did not comment at the time, and it is not clear if any action was taken.Andrea Riposati, CEO of Immensa Health Clinic Ltd, said: We are fully collaborating with UKHSA on this matter. Quality is paramount for us. We have proudly analyzed more than 2.5million samples for NHS Test and Trace, working closely with the great teams at DHSC and UKHSA. We do not wish this matter or anything else to tarnish the amazing work done by the UK in this pandemic.It comes as West Berkshire Council said in a statement some of the tests at the Newbury Showground testing site, operated by the Department for Health and Social Care (DHSC), have had results sent out that may have incorrectly shown as negative for Covid-19.After receiving reports from local residents in recent weeks that there were concerns about the accuracy of test results from the site, we passed these concerns onto the DHSC for further investigation, the statement added.The DHSC has now confirmed that a number of sites nationally may have been affected by this issue, including the one at Newbury Showground.Those who received a negative result for a PCR test between Oct 3 and 12, as well as their close contacts, were strongly encouraged by the local authority to take another test.Councillor Graham Bridgman said: Testing continues to remain important as we learn to live with Covid and anyone who has symptoms, or who has been in contact with someone who tests positive, should book a PCR test straightaway. We also strongly encourage the public to do twice weekly lateral flow testing.Around 4,000 people in Wales may have been given inaccurate Covid test results after technical issues at a laboratory in England, the Welsh Government has warned.The majority of faulty Welsh results will have been given between September 8 and October 12 and were from testing sites in the Gwent and Cwm Taf Morgannwg areas.Welsh health minister Eluned Morgan confirmed the issue is isolated to one lab and does not involve the wider network, including the one in Newport which is responsible for processing the majority of Welsh samples.Baroness Morgan said: My immediate concern is the information and support for the Welsh residents impacted and I have asked Public Health Wales to provide additional support and advice to the affected health boards in addition to the UKHSA communications.They will also be assessing the potential impact of this incident on the case rates and epidemiology reports for Wales.We will continue to work closely with UKHSA and NHS Test and Trace on the findings and actions needed and I will keep members informed on developments.Concerns were raised when people had positive lateral flow tests, but negative PCR results from the lab.The Welsh Government said it was made aware last week that the UKHSA had begun an investigation, prompting Public Health Wales to review cases highlighted by health boards in South Wales.Anyone who had a test from October 4 and received a result from the affected laboratory will be contacted by NHS Test and Trace by text message andor e-mail and advised if it was negative to book an appointment to be re-tested.It will also advise that their close contacts who are symptomatic should book a test.People who had a test processed at the laboratory between September 8 and October 4 will also be contacted and advised to get a test if they have symptoms.Those who have symptoms should self-isolate immediately and book a PCR test, the Government said.More from NewsFrom a plague of moths to the beauty of bubbles: The winners of the Close-Up Photographer of the Year competitionDon\u0026#39t blame trade unions for taking Boris at his word\u0026#39Hero\u0026#39 policeman had arrow lodged in his back as he saved others10 facts you never knew about Guy FawkesMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"cheaper covid lateral flow tests","story":"Cheaper Covid lateral flows to replace PCR tests for fully-vaccinated UK arrivalsHealth Secretary Sajid Javid on Thursday evening has announced that double-jabbed arrivals into the UK will be able to take cheaper and quicker lateral flow tests from October PCR tests will be replaced by cheaper lateral flow tests for arrivals into the UK Image: DAILY RECORDByBen GlazeDeputy Political Editor:,  Oct Updated:,  Oct | comments Families flying home from half-term holidays can use cheaper lateral flow tests to prove they do not have coronavirus, the Government has confirmed.Ministers had pledged to axe requirements for passengers arriving from abroad to use “gold standard” polymerase chain reaction kits before the end of the month.Health Secretary Sajid Javid on Thursday evening announced the change for double-jabbed arrivals would come into force on October  - meaning travellers jetting back from half-term breaks overseas can benefit.Travel and aviation industry bosses had long demanded the switch, saying that expensive PCR tests priced many families out of foreign trips.  Airlines UK chief executive Tim Alderslade said: “This is great news and we’re pleased to get it over the line in time for the crucial half-term period, which will be a massive relief to families desperate to get away this autumn. “Vaccinated passengers can be reassured that they do not need to book or take an expensive PCR test when theyto the UK, which will further reduce the cost of travel.” He added: “This is a major step forward that will support the desperately needed recovery of our sector.” The rule change means fully-vaccinated passengers and most under-s arriving in England from countries not on the red list can take a lateral flow test on or before day two of their arrival into the UK.  Passengers must upload a photo of their test to prove results as soon as possible, with free PCR tests for any positive cases. Mr Javid said: “We want to make going abroad easier and cheaper, whether you’re travelling for work or visiting friends and family. “Lateral flow tests will be available later this month for those ing from half term holidays. “This change to testing is only possible thanks to the incredible progress of our vaccination programme, which means we can safely open up travel as we learn to live with the virus.”  Transport Secretary Grant Shapps added: “Today’s rule changes will make testing on arrival simpler and cheaper for people across the country who are looking forward to well-earned breaks for this October half term. “Taking away expensive mandatory PCR testing will boost the travel industry and is a major step forward in normalising international travel and encouraging people to book holidays with confidence.” Passengers who are not fully-vaccinated and are landing from a non-red list nation must still take a pre-departure test, PCR tests on days two and eight and complete  days self-isolation. Paul Charles, CEO of travel consultancy The PC Agency, said: Itaposs progress butyouaposre fully jabbed you shouldnapost need to take a test at all.

The Government has insisted it has already learned lessons from the pandemic. Ministers have also pointed to a public inquiry due to begin next spring. Critics want it to start immediately. Health Secretary Sajid Javid, who took up the role in June after Matt Hancock was forced to resign for breaking social distancing rules during an affair with his aide, was asked todayhe was sorry for failures which occurred.He said: “Yes, of course I’m sorry. “Obviously I am new in the role, but on behalf of the Government I am sorry for, during the pandemic, anyone that suffered, especially anyone that lost a loved one, a mother, a dad, a brother, a sister, a friend. Of course I am sorry for that.  “Also, all those people that may not have lost someone but they are still suffering - there are many people sadly suffering from long Covid, we still don’t know the impact of that. Of course I am. “There will be lessons to learn from this pandemic for this Government, for governments across the world, there will be lessons. It is important that is done. “There is going to be a public inquiry and I think that is the best place to learn these lessons.” Asked later what mistakes he was apologising for, he said: “I don’t know all the lessons that we are going to have to learn about this - I don’t think anyone does at this point. “I think the best place to determine those will be the independent public inquiry.” Comment MORE ON Keir StarmerPoliticsTory GovernmentCoronavirus\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Retired head of the Navy Admiral Lord West told peers the pace of government orders for new warships meant the Senior Service was at risk of dropping below  frigates. The existing fleet of Type , Duke-class vessels - some of which are  years old - is being replaced by eight, Type  City-class Global Combat Ships and five Type , light frigates. But Lord West, who commanded HMS Ardent in the  Falklands War, feared the Navy fleet would dip below  frigates.  He added: “The Government said that we would have and keep a minimum of  frigates - which is, after all, pretty damning for a maritime nation like us.“When one looks at the order rate for frigates, and the possibility of the rolling programme which so many shipyards need, one has to say that we are not going to have  frigates as we move into this decade.”He added: “As someone with an intelligence background, I would think it would be considerably less.”Defence Minister Baroness Goldie did not dispute the warning. But she told peers that “we have for the first time in  years two classes of frigate simultaneously under construction in UK shipyards”.  She added: “The Ministry of Defence expects to place an order for the batch two Type  frigates in the early s and to award a manufacture for the Fleet Solid Support shipswithin two years from May . “The Defence Secretary has said that he aims to have the National Flagship in the water by  or . “No decisions have yet been taken on order dates ... for the Type  frigates.” Mocking Government pledges of a British shipbuilding revival, Lord West told the Upper House: “It sounds marvellous and indeed having a Prime Minister who says that nothing does more for the security of our nation than building a warship for the Royal Navy obviously cheers a sailor like me up. “But the reality is that  months ago he made these statements and not a single order has been placed since then.”  He said that in  years “on the active list” he was “scarred” by “hearing numerous things about ships coming and never joining the Fleet”.Former Defence Minister Kevan Jones, a Labour MP who sits on the Commons Defence Select Committee and chairs the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Shipbuilding, told the Mirror: “The Government’s schedule to replace a signicant number of Type  frigates by the mid-s looks increasingly unlikely.“As such, the Royal Navy is on track to have its lowest number of frontline warships on record, by the mid-s, chiefly owing to a frigate capability gap which is all the government’s own making.” Unions urged the Government to speed-up orders to protect workers. Confederation of Shipbuilding and Engineering Unions general secretary Ian Waddell said: The national shipbuilding strategy clearly sets out a drumbeat of naval procurement which is designed to maintain our sovereign capability to design, manufacture and maintain our naval and auxiliary fleet.  We need to get on with delivering it in order to safeguard the safety of the nation and safeguard our world class shipbuilding capability and pump investment into our shipbuilding communities in every part of the UK which will be spent in local shops and businesses. The Prime Minister made much of a high wage high skilled economy in his speech last week but weaposve already got one in shipbuilding and we are at risk of losing it unless we get on with ordering and building these ships in British shipyards. GMB union national officer Ross Murdoch said: The Government’s dither and delay over the five-ship, Type  frigate contract could lead to our aircraft carriers being left with less frigate protection than they require. “Ministers must learn lessons from this and make sure there are no further hold ups to the FSS contracts. Instead of unclear and veiled comments about signicant proportions of the work for the UK, they should confirm the design, build and final assembly work will be carried out in our yards and will support our supply chain. This will provide the much-needed prosperity our UK shipyards and workforce need and help rebuild the UK economy.Most ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Royal NavyMinistry of DefenceKevan JonesArmed forcesPolitics\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Children at Parkside Community School, in Chesterfield, Derbyshire, were ordered out of the building while police brought in an army explosives team to take a look at the grenade. Skilled technicians from the bomb squad arrived at the scene and examined the grenade at around am on Wednesday. It turned out to be only a scare fortunately as the grenade had been decommissioned. It is believed that the grenade had been brought in by a Year  pupil. After the bomb squad gave the all-clear, the children were allowed back into the school and carry on with their classes. A police spokesperson said: “We were called at am todayby the school as a student had brought an old hand grenade into a history lesson. Part of the school was evacuated while the military EODteam was contacted. The team attended and examined the item, confirming it had been decommissioned.” Comment MORE ON EducationSchoolsHands\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Obviously I am new in the role, but on behalf of the Government I am sorry for, during the pandemic, anyone that suffered, especially anyone that lost a loved one, a mother, a dad, a brother, a sister, a friend.

There will be lessons to learn from this pandemic for this Government, for governments across the world, there will be lessons. It is important that is done.

And one demanding dachshund will refuse to eat his whipped cream treat unless it’s in a specic cup. Harlee, a long haired dapple dachshund, from Liverpool, will not eat his puppuccino unless it’s in a Starbucks cup. But his owner has come up with a sneaky way to get him to consume a ‘fake’ drink at home, by saving the mini cardboard cup that Starbucks pup-cups come in. The three-year-old mini daxie’s TikTok is filled with videos of him enjoying his favourite treat, but a weekly trip to Starbies for the dog can prove pretty costly - especiallyyouaposre getting your own iced caramel latte each time too. Harlee’s owner tried to make Harlee a puppuccino at home, using piped whipped cream in a glass mug, even using a nozzle that mimics the piping of Starbucks’ pup-cups.However, the pampered pup knew he was being duped, and thought the treat looked ‘suspicious’ in aTikTok video that reached over , people.He cautiously licks the whipped cream, but certainly isn’t sure about the imposter puppuccino before deciding it ‘tastes funny’. His owner then scoops the cream into their trusty Starbucks cup, adding extra cream with ‘aerosol cream sound effects for extra convincing’, before presenting it to the pup.Fetch. Chase. Eat. Sleep. Repeat. is a new podcast from TeamDogs which takes a sideways look at what itaposs REALLY like bringing puppies into your le.Every week hosts Hannah Jones and Karen Price will be joined by celebrity dog owners like Strictly Come Dancingaposs Shirley Ballas and Coronation Street actress Samia Longchambon to chew over the adventures - and misadventures! - of puppy parenting.

The family, who have asked not to be named, were visiting Manchester at the end of September as their daughter was starting university.They travelled from London and stayed at the Victoria Park Hotel in Rusholme paying £ for two rooms for one night via booking, reports the Manchester Evening News. It wasnapost the most expensive place, so I wasnapost expecting luxury, the mum said. Iaposve travelled quite a lot and used booking for years. I wasnapost expecting anything big, that wasnapost the point of the journey. But we were quite shocked.  It was the worst place Iaposve ever stayed, Iaposve never seen anything like it. When checking-in, the mum says a member of staff told them there was a problem with the keys and they wouldnapost be allowed to keep one for their room. Instead, another member of staff, who didnapost speak any English, used the same key to open both rooms. When the family ed, they were once again escorted to their rooms from reception and told they couldnapost keep a key. The mum eventually insisted on keeping one key between them that would open both doors but said she found the scenario aposvery unnervingapos. When the family ed, they were once again escorted to their rooms from reception and told they couldnapost keep a key. The mum eventually insisted on keeping one key between them that would open both doors but said she found the scenario aposvery unnervingapos. Never mind the décor of random pieces of tiles violently pushed together, clearly against their will. The floor stuck to our shoe. The overwhelming stench of mould was permeating every pore of our skin. Once her daughter was asleep the mum went to make a cup of tea but found the kettle wasnapost working. After trying all the plug sockets in the room she realised the lamps werenapost working either. At that point it hit me there was no electricity, she said.  I was trapped in a filthy, stinky room with no phone and no electricity and windows that didn’t lock. I wasnapost about to leave my daughter unattended in this place where one key opens multiple rooms, and go seek help at the reception. The mum says the ventilation problem in the room was so bad even the teabags were mouldy. My daughter was asthmatic as a child, thankfully she grew out of it but that was the first night she has coughed like that since she was three or four years old, she said. I found it dficult to breathe. I donapost know whether it was the anxiety as well. Victoria Park Hotel did not respond to a request for comment when contacted by the Manchester Evening News. A member of staff who answered the phone asked us to send an email which did not receive a reply. Booking initially apologised for the mumaposs experience and offered her £ in travel credit. After the M.E.N. contacted booking for comment the offer was upped to the full £. The health and safety of our customers is a key priority for us at Booking, as well as listing accommodation that meets the expectations of travellers, which clearly did not happen in this instance, a spokesperson said. We have been in touch with the customer, offered a full refund and any other costs relating to the relocation and will be contacting the accommodation owner to address how they prepare their property for visitors to ensure all future guests have a good experience.” Comment MORE ON Holidays\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Fancy an escape to the Chill newsletter for weekly inspiration and advice on UK holidays Sign Up!Invalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Early years Prince Andrew and Sarah had been friends since they were children but it wasnapost until  that they started dating after being seated together at Royal Ascot that year.They got engaged nine months later on February ,  - his th birthday - and Andrew gave his we-to-be a ruby engagement ring. Their wedding was a grand affair at Westminster Abbey and they shared a kiss on the balcony of Buckingham Palace like Prince Charles and Princess Diana before them. In the early days of their romance, Fergie bonded with the Queen over their shared love of horses, according to Vanity Fair.It was also reported that she won over Prince Philip with her sharp sense of humour and the interest she showed in her father-in-lawaposs favourite sport of carriage driving.Split from Andrew Love the royals for the Mirroraposs daily newsletter to get all the latest news on the Queen, Charles, Kate, Wills, Meghan, Harry and the rest of The Firm. Click here to sign up.After their wedding, the couple welcomed two daughters - Princess Beatrice in  and Princess Eugenie in .But cracks had begun to appear in their relationship as Andrewaposs naval career saw him away from the family for long periods of time. And in  they split with their orce finalised in . Speaking to US TV host Ernie Manouse in , Sarah spoke about palace courtiers, who she said made her le dficult. She explained: “My deal was that I was marrying my man, who happened to be a prince and a naval officer. “But what I got was not the man, I got the palace and didn’t get him... and the courtiers told me I had to go to Buckingham Palace and he had to go to sea. “For our marriage, I saw him  days a year.” Livid royals  Despite splitting from Andrew, Fergie was still invited to join the family for their traditional summer holiday in Balmoral in . However, the politeness disappeared on one excruciatingly embarrassing moment when intimate photos of her appeared on the front pages. She had been snapped having her toes sucked by her financial advisor, Texan millionaire John Bryan. Other photos in the set also showed the couple kissing, embracing and frolicking in the pool and they appeared in newspapers.And while at Balmoral, Fergie had to walk into breakfast that morning while the family all looked at the pictures. Speaking on Channel aposs documentary, Fergie Vs Diana: Royal Wives at War, royal expert Jennie Bond said: There she was, with all the members of the royal family, who traditionally have all the papers laid out on the breakfast table. The scene when she went into the dining room was horrendous because there were her brothers-in-law turning over the pages and staring at her naked top half of her body. It was excruciatingly embarrassing and she went to the Queen, and the Queen was livid. She was absolutely furious with Sarah. Prince Philip rt  One royal who was said to be especially furious with the toe sucking pictures was the late Prince Philip.His biographer Gyles Brandreth once said Philip thought Sarah was simply beyond the pale and gave her a wide berthBrandreth claimed the Duke of Edinburgh decided that aposenough was enoughapos and that he didnapost want anything more to do with her.He told MailOnline : When I asked him [Prince Philip] why he wouldn’t see Sarah, he said: ‘I am not vindictive.’Then, looking at me directly, he added emphatically: ‘I am not vindictive, but I don’t see the point.’ The pair are said to have not met for  years, with Fergie banished from ­Balmoral each summer before Philip arrived. Diana feud It wasnapost just Prince Philip that Sarah stopped talking to - she also had a falling out with her friend Princess Diana.In the early years of their marriages, Diana and Fergie had a close bond. They were often pictured chatting at events, such as Ascot, and took their children on skiing holidays together with Fergie frequently describing Diana as her best friend. But itaposs thought that in  the pairaposs relationship became strained and at the time of Dianaaposs tragic death a year later, they were not on speaking terms.According to the Daily Mail, the reason stemmed back to Sarahaposs autobiography, My Story, released in .Before it was published, Diana is reported to have told her former sister-in-law not to include any gossip about her in it. But Sarah included an unflattering anecdote, saying she got a verruca after wearing a pair of shoes she borrowed from Diana - causing the rt. William wedding snub In , Fergie was snubbed from the royal wedding of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge after being unceremoniously left off the guest list.The wedding came a year after she was caught up in a sting set up by a journalist in which she appeared to ask for and accept , in cash in exchange for access to her ex-husband Prince Andrew.Speaking to Town and Country Magazine she said: I didn’t think I was probably worthy to go to their wedding. I took myself to Thailand, actually, to be far away from it so that I could try and heal.”But she bore no ill will towards her nephew William and said previously: I think Diana would be so proud of her son... I really love the feeling that Diana and I both werenapost there. Harryaposs invitationHowever, by the time Williamaposs younger brother Prince Harry married Meghan Markle in , the tide had begun to turn.And Fergie did bag an invite to the big day - marking ato the royal fold. In later years, she of course took her place alongside he royals at the weddings of Beatrice and Eugenie. Balmoral Despite Fergieaposs frosty relationship with Prince Philip, she is said to have remained on good terms with the Queen. And this year she appeared to be back in the royal inner circle by spending time with Her Majesty and other royals at Balmoral. According to royal expert Angela Levin, this made Fergie happy and feel assheaposs back in the crowd. Praise for the Queen And showing her gratitude to the Queen, Sarah has given her some high praise indeed. Speaking on the Tea with Twiggy podcast earlier this year, she said she admires the way Her Majesty is so modern and flexible. She said: I think to myself that honestly my mother-in-law has been more of a mother to me than my mother. I absolutely think there is no greater mentor because from a little girl to now, the consistency of Her Majesty has been a great honour and makes me want to cry.

The man, whose identity has not been made public, was held in a darkened room and fed sporadically, the Carabinieri police said. He was able to use some kind of code to tell his family he was being held hostage while calling them with the ransom request, it has been reported. They then contacted the police who located the -year-old in Monte San Giusto, near the city of Macerata in central Italy,  hours later. On Wednesday afternoon Italian police said they surrounded the apartment of the alleged kidnappers - who had demanded €,for his release - before safely securing the Brit.  Yesterday the Italian force said that the young man had been on holiday in Italy when he was kidnapped. Three of his alleged kidnappers were Italian, while the fourth was Moroccan. They were reportedly arrested and remanded in custody in a prison near the city of Ancona. The young manaposs release was secured via a joint operation between the Carabinieri and the National Crime Agency. It is unclear why the amount of money demanded was relatively small, given the wealth of the British manaposs family.His family, who are fairly wealthy, received a message from him and contacted the British police and the NCA, who in turn contacted the Carabinieri, Colonel Nicola Candido, who was also involved in the operation, said, thereported. Within  hours, we had located the apartment in which he was being held prisoner. The raid took place at  on Wednesday. We surrounded the apartment block, arrested the captors, and released the hostage. The British man had been in Italy since June, he said. Colonel Massimiliano Mengasini, who was also involved in the operation, said the man was found in a darkened room with furniture pushed up against the wall. The man was exhausted but slowly recovering, he added. Sean Kelly, operations manager for the NCA’s Anti Kidnap and Extortion Unit , said: “We have been working closely with the Italian authorities since the kidnap of a British man was reported. “NCA officers in Italy and specialists from AKEU, working together with UK policing, have been providing close support to the Carabinieri Police as part of its ongoing investigation. “We are pleased that this incident has been resolved successfully.”  Most ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON Crime\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Mistakes at Amyaposs Fish and Chips in Darfield, near Barnsley, South Yorkshire resulted in ideal conditions for food positioning bacteria to grow, inspectors said.Cooked food was left outside to cool down and ingredients were even stored on the floor of the takeaway, YorkshireLive reports.The shop kept a tray of ribs cooling in a warm oven and left raw fish in a washing up bowl in a fridge which was warmer than it should have been. Despite the countless errors, employees were unfazed by the horric conditions and showed little understanding of the risk this may pose. The business said that while it agreed with the remarks from Barnsley politan Borough Council, a number of improvements have been made since the inspection on July . However, the chip shop has been slapped with a zero-star food hygiene rating by the Food Standards Agency- the lowest possible grade. Officials carried out a full food hygiene rating at the chip shop in School Street, Darfield, and filed a troubling report. Among the most concerning findings were the shocking conditions in which food was kept. Food was being stored on the floor of the main cooking area and was at risk of bacterial contamination, said the inspector. The picture above shows bowls of food lying on the floor as a member of staff works nearby. Food was also found being prepared and stored outside, posing further risks to customers, while cooked rice was left out to cool at room temperature. Once food was cooked, it was sometimes left in the danger zone. The inspector spotted a tray of ribs cooling in a warm oven on their visit, which presented the ideal conditions for food positioning bacteria. There was a general lack of cleaning... and hand washing from staff, storage containers were damaged and dirty and there were not even enough cleaning supplies in the building. One area of particular concern was the risk of cross-contamination.  Raw meat was being prepared next to cooked food which was about to be served. The conditions didnapost appear to improve in the fridges either. Here, raw meat and prepared food were stored on the same shelves. The temperature of the fridge - where raw fish was kept in a washing up bowl - was .°C, almost °C warmer than FSA recommendations. Raw meat was also stored unwrapped in freezers, while the lid to one of the chest freezers at the chip shop did not close properly. You must not prepare food for customers who declare they have a food allergy as you are unable to safely prepare food for them to eliminate risk from... cross-contamination, said the inspector. One of the most startling pictures is of the chopping boards at Amyaposs Fish and Chips. These were used by staff for prepared food, but the images show how they are covered in black grime.  Get all the latest news sent to your inbox.for the free Mirror newsletter Chopping boards used for the preparation of ready to eat food items were found to be in a filthy condition, said the report. Remarkably, staff told inspectors this was acceptable and showed little understanding of the risk this may pose. The problems didnapost end there though. The thermometer probe was dirty, but it appears as though the staff didnapost use it anyway. Instead, they simply copied temperature records from previous entries, rather than actually checking the food.  The report added that most of the issues highlighted in the  inspection were also found during previous visits and little progress had been made. The hygiene and safety standards noted on this inspection fall well below those expected, it concluded. Since the inspection, Amyaposs Fish and Chips have filed a brief update to FSA. They claim the premises have been thoroughly cleaned and procedures are now in place to ensure that cleanliness is maintained. The owner has also stated that staff have been trained   re-trained and are under better supervision and a new Food Safety Management system has been introduced.

Each morning the exasperated caterer sees two or three doggers while sheaposs helping lorry drivers to refuel, Yorkshire Live reported. She claims the men come aposfrom Manchesterapos and sometimes so many people turn up thereaposs no room for lorry drivers to park in the layby. If you came and had breakfast at our cafe youaposd see two or three doggers, guaranteed, she said.  Most people think itaposs funny but itaposs actually really seedy. Sharon claims that the wood behind her cafe is littered with condoms and old mattresses that are used for people to have sex on. She says she has repeatedly reported the issue to her local MP and the police, and now feels she needs to warn walkers in the area.  She said: If it were a female and male dogging site, Iaposd feel exactly the same - that just doesnapost come in to it, itaposs the fact that itaposs a dogging site. Thereaposs a hotel  yards up the road, Iaposm sure they would appreciate the business. Itaposs massive. The truckers who do manage to park there on a night get propositioned, they knock on the cab and say aposdya fancy a bit apos She added: The main thing Iaposd love to do is for truckers to be able to park. They come in depressed, theyaposre away from their families and they want a warm meal.  Obviously I donapost come to work for the fun of it, we lost my mum in the beginning of Covid and we opened about a week after we lost her. To see it come to nothing because people canapost come in itaposs terrible - itaposs just soul destroying. But then again the truckers, the plight that they have at the minute, theyaposre not getting the jobs because the conditions are so bad and then to not be able to get in for a meal... Sharon has started a petition calling on local councils to crack down on people using lay-bys to park their car all day.

The force released audio footage to remind people that their  service is for emergencies only.Police made the recording public as part of their Think Before You Dial campaign - but some said shaming an aposelderlyapos man wasnapost the way to deal with the situation.In the two-minute call, the man - whose voice has been disguised - said: This is an odd thing to put to you, but I bought a chicken yesterday from Tesco. What do you think to this story  Have your say in the comments  I put it straight in the fridge without opening the bag. I opened it and the smell from it is absolutely disgusting. Itaposs putrid. I donapost know what to do with it, can you advise me  Despite being repeatedly told the matter was between him and the supermarket, he continued to ask for help - tying up a  call handler for more than two minutes. There is nothing the police are going to be able to do with it, Iaposm afraid. This is a civil matter between you and Tesco, the operator said.  But the man didnapost hang up, he continued to ask for police assistance. If I paid for the petrol, could you not send a car out for me , he asked. The handler replied: No unfortunately, we are dealing with crimes at the moment. Itaposs not under our remit for us to come and collect a rotting chicken. The call ended soon after.

It’s not just Halloween when G.H.O.S.Tdeal with ghastly ghouls, it’s an all year round job. The private paranormal investigators have always had a strong interest in ghosts after founder Craig believed he saw and felt the spirit of his grandfather. Craig was only  at the time, and that’s when his intrigue with the afterle really began. He said: “When I was younger, myself and a couple of friends went to locations to try and experience things. “It kind of escalated from there, we started looking at some of the most haunted locations across the country and around the world. “I decided to incorporate a team and we built on that from there.” It’s not just ghost hunting that Craig and his team get up to though, they even have their very own aposhaunted museum.apos The museum contains eerie artefacts that visitors can look at for themselves, with many of people experiencing some strange encounters. Craig continued: “We’ve got a worldwide audience, and over lockdown we’ve had some strange artefacts that were in peopleaposs houses originally. “I’ve thought about doing something like this for  to  years and over lockdown we got so much stuff that we decided to do it. “People absolutely love it, it’s great for the city of Stoke-on-Trent.” Although spooky encounters are all part of the job for Craig, he does recall some particularly creepy moments. He said: “We went to one location near Liverpool where a woman claimed she was possessed. That was quite daunting. “The young lady still speaks with us via social media today, she often interacts with us.”  Perhaps the creepiest thing from their haunted museum has to be the haunted doll “Mary”, who has made many visitors feel uncomfortable. Craig said: “Mary is definitely the most haunted doll in the United Kingdom, a lady in Stafford gave us this doll who was given to her by an elderly lady for her children. “She didn’t feel comfortable with this doll, so gave it to us. It’s been in our possession for about a year now. “She’s rocked on a chair, she’s thrown herself out of the chair, she’s even moved her eyes from the right to the centre. The previous owner had even experienced issues with her car on the way to give the doll to G.H.O.S.T, which they believe was all caused by Mary. “Mary is definitely one of the most haunted artefacts we’ve had, but we also had a couple who saw a Victorian baby walker move in front of them. “We had two members of a band come to visit us last week and they said they saw the baby walker do the exact same thing. There is also a Victorian séance room in the museum.  Craig said: “The ladies who we run it with have been doing mediumship for  to  years plus, they are very experienced. “We also offer haunted sleepovers from pm in the evening, we give you a full tour of the museum and artefacts, an investigation of the museum, seances and table tipping spirit board sessions.” During the sleepover, visitors get the chance to visit their very own chapel at around am, and have the option to sleep overthey want to. Craig continued: “We’ve had a few sleepovers here, one group almost lasted the whole evening. “You get to sleep in a body bagyou want to, and there is so much activity - from loud footsteps, moving curtains, and the giggles of a little girl.”All of the experiences can be seen on the museumaposs YouTube channel, the team also do regular Facebook lives on their page.Craig concluded: “We offer a genuine ultimate experience all under one haunted location where you can investigate yourself.” For funeral notices in your area visit funeral-notices Comment MORE ON YouTubeMuseumsFrisk\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Sam Hornby, a mum of two, was set the task of creating a Ravenclaw common room by her nine-year-old son when they moved into their new home in Rossendale, Lancashire, in February. His requests even included making the ceiling look like the one from the Great Hall at Hogwarts and the incredible final result looks like something straight out of the film franchise. It includes stone-look walls, candles floating from the ceiling, a chest of drawers painted to look like a stack of trunks used by Harry and his classmates, and plenty of trinkets from the school of witchcraft and wizardry. Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here. Sam, who works as a swimming teacher, says she bought everything she needed from Ikea, The Works and Etsy to pull off the incredible transformation, costing her £ altogether. The -year-old said: My son is a Harry Potter fan and a proud Ravenclaw. He had a Harry Potter room in our old house and so when we moved in February , he asked for me to recreate it, but wanted it to be solely a Ravenclaw common room and not Harry Potter in general. He also askedI was able to make it look like the ceiling of the Great Hall, so the ideas came from him really. Once the room was prepped, Sam said she found an image of the crest her son wanted on the ceiling, and cut it into a cardboard box, using her phone torch to project the crest upwards to use as guidance as she painted it on. She said: Once this was done, I added a picture rail, wallpapered the brick wallpaper, brought the paint down onto the wallpaper to create the illusion my son wanted and then my husband and I did the fibre optics cables in the ceiling - all  of them. It is handy having an electrician for a husband as he also did the wall lights.I painted the IKEA drawers to look like suitcases, printed out labels for the bottles, got old hardback books from a charity shop and printed out the first year reading books from Google Images and added owls and other bits.The shrunken head was crocheted by me, and the Fawkes Phoenix was also crocheted by me from a Crafty Intentions pattern on Etsy. The candles are suspended by transparent thread, a pin hammered into the ceiling and a blob of paint to conceal the pinhead.  “The plaster cost £, the carpet was £, the paint was £, the picture rail was £, the fibre optic lights were £ and the candles cost £. We already had the furniture and the bottles were empty alcohol bottles gted by friends.” Sam said she was thrilled to bits with how it turned out and was even more delighted when she saw her sonaposs stunned reaction. His smile was so big and he was a little overwhelmed as he hadnapost seen it, she said. He last saw it before we started any of the decorating and painting and had been in the spare room. My biggest tip for others who want to recreate this look is actually taken from Mural Joe who is on YouTube. “He has a video that shows you how to comfortably paint a ceiling by rolling up a fleece blanket, putting it round your back, under your arms and then tying it behind your head - it stops any neck ache. My other tip is to shop around as it doesnapost have to cost too much. Buy paint cheap, spend £ a tube at most. And most importantly, take your time to prepare. This includes filling holes and so on, but also get lots of images as references for what you are wanting to paint. Do your research. To be able to completely personalise a room for £, and achieve the dream for my son, is actually priceless.Most ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Harry PotterHousing\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

This means that the Northern, Piccadilly and Jubilee lines will remain closed for now.  The staggered reopening is likely impacted by staff shortages compounded by the pandemic that has also limited TfLaposs ability to train new drivers. In a statement, TfL said: The Central and Victoria lines were previously two of the busiest lines on the Night Tube network and provide crucial links between large parts of London and the centre of the city. Training still needs to take place on the other Night Tube lines - the Jubilee, Northern and Piccadilly lines - so Night Tube services on those lines canas soon as possible. Theof these lines also has to be planned around complex vital operational and engineering closures.  The Night Tube petitionaposs founder Ella Watson wrote: In the UK and London women and girls are unsafe on the streets, especially at night. The rightful outcry at the recent murders of Sabina Nessa and Sarah Everard on Londonaposs streets, epitomises the fear women face of walking alone or standing on the streets in the evening and at night.

PCR swabs from a number of testing sites have been ing negative results to people who had the virus due to errors at a major laboratory in the Midlands. The public have now been told to get retested while close contacts with symptoms are also advised to get a PCR check. It is the latest controversy around the bungled NHS Test and Trace programme which has seen the Government hand multimillion contracts to private firms to run much of the system. Immensa Health was handed a £ million contract and runs a laboratory in Wolverhampton which health officials said gave , people incorrect results between September  and October . Have you been impacted by unreliable testing at the lab  Email webnews@mirror  Most of these results were for people in South West England, prompting fears of spike in the region. Dr Will Welfare, incident director at the UK Health Security Agency, said: “We have recently seen a rising number of positive lateral flow test results subsequently testing negative on PCR. “As a result of our investigation, we are working with NHS Test and Trace and the company to determine the laboratory technical issues which have led to inaccurate PCR results being issued to people. We have immediately suspended testing at this laboratory while we continue the investigation.” Dr Kit Yates, expert at the University of Bath, said: “There’s been a concerted effort to highlight what’s been going on with these strange results for a while now in the hope that someone would investigate. “We now know , people are believed to have been given  negatives, but this doesn’t even come near to the cost of the mistake.  “Many of these people will have been forced into school or work potentially infecting others. This could be part of the reason behind some of the recent rises we’ve seen.” The testing site had previously made headlines after staff were filmed fighting, sleeping, fighting and rolling around on the floor. The contract was handed to Immensa without a standard tender process and according to Companies House the firm only appears to have existed since May just after the start of the pandemic. Andrea Riposati, CEO of Immensa Health Clinic Ltd, said: “We are fully collaborating with UKHSA on this matter. “Quality is paramount for us. We have proudly analysed more than . million samples for NHS Test and Trace.  “We do not wish this matter or anything  to tarnish the amazing work done by the UK in this pandemic.” West Berkshire Council released a statement calling on those who used its Newbury Showground testing site to book another PCR check. The mass testing site in Chieveley, West Berkshire, is one of those affected by the errors at the Immensa lab.  It said Newbury Showground “had results sent out that may have incorrectly shown as negative for Covid-”. It continued: “After receiving reports from local residents in recent weeks that there were concerns about the accuracy of test results from the site, we passed these concerns onto the DHSC for further investigation. “The DHSC has now confirmed that a number of sites nationally may have been affected by this issue, including the one at Newbury Showground.” Those who received a negative result for a PCR test between October  and , as well as their close contacts, were “strongly” encouraged by the local authority to take another test. Dr Welfare, of the UK Has, added: “There is no evidence of any faults with lateral flow tests or PCR test kits themselves and the public should remain confident in using them and in other laboratory services currently provided. “If you get a positive LFD test, it’s important to make sure that you then get a follow up PCR test to confirm you have COVID-. “If you have symptoms of COVID-, self-isolate and take a PCR test.

Lyra Cassell, , from Allerton, Liverpool, found a lump in her groin at the end of August and asked to see a doctor. Her mum, Hayley, says they were told the lump was a hernia, and that they could not get a hospital appointment for months due to an NHS backlog that has been caused by the pandemic.Hayley told the Liverpool Echo : She had a hernia as a baby so we thought it was nothing to worry about. Then we went for a walk in Garston Park and she went aposIaposve got this lump on my neck.apos It was on the side of her neck and it was quite big. I thought aposthataposs not right Lyraapos and I phoned the doctors again. Following her second appointment with a nurse, Lyra was referred for an appointment the hospital and a few days later she had her bloods taken by her GP. Hayley said: [The doctor] phoned me on the Tuesday morning to tell me she was anaemic and to stop giving her sweets and fizzy drinks. They said sheaposs not diabetic but her blood sugar levels are slightly high. However, two weeks later, Lyra went for an ultrasound appointment followed by a biopsy and further blood tests, and on September  received the devastating news that she had acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. She started receiving chemotherapy the next day. Mum Hayley said: Everything was going well for her. The fit and healthy Belvedere Academy student had recently smashed her GCSEs and was running five times a week for the Liverpool Harriers And Athletic Club. Hayley, , said: [Lyra] works in Ginoaposs restaurant in town part-time on the reception and she also taught dance in Liverpool College to four- year olds, so she was really busy and she was loving it. She was saying she was tired but we just put it down to working and going out with her friends. Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia is a type of cancer that affects white blood cells. It progresses quickly and aggressively and requires immediate treatment.  Hayley said: Lyraaposs first question was aposwill I lose my hair apos They explained to us that it will be a very dficult process of at least two years. It feels like itaposs someone  this has happened to - this doesnapost happen to us. Itaposs just horrendous. Two weeks ago I had a normal, and what we thought was a healthy teenager, ready to smash her A-levels and go out clubbing and do all the things we did as a   year old, and now everything is a train wreck.

Dad Thomas Hughes, , and step-mum Emma Tustin, , are accused of mistreating Arthur Labinjo-Hughes before he suffered an un-survivable brain injury at his home in Cranmore Road, Solihull, West Midlands, on June  .The young boy died in hospital in the early hours of the following day, Birmingham Mail reported. Hughes and Tustin both deny murder. Yesterday in court on the sixth day of the trial jurors were played CCTV footage taken in the living room of the family home on June , when Arthur allegedly endured the fatal injury.  They were also shown texts between the Hughes and Tustin from that day, including a photo sent from the woman in which Arthur appears to be crying. From the home Tustin texted Hughes, who was out at the shops, multiple times, writing that the boy was grabbing walls and door and throwing himself down just before pm. They discussed whether a mark on his face was bruising before Tustin sent Hughes an audio clip of Arthur crying followed by a text saying: Still at it. The prosecution showed a clip of the woman leaving the living room for about a minute, during which time they contend she dealt Arthur the fatal blow. Jonas Hankin QC told the court that around this time Tustin texted the aposballoon ladyapos about her birthday decorations for an upcoming party. At .pm Tustin messaged Hughes: Just copped me in the stomach he has thrown himself all over the floor wonapost get up for s*** Iaposve shut the door on him.  A minute later she took a picture on her phone showing Arthur lying down in the hallway. The court was played living room footage showing Tustin walking into the kitchen before ing while looking at her phone and then walking into the hallway. She s carrying Arthur into the living room, Mr Hankin told the court. His body is limp. She carries Arthur into the kitchen then into the living room and places him on the floor. Arthur appears to be unconscious. His eyes are closed, body is limp. He falls to the left onto the floor. It appears his body is limp. Tustin gets up and goes into the kitchen. The next footage from .pm shows Tustin partially pick Arthur up from the floor and drag him into the hallway. She then reappears and places Arthur on the sofa before walking into the kitchen. Giving evidence in court earlier on Thursday, Tustinaposs hairdresser, Catherine Milhench, said she wished she had called police after seeing Arthur on June  and . Ms Milhench, who works from home and first cut Tustinaposs hair in the summer of , said she met Arthur later that year and he seemed absolutely fine, healthy, a normal boy.  Describing a hair appointment at her home in February , Ms Milhench said of Arthur: He was still, I would say, healthy-looking but not happy. He was made to sit downwith his hands on his knees and not move. Ms Milhench told the court: I just thought heaposs obviously been naughty at home. When you go to other peopleaposs you donapost want your child to misbehave. Answering questions from Mr Hankin, Ms Milhench said at another six-hour hair appointment on June  , Arthur was told by Tustin to stand by and face the front door. Mr Hankin asked Ms Milhench: Throughout the time that she was there in your home, how did she sheinteract with Arthur  The witness answered: Telling him to stand, not to lean on the door, to face the door... not to move. Tustin then went to the bathroom to have her hair washed, Ms Milhench said, adding of Arthur: He was made to come upstairs and face another door upstairs. She said he couldnapost be trusted. Asked for her view of Arthuraposs state during the visit, Ms Milhench said: Deteriorated. You could see his collar bones. He was wearing a pyjama onesie and you could just see his collar bones sticking out.  I didnapost remember that from last time. He had lost weight. Using the phrase like skeletal to describe what Arthuraposs condition made her think of, Ms Milhench said the boy appeared to be drained and weak, adding: It wasnapost nice to see. His legs trying to walk up the stairs would be shaking, like he couldnapost hold himself up. Asked what happened when Hughes arrived at her home to pick up Tustin, Ms Milhench added: He parked on my drive. Tom had himby the scruff, took him out. I remember Arthur falling on the floor. He just collapsed and fell into the car. The court heard Tustin ed to complete her hair appointment on June , arriving at around .am. During the visit, Ms Milhench said Tustin and Hughes were constantly swearing at Arthur like a game of tennis, with Tustin going on to claim that Arthur was being pressure-pointed. Ms Milhench said she had suggested Arthur should be sent to live with his grandmother, but was told that would be what he wants and would allow him to win. The court was also told that Ms Milhenchaposs partner, Tobias Jarman, snuck a drink of water to Arthur without Tustin and Hughes knowing. Mr Jarman, who said Arthur looked malnourished and had cracked lips, told the court: I tried to reassure him. I said, aposyou have not got to be scared of me in any wayapos. He look petried. It was not the normal glow you see in a kidaposs eyes of that age. It looked like there was fear ingrained inside of there. Hughes and Tustin deny murder. Tustin has admitted one count of child cruelty but has denied further charges of the same offence. Hughes also denies child cruelty offences.

Customers have been snapping the odd product choices in supermarkets like Tesco, Co-op and Asda across the country.It comes as Brits are warned of a light Christmas ahead after the UKaposs biggest container port reached capacity and was forced to turn ships away. Products are now being delayed and not making it into stores, according to reports. The shortages have been noticed by Brits up and down the country, who have been taking photographs of the rogue choices. One shared an image of fresh food crates at a Co-Op in Hertfordshire loaded with Quality Street, Celebrations and Dairy Milk instead of vegetables. Meanwhile, an Asda in Gloucester stretched out a display of Lynx deodorant to cover most of its toiletry aisle.  A Tesco Extra in Cardf was mocked after a massive sunflower oil display was spotted in the frozen food aisle. Staff at another Co-Op branch stuck rows of squeezey bottles of Heinz Salad Cream and HP sauce in refrigerators. The rogue items have been appearing in stores as shipping giant AP Moller-Maersk is erting vessels from their facility in Felixstowe, Suffolk. The Danish company warned the problem will continue into the new year. The issue has reportedly been caused by a lack of lorry drivers, a spike in imports and Covid restrictions at ports combining in a aposperfect stormapos.  Lars Mikael Jensen, head of the east-west network at Maersk, said containers are stacking up in Felixstowe because there are not enough drivers to aposget boxes outapos.Most imported toys come through the port, raising fears there will be shortages over Christmas, The Times reports. And today Tory Chancellor Rishi Sunak did little to reassure customers when discussing shortages - confessing that the government canapost fix every single problem.As fears grow of kids waking up on Christmas Day to empty stockings, the Chancellor said the Government were do absolutely everything we can to solve the British port issues.  Diverted ships are being unloaded at ports where, including Rotterdam, Antwerp and Bremerhaven, and are then transferred to smaller vessels to be transported to the UK. The process is reportedly causing delays of up to a week. Mr Jensen previously told : There is a shortage of truckers in the UK. Normally after four to five days the containers are out of the terminal and into a warehouse in Birmingham or wherever before coming back empty. “The trouble is that now we don’t have the same speed of flow of boxes moving in and out. With fewer truckers on average it takes longer to get boxes out of the terminal, so they are left standing. He also told The Times: We had to stop operations on a ship because there was nowhere to discharge the containers. Felixstowe is among the three worst affected ports in the world, Mr Jensen said. One shipping boss told The Times: I donapost want to sound like a Grinch but there are going to be gaps on shelves this Christmas. Mike Bowden, procurement manager at the shipping group Cory Brothers, added the port is so full of containers that new ones cannot be unloaded - and empty ones cannot be put back on ships. The Department of Transport told The Times that the issue was not aposunique to the UKapos, adding that ports around the world are battling container capacity and supply chain issues.

Madison Collins began suffering from head jerks and ticks, which mum Melanie says seemed to come from nowhere in January of this year.Melanie, , described how one frightening attack in June left -year-old Madison, known as Madi, unable to breathe and needing hospital treatment. The worried mum said she now fears the ticks are being caught via social media after learning  other girls developed similar symptoms.The manager said Madi is now aposticking every dayapos to the point where sheaposs repeated phrases  times, punched herself and her hands have even locked into place for three hours. Melanie remains sceptical that her daughteraposs sudden condition is caused by social media specically as she questions why boys have been less affected, however she said she aposwouldnapost rule it outapos. She is now speaking out about Madiaposs situation and urging parents with similar experiences to come forward to find its cause. Melanie, of Clacton-on-Sea, Essex, said: [The college] said that they had  girls and one boy that have ticks at the moment. I was relieved. I know thataposs an awful thing to say but hearing that made me know that something has actually happened.  Something is happening to make this happen to girls andI can find a reason for it, I can deal with it better. If somethingaposs happening as a nation, we need to get to the bottom of it. We owe it to our daughters to find out why this is happening and what we can do to make sure it doesnapost happen to other girls her age. I just felt like I wanted to do something and rather than sitting there speculating, I want to find out for myself how big of a problem this is rather than being told aposthis is happeningapos. I want to get people together so we can do something about it. I think thereaposs strength in numbers and rather than this getting pushed under the carpet,I can find other people going through this, we can push this to the government level to get something done about it and get proper research to find what the cause is. Research led by Dr Kirsten Muller-Vahl at the Hannover University Medical School stated that a spike in patients displaying aposticksapos positively correlated to a rise in videos featuring Touretteaposs on sites such as TikTok, YouTube and Instagram.The study claimed the rise in ticks could be viewed as a aposstress reactionapos to societyaposs emphasis on iniduality and aposvaluing their alleged exceptionalityapos, which they say promotes aposattention-seeking behavioursapos. Worried Melanie has read the articles on the subject and also heard the condition linked to stress from the pandemic but she remains unsure what is causing it. However she refuses to rule anything out and called for more people to come forward so that more research can be done.  Melanie said: Online articles are saying that social media sites like TikTok is a probable cause. One of them is that people are going on there to highlight their ticks and thataposs starting off other kids to have it. On my LinkedIn posts there have been comments that have been said about that social media is being looked into as a possible cause, people have said aposmaybe social media is the reason whyapos, thereaposs been a couple of articles as well that have been linked on my LinkedIn post. My gut is telling me that itaposs external. Something has happened which is affecting girls. A lot of people are putting it down to [social media] or the stress of the pandemic but Iaposm not convinced of that because Madi will delete her social media every so often. Andshe feels like sheaposs becoming a bit consumed by social media she will delete it from time to time and will almost hit a reset and then go back to it. When I asked her about her stress levels during the pandemic she wasnapost particularly overly stressed. Iaposm not saying that it hasnapost played a part in it, Iaposm just not convinced she was stressed enough to bring on ticks. But then I donapost know, Iaposm not a medical doctor. I donapost think itaposs social media because I thinkit was social media,it was TikTok, like people are saying, I think boys would be affected. I wouldnapost rule it out. But I just thinkit was social media, it would affect boys as well, particularly as this condition is more prevalent in boys than it is in girls.  Melanie, who described her daughter as aposreliableapos, aposactiveapos and aposfunnyapos said she never had any of these symptoms as a child and from her understanding most children with Touretteaposs usually get recognised by the child is six-years-old. The devoted mum said sheaposs also been told by professionals that normally cases of Touretteaposs are more prevalent in boys. However, in the last  months thereaposs been a massive spike in referrals for girls between the ages of -. Melanie said: It was probably about eight months ago that she started these head ticks where she was jolting her head and they started getting progressively worse. Then she started having almost seizure-type ticks where her eyes would roll in the back of her head. We had to phone the ambulance, sheaposs been to hospital about it twice. They were so bad that she couldnapost breathe properly. It was almost like a seizure but when she was in hospital they confirmed it wasnapost because her vitals were quite normal, so it was just a tick spasm attack. It was frightening to watch. Sheaposs had a few of those. And then the vocal ticks about this time started kicking in as well. Madi says the ticks have had a dramatic effect on her daily le.  Her ticks include clicking noises, neck jerks, punching herself, vocal ticks in which she repeats a phrase repeatedly, sometimes for a whole day, scratching herself and even banging her head against the table. Madi said: When the ticks were small it didnapost really matter and to be honest I put it down to anxiety ticks for quite a long time and I just thought theyaposd go away. And when they got really bad it stopped everything. I used to read a lot and for a few weeks after my ticks got really bad I just couldnapost pick up a book, Iaposd just throw it. And there are still times I do throw my books. Just not as often now, you kind of learn how to deal with it. I wasnapost able to sit through my classes. I was told to leave a lot. I practically wasnapost able to do anything normal anymore. Everything became a lot harder. When I was working at the restaurant, I would have incidents where I would throw a glass on the floor. Then when I was trying to pick it up, I would just put it in my mouth and try to bite down unless someone took it out. There will be days where I can barely walk a few steps without falling over. When Iaposm trying to have a conversation with someone, my vocal ticks can get in the way and they can cause a lot of mishaps. For example, people think Iaposm calling them a b*tch or something. When Iaposm trying to do assessments or exams it can be really hard. I was trying to do an assessment in criminology and my hands locked so I was trying to do it with one hand and it didnapost unlock for three hours after, which is quite painful because itaposs quite a cramping one. Mum-of-three Melanie shared a post on LinkedIn and said that around - parents have contacted her, with around four or five of them saying their children have suddenly developed Touretteaposs.  She said that Madiaposs college have been aposabsolutely brilliantapos and theyaposve kept her included in all the decisions made surrounding her education. Melanie said: She hasnapost been diagnosed with Touretteaposs yet because she had to have symptoms for over a year to get diagnosed. Itaposs walking that fine line of not accepting it but at the same time accepting it because you donapost want her to feel uncomfortable by it. At the moment it looks like Touretteaposs, thataposs what itaposs presenting itself as. It was a lot to get my head around and to be honest itaposs only then when talking to the college that I was realising that other girls are going through this that I thought there must be a cause, andwe can find the reason weaposve got a better chance of finding treatment or a cure. Dr Muller-Vahl et alaposs study claimed teenagers were presenting ticks similar to a popular German YouTuber who demonstrated them in his videos, which have gone viral over the last two years. Suzanne Dobson of Touretteaposs Action, a UK-based charity that researches the condition and supports affected families, suggested in an interview earlier this year that social media may simply be encouraging teenage girls to be more open about their ticks. But she also speculated that gathering more aposlikesapos for demonstrating severe ticks, could be resulting in the girls no longer trying to stop the ticks. Hospitals in the UK claim to have seen an increase in ticks being reported in teenage girls since the pandemic. Great Ormond Street and Evelina Childrenaposs Hospitals each received between four and six referrals of ticks in teenage girls between -. However during the last three months of , this surged to each receiving three to four referrals per week.

Jaclyn Misch, from Michigan, USA, was -years-old when she started to think she had a health issue as she hadnapost had her period yet. After several doctors appointments she was diagnosed with Mayer-Rokitansky-Kuster-HauserType , a rare condition that occurs in females and mainly affects the reproductive system. Essentially it means that she was born with no womb or cervix, and also has an incomplete vagina. A dilator was used to stretch her vaginal canal so that she could have penetrative sex, but she cannot carry her own child. In , the now -year-old who won the title of Miss Michigan USA , met Jonathan and then married him in .  The couple tried for a baby through IVF and gestational surrogacy, but after three failed embryo transfers they parted ways from their former carrier. They currently have a new gestational carrier that volunteered to potentially carry their baby. I was diagnosed with MRKH when I was sixteen my family physician was concerned I had never started my cycle but since I was lean and athletic, thought this might be the delay, Jaclyn said.  At sixteen years old, I really wanted to pretend that none of this was happening, so thataposs exactly what I did. Iaposd been trying so hard to fit in with my high school friends, but as fate would have it, my diagnosis had a dferent path planned for me. I was now one in , women around the world diagnosed with MRKH Syndrome. The fundamental biological traits that made me a woman, my self-identity and the plans for my future had shted.  I had to use dilators to have sex, I would never have a period and be like my girlfriends and I would never carry a child. I didnapost feel the same as other females and I frankly still donapost. Jaclyn said she kept quiet about the condition for years, not even telling members of her own family. Husband Jonathan helped the wine educator and marketer open up. He encouraged me to enter my first pageant and I won, she continued. I truly feel like I won as a way to use the  to spread awareness about MRKH syndrome. At the time of my diagnosis, there was no social media and the only thing my parents and I could find online about it were a few research articles. I felt confused, scared and angry. I ignored most of my emotion towards it and didnapost want to think about it.  It took me years to come to terms with the diagnoses and fully process. I had to learn to become comfortable in my own skin again for sixteen years of my le I had been conditioned by society and our culture to think I would grow up, get married and have a baby. Jaclyn had long hoped that she would one day become a mum.  I played with baby dolls and dreamt of having a baby bump, she continued. So when the diagnosis came, my self-identity shted and I had to start envisioning a le without the blessing of pregnancy. As far as sexual intercourse goes, I think itaposs important to preface this by saying everything is aposnormalapos down there on the outside. But girls with MRKH have a aposshallowapos vaginal canal, meaning in order to have sexual intercourse you need to self-dilate . Or have surgery to elongate the vaginal canal my doctor and I decided dilation was my best option, as itaposs also the first line of treatment recommended by The American College of Gynaecology.  I didnapost have much of an issue and things went quickly and smoothly. As happy as the couple are together, MRKH has had an affect on their relationship. Iaposve been with my husband Jonathan since  and I have to say that my diagnosis affects our relationship emotionally in our journey to parenthood, Jaclyn said. Seeing our friends get pregnant so fast and easily will always strike a small chord in my mind. Of course, Iaposm happy for them but always wishing to have that ability myself. After our three failed embryo transfers and parting ways with our previous gestational carrier I was a mess. Asking myself what my le purpose is, will we ever have a child of our own  I was completely deflated, and it hit me much harder than Jonathan. Instead of the path to parenthood being joyful and happy ours is stressful, emotional, and draining both mentally and financially. Our journey to parenthood is by far the most challenging. For the longest time, Iaposve seen PGS aposchromosomally normalapos embryos taking on the first time. Iaposve had friends with MRKHget pregnant on their first transfer with their high-quality embryos so naturally, I thought we would too as our embryos were perfectly normal. But that wasnapost the case three times in a row. The waiting period is also extremely dficult. Between transfers, waiting for the two-week pregnancy blood test building up excitement only to be completely deflated with the negative results. Currently, we have a new gestational carrier and are beyond grateful that she and her husband have volunteered to help us start a family. We are in the process of having her screened by our IVF doctor. Jaclyn hopes that others will gain strength from her story. She said: You are never alone so many women have been diagnosed with MRKH from around the world there is an entire network of MRKH sisters waiting for you with encouragement, understanding and support through every phase of MRKH.

Nutritional therapist Julie Silver recommends also using a saltpipe - an inhaler designed to help improve our respiratory systems - to alleviate coughing and sneezing. They can be picked up online for around £.  Afternoon GP Dr Sarah Brewer recommended staying inside and keeping warmyou feeling a cold coming on. If the nose gets too cold, these immune systems don’t work properly, so you are more susceptible to infection, she explained. Staying indoors also limits the spread of infection.

So stock up.He also advised to stay well hydrated by drinking plenty of water to beat that scratchy feeling that develops at the back of our throats when the temperatures drop. Alcohol can dehydrate you further so itaposs best to stay off the booze for a bit. Nutritionist Amanda recommended snacking on nuts, as they contain selenium which supports our immune systems.  Evening Saving the best until last, having a cold is the perfect excuse to get a curry in.

I would apologize to them, though. Explain it was s***** for you to insist you deserve it for buying the cards because they were a gt.

I’ve grown since then, I’ve grown as a person and I feel like now I can tell the story and not actually cringe as bad about it, she explained in a TikTok video. I’m not sure how old I was, I think I was about  and I was dating my bosses’ brother at the time and I was proper in love with him, I don’t know why. But I was head over heels, didnapost go near a single other boy and he was the one - at the time. During the relationship, Lauren was on the contraceptive pill and said sheaposd always been really good at taking it.

So, I was crying my eyes out because I’ve always wanted kids.  Lauren decided to go to the clinic and take the medication to get rid of the infection before confronting her ex, who went on to deny having given her the STI. He’d been cheating - I think he said he’d slept with three other girls behind my back - that was the start of me being cheated on - all the time, she said. Anyway, it was really easy to treat and I’m just so glad I caught it. I can never thank that woman enough who just absolutely blagged my head and teenage me was like aposshut up.apos I’m so glad she made me get a test.

The accused, identied only as Jonathan R. has been charged with attempted murder in a trial that started on Monday in Cologne, Germany.

Gil Wizen was staying at a reserve in Napo province of eastern Ecuador, when he followed a trail of baby spiders in his bedroom to find a Brazilian wandering spider and its offspring.The spider, which is as big as a human hand, had taken refuge under Mr Wilzen’s bed where she was seemingly guarding her children, the Daily Star reported.Mr Wizen managed to take a photograph to document his face to face encounter with the venomous creature, capturing an image which has now won him a prestigious award. The spider room, which is the name given to the image, saw Mr Wilzen awarded the Wildle Photographer of the Year award for Urban Wildle. According to notes on the award website, Mr Wilzen used forced perspective to make it appear even larger. Following the success in capturing the moment, a daring Mr Wilzen safely relocated the spider outside. Speaking on his blog about the photograph, in a post which appears to be from , he said: Not only there were literally thousands of spiderlings under the bed, right beside them rested one of the biggest aposnon-tarantulaapos spiders I have ever seen. “Its bodywas mm but with its leg span it could easily cover my hand.  Brazilian wandering spiders are more commonly known to roam forest floors at night rather than bedrooms. They search for prey such as frogs and cockroaches. Although their toxic venom can be deadly to mammals including humans, it can also be used for medicinal uses. The overall winner for this year’s Wildle Photographer of the Year went to French biologist and underwater photographer Laurent Ballesta. She managed to capture a camouflage grouper fish swimming around in a cloud of eggs and sperm. Other winning photos included fighting fish, an inquisitive underwater elephant, a calm gorilla and a beautul reflection in a coral reef.

Matt Streatfeild, from Newcastle, New South Wales, in Australia, came across the message from the past as he knocked down two walls in his home as part of a renovation. Intrigued he opened the letter dated April , , and to his surprise found it was written from the plasterers who built the walls. It was meant to give future generations an idea of what le was like back in the mid-s. You always hear the legend of messages in a bottle, but you never think youaposll find one in between two walls in your own house, Mr Streatfeild said. The letter said the workers from Newcastle Interior Linings, which still exists today, earned each week and that the bottle was one of the first measured in metric being equal to a “one imperial pint”.  The workers were also listed and Mr Streatfeild was able to track down Ron Niddrie, one of the plasterers who is now aged . One of these little mementos has paid off, Mr Niddrie told NBN News.. The fact that it was  years ago was even more of a shock. The message stated: “We are waiting for our weekly wages which are, gross, . .  “The bottle is one of the early metric, as we are beginning a metric conversion, it is equal to one imp pint.” Mr Streatfeild now says that he will now put the bottle back behind the new wall when it is built and add a bottle of his own for future generations. When we re-sheet this wall weaposre going to place the old bottle that we found from  with that piece of history, and weaposre going to add our own, he said. Little face mask from  and a bit of a description of how leaposs been for the last couple of years.

Lukas Ostertag was one of the underwater group who encountered the freaky sea beast while ing in the Sataya Reef, off the Egyptian coast. The -year-old described the creature’s appearance as being a “long square rubber pipe-like thing” with a pointy end. “It looked like nothing Iaposve seen before,” he said. It definitely was super strange as it seemed to move on its own and nobody knew what it was. Lukas said it reminded him of the Yrr - a fictional deep-sea species hellbent on destroying mankind, dreamed up by Frank Sch tzing for his novel, The Swarm.  He and his fellow ers thought it might be a kind of polyp - a soft-bodied organism related to sea anemones and jellyfish. Others guessed it to be a worm or a kind of plant, Lukas said, while one other person thought it might be a jellyfish. Looking for answers, Lukas, from Heidelberg, Germany, shared his photos with an online group dedicated to identying marine animals. However, the members seemed to share his confusion. One person wrote: Wow this thing is a puzzler. I could see it being a siphonophore, soft coral, pyrosome, maybe nemertean, or jellyfish arm. Iaposm stumped.  Another commented: Looks like a nemertean - ribbon worm, but the jellyfish part is possible as well. In the end, Lukas got an answer when footage emerged from another group that had been ing the same reef. In the end we figured out it was from a jellyfish as another e group the same day made a video,” he said. The thing we saw was the leftover arms of the jellyfish, probably after being devoured by a sea turtle. I guess in the end the arms were still moving a bit because the jellyfish was not eaten long ago.  The specic species is thought to be the Thysanostoma lorerum. Lukas said it had been “fun” figuring out what the creature was after being “so clueless” upon the initial sighting. “That we found out it was a jellyfish was pure luck,” he said.

When they got there Jesus asked them: #What were you arguing about along the way #They couldn#t answer, for they had been arguing about which of them was the greatest. They were silent, because they#d been caught out.Then Jesus took a little child in his arms and said to them: #Whoever welcomes one such child in my name welcomes me, and whoever welcomes me, welcomes not me but the one who sent me.#Greatness, Jesus was saying to them, is found in welcoming and receiving into our arms someone vulnerable, powerless and dependent, regardless of age.Greatness is found not in what we have accomplished but in what we have done and given to #the least of these#, the hungry, thirsty, naked, sick, and imprisoned: the symbolic children in each of our lives.Greatness never makes itself superior over another. It is not about me, my job, my reputation, my status. Our greatness is revealed in our service and care of others.Max is doing well, by the way, and I can hardly wait to see him again.God bless you and yours, from biggest to littlest, today and always."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column september 24 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.We would like to add our best wishes to Mr Peter Ciarella on reaching his th birthday.He is undoubtedly one of the best-known and loved people in the district, and his contribution to Lochgilphead over the decades is immeasurable.It#s amazing how the foresight and hard work of dferent groups of people, working independently for their own particular areas of interest, have resulted in a number of improvement schemes coming to fruition at the same time.Mid Argyll is looking forward to the completion of projects to upgrade the Lochgilphead swimming pool, front green and Kilmartin Museum.

especially when it comes to the impact of proposed sites on traditional fishing grounds # poor site maintenance and monitoring which can lead to instances of vessel entanglement and also the environmental impact of the sites on both commercial and non-commercial species.The group believes that while the sector has made many advances over the past decade, increased transparency and oversight are needed to ensure the aquaculture sector can better co-exist with the fishing industry.The initial aim of the group would be to ensure that there is a proper analysis of localised fishing and follow up with clear and sensible communication between the two sectors to ensure that with expansion does not come conflict.It is a timeous idea, which will hopefully reassure fishermen that they will not simply be displaced by fish farming but will be respected for their own produce.The group will cement a policy to assist the fishing industry deal realistically with the fish farming industry and the Scottish Salmon Producers Organisation.Simon Macdonald, chair RIFG Aquaculture Work GroupSir,NFU Scotland is calling on the UK Government to address the nation’s growing labour crisis, which is undermining all parts of the food and drink supply chain, leading to signicant losses on some Scottish farms and resulting in a growing number of empty shop shelves.Last week#s #BackBritishFarmingDay on September  came as a UK Government announcement of a free trade #agreement in principle# between the UK and New Zealand is believed to be imminent.Having agreed in June to provide unfettered access in the future to Australia, the cumulative impact of another deal with a major exporting nation has huge signicance for Scottish farmers and crofters.With so much to celebrate about the quality and standards of our food and drink, #BackBritishFarmingDay was a fantastic opportunity to thank the nation for their incredible support throughout Brexit and Covid-.NFU Scotland, both independently and in conjunction with the Scottish food and drink industry, has written several times to UK Government calling for measures that address the shortfall in both seasonal and permanent staff.Should it fail to do so, I have absolutely no doubt that the situation will deteriorate further.It is galling to hear that the UK Government is on the verge of signing up to another free trade deal that will permit a growing level of imports while delivering very little to our food and drink sector in .The blunt fact is that neither deal has been afforded any kind of proper parliamentary scrutiny as the government’s promised Statutory Trade and Agriculture Commission has yet to be established.Safeguards against market disruption are also promised, but the cumulative impact of these deals will be profound for UK farming.If handled badly, these may make it impossible for some of our family farming businesses to continue to compete with high levels of low-cost imports produced to standards that would not be allowed here.Martin Kennedy, president, NFU ScotlandSir,National audits of diabetic services have shown that only around  per cent of people with type one or two diabetes have nine key annual checks to help prevent long-term diabetic complications.The pandemic has made this situation dficult because many routine checks and face-to-face appointments have not been available.The InDependent Diabetes Trusthas published a free new booklet which explains the nine key tests.It helps people look after their health by ensuring that they know what checks they need from health professionals.Get your copy of Diabetes care #

many other people.The errors relate to test results given to people between September  and October , mainly in the South West of England, but with some cases in the South East and Wales.There are no technical issues with test kits themselves and people should continue to test as normal, UKHSA said.It said a full investigation is being carried out into why and how incorrect results were given.Dr

defeat.And last Saturday#s defeat came about through a goal each in the early and late stages of the match, despite a strong showing from the Kintyre Park side.Playing in a ---, Tarbert#s Craig Johnstone ed to central defence and John McCallum played on the left wing in place of the unavailable Rhys Casci, while Liam Renton ed to the fray on the right of the front three, in place of the injured Ross Brown.To compound all the chopping and changing of the team beforehand – a common feature of Pupils# line-ups due to injuries and work commitments in recent weeks – the Kintyre side suffered a huge setback on the pitch after two minutes.A Finnart corner, for all the world a Pupils# goal kick, was awarded by the referee, and the visitors# near-post delivery was flicked on and erted into the net by a Finnart head at the back post.Although the award of the corner was thought to be unjust, the home side was left reflecting on a set piece which could have been defended much better.The McFadyens-sponsored Pupils gradually settled into the game after this early shock and enjoyed decent spells of possession,perhaps only resulting in half-chances at goal – notably through a Scott Souden header which went narrowly by the post – throughout a tightly-contested first half.After the interval, the Pupils continued to press for an equaliser, but their battle-hardened visitors, who have enjoyed the winning habit for most of this season so far, were well organised in defence, with experienced substitutes adding a calmness to their play.Nevertheless, working hard in search of an equaliser, the Feathers Inn-sponsored Pupils had a foray into the Finnart box midway through the second half when Stuart Crossan played in John McCallum with a deft flick, but the latter#s right-footed shot flashed wide of the Finnart goal.McCallum found space in the box again soon after and cut the ball back to Scott Souden, a little too far behind, but was bailed out by the onrushing Liam Renton, who looked to have the goal at his mercy, but somehow a Finnart defender got back to block the close-range effort.Meanwhile, Pupils captain Keith Mitchell had switched from a midfield berth to left back during the second half, and the change was bearing fruit with a good deal of the Pupils# play developing down this flank.However, more frustration was to follow for the home side in the rd minute, as the Pupils# defence was exposed in a two-vs-one situation and an unmarked Finnart forward latched on to a through-ball and lashed a shot beyond young Pupils #keeper Alasdair Ferguson to give the visitors an unassailable - lead with so little time remaining.It was a bitter blow for the home side having put so much effort into earning at least a point, but hopefully it can be taken as another lesson in game management from an experienced and well-drilled opponent.Tomorrow , the Pupils are on their travels, taking on Paisley outfit Glenvale FC on league duty at the town#s Ferguslie Park.

I have referred to this excellent record in providing information for this historical résumé.A further detailed company history is being prepared, though the rapidity with which West Coast#s evolution takes place means that it is hard to ever regard any such work as complete!Suffice it to say that John, David and William Craig, having formed a garage repair business just after the end of the First World War, then ventured into the realms of road passenger transport in February  by launching a service between Campbeltown and Tarbert to compete with Duncan Ramsay, an existing operator on this route.The Post Office then put out to tender its mail contract to meet the steamer at Tarbert. It was secured by what became the second of the famous Kintyre passenger transport company names, A  P McConnachie.Further new operators joined the fray and, as was common in those days, intense competition occurred everywhere in the country until regulatory route licensing was introduced in  with the arrival of the Road Traffic Act.Post Office mails and parcels contracts formed a key part of the Kintyre service network in a similar but much further reaching geographical spread, the now famous MacBraynes organisation of those times similarly carried parcels and mails to destinations across the western seaboard and western isles in its own fleet of buses and motor ships.In the mid-s,West Coast Motors obtained a contract to convey mails and parcels to and from Campbeltown and Glasgow. This was renewed at succeeding intervals and continued right up until .The vans and light trucks later used were every bit as smartly turned out as the coaches, and were an excellent advert for the company.To be continued in next week#s Courier."},{"url":null,"title":"minato-sushi-cheese-lady-boost-haddington-town-centre","story":"The Cheese Lady on Haddington High Street is moving into the former butcher premises of Colin D Peat on neighbouring Court Street.The move from High Street has opened the door for Minato Sushi to bring the Japanese delicacy to the town centre.The changing face of the town centre was welcomed by councillors Tom Trotter and John McMillan, with the new businesses set to open this summer.Jen Kerr, of Minato Sushi, stressed there was still plenty of work ahead at the business before the doors opened.The -year-old, of Port Seton, who will run the business with her boyfriend Tom Cuddy, described it as ldquoa real dream come true.She said: ldquoWe are really excited.

I thought it might be fitting for the bell to be recommissioned and used again in remembrance of the  lives lost.”Towards the end of , Bill contacted a local craftsman and friend, Richard Wilson, and askedhe could help. It had been hoped to have the clapper made and fitted ready for the anniversary in , however plans had to be delayed due to the pandemic.In the meantime, Richard carried out online research and was eventually able to get inside the Cathedral to measure up, acquiring the bronze for the clapper proved dficult locally so he had to source it online.“It took me around a fortnight to make the clapper in my shed at home mostly using a hobby lathe and a CNC router,# said Richard.#I was a bit taken aback when Bill asked me to do this for him. Obviously, it is a great honour and a privilege for me to be asked considering the history of the ship and the lives lost during the sinking.#Hopefully this clapper will be around for years to come and will be used to commemorate the event each year.”However, this was only half the tale. The clapper needed a tassel — a rope that someone would actually hold to ring the bell.Fran Hollinrake is the visitor services officer and custodian at the cathedral.She said that, having attended several commemorations over the years, her and her husband Andy became friendly with a couple, John and Tracy Welch.John’s father, Stoker Petty Officer John Welch, was on board HMS Royal Oak the night she sank, but he survived.His son, John, was a rigger in the Tyneside dockyards, and spent much of his working le working with ropes, but ill-health prevented John from making the tassel.Instead he passed the job on to his former apprentice and friend Paul New.John and his we Tracy arrived in Orkney this week and were present at the unveiling.John said of his father#s experience on that fateful night: #The night of the sinking he was on deck having a cigarette when the explosion happened. He managed to get off the ship and into the water and was picked up by the Daisy II.#He said he had held on to another chap in the water who was in dficulty,  as he was an excellent swimmer and had medals for le saving and water polo, but when they were both pulled aboard by the crew of the Daisy unfortunately the other chap had died. He was lucky to escape with burns to his hands and face.#After medical attention I think a week or so later he was sent back to Portsmouth to join another ship.“As I far as I can remember he never ed to Orkney, but after the war attended the reunions in Portsmouth on a regular basis. As for his feelings about that night it wasn’t something he went into in great detail, but he did say thathe could get back on the ship he would know exactly where his gold lighter and cigarette case were.#Representing the council, who maintain the Cathedral on behalf of the people of Orkney, Councillor Stephen Clackson also has a personal connection to the Royal Oak, having tragically lost his uncle Ronald George Clackson when the ship went down.He said: “My Uncle Ronny was the closest sibling in age to my dad and his favourite brother. He was very technically minded and joined the Royal Navy on July , , aged ¾, for ‘  ’ years.#After training at the shore establishment HMS Victory, he was posted to the recommissioned HMS Royal Oak as an ordinary seaman on June , , when the ship was expected to be embarking on a -month tour of the Mediterranean.#Looming hostilities set the course of the battleship in another direction, and by August she was in Scapa Flow. My uncle was reported missing presumed killed when the Royal Oak was sunk by torpedoes from the U- in the early hours of October , just a week after his th birthday.#The news was devastating for my grandmother, whose brother had been killed on the Somme in World War I at the same age, and she never really got over it.

It said: ldquoIn , we adapted and evolved into Covid- testing, taking advantage of our laboratory network, scientic expertise, and digital systems to deliver world-leading Covid- testing solutions.Andrea Riposati, chief executive of Immensa, said: ldquoWe are fully collaborating with UKHSA on this matter.ldquoQuality is paramount for us. We have proudly analysed more than . million samples for NHS Test and Trace, working closely with the great teams at the Department for Health and UKHSA.ldquoWe do not wish this matter or anything  to tarnish the amazing work done by the UK in this pandemic.Among the testing sites affected are Newbury Showground in Berkshire.A man from nearby Swindon said his confidence in the accuracy of his recent Covid test result has been impacted by the issue at the Immensa laboratory.Tim Barton, , told the PA news agency he and his family received positive lateral flow tests after falling ill with coronavirus symptoms earlier this month but their PCR tests came back negative.The client relationship director said: ldquoMy son, daughter and myself all had positivendash we then had PCR tests done at the test site in Swindon all of which came back negative.ldquoThis will undoubtedly impact peoplersquos confidence in the accuracy of these types of testshellip they could have cost lives.Meanwhile, in Wales, around , people may have been affected from testing sites in the Gwent and Cwm Taf Morgannwg areas.Immensa is part of Dante labs, whose chief executive is Mr Riposati.The Competition and Markets Authorityannounced in September it was investigating Dante Labs over concerns it may be treating customers unfairly.This included by not delivering PCR tests and or results on time or at all, failing to respond to complaints or provide proper customer service, refusing or delaying refunds when requested and using terms and conditions which may unfairly limit consumersrsquo rights.The CSA said Dante was ldquoa popular provider of PCR travel tests in the UK this summer.We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

He was a childhood friend of Salman Abedi and he is therefore singularly well placed to describe Abedirsquos journey towards radicalisation.He told the court the inquiry was also ldquovery interested in what was discussed when Mr Taghdi and Salman Abedi visited Abdallah in prison.And he said he was a witness of ldquoconsiderable signicance adding that Mr Taghdi was seen to visit the area where the Nissan Micra car was kept in the five weeks Salman Abedi was in Libya before ing to collect the bomb components from the car and carry out the attack.Mr Greaney said Mr Taghdi had been given ldquoevery chance to co-operate with the inquiry but failed to do so.Mr Taghdi, from Manchester, was arrested and questioned after the bombing but never charged with any offence and denies involvement or knowledge of the bomb plot by Salman and his brother Hashem Abedi.Mr Justice Jacobs granted the application for the order, backed by an arrest warrant should he not attend.He added: ldquoIt is beyond sensible argument that the respondenthas relevant evidence he can give to the inquiry.ldquoIt is justied in the circumstances of the present case so we will make the order which has been requested.Ismail Abedi, the bomb plottersrsquo older brother, and Abdalraouf Abdallah, are both due to give evidence next week, having initially declined to do so. Lawyers for Abdallah told the inquiry on Thursday he will not answer any questionshe is forced to attend.It is not yet knownany of them will attend the inquiry, which reconvenes on Monday.We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

This is assuming theyrsquove served over half a custodial sentence.Minister for justice and tackling illegal migration, Tom#Pursglove, said the the New Plan for Immigration provides the only long-term solution to fix our ldquobroken asylum system.He added: ldquoWe are taking another step forward in delivering on this commitment as our Nationality and Borders Bill continues its passage through Parliament. We are ensuring our system is fair for those who play by the rules, but firm on foreign criminals and those in our country illegally.ldquoWe have brought forward the most signicant reforms to the immigration and asylum system in decades. This is what the British people have consistently demanded. Strengthening the Bill through these amendments will ensure that we continue to deliver for them.The US also requests that foreign governments take appropriate steps when it comes to deportations and removals. Any lack of cooperation from the nation of origin would in many cases result in visa sanctions, which can y in severity.At the beginning of the month, the EU temporarily suspended the application of certain provisions in the visa code to nationals from The Gambia.The decision was taken due to the countryrsquos lack of cooperation on readmission of third-country nationals illegally staying in the EU.Some of the other amendments tabled by the Government include expanding the types of claims that can be dealt with in an accelerated appeal from detention, so that more cases can be resolved while the person is in detention rather than them being released into the community.#This includes foreign national offenders.Over the coming week, the Government is also expected to introducea robust approach to age assessment to better identy asylum-seeking children and stop adults accessing childrenrsquos services and legislation to establish an Electronic Travel AuthorisationScheme.Once introduced, carriers will have to check that all passengershave a digital authorisation or some other form of permission before they can travel to the UK.We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

But were it not for Murdo Dan’s job as a joiner and Chrissie Mary doing a few shts as a carer, their economic ‘situation’ would be very dficult indeed.To supplement their income, they have decided to use their meagre savings, borrow a not insignicant sum from their local bank, and apply to stick a couple of pods on the croft.Meanwhile, Nigel and Pippa saw a croft for sale in the Sunday Times Property Section for what they thought was a snip at £k and decided to use part of a trust fund to purchase it as a commercial investment.They thought that they could also capitalise on the local tourist ‘boom’ and have applied to turn the derelict croft house into a vegan cafe and craft shop and also to stick several pods on their newly acquired croft to offer a ‘holistic getaway’ for their jet-set pals.Do you, and I certainly don’t mean to pre-judge anyone who reads this paperthink that their ‘cases’ should be treated any dferently by the local planning authorities If the answer is “yes”, then think again.Too dficult a scenario to judge Try this one.Should an application to build a couple of pods on a croft, which is basically  per cent bog, in the middle of Ranish and has no view of anywhere except adjacent croft bog, be given any additional merit over a similar application in beautul Scaristavore or Ardroil where ‘breathtaking scenery’ will be the selling tagline Wrong again.As a member of the local planning board here in the Western Isles, I’m more than well aware of what my responsibilities are and it’s certainly not to pre-judge any applications based on my own preconceptions, or prejudicesof what should or shouldn’t be allowed.I’ve to stick to the guidelines and the training I’ve been given, understand what’s expected of meand to base my decision without emotion or bias. across the front pages of this paper and others, on social media and the television news, can influence any of my our decisions.The capitalist playground which crofting tenure has now become, and the seismic change in the scale of speculation on ‘marketable’ properties available, is in danger of knocking the fragile socio-economic balance of the west of Scotland even further off its already very shoogly axis.Crofts have now become the equivalent of crypto-currency the ‘Bitcoins’ which can provide financial security for those fortunate enough to be sitting on ‘gold’.What’s being done to stabilise and bring a dose of reality to a market which threatens to get completely out of control How can single iniduals be able to own several crofts with not an intention to ‘work’ or develop any single one of them I believe that a crofting historian once said that this form of land tenure has become ‘the single biggest impediment to sustainable development in Western Scotland and the Highlands and Islands’.That wasn’t yesterday.‘Things’ are already well out of control.But who should intervene I’m not the only one who keeps asking the question.Apparently ‘we’ should legislate to address.We need, it has been suggested, to become Jersey or Guernsey.That people shouldn’t be allowed to buy homes here unless they intend to be used as a primary residence .Second homes taxation needs to increase signicantly and the additional income be used to support tourism infrastructure.From the Butt to Bodmin there have been ious proposals as to how to legislate to prevent the worst effects of tourism from destroying fragile local economies.Have any worked, andso, could they be implemented here to make any dference Let me be very clear.Tourism is hugely important to our rural economy.More so since Brexit and Covid.But I’ll say this again, at the risk of boring you all: it needs to be carefully nurtured and sustainably developed.We cannot survivewe turn our villages into ‘ghost-towns’#yes, I know…..for the winter months.We need a balance, we need the ‘tools’ with which to legislate properly and we need those charged with ‘oversight’ to take better ownership.We need, and I’ve yet to see any evidence of this, these same people to begin to take this seriously.For our future generations.They are the ones who will be impacted mostwe don’t sit up and pay attention.Now."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/CATTLE-SALES-SEP-21-2-scaled.jpg","title":"remember your roots skye plan is urged to recognise","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThose were the comments of Roddy Murray, former Western Isles councillor and now the grazings clerk for Tarskavaig in Sleat, who this week voiced his concern that there was no mention of crofting at all in the ‘Skye and Raasay Future’ plan published in August with the full backing of all four local councillors.He told the Free Press: “There are  projects listed in the plan but not a single mention of crofting. Crofting is the basis for so many of the settlements on Skye outwith Portree, Broadford and Kyleakin and this should have been acknowledged.“There is quite a signicant impact from crofting on the economic and social well-being of Skye and Raasay. You only have to look at the , high quality calves sold for high prices last week in Portree to see that.”In terms of infrastructure improvements to support crofting, Mr Murray said the auction mart in Portree must be redeveloped to improve parking and animal welfare, and an abattoir facility must be provided so that livestock does not have to be driven to Dingwall.He added: “We are being told by the Scottish Crofting Federation that there is a huge demand for new crofts.#To meet that demand we either have to encourage landowners to make this happen or there has to be acquisition of an estate.“If we want to keep our young people in our communities we need to address the availability of crofts.”The Scottish Government are guilty of an “abject failure” when it comes to creating new crofts on publicly-owned land, Mr Murray added.Stung by the criticism, the council said they hoped to “discuss the plan further with organisations like the Crofting Commission” and would be keen to hear from any other interested parties.A spokeswoman said: “Skye and Raasay Future has been prepared with and by wider representatives of the community across the area.#It reflects people’s vision and priorities for the future, following feedback gathered through workshops and online consultations held throughout the year.“In workshop discussions, the important role that crofting plays in the identity and culture of Skye and Raasay communities has been clearly referenced..#Skye councillor John Finlayson said all stakeholders should be involved in “shaping, evaluating and changing” the plan’s priorities and he acknowledged the importance of crofting “in all its guises” across Skye and Raasay.He added: “Crofting is still a central part of le on Skye and while it is part of our history and culture it will also I hope continue to be a key part of our future and it is an important element of SARF.#As those who took part in the engagement to create the initial plan agreed, it is important that representatives from the crofting community are fully engaged in the continued development and implementation of the plan and I am confident this will happen.”"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1634132049562.jpg--covid_19___wed_13th_october_figures.jpg?1634132049000\n","title":"wwwballymenaguardiancouknews20211013newscovid 19 wed 13th october figures","story":"The NI Department of Health dashboard shows one further coronavirus related death and  new positive test results.

There was no improvement in Jake’s condition and the family spent  weeks going back and forth trying to find out just why their little boy was so ill. Eventually a visit to AE and blood tests led to Jake being referred to the RVH Children’s Hospital where they received the devastating diagnosis.“It has been a really dficult time for Jake,” said Karen “as he missed all of his P year, with the exception of a few days. “We are all very grateful for the fantastic suppport we’ve received from these bandsmen.”Among the marchers in September was local councillor, Rodney Quigley who said that the joint effort by the band members was to be praised.“I couldn’t make the entire walk because of prior engagements but I was proud to be there at the .am start in East Belfast with my local band colleagues. “Jake has relations in the ranks of Gertude Star Flute Band and it was their idea to do the walk to Ballymena.“I know their fund raising page has received a lot of donations from local bands and its great to see such unity on the marching band front,” he said. One of the walk’s organisers, Gertrude Star’s Andrew Larmour said the walk to Ballymena was one of the proudest days of his le.“Walking with my Gertrude brothers and making three new friends for le in GeorgeBarr , Lyle Murray and Rodney Quigley was an honour.“It is great to know that we have helped Jake and his mum Karen Oliver through this event.” Karen and Jake were there to welcome the intrepid walkers to Ballymena and she said she was overwhelmed by the generosity shown.She said: “Tonight Jake,Emelia and I met up with everyone walking at Queen Street and finished the walk with them! “We cannot thank you all enough! Jake was a little out of sorts due to increasing his Saturday chemotherapy dosage but he just stayed in my arms and took it all in this evening.“ I wish I could thank absolutely every one in person for joining the walk and giving donations you have all blown us away by your generosity.”Last week. Andrew posted: “Went down to Ballymena to hand over what was raised on our sponsored walk a few weeks ago.  “Can now say after counting final total tonight cheque and cash pound was raised in aid of wee Jake Oliver. “Again Id like thank everyone that donated to the sponsored walk also the ones that took part on the walk and Gertrude Star , Pride of the Maine and Ballykeel LSOU bands. “Your generosity didnt go unnoticed thank you.” "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_4157474.jpg--.jpg?1634222796000\n","title":"nipsa wants stormont department to take over management of council","story":"NIPSA has confirmed that it has written to the Minister for Communities asking that the Department takes over the managementat Mid and East Antrim Borough Council.

Together with its plans for Christmas  and beyond, the events provided delegates with an opportunity to meet Mary Waide who was elected Regional President for the North Region at the beginning of the pandemic.Following opening prayers and a welcome by Mary Waide, regional board members of SVP took to the stage to present ious aspects of the Society’s work to assembled guests representing their local SVP Conferences.Following a thought provoking spiritual reflection, board members presented the Society’s retail strategy for its  Vincent’s shops in Northern Ireland, a report of the outreach into prisons, details of how each Conference should report on its finances and new ways of adhering to policies and procedures for those being assisted by the charity and those providing the assistance.An interactive element encouraged guests to engage in a healthy discussion with board members before closing prayers. Mary Waide, Regional President of SVP North Region, said: “I am absolutely delighted with the success of this series of SVP Member Roadshows and the feedback from those who were able to attend.It was important for the SVP regional board to get out into our local communities having had such a long time apart from our members face to face. The focus of the roadshows were to primarily express our gratitude to our members for the sterling work they have been continuing to do on the ground to help those who have needed it most, during the most trying of times, and to share with them our SVP vision for the longer term. “The dedication of members of SVP has never been more important than it has been in the past  months. I know from experience how daunting it has been trying to help the vulnerable in our community without compromising or risking the health of those who are supporting those in need. As we move forward, it is my hope that our Conferences in County Antrim continue to go from strength to strength under the guidance of Frederic Ozanam who founded SVP almost  years ago.”SVP is an international charity and the largest voluntary charity in Ireland. SVP members in Northern Ireland work in all communities to support people whatever their background, who are experiencing poverty and social exclusion, promoting self-sufficiency and working for social justice. Every year SVP spends approximately pound million to help those experiencing poverty in Northern Ireland. Last year, SVP responded to tens of thousands of calls for assistance from members of the public.

It was quite the experience. I put a lot into it and there was highs and lows, but mostly highs.”Liam said he took the role of handling the public’s mail seriously, explaining: “Just generally, you have to have a certain amount of security about it and respect for other people.

I didn’t want a fuss, but there was sandwiches, cakes and buns,” he added.Delivering the post is something of a family trade for Liam, with his sons Paul and Richard based in the Omagh office and his grandson Kyle having been a postman for five years.“Richard mainly worked with me and Kyle gets his mail from the Omagh office in the morning and goes to Dromore to deliver it,” he said.One demand of the role Liam is more than happy to say goodbye to is the eye-watering early starts.“The last while, especially since Covid, I’ve been getting up for work at am and getting into work for am, driving from Donegal, then my sht would end at .pm,” he said. “The way we worked was a three-day week, doing double shts.”Now that he has extra free time on his hands, Liam is planning to get more involved with his local Gaelic football team.“I do a bit of training and I’m involved with the senior team a bit as well” he said. “I’ve a big interest in the county team as well. I’ve plenty to keep me going.”With more than four decades of memories to look back on at the Omagh office, Liam has plenty of memories, good and bad.Among the worst is Omagh’s darkest moment: the day the Real IRA blew up the town centre. The atrocity, on August , , killed  people, including a woman pregnant with twins, nine children and three generations of one family.It was the single biggest tragedy of the Troubles, and took place three months after the signing of the Good Friday Agreement.“I was working that Saturday. It never leaves you. [In] the aftermath... the photographers, the post office was overrun with Press doing stories. They used the roof of the post office because it was the highest point in the town for photographs.”He also recalled the official visit to Omagh by then United States president Bill Clinton and his we Hillary, who mourned with the victims of the attack a month later.“It was a big thing when he came, all the security that surrounded him,” Liam told the Belfast “Loads of things happened over the years.

Credit: INPHO Declan RoughanNiamh CampbellTwitterEmailOctober   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailMickey Harte has revealed fresh details of his departure as Tyrone boss, a role he held for almost two decades.“How it finished was not the way I would have chosen,” he writes in Devotion: a Memoir, which has been released nearly five weeks after Tyrone won their fourth All-Ireland under Harte’s successors, Brain Dooher and Feargal Logan.The Errigal Ciaran clubman quotes a diary extract from November , : “I knew the end was close. I just never imagined my time with Tyrone would finish on a winter’s night in the car above Garvaghey, waiting on a call.”Then team captain Mattie Donnelly was with him, and the week before, Harte talked with Donnelly to “check the mood among the players”.“If he told me the squad were set on change then I would have said goodnight,” Harte writes.Read MoreMickey Harte memoir: Ex-Tyrone boss reveals he views his le in two parts following daughter Michaela’s death“Had the season run as normal, there would have been no need for that conversation with Mattie.”Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up The -year-old tells of how “ years of unbroken service seemed a good time” to bow out, but he wanted a “genuine shot” at his final year, “an opportunity denied by the coronavirus”.Despite saying Tyrone chairman Michael Kerr supported him, the veteran manager believes that “some officers” on the county board were “set against” him for a long time.“Others were moving against me behind the scenes,” writes Harte. “Playing politics never interested me and I had no inclination to start now.”Unbeknownst to Harte, the committee was taking a vote which was split in his favour -, but he needed one more ballot to get his wish of one more year at the helm of the squad. “I headed off. Destinations never defined me it was always about the journey. But home was the only place for me then,” he says.Earlier in the memoir, he describes his position with Tyrone changing after their three All-Ireland wins.“My position came under increasing scrutiny because I was being judged on the standards that were set in the Noughties. But the football world had moved on. And our greatest ever team was breaking up,” he notes. “That period was probably more dficult for me than I realised at the time. These great players, warriors for Tyrone, were reaching the end and I had to make a lot of hard calls. I made mistakes.”“Of course, I still want Tyrone to succeed I always will,” adds Harte, who now has a new position managing the Louth inter-county team. “I am old enough and wise enough to know that bitterness serves you no good.

Anzorov claimed responsibility in a text accompanied by a photograph of the victim found on his phone.Sixteen people have since been charged in the case, most of them for “complicity in a terrorist murder” or “criminal association”.They include five students of Mr Paty’s school, all minors, accused of having helped the killer in exchange for promises of payments of - euros.The investigation established that the attacker knew the name of the teacher and the address of his school but he did not have the means to identy him.The suspects also include a student’s father who posted videos on social media that called for mobilisation against the teacher.

She co-founded successful online learning company Learning Pool in Derry in . Today, she works extensively with start-ups and scaling tech companies. She is one of the co-founders of cross-border social enterprise and female founder community AwakenHub and she is part of the EU’s flagship EIC Accelerator innovation team. googletag.cmd.push -------------------------------------------- A few weeks ago Digital DNA’s Simon Bailie asked me to write a short piece about Derry for DDNA’s Top Tech Companies in NIreport. Simon asked me to cover the Derry tech scene – how it’s altered in the almost  years I’ve been working in the city and perhaps more importantly, what the missing ingredients are that would make the Maiden City’s tech scene really sing. I enjoyed writing it and was surprised to find that no-one  has written about this. Here’s what I had to say in full. How much has the Derry tech scene changed  I began working in Derry in . I moved from Belfast where I’d been global CFO in one of QUB’s semiconductor IP spinouts.I’d spent a good bit of my time in the early noughties in Silicon Valley and Derry in  couldn’t have been further from San Jose. The only similarity was that the streets were completely deserted by .pm. When I told my friends in Belfast that I was taking a job in Derry they all tried to talk me out of it. I remember trying to recruit a team in  and talent was very thin on the ground. Most of the local workforce were lers in one of the FDIs or they commuted to tech jobs in either Belfast or Letterkenny.     The local tech scene back then was dominated by the prominent FDIs Seagate  Allstate , big fish Singularityand a never-ending raft of call centres and it was populated by revered avuncular middle-aged men like Bro McFerran and Dr Alan McClure. Anyone calling the HP or Expedia customer help lines back in the day would’ve been greeted by a Derry accent, way before it was trendy. We started Learning Pool in London in  and quickly moved the company to Derry because it was bootstrap-affordable and because of the ready talent graduating from Magee. We couldn’t afford to hire an experienced team so we recruited new graduates with the right attitude and trained them. We didn’t have an office so we took a few desks in theshockingly haphazard co-working space at the university. Even though the space was supposed to be reserved for new startups, a few companies had been renting in there forever so we ended up with desks dotted here and there in random parts of the floor. No-one in our team could sit together and the co-working space manager constantly shushed us whenever we took phone calls and harped on forever about the washing-up. We had a desktop PC in the corner with a paper notice sellotaped to the top of it which read DO NOT SWITCH OFF  Today there’s a stable of promising scaling tech companies choosing to base themselves in Derry. Established companies likeElemental Software  Newer entrants like medtech company Respiratory Analytics, cyber security companyITUSand caretech challenger startupInCharge. Many companies keep one foot in Derry and the other in Donegal, thus preserving their EU status for access to customers and funding. Catalyst Incopened its doors in  on the historic Fort George site just outside the city and has been a great formal addition to the fabric of the local ecosystem. Other active startup supports likeStartacusand new island of Ireland female founder community AwakenHubare anchored in Derry. Today, the local tech scene is younger, more female, less formal, more global, well educated and informed and definitely ambitious. A lot of newer founders have lived away from Ireland for a while but are electing tohome and settle down, build a business. Catalyst’s Co-Founders programme has uncovered some interesting nascent companies. Some of those new graduates that I recruited back in  or  have gone on to found their own startups. That’s how ecosystems work. The FDIs are still present but they’re less dominant today. They don’t have a lot of employee churn and just tick along in the background, largely behind closed doors. They bring employment to an area of Northern Ireland that badly needs it and they sponsor the odd event and programme. Many of the call centres seem to have been bought over and have disappeared. Innovation and all the interesting stuff happens in the smaller, agile companies around the edges and this is what we need more of. As well as the FDIs we now have the presence of indigenous scaleups like Kainosand FinTru. It would be great to see a few more like these moving in but high quality office space is an issue. Maybe not so important in the future we’re facing post-COVID. The traditional talent pool has extended from the Bann well into Donegal and in Derry I’ve worked beside people who’ve commuted daily from as far afield as Ballycastle and Creeslough. Missing Ingredients If it was Christmas morning and I could have three wishes to improve the tech sector ecosystem in the North West this is what I would wish for: - An ambitious cross-border university named after the late John Hume with campuses in both Derry and Donegaland strong links into the powerful North West diaspora that stretches from Philadelphia to London to Singapore. I’m always impressed by the vibrant startup scene that exists in Letterkenny as a result of the numerous overseas students and researchers who come to LYIT for academic reasons and end up staying. This new university to be fastened at the hip to a well funded and well resourced startup, student and alumni accelerator regime like Oxford University has withOxford Foundrywhich in turn connects firmly into sources of venture finance, a bit likeEDEMin the marina in Valencia - A Derry-Letterkenny- Sligo-Galway Economic Corridor along the Wild Atlantic Way to mirror the Belfast-Dublin corridor that was formally announced in the east of the island last month. This to connect the opportunities that will naturally flow from the new Magee Medical School to the vibrant medtech cluster of companies and investors in Galway and to link in with the newly reinvigorated Western Development Commissionand the string of Atlantic hubs the Irish State has invested in over recent years. I am encouraged by news of a new cross-border scaling hub led by Catalyst Inc  LYIT which will be built in the image of thePortershedGalway model - A focus placed on determining how Derry and indeed all of Northern Ireland can tangibly and quickly benefit from being so close to an EU border in the post-Brexit world. Can Derry compete with Belfast  This was a provocative question posed by Simon in his brief to me. In my view, this is not the right question and shouldn’t be part of anyone’s ambition. Any venture starting out in the new world should instead think about opportunities presented as a result of global changes that the past  months have fast tracked. It’s now genuinely possible to be a global company from Day  and utilise talent from any part of the globe. Barriers no longer exist. Cities and regions need to start thinking this way too. To ask Derry to compete only with Belfast would not be setting a big enough challenge. So, in conclusion,you’re looking for a friendly and affordable university city to start your tech business, where it’s possible to be in both the UK and the EU, an hour from London by air, where   of the population is aged - and is well educated, where government startup funding is readily available, close to some of Europe’s finest beaches, with top class local state schools and a long history and culture … then maybe you should take a look at Derry. And my final call to action, on  April  Jayne Brady started in a brand new post at Belfast City Council as Belfast’s Digital Innovation Commissioner. An engineer and former Venture Capital Partner, in the  months since Jayne started she’s made a massive dference and she represents Belfast at the digital and innovation negotiating tables in both Westminster and Dublin. In truth, although she works for Belfast City Council she does her very best to represent all of Northern Ireland. Isn’t it time we appointed a Digital Innovation Commissioner to do the same and really own this agenda for the NW region of Ireland and its citizens, present and future ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId   reported missing  times - court told\" title\"Derry girlsreported missing  times - court told\" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"Derry NewsDerry girlreported missing  times - court told overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsCity of Derry airport welcomes a new route overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Paul Lavilleand James Donaghy, MD of Donaghy Bros, at the awards.Local NewsCounty Derry electrical retailer collects top award in London overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsCounty Derry man disqualied after witnesses followed him home overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsCounty Derry teenager bit officer on the leg and spat at police overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The PSNI have urged the public in Derry to be vigilant towards scammersLocal NewsPolice warn Derry smartphone users of scammers overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Thursday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Friday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Sir Gerry Robinson became well-known as a television presenter fronting BBC programmes including Troubleshooter and Can Gerry Robinson Fix the NHSNational NewsDeath announced of Sir Gerry Robinson overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Fancy Dress night out with Moyola FC, Castledawson \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Fancy Dress night out with Moyola FC, Castledawson  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Memory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Council voted earlier this year to hand control of Portstewart Town Hall back to its original owners - the Montagu Estate - after receiving Notice to Quit in . googletag.cmd.push Portstewart Community Associationhad called on the Department for Communities to intervene in the handover after a Public Records Office for Northern Irelanddocument appeared to cast doubt on the halls ownership arrangements. Under Section  of the Local Government Act, district councils must seek Ministerial approval for any disposal of land that is not at the best price or for the best rent. Department for Communities guidance says Section  also forms the basis for district councils to provide justication for a project and that the disposal is for the well-being of the district. However, a spokesperson for the Council said it does not consider Section  relevant on this occasion. Throughout Council’s long consideration of this matter legal advice confirmed that Council holds no title deeds for the building. The Montague Estate holds title, they said. Council’s Legal Team advised Council that the land in question is not registered in the Land Registry. Registry of Deeds searcheswere carried outfrom the s to present andhave no entries relating to the purchase of the Town Hall with a freehold title from the Montague Estate, . Council is aware of the PRONI document, but legal advice obtained and presented to Council advised that PRONI records are not proof of title and are only useful at providing general information.     It is possible any purchase price mentionedmay relate to a premium under a long lease. PRONI records also show Montague involvement with the Town Hall into the s. Council holds no title to the land and therefore Council does not consider Section  relevant as no transfer of land has taken place. The possibility of a community asset transfer to the people of Portstewart can only proceed with the agreement of the legal owner of the building, the Montague Estate. The community is free to engage with the Montague Estate regarding this matter. Last week, the Montagu Estate said they were disappointed years of neglect had resulted in the closure of the Town Hall. It is disappointing to us that the Town Hall has been allowed to fall into disrepair over so many years of neglect, causing the loss of this amenity to the townspeople of Portstewart that is sincerely felt by all, they said in a statement released by their solicitor. Local councillor Angela Mulholland confirmed the community had made contact with the Estate. Wehavereachedouttothe Montaguestatetotrytofind awaytoreachapositive resolution, she said. Wewanttorally thecommunitytoactively engageinrestoringourtown hallandtheotherareasthat have been left neglected for so long. The Department for Communities said they have sought assurances from the Council. he Department has sought assurances from the Council, which have indicated that Section  does not apply in the case of Portstewart Town Hall, said a spokesperson.  Montagu Estate disappointed with years of neglect at Co Derry town hall  The Montagu Estate have released a statement on the halls handover.    Council accused of failing to do due diligence over town hall handover  A local community association has called on the Department for Communities to intervene.    County Derry community group ‘deeply disappointed’ by town hall handover  The group also expressed frustration that meetings were held in private.

Rory Conway, of Roshure Road, Magherafelt, contested a charge of driving with excess alcohol on his breath at Magherafelt Magistrates Court last week. The court heard from a police constable who had attended a call from two female witnesses who had followed the defendant home along the Draperstown Road and Roshure Road on September  . googletag.cmd.push The constable told the court he spoke to the witnesses outside the property who said they had seen the defendant at a petrol station in Draperstown and observing he was driving all over the road, had followed him and called the police. After speaking with the witnesses, the constable located a car in the driveway of the house on Roshure Road, and noted the bonnet was still warm. Conways partner answered the door, and when askedthe owner of the vehicle was home, the defendant, who had been in bed, appeared downstairs. The constable noted a smell of intoxicating liquor from Conway and conducted a preliminary breath test, where a reading of mg was recorded. The defendant was then arrested and taken to custody and on leaving after police interview, said: “Boys, it would have been worseyoud got me in the car.” Defence for Conway argued that as the comment had not been taken down in the constables notebook and read and signed by the defendant, it was inadmissible in court. They also said there was no evidence of the defendant driving the car, as both his partner and father had access to it.     The constable said he was not aware of anyone  inside the property at the time, and that the witnesses had described a male suspect. Statements given by the witnesses were then partially read out in court by Judge Mullan. One witness said she had observed Conway getting out of the car and urinating against the garage, before she asked him: “What do you think youre doing ” The statement said the defendant replied “What ” and moved towards the car, prompting the witness to ask: “Where are you going  You nearly caused an accident there.” Conway replied “Im sorry, Im going to my bed,” before the witness went round the back of the house and observed him at the side window with no shirt on, looking out at them. Counsel for the defence said the details in the statement meant that the witnesses should have been able to identy the defendant as part of the Viper procedure, which they were unable to do. Summing up, they told the court the defendant had not been detected driving the vehicle, that his unsolicited comment had been inadmissible and that he had not been identied by witnesses. The prosecution submitted that Conway was the owner of the vehicle and that there were two witnesses to his driving who were so concerned they had followed him home. Police had found the bonnet of the car to be warm, had spoken to the defendant and noted there didnt appear to be anyone  in the house. It was also noted Conway did not deny the charge at interview. Judge Mullan found the defendant guilty of driving with excess alcohol on his breath, and said the failure of the defence to call Conway to give evidence was a factor in the decision. She disqualied the defendant from driving for a period of  months, and issued a fine of pound, alongside an offenders levy of pound.

With the next Assembly election only months away, the campaign rhetoric has already started – and turned sour – with unionists openly mooting exploiting a loophole that could deny Sinn Feacutein or the SDLP the First Minister role should either be the largest party in Stormont. googletag.cmd.push Cllr Harkin of People Before Profit, while angered by the political manoeuvring is not entirely surprised that there are those seeking to pushing the boundaries saying “democracy has always been a sham” at Stormont. He said: “The threat by the DUP, UUP and TUV to refuse a First Minister they dont agree with harks back to the worst of the sectarian unionist veto. “While its no surprise, it does expose the hypocrisy of parties with pretensions to upholding democracy. “This isnt just an insult to nationalists, it is an insult to everyone who believes in democracy. There is an ever increasing number of people who identy as neither unionist or nationalist. “We share the sense of outrage many people feel. The veto on democracy must go. “The Civil Rights movement arose as a people power challenge to a sectarian Stormont regime for basic democratic rights. “Every democratic demand for equality was resisted, often violently, by those prepared to determined to defend the status quo. “The new Stormont purports to be a democratic institution, however, it is anything but. State sectarianism is still embedded in the new Stormont political carve-up.     “In Stormont, establishment unionism and nationalism, dismissed workers rights, womens rights, LGBTQ rights, respect for the Irish language and racial equality for decades.“ “Political establishment parties have shted on some of these demands, certainly not all and not far enough, because of relentless people power campaigning. “But the kneejerk anti-democratic instincts of all the governing parties isnt far from the surface. “The shocking undemocratic treatment of the Black Lives Matter protests was greenlighted and subsequently rubber-stamped by all five of the Executive parties. “Democratic access to the right to choose  None of the five Executive parties are making a fuss about the continued denial of abortion services. “The whitewashed investigation of the ash for cash RHI scandal is another example of how the new Stormont regime has been prepared to trample on democracy. “The failure of the Stormont Executive to implement an anti-poverty strategy tramples on human rights and basic democracy. “The same applies to the refusal of the Executive to undo decades of undemocratic neglect of Derry and the North West thats evident in the failure to expand Magee, upgrade infrastructure or build adequate housing. “In the old and new Stormont, democracy has always been a sham. “Stormont has proved incapable of meeting the basic needs of the vast majority of people. Whether its an insulting pay offer for health heroes, doing nothing as people are pushed over a poverty clf edge or ensuring womens rights. “As with the Civil Rights movement of the s, people power will be the key to extending democracy and creating a more equal society.” ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId   reported missing  times - court told\" title\"Derry girlsreported missing  times - court told\" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"Derry NewsDerry girlreported missing  times - court told overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsCity of Derry airport welcomes a new route overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Paul Lavilleand James Donaghy, MD of Donaghy Bros, at the awards.Local NewsCounty Derry electrical retailer collects top award in London overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsCounty Derry man disqualied after witnesses followed him home overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsCounty Derry teenager bit officer on the leg and spat at police overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The PSNI have urged the public in Derry to be vigilant towards scammersLocal NewsPolice warn Derry smartphone users of scammers overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Thursday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Friday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Sir Gerry Robinson became well-known as a television presenter fronting BBC programmes including Troubleshooter and Can Gerry Robinson Fix the NHSNational NewsDeath announced of Sir Gerry Robinson overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Fancy Dress night out with Moyola FC, Castledawson \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Fancy Dress night out with Moyola FC, Castledawson  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Memory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

The Sinn Feacutein Councillor was commenting after she and Cllr Conor Heaney met with the Irish Government’s Shared Island Unit. The Shared Island Unit is an initiative that sets out the Irish government’s commitment to working with all communities and traditions on the island to build consensus around a shared future, underpinned by the Good Friday Agreement. googletag.cmd.push One of its facets is to further develop an all-island economy that includes investing in the North West and border regions. Cllr. Duffy said: “We had a very positive and constructive discussion with the Shared Island Unit which is based in the Taoiseachs Office and has a budget of pound million so it can certainly help progress the discussion that is already well underway across the island regarding Irish reunication. “We briefed them on the key issues facing the north west including Magee expansion, increasing the Irish Government’s contribution to the A, funding for a Derry to Dublin air link as a gateway to the US and the rest of the world and increasing the financial contribution to the existing City Deal to develop a North West Inclusive Growth Fund. “We also updated them on the Working Group on Irish Unity that Sinn Feacutein established within Derry City and Strabane District Council and agreed to share some of the conclusions from the Working Group as it progresses. “What is emerging from that group already is that there is huge potential for Derry and the North West to thrive economically and socially in a reunied Ireland, given that this area perhaps more than most has been stled by the imposition and impact of partition.”    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId   reported missing  times -

Ryanair have confirmed they will operate three weekly flights between Derry and Manchester, England, from Winter . The airline have launched a seat sale to celebrate the announcement of the new route, and their Director of Commercial, Jason McGuinness, said they remain committed to growing their passenger network. googletag.cmd.push Ryanair remains committed to re-building Europe’s aviation and tourism industry by restoring connectivity and growing its network of passengers to over  million by , he said. As Ryanair takes delivery of  additional Boeing - ‘Gamechanger’ aircraft this winter, we are delighted to add this new route from Derry to Manchester. Local MLA for Foyle, Sinead McLaughlin, welcomed news of the new service. This route has long been an ambition of the airport and I congratulate the airports leadership, and Derry City and Strabane District Council as the owners, for getting this over the line, she said. Connections with Manchester are really important for our local economy, as well as being a key destination for study and social reasons. Manchester is a vibrant and dynamic city, which is becoming increasingly signicant within Britain as an economic hub. Creating business links between the two cities could be extremely beneficial for Derry. The City of Derry Airport provides important economic benefits for Derry, as well as the wider region on both sides of the border. It is essential that the Executive and the British and Irish governments provide the ongoing financial support it needs, not just to survive but to expand.

The SDLP leader said that the proposals presented by the Commission this week demonstrate generous flexibility and has called on the British Government to show the same willingness to reach an accommodation. Following the call, Colum Eastwood called on DUP Leader Jeffrey Donaldson to withdraw his threat to collapse the devolved institutions in light of the signicant movement made by EU leaders. googletag.cmd.push Colum Eastwood MP said: “We have had further useful dialogue with Maroš Šefčovič this afternoon. The SDLP is very pleased with the flexibility that the European Commission has shown and the proposals that are now on the table. It is time that we see a similar willingness to reach an honourable accommodation from the British Government. “There will now be a period of intense negotiation. That should be a constructive and relentlessly positive engagement aimed at securing a resolution. I hope that the briefing and counter briefing that has characterised previous talks, particularly in the British Press, will not come to define this negotiation. “In the spirit of seeking accommodation, Jeffrey Donaldson should now withdraw his threat to collapse devolved government in Northern Ireland. Unionism has achieved its goals, there is no further price to be extracted. Continuing to make undeliverable demands around the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice is a hiding to nothing.”     ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId   reported missing  times - court told\" title\"Derry girlsreported missing  times - court told\" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"Derry NewsDerry girlreported missing  times - court told overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsCity of Derry airport welcomes a new route overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Paul Lavilleand James Donaghy, MD of Donaghy Bros, at the awards.Local NewsCounty Derry electrical retailer collects top award in London overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsCounty Derry man disqualied after witnesses followed him home overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsCounty Derry teenager bit officer on the leg and spat at police overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The PSNI have urged the public in Derry to be vigilant towards scammersLocal NewsPolice warn Derry smartphone users of scammers overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Thursday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Friday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Sir Gerry Robinson became well-known as a television presenter fronting BBC programmes including Troubleshooter and Can Gerry Robinson Fix the NHSNational NewsDeath announced of Sir Gerry Robinson overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Fancy Dress night out with Moyola FC, Castledawson \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Fancy Dress night out with Moyola FC, Castledawson  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Memory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

Doherty, was a French teacher at Oakgrove College, before a combination of ill-health and redundancy left him twiddling his thumbs at home. Being an aficionado of words, he decided to put those thumbs – and fingers – to artistic use and create the spoonerism series. googletag.cmd.push Spoonerisms derive from error in speech in which corresponding letters are switched between two words in a phrase. The label takes its name from Oxford Don and cleric, William Archibald Spooner who would regularly do this. Sean, who is of the same family that own the citys famous Doherty Meats, said: “I would always do crosswords in the newspapers and I do love words. Sometimes I would spoonerise stuff in my head.  Spooner tries his luck at running a coffee shop. Pic: Sean Doherty “I started noting them down andthey amused me, I would then create wee scenarios for them. “To be honest, I couldnt draw to save myself and I am aware that the cartoons are less than professional. “I was running around trying to get quotes from people to have my cartoons done professionally but the cheapest quote I got was fty pounds a frame. “The wolves are not at the door, but I am on benefits at the minute. The house is paid for and my we is still working, but I still have two children at university so I cant be paying out that much for a professional cartoonist.     “I have a couple of hundred of drawings already created. Even to produce a set of ten would set me back five hundred quid. “I did a google search and came across a teach-yourself-how-to-do-cartoons programme. I went on there and used that to create my spoonerism characters. “The original Spooner was a nineteenth century cleric so naturally, I made one of my main protagonists a cleric as well – a bit like the Father Brown character on TV. “The we character is the one who interprets the spoonerisms, the mistakes with a for flips sake what are you at  and so on. “The cartoons Ive done are very rudimentary but I think as Ive been bouncing along, I got slightly better at it.” As mentioned earlier, Doherty has suffered with ill-health over the last few years with two bouts of Non-Hodgkins Lymphona leading him to take a redundancy offer from Oakfield College and take a break from teaching. He added: “I have had a colourful health history. I have had a number of things over the last ten years. “Im a teacher by trade having taught French at Oakgrove College. I dont do that anymore having had to take my redundancy. “I had my large bowel removed and a stoma bag installed. I recovered from that and went back to work. A couple of years after that, I had massive seizures and was diagnosed with osteoporosis. I broke a dozen bones – including my hip and backbone. “I was in hospital for a month after that. I recovered, went back to work and then I was diagnosed with Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma cancer. That was around three or four years ago. “I was successfully treated for it. I was within a few days of being officially declared as being two years clear when I took ill again and found the Non-Hodgkins had ed. “When you get cancer once, your chances of survival are good. When you get it a second time, it can be bleak. “I was lucky enough to have a doctor who was fantastic. He got me onto a thing called Car T Cell Treatment in London. “Its a radical, new treatment, What happens there is they take a sample of your bone marrow and have it sent away to a facility the Netherlands, They convert the bone marrow to fight the cancer internally. “Unfortunately it makes you sick as a pig as you have no immune system. I was in hospital for quite a long time in London. But it was successful – so far, so good, touch wood. “I got sent back to Derry literally just before the pandemic. Im still classied as being clinically extremely vulnerable. “In the middle of all that, I was offered a redundancy from teaching. Being extremely clinically vulnerable and going into eight or nine classrooms a day with dferent sets of pupils is not recommended. “My plan A had been to work as a substitute teacher – and I would have got plenty of work being a language teacher. “But the doctor in London said to leave it until next April and then we could revisit that. For now, I was told that I was not to work as a teacher.”  Spooners Quadrophenia party takes a wrong turn. Pic: Sean Doherty While Doherty awaits for the doctors to give him the green light to resume his teaching career, the Spooner cartoons keep him busy and hopefully someone somewhere might offer him the chance to showcase his material to a wider audience. He said: “I do not claim to be some sort of great artist, but what I have managed to start doing is to give them a character, give them a continued presence and to visually represent a joke. “You might not go oh that is a wonderful cartoon there, but you might see the joke. If youre a wordy sort of a person, you will get the joke. “Of course some might not get the joke and find it funny but I do think there is a niche for spoonerism cartoons.”ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId   reported missing  times - court told\" title\"Derry girlsreported missing  times - court told\" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"Derry NewsDerry girlreported missing  times - court told overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsCity of Derry airport welcomes a new route overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Paul Lavilleand James Donaghy, MD of Donaghy Bros, at the awards.Local NewsCounty Derry electrical retailer collects top award in London overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsCounty Derry man disqualied after witnesses followed him home overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsCounty Derry teenager bit officer on the leg and spat at police overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The PSNI have urged the public in Derry to be vigilant towards scammersLocal NewsPolice warn Derry smartphone users of scammers overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Thursday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Friday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Sir Gerry Robinson became well-known as a television presenter fronting BBC programmes including Troubleshooter and Can Gerry Robinson Fix the NHSNational NewsDeath announced of Sir Gerry Robinson overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Fancy Dress night out with Moyola FC, Castledawson \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Fancy Dress night out with Moyola FC, Castledawson  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Memory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

The scheme is a recycling initiative which he had championed during his time as Environment Minister and has worked to progress in recent years. In response to an Assembly Question tabled by Mr Durkan, the Minister of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs , Edwin Poots reaffirmed his commitment to introduce the scheme, following the department’s joint consultation with DAERA and the Welsh Government. googletag.cmd.push The Foyle MLA said: “I’m pleased that work is continuing to progress a depositscheme for Northern Ireland. “This is a scheme which began work on during my time as Environment Minister, having seen their benefits in other countries. “Unfortunately, at that time my attempts were met with some resistance, both politically and commercially. “In February , the Executive supported my calls for the introduction of a depositscheme and committed to the North’s participation in a proposed UK-wide rollout. I welcome that the consultation process has been completed and welcome Minister Poots commitment to delivering this scheme and move towards a circular economy. “While awareness in recent years has improved where recycling is concerned, we are still not at the level we need to be. “A cash incentive under a Deposit Return Scheme, in my opinion, is the best way forward and will encourage an uptake in recycling. “Our throw-away culture is completely unsustainable and our planet is bearing the brunt of it. “In recent years, we have witnessed a growing realisation that action must be taken by governments, businesses and iniduals to address the damage being done to our environment.     “I would like to see this scheme expanded to include cans and plastic bottles, building on the success of the carrier bag levy, to tackle the scourge of single use plastic on our communities. “I hope the Minister will revisit an all-island approach for this initiative but for now it is crucial that we push forward on implementing this environmentally transformative scheme without further delay. “ ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId   reported missing  times -

The scheme is a recycling initiative which he had championed during his time as Environment Minister and has worked to progress in recent years. In response to an Assembly Question tabled by Mr Durkan, the Minister of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs , Edwin Poots reaffirmed his commitment to introduce the scheme, following the department’s joint consultation with DAERA and the Welsh Government. googletag.cmd.push The Foyle MLA said: “I’m pleased that work is continuing to progress a depositscheme for Northern Ireland. “This is a scheme which began work on during my time as Environment Minister, having seen their benefits in other countries. “Unfortunately, at that time my attempts were met with some resistance, both politically and commercially. “In February , the Executive supported my calls for the introduction of a depositscheme and committed to the North’s participation in a proposed UK-wide rollout. I welcome that the consultation process has been completed and welcome Minister Poots commitment to delivering this scheme and move towards a circular economy. “While awareness in recent years has improved where recycling is concerned, we are still not at the level we need to be. “A cash incentive under a Deposit Return Scheme, in my opinion, is the best way forward and will encourage an uptake in recycling. “Our throw-away culture is completely unsustainable and our planet is bearing the brunt of it. “In recent years, we have witnessed a growing realisation that action must be taken by governments, businesses and iniduals to address the damage being done to our environment.     “I would like to see this scheme expanded to include cans and plastic bottles, building on the success of the carrier bag levy, to tackle the scourge of single use plastic on our communities. “I hope the Minister will revisit an all-island approach for this initiative but for now it is crucial that we push forward on implementing this environmentally transformative scheme without further delay. “ ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId   reported missing  times -

Available exclusively in Attitude Black paintwork, the new Sport Black Edition brings a distinctive sporty look to Toyota’s fth-generation RAV, and is available in front-wheel-driveguise only.  googletag.cmd.push   However, for buyers looking for the added security of an all-wheel-drivedrivetrain in their new RAV, there is the option of AWD in Sol, Sport and Platinum iants, while the entry-level Luna model is FWD only.Petrol Electric PowertrainLike every iant in the RAV range, the Sport Black Edition is powered by a .-litre four-cylinder petrol-electric hybrid powertrain, which produces bhp and Nm of torque and enables the five-seat family SUV to sprint from -km h in just over  seconds. Standard across the entire RAV range is a suite of safety features which offer maximum protection for all occupants, while providing the RAV driver with the latest technology in driver assistance systems.     Collectively called Toyota Safety Sense  , features include Pre-Collision Assistance , Speed Assistance , Lane Keepingand Automatic High Beam Assist.Gracious Exterior, Spacious InteriorThe exterior design of the new RAV is more appealing and less anonymous that its predecessor, and this is gained by way of boxy wheel arches, a squared-off nose with a large grille, and angular edges and creases in the bodywork. I feel that Toyota has done a great job of making the new RAV look and feel more ‘premium’ than ever, while also offering more interior space than any of its predecessors.         Cabin quality is exceptional, with sturdy and durable materials used throughout, while overall passenger space is generous in every respect. This has been made possible by placing the front and rear axles mm further apart than before, and even tall adults will be able to sit in the rear seats comfortably, with plenty of legroom and headroom on offer.The RAV’s battery is located under the floor, but its boxy dimensions help to hide it well, with a slightly higher boot floor the only clue to what lies beneath.Compared to its predecessor, the RAV’s boot capacity has grown to -litres , with a massive ,-litres available when the rear seats are folded down.The RAV was awarded a full five stars by Euro NCAP in  and that was thanks in part to an upgrade to the second-generation of Toyota Safety Sense for the latest model.Test CarMy test car was a RAV Sport Black Edition which drew lots of admiring glances due to its terric road presence and distinctive design details.An impressive array of standard equipment includes TEX leather black upholstery with heated front seats, powered driver seat, auto-dimming interior mirror, front and rear parking sensors, rear view camera, auto lights and wipers, LED front light guide with daytime running lights, LED projector headlights, electrically operated boot door, ” Toyota Touch multimedia system, dual zone climate control, rear privacy glass, satellite navigation, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, black headliner cloth, paddle sht, light blue ambient lighting, and illuminated entry along with many more comfort, convenience, safety and infotainment features.As is the case across all models in the RAV line-up, fuel consumption as low as .l km is achievable on a WLTP combined driving cycle, while Co emissions of between  and g kmensures low annual road tax in addition to low overall running costs.Toyota’s advanced hybrid technology ensures that the RAV’s petrol engine and electric motor combine seamlessly to deliver extra performance and outstanding fuel efficiency, while remaining ultra-smooth and extremely quiet when driving in electric mode.Toyota claim that up to % of the time you drive a Toyota Hybrid, you are in electric mode, with the added advantage that you never have to plug the car in to charge the battery.Toyota’s self-charging hybrid harvests the energy normally lost from deceleration and braking into a small battery. This unit doesn’t have enough capacity to propel the RAV alone for any considerable distance, but it does offer the convenience of being able to charge itself without any input from the driver.The RAV sits on Toyota’s New Global Architecture, which is also used in the Toyota Prius, C-HR and Corolla models. It brings big benefits in ride and handling, with more sophisticated suspension than the old model, so the RAV is capable of turning into corners with a surprising amount of poise and precision, with plenty of grip while resisting dramatic levels of body lean.The RAV’s CVTtransmission is smooth and slick in its operation, while a well-insulated cabin ensures that on-road refinement is top class. When travelling through towns and cities at low speed, the RAV’s electric motor is barely audible, with the engine shutting off entirely when stationary in traffic.

Hyundai’s newest offering is an appealing small SUV, which slots into position between the new i and new Kona in terms of its exterior dimensions.Hyundai claim that the Bayon is a ‘small on the outside, big on the inside’ urban crossover SUV that is designed to make a lasting impression. Boasting best-in-class safety and connectivity features, the Bayon comes with lots of smart technology as standard.  googletag.cmd.push   Eye-Catching ProportionsWith its sharp lines and eye-catching proportions, the new Bayon really stands out from the crowd. Sleek and stylish, it elegantly combines Hyundai’s award-winning SUV heritage with a visually stunning interpretation of Hyundai’s new Sensuous Sportiness design language — defined by the harmony between proportion, architecture, styling and technology.The arrow-shaped headlamps and wide grille harmonise with the sleek air intake band and narrow LED daytime running-lights on top, to give the front a purposeful, unique look. A dynamic shoulder line provides visual drama to the Bayon’s sporty wedge-shaped profile while, at the rear, arrow-shaped LED rear lights are connected by a red accent line. Positioned far out to the sides, the rear lights enhance the visual impression of width.     The new Bayon is shorter, narrower and lower than its Kona sibling, but stands a fraction taller than the i supermini upon which it is based. While the Kona is offered with an all-electric version, the new Bayon is powered solely by a .-litre MPIfour-cylinder petrol engine across all iants.The ingenious MPI system injects fuel at each cylinder, allowing much greater control over how much fuel the engine burns, leading to impressive fuel efficiency.Well-Appointed Trim LevelsThe new Bayon is available in a choice of three trim levels, namely Comfort Plus, Executive and Executive with a two-tone roof. Standard features from entry level include a rear spoiler, roof rails, sports-style driver and passenger front seats, driver seat height adjuster, height and reach adjustable leather-wrapped steering wheel, air-conditioning, auto light control , temporary spare wheel, cargo net, multi- steering wheel controls, central door locking, Bluetooth, DAB radio, cruise control, and a tyre pressure monitoring system, along with a host of safety features for peace-of-mind motoring.         Upgrade to the Executive trimand additional standard features include ” alloy wheels, chrome belt line finisher, body coloured bumpers, shark-fin ariel, aluminium foot pedals, heated front seats, heated steering wheel, automatic air-conditioning, automatic window defogging , power-folding electric mirrors, rear privacy glass, auto wipers, remote central locking, voice recognition, Android Auto  Apple CarPlay, ” audio display, .” LCD supervision cluster, USB charger, wireless phone charger, rear parking sensors, and a rear view camera with dynamic guidelines, along with additional safety tech.Test CarMy test car was a new Bayon Executive .litre MPI, which was finished in elegant Aurora Gray Pearl paintwork that compliments its strong SUV design.Producing PSand Nm of torque, the Bayon can reach km h in .-seconds, while ing up to .mpgon a WLTP combined driving cycle.A low Co emission figure of g km translates to annual road tax of just €.On the road is where the new Bayon really excels, with a terric mix of comfort, control, poise and precision on offer. Road imperfections are dealt with swtly, while noises and knocks from the suspension are well isolated from the cabin.For a relatively small car, the Bayon’s motorway refinement and stability are impressive, while the car corners keenly on twisty roads. A precise steering response ensures that the Bayon is a delight to drive around town, while the standard rear parking sensors and rear view camera in my test car made parking a doddle too.The family-friendly cabin space in the new Bayon is impressive, with rear legroom deserving particular praise.Interior storage comprises a of a deep glovebox, front and rear door bins that can accommodate a large bottle, and a flat shelf for a smartphone at the bottom of the well-constructed dashboard.Boot capacity of -litres can be transformed into a ,-litre space when the rear seat backs are folded down, while an intelligent trunk cover can be stowed away safely within the boot when not in use.The new Hyundai Bayon is available in a multitude of stylish exterior colours, along with the option of a two-tone roof and matching door mirror housings in Phantom Black to create a car perfectly matched to inidual taste. The new Bayon truly is ready to reach new heights in the competitive small crossover SUV market segment.Hyundai’s comprehensive -year unlimited mileage warranty comes as standard, as does a -year AA Roadside Assistance and Free Vehicle Health Check package.

Based on the A-Class of the time, Mercedes-Benz gave its smallest model some SUV flavour with clever body cladding and a raised ride height.  googletag.cmd.push   More SUV-Like Than EverLaunched in , the second-generation GLA also shares its DNA with the latest A-Class, but it gained a more traditional SUV shape. Standing cm taller than its predecessor, the new GLA’s wheel arches are more squared-off in shape and are clad in protective black plastic. Its wheelbase has also been increased to create more passenger space, while the wheels are pushed out to each corner, resulting in much shorter front and rear overhangs.     Pitched directly against rivals like the BMW X and Volvo XC hybrids, the new GLA  e uses the same powertrain as the plug-in A-Class— a .-litre petrol engine and bhp electric motor, drawing power from a .kWh battery. The fuel tank in the GLA  e is located ahead of the car’s front axle, which leaves space under the boot to fit the hybrid battery. Importantly, this means that the GLA avoids the awkward box-shaped intrusion into the boot area seen in some plug-in hybrid cars.Specication DetailsThe new Mercedes-Benz GLA  e is available in a choice of two generously-equipped specication levels — Progressive and AMG Line — both of which come with standard features such as stylish five-twin-spoke light-alloy wheels, parking sensors with reversing camera, LED high performance headlamps, Light and Sight package, hard-disc navigation, MBUX multimedia system, digital radio, Android Auto, Apple CarPlay, Seat Comfort package with heated front seats, automatic climate control, roof liner in black fabric, Mercedes-Benz emergency call system, galvanised steering-wheel gearsht paddles, Easy-Pack tailgate, Dynamic Select, acoustic ambient protection, Active Lane Keep Assist, and Speed Limit Assist, along with many more comfort, convenience and security features.         Additional AMG Line specication includes lowered comfort suspension, AMG body styling, carbon-structure trim, ” AMG -twin-spoke light-alloy wheels, Artico leather Dinamica microfibre black upholstery, and AMG floor mats.Test CarMy GLA  e ‘Progressive’ test car was finished in Night Black paintwith contrasting Macchiato Beige Black Artico leather upholsteryfor maximum impact.With a % battery charge, my test car estimated its own electric range to be km’s. The car defaults to Hybrid mode when started up, so you proceed in zero-emission fashion at speeds of up to km h, as long as the battery has charge and you accelerate gently.When the petrol engine cuts in performance is strong, as it and the electric motor combine their power in a smooth and orderly fashion. With a combined power output of bhp and a mighty Nm of torque, the GLA  e can sprint from -km h in as little as . seconds, and can achieve a top speed of km h .The petrol engine only really makes its presence known when you ask for more performance, while neat handling and sufficient grip from the driven front wheels provides great confidence on the road. The car’s steering is light but direct, and the ride is more than comfortable enough to deal with rutted road surfaces and speed ramps with ease.Cabin space is impressive, with excellent head, leg and elbow room available for all occupants, while a -litre boot capacity will be more than adequate for most families. However, the GLA’s standard split-folding rear seat backs allow for the transportation of larger items when called upon, with up to ,-litres of space on offer in this mode.The cabin of the new GLA certainly feels vastly improved over the original GLA in every respect. This has been made possible by the latest Mercedes-Benz MBUX interior layout, with crisp digital displays replacing the analogue instrument dials and flowing across onto the dashboard.Buttons have been largely replaced by a controller ahead of the gear-lever and voice control, which uses articial intelligence similar to that found in home smart devices to recognise more natural speech and commands. The turbine air vents from the original GLA have been retained, but the dashboard has been slimmed-down for a more spacious feel.VerdictOverall, the new Mercedes-Benz GLA  e is a competent all-rounder that offers a decent electric range, low emissions, predictable handling and a luxurious, technology-filled cabin — encased in a stylish and practical premium compact SUV body.

They also provide underage hurling via St Patricks, an amalgamation with their parish neighbours St Colms Drum.When Derry won the All-Ireland title in , the countys most successful era, Richard Ferris was part of the winning formula and scored a goal in their opening round against Down that season. Joe Irwin won an Ulster medal with the county and Eunan Rafferty was also on Derry teams in that era.The clubs recent underage development work has provided Michael Mullan to Derrys Ulster minor winning team of , with Tiarnaacuten McHugh, Dara and Ruairi Rafferty part of the group who repeated the feat two seasons later on their way to the All-Ireland Final.Current senior captain Tiarnaacuten Woods has represented Derry at minor and U level, with McHugh and Ruairi Rafferty – who have played senior hurling with Kevin Lynchs – having also played the wee ball game for the county.On the camogie field, Una Rafferty and Aoe Kelly have represented Derry at minor and U level respectively. It has all comeas a result of the work being done at the club.“It is great to have Richard Ferris back involved again,” Shane adds. “He has set up a winter programme in place for the players in first to fth year , with the older players getting looked after under the senior  with their strength and conditioning.”The current senior group has benefited from the influx of youth as they have one eye on the Derry IFC Quarter-Finals later this month.McGonigle paid tribute to those who have sat on club committees down through the years and it has been bolstered with new blood coming on board in recent years to help with the clubs progression. Another great development has been an influx in new coaches coming forward at primary school level. Every bit helps. Like many other clubs across Ireland, Drumsurn reaches deeper into the locality. They are more than just GAA. Its a social hub that knits everyone together, regardless of age. It offers an identity.On top of their day to day club activities and s. Fitness classes, male and female, are a valuable facet of the club, while they also host Irish dancing and bowls.The club has also recently formed a mental health committee and have put in place a full winter program to complement this initiative. There are also plans for Irish language classes. There is never a dull moment. The clubs heart beats strong.“We as a club are very community focused,” Shane stresses. “In the past year we have brought the Action Cancer big bus for two days and also provided a defibrillator in a cabinet for our communitys use.”Since moving to their current premises, Billy Doran Park, in , they have added a training pitch and a club gym.The Club Committee set out a three-phase ground development plan in . The first phase of a new kitchen plus internal and external toilet blocks was completed in  with the changing rooms refurbished in .Phase , currently going through planning, includes a walking track, new floodlights and ball-wall. It all leads into Phase , a floodlit G pitch.“Our proposed ground developments are going to cost in excess of pound,,” McGonigle points out. “For a club of less than  members, this is a massive undertaking.”Drumsurn have set themselves a target of having phases two and three complete for their Centenary Year in .“Unfortunately, as with many other aspects of le, Covid has put a stop to conventional fundraising activities for the moment,” Shane outlines. “So we decided to set up Drumsurn GAC Competitions as a way of raising some much needed funds.”     For more information and details on how to enter Drumsurns competition, visit www.drumsurngaccompetitions  ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId   reported missing  times - court told\" title\"Derry girlsreported missing  times - court told\" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"Derry NewsDerry girlreported missing  times - court told overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsCity of Derry airport welcomes a new route overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Paul Lavilleand James Donaghy, MD of Donaghy Bros, at the awards.Local NewsCounty Derry electrical retailer collects top award in London overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsCounty Derry man disqualied after witnesses followed him home overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsCounty Derry teenager bit officer on the leg and spat at police overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The PSNI have urged the public in Derry to be vigilant towards scammersLocal NewsPolice warn Derry smartphone users of scammers overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Thursday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Friday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Sir Gerry Robinson became well-known as a television presenter fronting BBC programmes including Troubleshooter and Can Gerry Robinson Fix the NHSNational NewsDeath announced of Sir Gerry Robinson overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Fancy Dress night out with Moyola FC, Castledawson \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Fancy Dress night out with Moyola FC, Castledawson  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Memory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

The project manager Mr Mike Gibb, said Delamont had always been his first option but he could no longer afford to wait on the council.Mr Gibbrsquos announcement dashes hopes that the centre, which is destined to become the largest owl and birds of prey rescue facility in Europe, would come to Killyleagh.Mr Gibb had entered negotiations with Down Council last year regarding the possible construction of the sanctuary at Delamont.But the project became the subject of controversial debates within the council chamber earlier this year amid accusations that council officials were dragging their heels about the proposal, leading Mr Gibb to look for alternative locations.CLOUGH ndash Residents opposing plans for the erection of a BT Cellnet mobile telephone mast in Clough have formed an action group to try and block the plan.At a meeting in the village on Monday, residents got together after they heard local environmentalist, Walter Graham, outlined the drawbacks and health risks associated with these masts.Plans for the -metre mast which,approved, will be sited within the Watsonrsquos filling station complex, were published several weeks ago andaccepted could be operating within months.Up to  residents gathered in the Old School House, just a stonersquos throw from the proposed site, to hear of the risks and implications these masts are believed to cause.Villagers heard how the transmitter could dominate the skyline, towering over homes, a primary school, petrol station and an old peoplersquos home.Claiming that scientists believed the growth of cancers were ldquospurred on by the transmitters, he said. ldquoIf this mast goes up my children are coming out of school, there is no way they will study in the shadow of that mast.

Three minutes later the visitors had their first effort when from Casey Courtneyrsquos long throw, Christopher McKay headed back to Courtney but his enterprising effort was wide.Villa should have been ahead in the th minute but Aaron Carberry produced an outstanding double save.The game was being played at a frantic pace with both midfields battling for supremacy with Jon Joe Sharvin and Darren McConnell linking to produce an outstanding pass for Jack Sharvin but his effort was well blocked.Soon afterwards there was almost a repeat with McConnell and Barry Walsh linking, and Jack Sharvin flashing the ball across the six yard box.Killyleagh were playing some neat football with Jonny Murray and Jon Joe Sharvin combining for Jamie Sharvin to almost thread it through for Declan McComiskey. There was time for Jamie Sharvin to stride forward and try a long range effort.The visitors have made an outstanding start to the season, reaching the quarter finals of the Steel Cup, and they knocked the ball about with confidence as they had their best spell of the game.A free kick from the impressive Arthurs was cleared for a corner in the th minute and then, six minutes later, first Jamie Sharvin blocked the effort from McKayrsquos knock down, and Jonny Murray cleared a clever short corner as Thomas Dickson prepared to strike.At the opposite end twice before the interval Jack Sharvin went close, first with a free kick on the far left and then he had an effort cleared off the line in the nd minute but in truth both teams were very evenly matched in the first half.Killyleagh took control in the second half with a midfield masterclass from Barry Walsh and Darren McConnell in particular, and McComiskey having a lot of joy down the left side. After  minutes they were awarded a penalty when Jack Sharvin was fouled in a clumsy challenge from Courtney inside the box.However, Sharvinrsquos spot kick was brilliantly saved by Andy Wallace.Four minutes later and Wallace produced heroics again, this time a save with his feet from Sam Carson after McComiskeyrsquos pace had again exposed Villa.The goal was coming, though, and it was goal of brilliance. Jack Sharvin curled the ball round his marker Hylands from the edge of the box and into the stanchion of the goal in the th minute.It was a goal worthy of winning any cup tie, at any level. For a long time it looked asit would.Killyleagh had half chances, after this, with Walsh again winning his midfield tussle with Dickson to set up Jon Joe Sharvin and then Jack Sharvin went even closer from brother Jamiersquos free kick. Villa had half chances too at the opposite end with Jake Wilson going close to an equaliser.Then came that dramatic finale. Wilson was presented with a second chance in the box after his initial effort was saved and he produced a stunning finish high into the net from a tight angle.Cue th minute pandemonium and it seemed the tie was set for extra time.But when the game was restarted Killyleagh won a corner and after two blocks at close range the ball was eventually scrambled over the line by Jon Joe Sharvin in the th minute.The huge crowd contained several former players from the first Killyleagh team to win the Border Cup in  and now Paul Sharvin will be hoping his team get a chance to match that Christmas glory.To reach the semi-finals, however, they must beat Crumlin United on November  ndash a chance to avenge an incredible - defeat when the teams last met in this competition exactly two yearsrsquo ago when Killyleagh tossed away a - half-time lead in the last nine minutes..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/13October2021_Slieve.jpg","title":"Slieve Donard sold for £40m  ","story":"NEWCASTLErsquoS iconic Slieve Donard Resort and Spa has been sold in a poundm deal to American investors.Owned by the Hastings family since , the world famous five-star hotel has been acquired by US-based AJ Capital Partners which is planning a major upgrade.After weeks of speculation that the hotel had been sold, the news was finally confirmed last Thursday with the new owner a Nashville-headquartered real estate developer and hotel operator with more than  hotels across the US and Britain, including St Andrews in Scotland.Announcing that the Newcastle hotel has been acquired, AJ Capital also confirmed that renovation work is planned to start in October next year, with the work completed by the following spring.During the planned upgrade, the hotel will remain closed.Howard Hastings mdash the managing director of Hastings Hotels mdash described AJ Capital Partnersrsquos acquisition of the Slieve Donard Resort and Spa as ldquoencouraging news for hospitality and tourism in Northern Ireland.He said it also represented a boost for the burgeoning golf tourism industry which ldquohas been an important driver of local tourism in recent years and shows signicant growth potential in the future.Mr Hastings added: ldquoI have every confidence that AJ Capital Partners will be sympathetic to the heritage of the hotel and that, under their leadership, it will continue to flourish and maintain its reputation as an iconic destination in Northern Ireland.ldquoThis investment is a strong sign of confidence in the local market by a major international hotel operator with exciting ambitions for the Slieve Donard in the coming years.

Mr Greaney said: ldquoHe has evidence of critical importance to give to the inquiry. He was a childhood friend of Salman Abedi and he is therefore singularly well placed to describe Abedirsquos journey towards radicalisation.He told the court the inquiry was also ldquovery interested in what was discussed when Mr Taghdi and Salman Abedi visited Abdallah in prison.And he said he was a witness of ldquoconsiderable signicance adding that Mr Taghdi was seen to visit the area where the Nissan Micra car was kept in the five weeks Salman Abedi was in Libya before ing to collect the bomb components from the car and carry out the attack.Mr Greaney said Mr Taghdi had been given ldquoevery chance to co-operate with the inquiry but failed to do so.Mr Taghdi, from Manchester, was arrested and questioned after the bombing but never charged with any offence and denies involvement or knowledge of the bomb plot by Salman and his brother Hashem Abedi.Mr Justice Jacobs granted the application for the order, backed by an arrest warrant should he not attend.He added: ldquoIt is beyond sensible argument that the respondenthas relevant evidence he can give to the inquiry.ldquoIt is justied in the circumstances of the present case so we will make the order which has been requested.Ismail Abedi, the bomb plottersrsquo older brother, and Abdalraouf Abdallah, are both due to give evidence next week, having initially declined to do so.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThe Home Secretary will be able to suspend visas entirely, impose a pound surcharge on applications to come to the UK or increase visa processing times.The powers will affect the whole visa service, including study, work, visitor and settlement visas.The aim is to encourage other countries to cooperate with the UK Government when it comes to deportations and removals.Ms Patel said: ldquoThe UK has a proud history of being open to the world but we rightly expect our international partners to work with us to remove those who have no right to be in the UK, such as dangerous foreign national offenders.ldquoIt is unfair on UK citizens and taxpayers that pressure is put on our public services by foreign nationals with no legal right#to be#here.ldquoThrough my New Plan for Immigration, and this landmark legislation, I will continue to take the dficult action needed to fix our broken asylum system and deliver on what the British people want ndash full control of our borders.Foreign criminals will also be able to be removed sooner.Under changes to the Early Removal Scheme, foreign national criminals will be eligible for removal up to  months before the end of their custodial sentence, as opposed to nine months. This is assuming theyrsquove served over half a custodial sentence.Minister for justice and tackling illegal migration, Tom#Pursglove, said the the New Plan for Immigration provides the only long-term solution to fix our ldquobroken asylum system.He added: ldquoWe are taking another step forward in delivering on this commitment as our Nationality and Borders Bill continues its passage through Parliament. We are ensuring our system is fair for those who play by the rules, but firm on foreign criminals and those in our country illegally.     ldquoWe have brought forward the most signicant reforms to the immigration and asylum system in decades. This is what the British people have consistently demanded. Strengthening the Bill through these amendments will ensure that we continue to deliver for them.The US also requests that foreign governments take appropriate steps when it comes to deportations and removals. Any lack of cooperation from the nation of origin would in many cases result in visa sanctions, which can y in severity.At the beginning of the month, the EU temporarily suspended the application of certain provisions in the visa code to nationals from The Gambia.The decision was taken due to the countryrsquos lack of cooperation on readmission of third-country nationals illegally staying in the EU.Some of the other amendments tabled by the Government include expanding the types of claims that can be dealt with in an accelerated appeal from detention, so that more cases can be resolved while the person is in detention rather than them being released into the community.#This includes foreign national offenders.Over the coming week, the Government is also expected to introducea robust approach to age assessment to better identy asylum-seeking children and stop adults accessing childrenrsquos services and legislation to establish an Electronic Travel AuthorisationScheme.Once introduced, carriers will have to check that all passengershave a digital authorisation or some other form of permission before they can travel to the UK..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: Patel plans visa penalties for countries that do not cooperate on deportations article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

With all things considered, officers recommended the delivery of option two.The rural towns officers included in the report are Donaghcloney, Keady, Richhill, Tandragee and Waringstown.DUP group leader, Councillor Mark Baxter proposed the officers’ recommendation to go with the festive drive in experience and said “it would be very welcome, especially in those rural communities”.Councillor Paul Berry welcomed the proposal but noted Markethill was not included in the list of towns mentioned and proposed it was included.Council’s head of economic development services, Nicola Wilson confirmed Markethill could be includedcouncillors want.Noting Council has a duty of care to the general public, Councillor Kyle Savage seconded the proposal to accept the recommendation and praised council officersfor “taking and showing true leadership” with this recommendation.Noting he was happy to go with the proposal for the festive drive-in, despite public health regulations relaxing further at the end of October, Councillor Sam Nicholson said he would second Cllr Berry’s proposal to include Markethill in the proposal.“I support Cllr Berry’s call to include Markethill. It is one of our most thriving and vibrant market towns,” he said.“If Councillor Berry is making a proposal to include it, I am happy to second it.”Alderman Ian Burns said he was fully supportive of the proposal but called for the towns of Gilford and Rathfriland to also be recognised.Councillor Thomas O’Hanlon said he would prefer to see twilight markets in the rural towns but with the movie night proposal he would want to ensure that “providing it can be worked into costs, it is run in as many of our rural towns as possible”.Alderman Jim Speers said he had discussed this issue “at ” with Council officers and acknowledged the need for as many places as possible to get an event like this.“I am very supportive of the need to have this event in Markethill butwe do that in one place other towns will feel they have been short-changed.“I have already had that conversation with officers and I would like to see us get to the point where this is rolled out across the area.”The committee then voiced its approval for Councillor Baxter’s proposal to recommend the movie night and free Christmas Eve car parking is approved and Cllr Berry’s proposal to incorporate as many smaller towns as budgets will allow.Read this:- Driving tests ‘crisis’Editor’s message:Thank you for reading this article.

freshers week around the corner and thousands of young people in Northern Ireland set to start University or new career paths, many will be on the hunt for rented accommodation. Northern Ireland has experienced a .% increase in average rental values this year[]. With the price increase, OFTEC, representing the liquid fuel industry in Ireland, is concerned that students may take cheaper accommodation options without properly inspecting the property. With this in mind, OFTEC has issued advise to help students ensure their accommodation is safe before they sign the dotted line. Raise the alarm – Currently, it is not a mandatory requirement for private landlords to provide smoke and carbon monoxide detectors, but the HSENI recommend that they do. It is a legal requirement to fit a carbon monoxide detector when a fossil fuel appliance has been replaced. Carbon monoxide is potentially lethal as it has no smell, taste or colour. Without a working alarm, it is impossible to identy carbon monoxide leaks. OFTEC’s advise is to ensure that there are working fire and CO alarms in the property, and that they are tested on a regular basis.Heating requirements - The Health  Safety Executive recommend that all boilers should be serviced annually and tenants should ask for evidence of recent servicing. If you have concerns, ask for a CD  Landlord Oil Installation Check which is carried out by an OFTEC registered technician and will give you peace of mind. For a gas heated property, ask for a copy of the annual gas safety check.Look for damp – It is easy to hide damp patches with a coat of paint, soyour house smells musty or you see evidence of mould, find out how the landlord is planning to fix the problem. Mould has no place in the home as it can cause respiratory problems and headaches.Furniture and fittings – Ask the landlord for a list of everything that is included and make note of any damage that is there before you move it. Check any beds, sofas and chairs are in good condition.Secure your home – burglars may target student areas because of lax security. Ask your landlord to fit key operating locks on the windows and lever deadlocks on external doors.  OFTEC Ireland Manager, David Blevings, said: “Quite often the excitement of moving in with friends can overshadow the concerns about the accommodation itself. We are urging students to play it safe this year and carry out these essential checks before signing a lease and moving in. “Asking a landlord about safety may seem awkward, but it could prevent you from living in a potentially dangerous property for the next  months. It’s vital that your new home is not a burden as you start your time at university.
