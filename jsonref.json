In 2015, she reportedly told the journalist Piers Morgan that she had not always sought showbusiness success.‘As a kid, I wanted to be either the president or a news broadcaster like you,’ she told him.          The actress married Prince Harry after meeting him in London in 2016. She has now become the Duchess of Sussex          Meghan Markle is expected to become a British citizen but she has harboured dreams of becoming President of the USMeghan is still a U.S. citizen because the process to become a fully-fledged Briton is expected to take three years. She is expected to retain her U.S. citizenship, as dual citizenship is permitted. Presidential candidates must be U.S. citizens.Meghan has cultivated a warm friendship with former U.S. president Barack Obama and his wife, Michelle, while chat show host Oprah Winfrey, who is one of the most influential women in America, was given a prime seat at St George’s Chapel Windsor, opposite the Royal Family.A royal historian says Meghan would find it difficult to enter U.S. politics while still married to Harry. ‘It is a pretty strong rule that members of the Royal Family keep out of politics,’ he says.Share this article    The newly married Duke and Duchess of Sussex, Meghan Markle and Prince Harry, leaving Windsor Castle after their weddingBut Harry could, of course, give up official royal duties. His mother, Princess Diana, was said to have considered moving to America.And the claim appears to have caused consternation at Kensington Palace yesterday, with the Duchess giving her official spokesman permission to take the unusual step of issuing a public denial.‘This conversation you describe with an associate is fictitious,’ the spokesman insisted.I am, though, not the only one to hear rumours that Meghan still holds political ambitions.Former Times editor Sir Simon Jenkins says: ‘Her friends and associates affirm that she is a political animal.‘Such is her fame, she could perfectly well follow a route taken by a certain Ronald Reagan. She might lead for the Democrats against a Republican Ivanka Trump. All I can say is, why not?’Meghan’s best friend is Jessica Mulroney, whose father-in-law, Brian, was prime minister of Canada for nine years.Meghan has strong political views and attacked Donald Trump in 2016 for being ‘isive’ and ‘misogynistic’. She might have to reach an accommodation with her new chum George Clooney, who is said to hold political ambitions of his own. Perhaps he could be her running mate."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/23/01/4C898F2700000578-5759713-Auctioning_under_the_name_ClaireOliver87_the_listing_included_th-a-28_1527035182950.jpg","title":"Official royal wedding gift bag sells 21 400 eBay","story":"    Included in the listing was a bottle of Windsor Castle spring water, a fridge magnet, an over-sized chocolate coin, a tin of shortbread biscuits, a spectator badge, a spectator wristband, a parking sticker, the order of service, a postcard, a map and day briefing, entry card letter and finally the tote bag itself          Auctioning under the name ClaireOliver87, the listing included the entire contents of the gift bag as well as the paperwork received on and prior to the dayThe guests arrived at 9am to see 600 VIPs including the Queen, Prince Philip and Prince Charles as well as the Clooneys, the Beckhams, Elton John and Oprah Winfrey turn up for the A-list wedding of the decade. And as 120,000 well-wishers fought for space outside the castle these privileged 1,200 were able to get great views of the newlyweds as they kissed outside the chapel and paraded past in the royal Ascot Landau carriage. But within hours of the event finishing dozens of their free hessian gift bags were being auctioned off to the highest bidder.Many of the sellers had clearly planned to do it in advance because they photographed the items outside St George\u0027s Chapel to ensure they looked genuine on eBay.           Bids for items have now reached more than £1,000 even though they were handed out for free by Meghan and Harry  Guests invited by Meghan and Harry to see them marry are already cashing in by selling their gift bags on eBay for £400 or more          Guests arriving in the grounds of Windsor Castle passed tables where bags were handed out to each guest but some have taken advantage of this generosity          The canvas bags had the happy couple\u0027s initials on the side and are being sold on the promise buyers will be getting a piece of royal wedding historySo why WERE the Beckhams and Clooneys (not to mention Chloe...Why did George and Charlotte suddenly go missing?

Meghan is the first mixed-race member of the royal family in an extraordinary journey for a girl born in LA to a white father and African-American mother who fought her way through the tough world of showbusiness to land a plum role in the TV series Suits.Harry and Meghan\u0027s big day couldn\u0027t have been more different than royal weddings of the past, especially because the prince was visibly emotional throughout - and guests suggested it was the most erse major event in the Queen\u0027s 66-year reign.The prince had looked tearful when he saw his bride for the first time, grabbing her hand telling her: \u0027You look amazing - I missed you\u0027 before tenderly lifting her veil.The new Duke of Sussex also said \u0027thank you, pa\u0027 after his father Prince Charles walked the now Duchess of Sussex down the aisle of St George\u0027s Chapel, Windsor, having stepped in at the last moment for Meghan\u0027s father Thomas.           Harry looked very emotional at points in the service and several others in the congregation were in tears on their happy day          Harry and Meghan hold hands as they walk out of St George\u0027s Chapel after the wedding ceremony          A sea of smiling faces greets Harry and Meghan as they leave the church after the American-influenced service conducted by the Archbishop of Canterbury          Laughter: One of the well-wishers in the crowds makes Meghan laugh and Prince Harry smile as they continue with their 25-minute tour of the royal market town Meghan Markle told wedding guests: \u0027I\u0027ve found my prince\u0027 in an emotional speech after her ecstatic new husband said the support of his \u0027far better half\u0027 meant he could finally be \u0027me\u0027, it was revealed on Monday.The new Duchess of Sussex also thanked the Queen, Prince Charles and other senior royals for welcoming her so warmly to the royal family \u0027firm\u0027.The bride, resplendent in a white evening gown by Stella McCartney, took to the microphone after a private evening dinner thrown by Prince Charles at Frogmore House.  Meghan\u0027s short speech was yet another part of her modernising mini-revolution of the royal family because royal brides usually leave it to the groom to address guests.The 36-year-old, who wore an aquamarine ring which belonged to Harry\u0027s mother beloved mother Princess Diana, ended her short address by declaring her deep love for Harry and said: \u0027I have found my prince\u0027, according to the Daily Mirror.Before she spoke Harry said his wife, brother, father and friends \u0027are the people that make \u0027me\u0027, me, in my Harry life\u0027 before adding: \u0027Now I\u0027m going to hand over to my far better half\u0027.Earlier he is also believed to have told his bride: \u0027I can\u0027t wait to spend the rest of my life with you.\u0027     One source described how Meghan also expressed her gratitude at how welcoming the prince had been to both herself and her mother, Doria Ragland. \u0027She has been so touched by how welcoming the Prince of Wales has been. So is her mother,\u0027 the source said. \u0027Honestly, they are touched beyond belief. It was important to her to make a point of thanking him publicly, although, of course, he knows privately how she feels.\u0027Another source said: \u0027It is often said that he always wanted a daughter and I think he has been really moved by how well they have got on. There is definitely a special connection there. Meghan\u0027s mother means more to her than anything, so it was lovely to see the way he was so welcoming to Doria too.\u0027          Meghan and Harry looked like movie stars after they changed for the evening reception at Frogmore House          Harry and Meghan travelled in a Jaguar converted to electric power, which had a numberplate with Saturday\u0027s dateCelebrities arrive for the funeral of TV presenter Dale WintonHorrific moment three friends film themselves drowning in a pond30-year-old Michael Rotondo is being evicted by his own parentsShocking moment man stabs nurse after being refused medicationCat clings onto the roof of a van driving at 60mphPfizer unveils the first ever viagra ad aired on UK terrestrial TVDuchess of Sussex Meghan is bowed to on first Royal outingMeghan puts protective arm around Harry on newlyweds\u0027 first eventNew NFL\u0027s national anthem policy could fine teams if player kneels\u0027You nearly crushed my kids\u0027: Woman drives irregularly outside schoolShocking CCTV of man ejected from spinning car after crashPrince Charles had also paid tribute to his \u0027darling old Harry\u0027 in an emotional speech that is said to have left the 600 guests, including Hollywood stars, in tears.Speaking at the afternoon reception at St George\u0027s Hall in Windsor Castle shortly after they married he Charles told of how moving it was to watch youngest son  get married.Charles, who walked Meghan to the altar, finishing by saying: \u0027My darling old Harry, I\u0027m so happy for you.\u0027Harry, 33, is also said to have given an \u0027off the cuff\u0027 speech about how happy he was.He is also said to have turned to his guests and asked: \u0027Can anyone play the piano\u0027 – before Sir Elton John played a medley of Your Song, Tiny Dancer, Circle Of Life and I\u0027m Still Standing.Harry also said Meghan had \u0027navigated everything with such grace\u0027, adding: \u0027We make such a great team\u0027. According to the Sunday Times. Wedding guest Peter Fearnhead, co-founder of African Parks, told the Sunday Telegraph: \u0027When Harry and Meghan came in they stood on the podium and Prince William introduced them.\u0027Prince Charles made a really gracious speech, it was amazingly endearing. He\u0027s got a wonderfully dry sense of humour. Prince Harry was charming about Meghan, they are so clearly in love. We all had a tear in our eye.\u0027 Later he whisked his bride away in an open-top Jaguar to head for a star-studded, champagne-fuelled, black-tie reception for the bride and groom at the opulent Frogmore House in Windsor Great Park on Saturday night.The newlyweds were cheered wildly as they took to the floor with the funky soul classic Land of a Thousand Dances for their first dance at the spectacular royal wedding reception.Comedian James Corden is reported to have launched a dance routine with Harry, his brother William and his father Charles, apparently refereeing a \u0027dance-off\u0027, while George Clooney danced with both Meghan and Kate. After a very modern take on the traditional royal wedding, the late-night revelry followed suit – and those fortunate enough to bag a place on the ultra-exclusive guest list were treated to a night of risque speeches, wild dancing and plenty of stodge to soak up the alcohol.

ITV’s coverage peaked at 3.6million.The combined average audience for BBC and ITV was around 11million. But this was lower than the figure for the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge’s wedding in 2011, which had a combined audience of 17.6million – although this included people watching on catch-up. Charles and Diana’s wedding was watched by more than 28million in 1981.Saturday’s FA Cup Final averaged 6.7million viewers and peaked at 8.7million on BBC1. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/23/03/4C6D6BBD00000578-5760259-image-m-50_1527041809494.jpg","title":"Meghan Markles sister says Doria Ragland looked like hockey player penalty box","story":"Meghan Markle\u0027s half-sister Samantha Grant fired off a series of barbs at Doria Ragland.

Importantly, as Tesco is currently the UK\u0027s biggest supermarket it has enormous influence over suppliers and the rest of the high street.Interestingly, the chain says it will not switch to a new generation of plant-based water soluble bioplastics or oxy degradable plastics.

By pledging to quickly eliminate some of the plastics that are difficult to recycle, it has raised the bar for action on problem plastics.\u0027And by acknowledging that we can\u0027t blindly replace plastics with bioplastics, some of which can also persist in the environment and harm wildlife, Tesco is committing to avoid false solutions.\u0027                             By pledging to quickly eliminate some of the plastics that are difficult to recycle, it has raised the bar for action on problem plastics                        Elena Polisano, Oceans campaigner at Greenpeace UKHowever, she said the company has more to do. \u0027Tesco hasn\u0027t set a much-needed yearly target for decreasing its volume of plastic packaging, which all supermarkets must do to curb plastic pollution,\u0027 she said.\u0027Iceland is leading the way on reduction with a commitment to eliminate single-use plastic packaging on own brand products by 2023 and Lidl is working towards a 20 per cent reduction by 2022.\u0027We hope other retailers including Tesco will follow suit with public reduction targets. We are challenging all supermarkets to reduce their single-use plastic footprints in the shortest time possible, and in the meantime they should pull out all the stops to remove unnecessary and non-recyclable plastic packaging by 2019. \u0027Now we know what it\u0027s doing to our oceans, it simply has to go.\u0027 Details of the Tesco plan were revealed by Chief Product Officer, Jason Tarry, who was speaking to hundreds of suppliers at an event organised by the Institute of Grocery Distribution (IDG) yesterday. As well as replacing plastic, Tesco is campaigning for the UK to adopt a so-called \u0027closed loop system\u0027 on packaging where everything that is used is collected and recycled, The Grocer reported.It said this will require the Government and local councils to set up a uniform recycling system across UK, replacing the current regime where there are \u0027extreme\u0027 differences in the materials that are collected between towns.Mr Tarry said: \u0027We are committed to reducing the total amount of packaging used across our business. Ideally we would like to move to a closed loop system.\u0027We will work with our suppliers to redesign and reduce all packaging materials and after consultation with our leading suppliers earlier this year we will remove all packaging that is hard to recycle from our business by 2019.\u0027To complete the journey to a closed loop approach, we stand ready to work with government to reform the current approach to recycling in the UK.\u0027Tesco steps up war on plastic with packaging ban"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/09/14/1AB6E95A00000578-5708953-image-a-152_1525873896610.jpg","title":"Canadian Marine Scotland employee tied gagged racism misogyny claims Scrabster","story":"    A shocking picture shows Marine Scotland employee DeeAnn Fitzpatrick tied up and gagged with tape after she made claims of bullying and harassment by male colleagues in 2010           Canadian national Ms Fitzpatrick (pictured on the job) told an employment tribunal she suffered years of bullying at the hands of her colleagues Miss Fitzpatrick, a Canadian-national, says she faced daily racism, threatening behaviour and even jokes about her recent miscarriage from her male colleagues while working at Marine Scotland as a fisheries officer.Yulia Skripal breaks her silence: Poisoned spy\u0027s daughter...EXCLUSIVE: Two DPD delivery drivers are caught on CCTV...Share this articleShe alleges that campaign against her continued for almost ten years.

It was fronted by Gina Miller (pictured), who took the Government to court over Brexit\u0027Those MPs who are seeking to dilute or delay Brexit must now admit that their meaningful vote is really just their plan to stop Brexit – as this document sets out unambiguously.\u0027Richard Tice, of the pro-Brexit group Leave Means Leave, said: \u0027George Soros, the billionaire who does not live in the UK, will stop at nothing with his elitist friends to stop Brexit, deceitfully masking their plans as a people\u0027s vote. \u0027Shamefully, they want to deny the poorest in our society from benefiting the most from Brexit.\u0027Best for Britain was launched last April ahead of the snap general election. It was fronted by Gina Miller, who took the Government to court over Brexit, but she quit the day after the General Election in June last year and has since spoken about becoming uncomfortable with the group\u0027s tactics. It emerged in February that Best for Britain had accepted a £400,000 donation from Mr Soros, the Hungarian-born financier who bet against sterling on Black Wednesday in 1992 – earning him one billion dollars.           Pictured: Best for Britain boss Gina Miller pictured in central London in May last year He then promised £100,000 more, matching a crowdfunding push, and later gave another £300,000.Board members include Lord Malloch-Brown, who was a foreign minister under Gordon Brown, and chief executive Eloise Todd, who worked in Brussels for Bono\u0027s charity ONE.When the campaign was founded, its backers claimed they respected the result of the EU referendum. But it has been putting up billboards around the country calling for a second vote and the document says its strategic goals include: \u0027stop Brexit\u0027 and \u0027win a people\u0027s vote to stay and lead in Europe\u0027.It sets out a three-pronged strategy to persuade \u0027soft\u0027 Leave voters to change their minds, mobilise hardline Remainers into action, and shift the Labour Party into an anti-Brexit stance.Best for Britain says it will \u0027attach our case to the big non-Brexit issues that have emotional resonance – we need to break out from the Brexit bubble\u0027. Using social media, it wants \u0027reach out to where people are engaged – physically but mostly digitally\u0027. It also pledges to \u0027cut through by being bold and embracing the disruptive\u0027.          Former Cabinet minister Owen Paterson (pictured) said a document reveals how far some Remainers would go to overturn the result of the referendum of June 2016In the next few weeks Best for Britain will start arguing the Brexit referendum was not a rejection of the EU: \u0027This was a vote against London as much as Brussels.\u0027Over the summer, its message will focus on how Brexit is \u0027putting the UK\u0027s unity and security at risk\u0027. In October – when it is expected that the outline of the Prime Minister\u0027s deal with Brussels will be known – the document reveals that the group has already decided to argue: \u0027Now we can finally see the real facts, this is not what we voted for.\u0027Best for Britain activists are instructed to \u0027survey local issues and concerns and link these to impact of Brexit\u0027.They started with grassroots events for constituency Labour parties earlier this month, with plans to start work on \u0027mobilising the unions\u0027 in the next fortnight.In July, the group is planning to lobby the policy conference of Unite, the country\u0027s largest trade union. In August, it is organising a \u0027Labour Against Brexit\u0027 speaking tour that will see senior figures make the case for remaining in the EU.          In September it will have a presence at both the TUC and Labour Party annual conferences.When MPs return to Parliament after party conference season, it is planning to bring hundreds of activists to London to confront them. The document says: \u0027We\u0027ve raised £2.4million, we need another £3.2million. \u0027Our activity is essentially scalable – how many we reach is directly proportional to what we can spend.\u0027A Best for Britain spokesman said: \u0027We have never hidden our agenda. Our aim as an organisation is to stop Brexit democratically. \u0027We want to connect people across the country to their MPs, particularly in the Labour Party, so they directly hear from their membership and their voters, the vast majority of whom want to make sure we have a real debate on Brexit before our options are taken off the table.\u0027Brexit is taking longer than people expected, costing more, and stopping us from creating a better Britain that works for everyone.\u0027But former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith said: \u0027This dossier is yet another example of the complacent Establishment trying to stitch up the people.\u0027 "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/23/14/4C8DF42200000578-0-image-m-24_1527081862222.jpg","title":"Shocking moment family spots CAT clinging roof car 60mph highway","story":"Pictured: Rebel the cat was seen clinging for dear life to the top of a van traveling 60mph along a Nebraska highwayMs Rankin told KETV her daughter was the first one to initially spot the unusual situation, and at first the Nebraska mom didn\u0027t believe her. \u0027My daughter says, There\u0027s a cat on that van, and I was like, Oh no, that\u0027s a raccoon,\u0027 she said.  \u0027When my husband pulls up closer, I\u0027m like, Oh my God, no, that\u0027s a cat.\u0027Horrifying moment pedestrian is hit by a car as he runs...What the TRUCK!

The size of the House is now falling and will continue to fall\u0027Yesterday’s Daily Mail reported a poll which it said suggested that the House of Lords was outdated, outsized and out of touch with the British public. Let me set out five short reasons why I do not believe the House of Lords should be discarded in this way.First, the Daily Mail poll suggests that seven in ten voters believe there should be fewer peers than the current 780. I totally agree. That is why I set up a special committee under Terry Burns to propose how we could reduce it.They suggested an overall cap of 600 members, not to be exceeded, and limited terms of service for new peers. In a debate last December, the Lords itself endorsed that report. The process of reduction is now under way – and I should emphasise that this is being done without the benefit of Government legislation, but rather by peers themselves. The size of the House is now falling and will continue to fall.Second, it is ludicrously unjust to characterise peers as ‘dinosaurs in ermine’. We may have an older membership than the House of Commons but with age comes experience and we have acknowledged experts in virtually every area and a far greater level of expertise than any other senate I know of in the world.Parliament set to debate sweeping reforms of the House of...The dotty grandees are gone... peers are just bland blobs...Share this articleIn defence we have distinguished military leaders like Alan West, the former First Sea Lord, Richard Dannatt, the former Chief of the General Staff and Jock Stirrup from the RAF, who was also Chief of the Defence Staff. Or if we take health, we have figures like Robert Winston and Ara Darzi.In the law, we have former Lord Chief Justices like Igor Judge and John Thomas. Among the historians and broadcasters, we have Peter Hennessy, Joan Bakewell and Melvyn Bragg. For obvious reasons, the depth of knowledge here vastly exceeds anything available in the younger House of Commons.  \u0027With age comes experience and we have acknowledged experts in virtually every area. We have distinguished military leaders like Alan West, the former First Sea Lord, Richard Dannatt (left), the former Chief of the General Staff and Jock Stirrup from the RAF, who was also Chief of the Defence Staff. Or if we take health, we have figures like Robert Winston (right) and Ara Darzi\u0027Third, there has been criticism of the House for pressing amendments on the Brexit Bill, but this ignores the fact that the final decision on all these amendments rests with the Commons – the elected chamber. Our only power is to ask the Commons to consider again. It would be odd if this Bill – of profound importance – was the only Bill which escaped such scrutiny.It should be added that of the 201 amendments which were made to the Bill in the House of Lords, 178 of them were proposed by the Government, again underlining the importance of the Second Chamber in improving legislation.Fourth, the vast majority of peers are hardworking and honest. I in no way defend anyone who has been shown to abuse the allowances system. I will refer any substantive complaint to the Commissioner for Standards for independent investigation.As for the £305 allowance itself, you might remember that the many peers who live outside London require either a hotel room or lodgings for the night, and have to meet this expense and any secretarial expenses out of this flat allowance. Everyone who claims has to sign a declaration that they have undertaken genuine parliamentary work.Fifth, on the question of cost, the overall cost of the Lords is approximately £100million a year, compared with the Commons which is over £200million a year.Moreover, the annual cost of each member based on the average allowances claimed is £22,000 a year, less than a third of an MP’s salary, let alone their additional expenses.The Lords cannot simply be written off as enemies of the referendum or enemies of Brexit – there are many views in the House on those subjects as there are on a range of issues. I was in the House of Commons for over 30 years and I cannot recall ever hearing calls for its abolition on the grounds that members held views which were considered out of step.We are a strong enough parliamentary democracy to permit differences of view, honestly held – particularly with the safeguard that the final decision rests with elected MPs."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/24/01/4C920C9000000578-0-image-m-13_1527120175960.jpg","title":"Loophole allows Ofsted outstanding schools avoid inspections 10 years","story":"    Some outstanding schools have escaped Ofsted inspections for the past 10 years           The loophole has allowed 1,620 schools to avoid inspection for more than six yearsThe aim is to let high-flying schools concentrate on teaching without having to worry about inspections.But the NAO’s audit of Ofsted found that 1,620 schools had not been inspected for six years or more, including 296 which have gone without for more than a decade and a small number for up to 13 years.Now Ofsted itself wants an end to the exemption because it lets schools avoid inspection forever if they stay below the radar after an ‘outstanding’ rating.British family car that drives itself but won\u0027t cost the...Share this articleDirector of corporate strategy Luke Tryl said some schools may now have slipped to ‘middling’, adding: ‘We don’t think the exemption is sustainable. It is one of the biggest factors undermining confidence in the reliability of our judgements.’Ofsted is unable to close the loophole by itself and is lobbying for a change in the relevant law so inspectors would visit outstanding primaries every six years and secondaries every five to seven years.The NAO findings also raise the prospect of some ‘outstanding’ schools failing Ofsted’s new ‘British Values’ criteria.Under rules introduced after the ‘Trojan Horse’ Islamic extremism scare, all schools must teach gender equality, tolerance of gay people and respect for democracy.The report also found Ofsted was missing inspection targets amid high staff turnover and falling budgets – the watchdog spent 52 per cent less in real terms in 2017-18 than it did in 1999-2000.Ofsted says that at the turn of the millennium, a team of 16 to 17 inspectors would go into secondary schools for a whole week every six or seven years. Now a ‘good’ school gets two inspectors for one day every four years. One in ‘special measures’ gets four inspectors for two days with a re-inspection within 30 months.Mr Tryl said: ‘We’re at the limit of what we can do. We can’t pretend that we’re offering the same level of inspection.’"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/09/11/2B54273300000578-0-image-m-14_1525862369803.jpg","title":"German plot exclude Britain EU Galileo satellite programme","story":"    A German-backed clique of Brussels officials in the European Commission is fighting to exclude Britain from the Galileo satellite project A paper issued by the UK government voiced \u0027strong objections\u0027 to the behaviour of the EU over Galileo.It warned that cutting Britain out of the project would break the orce deal struck between Theresa May and Mr Juncker in December. UK taxpayers have contributed more than €1 billion to the budget of the scheme, about 12 per cent of the total.  \u0027The exclusion of these UK sunk costs was agreed on the basis that the UK would retain full access,\u0027 the paper said. \u0027Should the UK’s future access be restricted, the UK’s past contribution to the financing of space assets should be discussed.\u0027 David Davis warns the EU is risking lives by trying to block...British security firms could be BANNED from helping EU with...Share this articleThere are complaints that Mr Selmayr, the commission\u0027s top mandarin, and his allies could be acting beyond their remit, according to The Times.Mr Selmayr wrote to Sir Tim Barrow, Britain\u0027s ambassador to the EU, in April with the aim to end British involvement in Galileo without proper consultation.At the centre of the row, the Brussels clique wants to refuse Britain access to the codes that control the satellite system.This theoretically allows the EU to switch off the military component of the service at will, which some EU member states believed would create a security threat.\u0027It is not acceptable that security is sacrificed to a clique that wants to use Brexit as, what they call, a \u0027pedagogical exercise\u0027 in showing the benefits of EU membership and the cost of leaving,\u0027 one European diplomat said.\u0027Germany particularly is taken with this idea.

Playing nice: The demolition of the nuclear test site was seen as a  goodwill gesture by Kim Jong-Un ahead of a summit with the US, but that has since been called off          A North Korean airport official is seen guiding South Korean journalists upon their arrival at North Korea\u0027s Kalma airport in Wonsan yesterdayExperts are ided over whether the demolition will render the site useless. Skeptics say the facility has already outlived its usefulness with six successful nuclear tests in the bag and can be quickly rebuilt if needed.Jeffrey Lewis, of the Middlebury Institute of International Studies, also told Vice News that North Korea has two further tunnel complexes running into adjacent mountains that are undamaged from previous tests.North Korea also did not invite any independent observers, raising speculation that it was simply destroying evidence of its nuclear program with the blessing of the United States.This is also not the first time that North Korea has demolished one of its nuclear facilities without hampering the country\u0027s progress in building a nuclear bomb.In 2008, a cooling tower at the Yongbyon Nuclear Scientific Research Center was demolished in front of the eyes of the world\u0027s media.The tower was part of the complex that produced polonium used in the country\u0027s first nuclear test, and at the time was seen as a symbolic move toward disarmament.Youngbyon had ceased operating the year before after a series of complex negotiations between North Korea, China and the US.But it is believed North Korea only closed the site having enriched enough material for several nuclear tests, only to reopen it years later when it needed more.The country claimed to have restarted the site in 2015, and in 2016 the International Atomic Energy Agency agreed that the plant was probably operational.           In 2008 North Korea destroyed the cooling tower at Yongbyon, the facility where they were enriching plutonium for their nuclear program, only to reopen the site a few years later          The South Korean journalists are part of a contingency of foreign reporters who will have been witnessing the demolition of  the nuclear testing site at Punggye-riThe demolition comes amid reports that dictator Kim Jong Un will be hiding his nuclear arsenals in a mountainous region of North Korea to avoid satellites being able to detect them.  NK News reports that that the regime has designated Chagang Province a \u0027Special Military-first Revolutionary Zone\u0027.The region, which borders China, will reportedly be fortified and access restricted to ensure that Kim can hide its weapons and materials in tunnels beneath the mountains there.A high-level source told the news website: \u0027Nuclear weapons can be hidden anywhere, but the North Korean authorities have chosen, it seems, a place where even satellites will have difficulty locating them.\u0027 North Korea cancels historic summit with Trump after \u0027ignorant and stupid political dummy\u0027 Mike Pence compared the country to LibyaPresident Donald Trump called off his summit with Kim Jong-un on Thursday after North Korea hurled insults at Vice President Mike Pence.Trump said it would be \u0027inappropriate\u0027 to hold talks at this time after the Kim regime again tested the limits of his patience.\u0027You talk about your nuclear capabilities, but ours are so massive and powerful that I pray to God they will never be used,\u0027 he said in a letter to Kim that the White House distributed.North Korea\u0027s vice foreign minister had slammed Pence for his \u0027unbridled and impudent remarks that North Korea might end like Libya.\u0027Choe Son Hui also said the future of the summit between Pyongyang and Washington is \u0027entirely\u0027 up to the United States, as she condemned an interview Pence gave to Fox News.       North Korea has called Mike Pence \u0027ignorant and stupid\u0027 for comments he made comparing the state to Libya.

Playing nice: The demolition of the nuclear test site was seen as a  goodwill gesture by Kim Jong-Un ahead of a summit with the US, but that has since been called off          A North Korean airport official is seen guiding South Korean journalists upon their arrival at North Korea\u0027s Kalma airport in Wonsan yesterdayExperts are ided over whether the demolition will render the site useless. Skeptics say the facility has already outlived its usefulness with six successful nuclear tests in the bag and can be quickly rebuilt if needed.Jeffrey Lewis, of the Middlebury Institute of International Studies, also told Vice News that North Korea has two further tunnel complexes running into adjacent mountains that are undamaged from previous tests.North Korea also did not invite any independent observers, raising speculation that it was simply destroying evidence of its nuclear program with the blessing of the United States.This is also not the first time that North Korea has demolished one of its nuclear facilities without hampering the country\u0027s progress in building a nuclear bomb.In 2008, a cooling tower at the Yongbyon Nuclear Scientific Research Center was demolished in front of the eyes of the world\u0027s media.The tower was part of the complex that produced polonium used in the country\u0027s first nuclear test, and at the time was seen as a symbolic move toward disarmament.Youngbyon had ceased operating the year before after a series of complex negotiations between North Korea, China and the US.But it is believed North Korea only closed the site having enriched enough material for several nuclear tests, only to reopen it years later when it needed more.The country claimed to have restarted the site in 2015, and in 2016 the International Atomic Energy Agency agreed that the plant was probably operational.           In 2008 North Korea destroyed the cooling tower at Yongbyon, the facility where they were enriching plutonium for their nuclear program, only to reopen the site a few years later          The South Korean journalists are part of a contingency of foreign reporters who will have been witnessing the demolition of  the nuclear testing site at Punggye-riThe demolition comes amid reports that dictator Kim Jong Un will be hiding his nuclear arsenals in a mountainous region of North Korea to avoid satellites being able to detect them.  NK News reports that that the regime has designated Chagang Province a \u0027Special Military-first Revolutionary Zone\u0027.The region, which borders China, will reportedly be fortified and access restricted to ensure that Kim can hide its weapons and materials in tunnels beneath the mountains there.A high-level source told the news website: \u0027Nuclear weapons can be hidden anywhere, but the North Korean authorities have chosen, it seems, a place where even satellites will have difficulty locating them.\u0027 North Korea cancels historic summit with Trump after \u0027ignorant and stupid political dummy\u0027 Mike Pence compared the country to LibyaPresident Donald Trump called off his summit with Kim Jong-un on Thursday after North Korea hurled insults at Vice President Mike Pence.Trump said it would be \u0027inappropriate\u0027 to hold talks at this time after the Kim regime again tested the limits of his patience.\u0027You talk about your nuclear capabilities, but ours are so massive and powerful that I pray to God they will never be used,\u0027 he said in a letter to Kim that the White House distributed.North Korea\u0027s vice foreign minister had slammed Pence for his \u0027unbridled and impudent remarks that North Korea might end like Libya.\u0027Choe Son Hui also said the future of the summit between Pyongyang and Washington is \u0027entirely\u0027 up to the United States, as she condemned an interview Pence gave to Fox News.       North Korea has called Mike Pence \u0027ignorant and stupid\u0027 for comments he made comparing the state to Libya. The vice president is pictured on Wednesday in Connecticut Trump said in his letter to Kim that as a result of the \u0027tremendous anger and open hostility\u0027 demonstrated by North Korea in the latest back and forth, he was pulling out of the June 12 meeting to discuss Pyongyang\u0027s nuclear program.\u0027I feel it is inappropriate, at this time, to have this long-planned meeting,\u0027 Trump said. \u0027Therefore, please let this letter serve to represent that the Singapore summit, for the good of both parties, but to the detriment of the world, will not take place.\u0027            Choe Son Hui, North Korea\u0027s vice foreign minister, said: \u0027We will neither beg the U.S. for dialogue nor take the trouble to persuade them if they do not want to sit together with us\u0027The U.S. president went on to say that he hopes to meet Kim one day and that the good dialogue that was building up between the two nations prior to the recent provocations remains promising.Trump\u0027s letter to Kim followed a string of threats from the North to call off the summit that had been brokered to discuss a commitment to denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.The president told DailyMail.com on Wednesday that he\u0027d know whether he was moving forward with the Singapore summit \u0027next week.\u0027 That was before North Korea\u0027s latest volley, which included the assault on Pence.\u0027We will neither beg the U.S. for dialogue nor take the trouble to persuade them if they do not want to sit together with us,\u0027 said Choe Son Hui, according to a report by North Korea\u0027s central news agency on Thursday.She added: \u0027I cannot suppress my surprise at such ignorant and stupid remarks gushing out from the mouth of the US vice-president. \u0027We could surmise more than enough what a political dummy he is (Pence), as he is trying to compare the DPRK, a nuclear weapon state, to Libya that had simply installed a few items of equipment and fiddled around with them.\u0027Choe said she could suggest to leader Kim that he reconsider the summit, if the United States offends the North\u0027s good will.Pence was a focal point in the initial stages of diplomacy between the U.S. and North Korea.He attended the Opening Ceremony of the PyeongChang Olympic Games in February alongside Kim\u0027s sister, Kim Yo Jong. He did not talk to the North Korean emissary during the games, instead previewing during the trip another round of U.S. sanctions. Huge explosion at North Korea \u0027nuclear test site\u0027"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/24/10/4C95321C00000578-5766307-image-a-43_1527155749309.jpg","title":"Shocking moment car thief somersaults air EJECTED vehicle","story":"    See you on the flip side: The stolen car is launched into the air after it crashes on a residential street in Brazil          The car rolls and the passenger is thrown from the vehicle into the air before landing on the other side of a high fenceHe will be taken to give a statement to investigators when he is discharged, according to reports.The driver suffered only minor injuries and was arrested for receiving stolen goods, dangerous driving and disobedience.Ponta Grossa is the fourth most populous city in Parana with a population of over 310,000 inhabitants."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/24/12/4C94A9F900000578-5766395-image-a-9_1527160581722.jpg","title":"Out control driver dances sings sticks tongue shocked parents","story":"    Footage uploaded to social media shows the driver singing, dancing, sticking her tongue out and gesturing to music          The clip was recorded outside California Primary School in Falkirk, Scotland and shared by concerned parentsJanie Graham uploaded the clip to social media yesterday with the caption: \u0027This happened when the kids were walking back from school.\u0027This woman was screaming for them to get in the car then tried to run them over.

The bank said Thursday it would cut its workforce from 97,000 to “well below” 90,000 in order to achieve cost reduction targets. It said the reductions were already “underway.”A chief target of the cutbacks is its stocks trading business, mostly based in New York and London. Head count at the equities business is to be reduced by about 25 percent.Those cuts will cost the bank some 800 million euros ($935 million) this year.The announcement came just hours before Board Chairman Paul Achleitner had to face disgruntled investors at the bank’s annual shareholder meeting. The bank’s share price has sagged and it paid only a small idend of 11 euro cents per share last year.Achleitner drew rueful laughs from the assembled shareholders when he misspoke and said the idend was 11 euros per share, a mistake he quickly corrected.Deutsche Bank has struggled with high costs, subpar earnings and troubles with regulators. The bank replaced its CEO in April after three years of annual losses and lagging progress in streamlining its operations. New CEO Christian Sewing has said the investment banking business would refocus on its European and German customer base and cut back on costlier and riskier operations where it doesn’t hold a leading position. Sewing said the bank was committed to international investment banking but must “concentrate on what we truly do well.”The new strategy means stepping back from several decades of global expansion in which the bank sought to compete with Wall Street rivals such as Goldman Sachs or JPMorgan Chase.Sewing replaced John Cryan in April with a mandate to accelerate the bank’s wrenching restructuring. It has suffered billions in losses from fines and penalties related to past misconduct. But progress in cutting costs has remained elusive. Sewing on Thursday affirmed the bank’s goal to hold costs to 23 billion euros this year and 22 billion euros next year.Deutsche Bank lost €735m last year after U.S. tax changes cost it €1.4bn. Earnings in the first quarter of €120m were sharply down from the year-earlier quarter. Addressing an audience of several thousands in Frankfurt, Achleitner said Cryan had “set the ball rolling for fundamental change” but later displayed “shortcomings in decision-making and implementation.”“Dear shareholders, you are right to expect the bank and its management to hit the targets it has set itself,” he said.“If there are signs those targets are in jeopardy... then we on the supervisory board have to act swiftly and decisively.”The bank’s troubles and the turmoil surrounding Cryan’s departure have put pressure on Achleitner as well. Cryan was forced to publicly push back against a media report that Achleitner was looking for a replacement, then left to twist in the wind for days before being shown the door.Achleitner brought Cryan to the bank in 2015 and thus in principle shares responsibility for the bank’s strategy and performance since then.The selloff is gathering pace, as investors fret about the €800m cost of the job cuts plan (which will hit profits this year).The WSJ’s Paul J Davies isn’t impressed by today’s restructuring plan.Deutsche Bank is caught in a vicious spiral. It is losing profit-making staff, clients and investors and it desperately needs to restore confidence among all threeChristian Sewing, the bank’s new chief executive, didn’t mention anything at Thursday’s annual investor meeting that will stem these losses. More radical ideas are needed.Deutsche Bank are threatening legal action against anyone who has leaks details of its board meetings.That follows media stories in March about boardroom unrest, ahead of John Cryan’s ousting as CEO.Meanwhile, the AGM cranks on....Achleitner’s reward? Facing more criticism from shareholders, who say he should step down.The Wall Street Journal’s Jenny Strasburg has the details:Newsflash: The number of Americans signing on for unemployment benefits has hit a seven-week high.The initial claims total jumped to 234,000 last week, more than the 220,000 which economists had expected. The previous week’s figure has been revised up too, from 220,000 to 223,000.These are still low figures in historical terms, reflecting the long-running improvement in the US labor market in recent years.Klaus Nieding of shareholder lobby group DSW has urged Deutsche Bank’s management to speed up its recovery plan.“It is high-time to ... end the years-long and still-popular ‘Deutsche Bank bashing’ and get to work finally getting our bank back on its feet after six long years of restructuring.” Professor Brian Scott-Quinn, director of Banking Programmes at Henley Business School, suggests Deutsche Bank is trapped in a ‘spiral of decline’.Scott-Quinn says that Deutsche should accept that the game is up.“We really no longer need Deutsche Bank. There are already plenty of retail banks in Germany to provide competition and a good service to consumers. In investment banking it is the same as there are still good European investment banks which can provide a good service to German industry.It is almost impossible now to recover from years of mismanagement. At the same time, to attract the people they still need, they have to pay more than others where bonus prospects are much better. It is a spiral of decline and it started perhaps 20 years ago, even before the financial crisis. “Barclays, along with other European banks, are perfectly capable of meeting the needs of German industry for corporate and investment banking services. Deutsche might be better acknowledging that its days as a global champion and as a German regional champion are over and that sometimes banks reach the end of their lives.”It wouldn’t be easy to send Deutsche Bank shuffling off into retirement, of course. Apart from anything else, it has a famously huge exposure to derivative contracts -- estimated at €46 trillion in 2016 (the potential losses on the portfolio would be rather lower).Here’s a photo of Deutsche Bank’s new CEO, Christian Sewing, outlining his cost-cutting plans to shareholders:Deutsche Bank shareholders are voting on whether to allow Paul Achleitner to actually chair today’s AGM (a fairly crucial part of a chairman’s duties)....Deutsche Bank still haven’t revealed exactly how many jobs are being cut under the restructuring announced today.All we know is that the headcount is being reduced from 97,0000 to “well below’ 90,000. So that must be more than 7,000 jobs -- and could even be the 10,000 figure that was rumoured last night.Deutsche Bank would rather tell us that it will be serving 9,000 Frankfurter sausages to shareholders today, along with pretzels and slices of cake:Job cut announcements usually trigger a share price rally (investors usually ignore the grim implications for staff and celebrate the cost savings). Christian Sewing must be disappointed not to get a better reaction to his plan.One theory is that shareholders aren’t happy that the restructuring will cost €800m, making a dent in Deutsche’s profitability this year.Wild scenes at the AGM....It’s really kicking off at the Deutsche Bank AGM:Shame the bank won’t let us watch it remotely -- so much for CEO Sewing’s pledge to offer more clarity...."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f8fba307a2fb6471debb326968d456a45ad43655/0_389_2776_1665/master/2776.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b3896ee5ed61757e86eb244e118a2fb8","title":"tall stories the weird world of hong kong kowloon rooftops in pictures romain jacquet lagrez concrete stories","story":"From badminton to bonsai pruning to a precarious nap, it’s all going on high above the packed streets of Kowloon, Hong Kong.

I don’t remember seeing that on any big red busesI’m not a politician, I’m an entrepreneur. I don’t believe in false promises or rigid ideology. I believe in creating opportunities, good deals and looking out for the people who work for me.I campaigned passionately for the remain side during the Brexit referendum, because the opportunity to live, work, trade and travel anywhere in the EU with zero faff is such a good deal and creates brilliant life and business opportunities, and is especially valued by younger generations.And I knew that the politicians on the leave side were deliberately selling false promises. They told us we could have all the benefits of being an EU member without any of the perceived costs. That trade would remain totally frictionless even if we voted for Brexit. That Brexit would mean a bonfire of bureaucracy and red tape.They were selling a fantasy. As the whole Brexit debacle has developed, this fantasy is unravelling. We have had to concede on every single front: timelines, costs, process, regulation. Almost every day we learn about some new complication, some new risk, some previously hidden cost of exiting the best deal this country has ever had.The latest is the revelation from the chief executive of HMRC that the Brexiters’ preferred customs plan, the so-called “max-fac” solution based on technology, would cost British businesses between £17bn and 20bn a year. To put that into a context even Boris Johnson would understand, that’s a cost of around £350m a week. I don’t remember seeing that on the side of any big red buses.The basic reality is that many small- and medium-sized companies won’t be able to cope with these kinds of costs, and will simply go bankrupt. Jobs will be lost, supply chains will be disrupted, every sector of our economy will feel the impact. Inevitably, the extra costs will be passed on to consumers. A double hit: jobs down, prices up.The government’s other proposal, the “customs partnership”, is equally nonsensical. It has no precedent anywhere in the world, it relies on a level of trust between the UK and the EU that is in pretty short supply thanks to our recent actions, and it would still involve a bombshell of new bureaucracy for British businesses, as companies would need to track all their products to their final destinations and then send invoices to HMRC to claim back the difference between UK and EU tariffs.The irony of this endless debate over customs is that the EU has already rejected both of the government’s proposals, which makes the whole thing utterly futile. And let’s not forget, the single market and the customs union already exist to keep trade between the UK and the rest of Europe almost entirely frictionless, so we’re wasting a lot of time and money trying to solve a problem that has already been fixed.People like me, business people and entrepreneurs who just want to get on with building businesses and creating jobs, are perpetually stunned at the lack of certainty, the lack of planning, the recklessness with which the Brexiters in government are treating other people’s jobs and livelihoods. If a CEO was as disingenuous and disorganised as the main Brexiters, they’d have been thrown out of the boardroom months ago.We’ve seen our economy go from the fastest growing in the G7 before the referendum to the slowest growing in the developed world today. The value of the pound has collapsed, well-known companies have disappeared, and the Bank of England has calculated that real household income is now £900 lower than predicted before the referendum. The Brexiters are driving our country towards a cliff edge and trying to pretend the brakes don’t work, and that there’s nothing any of us can do about it.But of course there is something we can do about it. We can give the people a say. A people’s vote on the terms of Brexit is the right thing to do, and it’s the democratic thing to do as well. This isn’t about re-fighting the battles of 2016, this is about giving people the right to check that they are getting what they want.We’re sick of C-league politicians stitching up deals behind closed doors to save face, when the consequences will have an impact on everyone. We can’t allow the politicians to decide this for us. This Brexit deal is too big and important and affects all of us we, the people, have to have the final say. That’s why I’m calling for a people’s vote, so that the citizens of the UK can take back control of this process and decide if the Brexit on offer is in the best interests of the country. Whether you are a remainer or a leaver, it makes sense to have the power to affirm that the deal they negotiate is the one you want. Just like in any business negotiation, if the final terms aren’t what was originally promised, you have the right to say “no” and to think again about the future you want for our country.• Richard Reed is the co-founder of Innocent Drinks and a supporter of the People’s Vote campaign"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/85df33e09a8947ca4e407de56f57e208ccea8cc1/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=74451ed21908061ec75c8d6086712bd4","title":"miss britain brexitland brexit horror ex mayor ipswich netherlands","story":"When I moved back to the Netherlands this summer after six lovely years in Britain, I knew I was going to miss the place and that every now and then I would wonder if I had made the right decision. Everybody who voluntarily moves countries goes through this, and knows that these doubts can keep you awake all night.Except that this time it is really, really easy for us to be at peace with our decision to leave the United Kingdom. We simply go online and read a story like the one that broke yesterday: “Ex-mayor of Ipswich denied citizenship after almost 40 years in UK”. The reason: the Home Office “cannot be satisfied” that Inga Lockington, who moved from Denmark in 1979, is a permanent resident.No doubt the wave of publicity in this case will force the government into a U-turn. This government has made so many already it is a miracle that Theresa May isn’t permanently dizzy. But the underlying dynamic will not change, as the recent Windrush affair demonstrated all too well: this government is either incapable of, or unwilling to, treat citizens’ rights with respect, especially those who have their origins abroad.But worst of all, we could not be sure that we would even have qualified for that British passport – meaning total insecurity about the university fees for our children, and about their status when applying for jobs later in life. The same holds for our rights to social security and access to the NHS – if the NHS survives Brexit, that is.Such insecurity might last for years, if not decades, considering that almost two years after the referendum result the British government still does not even have a position on what it would like the country’s relationship with the EU to be. Given the Tories’ woeful ineptitude, deluded thinking and many deceitful statements, it is also becoming increasingly hard to see how the EU could take any British position on good faith. How to reach an agreement when you cannot trust the other side to uphold it? For EU citizens in Britain there is no certainty about when the insecurity about their status might be settled.Still, there are moments when I think that it was a mistake to move. London was such a great place to live, and our state school offered such excellent education. But then I remember just how many EU nationals have already left Britain, and how many are in advanced stages of leaving. The same is true of a number of British friends, who are fanning out across continental Europe.To kill any remaining longings for a return to the UK I then go online once more to browse the billionaire-owned Brexit press. This is my way of reminding myself just how psychopathically vile and mendacious most of the UK press still is. Once Britain begins to pay the full economic, political and diplomatic price for what it recklessly voted for in June 2016, the Brexit media will not throw up their hands and beg for forgiveness for all their lies, falsehoods and empty promises. Instead they will blame lots of British iniduals and institutions, but most of all they will direct their anger and hostility towards one place in particular: the EU.Do I want to expose my children to the tabloid propaganda about EU aggression towards poor Brexit Britain, and the way it will be pumped into the heads of millions of Brits – including some in the school playground?I still miss Britain every day.

However, last summer we saw normal levels of variation, including in those subjects that were reformed,” said Ofqual’s chief regulator, Sally Collier, in a letter to head teachers.“But it is still possible that some schools and colleges could see more variation than usual this year.”Last year students sat reformed GCSEs in English and maths for the first time, while this summer’s cohort are sitting a wider range of 20 reformed subjects.The familiar letter grades are being replaced by the numbers 9-1, with 9 representing the top previous A* grade and a 1 equating to a G. Instead of a C as the acknowledged grade for a good pass, the reformed GCSEs will award a 4 or 5, with the higher number regarded as a “strong pass”.Collier said that “broadly the same proportion of students” will achieve grade 7 and above as achieved grade A* and A in the old GCSEs, and a similar proportion will gain grade 4 and above as achieved grade C and above in 2017.The effects of the EBacc and the government’s measures of student progress may be responsible for lower entries in creative arts and technology subjects, along with schools’ cost-cutting efforts of more expensive subjects.Geoff Barton, the general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, which represents many secondary school heads, said the government’s decision to decouple AS-levels from A-levels had led to a steep decline in the numbers taking the exams, reducing the choice of subjects available to students.“The evidence is clear that the government’s reforms have led to reduced subject choice for students and a decline in creative arts and technology entries. Schools and colleges are doing their best to preserve a broad curriculum for their students despite performance measures and funding pressures,” Barton said.“We are pleased to see an increase in entries to GCSE German and Spanish this year, but we are concerned that the take-up of modern foreign languages at A-level has declined. It is clear that we need a national strategy to promote modern foreign languages and improve teacher supply in these very important subjects.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/869aa42328f74025a2f3969e972b6792f2345439/0_803_2801_1680/master/2801.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dc2a9aaba29da622ea2b0b2e903b8b8b","title":"birds had to relearn flight after meteor that wiped out dinosaurs","story":"Fossil records suggest only flightless birds survived when T rex was wiped off the EarthBirds had to rediscover flight after the meteor strike that killed off the dinosaurs, scientists say.The cataclysm 66m years ago not only wiped out Tyrannosaurus rex and ground-dwelling dinosaur species, but also flying birds, a detailed survey of the fossil record suggests.As forests burned around the world, the only birds to survive were flightless emu-like species that lived on the ground.“Looking at the fossil record, at plants and birds, there are multiple lines of evidence suggesting that the forest canopies collapsed,” said Regan Dunn, a member of the team from the Field Museum in Chicago, US. “Perching birds went extinct because there were no more perches.” The six to nine-mile-wide meteor struck the Earth off the coast of Mexico, releasing a million times more energy than the largest atomic bomb. Hot debris raining from the sky is thought to have triggered global wildfires immediately after the impact. It took hundreds or even thousands of years for the world’s forests of palms and pines to recover. Fossil records from New Zealand, Japan, Europe and North America, all show evidence of mass deforestation. They also reveal that birds surviving the end of the Cretaceous period had long sturdy legs made for living on the ground. They resembled emus and kiwis, said the researchers whose findings are reported in the journal Current Biology.“The ancestors of modern tree-dwelling birds did not move into the trees until the forests had recovered from the extinction-causing asteroid,” said Daniel Field, from the University of Bath and a co-author of the paper published in Current Biology.“Today, birds are the most erse and globally widespread group of terrestrial vertebrate animals – there are nearly 11,000 living species,” he added. “Only a handful of ancestral bird lineages succeeded in surviving the mass extinction event 66 million years ago, and all of today’s amazing living bird ersity can be traced to these ancient survivors.”The team are now focused on reconstructing the recovery of bird populations and how new species emerged and thrived in the ecological niche left by the extinction of dinosaurs."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/41becac81c7ad9eb78f96c40abc1a323a593620c/0_296_2800_1680/master/2800.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c64229c96f60bcd421e90dc140fd80e9","title":"following a pattern orla kielys life work goes on show","story":"A new exhibition charts the Irish designer’s three-decade trajectory Designer Orla Kiely’s Stem pattern may be one of the most recognised motifs of 21st-century fashion, but a new exhibition opening this week is set to shed light on the unsung elements of the designer’s archive. A Life in Pattern, opening in London on Saturday at the Fashion and Textiles Museum, is the first exhibition dedicated to the Dublin-born designer, whose breakthrough came in the mid 90s with her iconic laminated bags that featured a simplified plant print in bright and bold colours.“I hope that visitors will take away a sense that our type of print is much, much bigger than Stem and that the body of work is more than they ever imagined,” says Kiely, who has had a close hand in the curation of the exhibition. Cue hand-drawn blooms, abstract animal designs, playful plant shapes and geometric forms.Over the past 23 years, Kiely’s eponymous label has, of course, evolved into more than a bag and fashion brand. In fact, it is as recognised – if not more so – now for its interior design and homewares, all of which is celebrated in the retrospective. Homeware currently accounts for about half of the brand’s sales, with the iconic enamel plant pot recently going though the one million sales mark.Kiely worked with the textile historian Mary Schoeser and the museum’s head of exhibitions, Dennis Nothdruft, to play with scale in order to maximise the impact of her plant-based patterns. As such, giant oversized mannequins wearing bespoke dresses will be displayed beside their miniature counterparts and there will be “an immersive installation” where visitors will “be absorbed in the kaleidoscopic colours and rhythms” of Kiely’s design world. Her mood boards, methods and processes will also be explored in detail.The exhibition’s timing is apt, given the frequency at which the lifestyle and fashion industries increasingly collide. Now, it’s common place for a fashion designer to have a collaboration with an artist on the side, or a cushion to be sold alongside a coat, yet Kiely was one of the first to spread her net. Her early influences of Mary Quant, Biba and Betty Jackson growing up in Ireland and the inspiration she has mined from Danish design, cinema and photography since, have translated as effortlessly to what you’ll find in your wardrobe as they have the kitchen cupboard since day one.Kiely attributes this to finding the right balance between consistency (“We don’t really follow trends, we do what we like and what we feel is nice for the season, so we’re on our own journey”) and reinvention – the latter of which is most keenly felt on the fashion front.Kiely is about to release her fourth fashion collaboration with the stylist Leith Clarke, L’Orla, which has seen a new generation of fans flock to the brand, led by style influencers such as Alexa Chung, Keira Knightley and the Duchess of Cambridge.“We are always looking to inspire ourselves we don’t rest and think, ‘Oh, that was incredible last season, let’s just do another version of that’. We’re constantly building, recreating and working with people who are really inspirational,” says Kiely.“Somehow, our prints have an uplifting effect,” she says, “and make people smile.”Orla Kiely: A Life In Pattern is on at The Fashion and Textile Museum from Saturday 25 May to 23 September 2018."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6dc1cc7e8ff9251178916019c5614c629a70e275/0_309_4208_2526/master/4208.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=59183d9e7b27c6f5f8c5aa7850cd5811","title":"chicken decapitation battered cats hollywood animal cruelty","story":"The sight of a duckling having its foot prised off in Lars von Trier’s new film sent Cannes audiences scurrying. Why are we so willing to allow animals to suffer for our art?If I am not looking forward to Lars von Trier’s The House That Jack Built when it eventually comes to UK screens, it is not because of the violence against women and children that helped earn the film an early round of disgusted reviews. No, what really fills me with dread is the prospect of seeing a duckling having its leg torn off with pliers.Even after Peta weighed in to confirm that Von Trier didn’t really torture a duckling (the effect was achieved “using movie magic and silicone parts”), the idea leaves me feeling queasy. (Regardless, the film itself sent guests scurrying for the exit during its international premiere at Cannes earlier this month). Half a century of watching horror movies may have accustomed me to misogynistic violence on screen (which is not to say I enjoy it), but it hasn’t inured me to the mistreatment of animals.Had Von Trier really tortured that duckling, he would have been following in a long and dishonourable tradition of auteurs treating animals even more badly than they treat actresses. Andrei Tarkovsky had a horse shot in the neck and pushed down a flight of stairs in Andrei Rublev (1966). Jean-Luc Godard filmed a pig having its throat cut for Weekend (1967). Chickens were decapitated in Sam Peckinpah’s Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid (1973). Bernardo Bertolucci’s 1900 (1976) contains scenes of frogs being tortured and a terrified cat being strung up so that Donald Sutherland can crush it to death with his head. The director cuts away from the act (thank heaven) and I like to think Sutherland didn’t really kill the cat, but the Italians do have previous form in this regard. The writer Curzio Malaparte, in a 1943 essay about Mussolini, describes a traditional Tuscan holiday entertainment in which working-class men, hands tied behind their backs, would batter cats to death with their shaven heads.Francis Ford Coppola incorporated footage of a water buffalo being hacked to death in Apocalypse Now (1979). Béla Tarr’s Sátántangó (1994) shows a cat being manhandled Tarr insisted the cat wasn’t harmed, but clearly he wasn’t concerned about showing it being swung around by its forepaws. Between takes of Park Chan-Wook’s revenge thriller Oldboy (2003), the actor Choi Min-Sik, a “devout Buddhist”, was caught on film apologising to the live octopuses he was eating – which makes you think of Lewis Carroll’s Walrus, weeping for the oysters he is devouring.But then both films come trailing notoriety, having once been classed as “video nasties”. The extras on both re-releases include interviews in which the films’ respective directors awkwardly address the animal cruelty. Martino says: “In a way, it was a constructed scene because we put the monkey and python together, but we didn’t plan for that to be the ending … So it was really unpleasant to watch.”It is here that many cinephiles, including me, find ourselves faced with a dilemma. On the one hand, we are vehemently opposed to censorship. We are also aware that animals die every day to feed us, and we wear leather shoes. On the other hand, I would rather not watch scenes of animal cruelty, and if this makes me a hypocrite, so be it. It is upsetting enough watching a deer being swallowed by a python on one of David Attenborough’s nature specials, but Attenborough himself drew the line at reality-show contestants killing crocodiles, pigs and turkeys “just to get a shot”.Humans have been abusing animals for entertainment since the dawn of time, and film-makers haven’t shown themselves any more principled than bear-baiters or bullfighters. The otherwise admirable stunt pioneer Yakima Canutt invented a device called “The Running W”, which brought down galloping horses, often injuring or killing them in the process. At least 25 horses were killed or had to be put down during filming of The Charge of the Light Brigade (1936), so enraging Errol Flynn, the film’s star, that he attacked his director, Michael Curtiz. Such was the public outcry when a horse broke its spine after being ridden off a 70ft cliff during filming of Jesse James (1939) that American Humane (AH, the US equivalent of the RSPCA) was finally tasked with overseeing the treatment of animals on Hollywood sets.Even then, it seems AH’s trademarked seal of approval is no guarantee that “No animals were harmed”. While researching my book Cats on Film, I found claims that at least 20 cats died during the production of Koneko Monogatari (1986), a Japanese film about a ginger and white kitten and his pug pal, retitled by US distributors as The Adventures of Milo and Otis, with a voiceover by Dudley Moore. AH gave it a thumbs up, and the rumours have never been verified, but it is obvious when you watch the film that animals are frequently in distress. The BBFC cut 16 seconds from the film and gave it a U certificate, but outtakes of a cat “falling” off a cliff and desperately trying to scrabble out of the sea to safety are enough to make me never want to see it again.And here I am being hypocritical again, because while I balk at cruelty to kittens or ducklings, I can just about tolerate non-cuddly scorpions and ants being set on fire in The Wild Bunch (1969) or horrible reptiles hacked to bits in Cannibal Ferox. But hooray for CGI, which now makes any sort of real animal torture redundant. “Today, I’d film those scenes in a different way,” Lenzi admits in his interview on Cannibal Ferox’s Blu-Ray release. “I’d probably re-do it now with more help from the special FX department.”Anne Billson is the author of Cats on Film"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f437f77ccb7c019c65453823c4c73a0758674531/1_0_3023_1814/master/3023.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fe49be0620137fb2a0a11a8f3e88a1e6","title":"jurgen klopp liverpool champions league final real madrid","story":"Jürgen Klopp knew we had met before but, at Liverpool’s training ground last month, he could not recall the exact setting of our first interview. The answer made him groan. Five years ago this month in Dortmund, 10 days before the 2013 Champions League final at Wembley, Klopp had been in a sparkling mood. As he prepared to lead Borussia Dortmund against Bayern Munich in an all-German battle for European football’s greatest prize, he offered engaging insights into his managerial style while urging the neutral fan to support his team.“If you want the new story, the special story, it must be Dortmund,” Klopp said. “You have to be on our\u0026nbspside.” Five years on, with neutrals enraptured again as Klopp inspires an often thrilling Liverpool to Saturday’s Champions League final in Kiev against Real Madrid, his charisma was equally obvious. But before Klopp could engage with subjects ranging from football to politics he remembered how Dortmund had conceded the winning goal in the 89th minute against Bayern.“It was too painful,” he said softly. “I’ve cancelled pretty much everything around that game and never watched it back.” He shook his head and repeated one word.\u0026nbsp“Never.”In that moment it was possible to sense the depth of Klopp’s desire to win the Champions League. He might be the most likable of interviewees but this quest for success drives him. It hurts to have won only one of the six cup finals in which his teams have played. In 2012, in his first, Dortmund beat Bayern 5-2 in the German Cup. He has since lost five in a row. That curious statistic is less interesting than the way in which he galvanises his teams.I also interviewed Marco Reus in 2013 and the Dortmund forward responded simply when asked how Klopp helped the team. “He makes us happy,” Reus said.In a more layered way Andy Robertson, the Liverpool left-back who has been a revelation since Klopp signed him from Hull 11 months ago, told me last week how “the gaffer uses humour very cleverly. If he feels the lads are uptight or things aren’t going our way he’ll relieve the tension. He’ll crack a joke or you’ll hear his big laugh. He’s a fantastic manager who knows exactly what to do and when to do it. His personality is so good that when you see him on the touchline you just want to run for him. You want to tackle for him, you want to do well for him. But, most of all, he’s a calming influence.”Klopp’s calm in a one-to-one setting, even more than his humour or warmth, remains my clearest impression from our interviews. Rather than a joker or cheerleader, he is a bright thinker with an even deeper emotional intelligence which enables him to connect powerfully with people.“My biggest skill is common sense. It’s important they understand football is only one part of life. Coming into a Champions League final you tell them to appreciate this moment. Of course they are young and considered superstars. But in big moments they need help to find calm. It’s not important if you won or lost the last game, if you played well or kicked the ball like your grandmother. I need to help settle their heads and\u0026nbsphearts before such a massive match.”In Dortmund Klopp had smiled when hearing Reus’s quote about happiness. “What they discover when they leave the club is that we have a very special dressing room. The secret of a manager like Alex Ferguson comes through when you hear what former players say about him. They can have had boots flying in their face like David Beckham but they still love the idea they were coached by him. That’s the biggest honour or accolade you can give to a coach.“It’s important you have maximum respect for your players but remember you are the guy who is most responsible. As managers we all have rules and so there is no discussion with my players about how much we train … But in every other case they can come to me with a problem and if I have a solution I will help them. If I don’t know I bring in someone else to find an answer. On the pitch, it’s work. But football without fun is not great. If we don’t have some fun it would be strange. Are we not lucky guys? We are so silly when we get too worried about football. It’s not too serious and I\u0026nbspdon’t see the point of being at war with the team.”Liverpool’s defence might be their undoing in Kiev – but Klopp’s trademark lightning transitions and the breathtaking prowess of his front three mean he has a real chance of breaking his losing streak in cup finals. The unity and conviction that surged through Liverpool against Manchester City in the quarter-finals and at home against Roma in the semi-final seem rooted in the close bond he forges with his players.In both interviews he spoke about how, at Dortmund, he did not show his team videos of Barcelona scoring beautiful goals. Instead, he showed them “photographs of Messi and his team-mates celebrating every goal like it’s the first they’ve ever scored. I don’t use videos because I don’t copy Barça’s style. But you see them celebrate goal number 5,868 like they’ve never scored before. This is what you should always feel – until you die.”Such joy means there is heartache when Klopp loses players to richer clubs. He was only half-joking when he told me how: “We cried for 20 minutes, in each other’s arms, when Shinji Kagawa left Dortmund for Manchester United,” and how “it was like a heart attack” after Mario Götze agreed to join Bayern Munich.Since Philippe Coutinho left Liverpool in January for Barcelona, Klopp has been hugely impressive in improving the team without their former star player. Tactical acumen, astute signings and Klopp’s enduring motivational powers mean Coutinho has hardly been missed.Klopp’s seemingly magical touch is felt throughout the club. It was instructive last month to see the warmth of his interaction with the tea lady and to hear snippets from Liverpool staff. One of them told me how Klopp might be the first person on the dance floor at a club function but, as soon as everyone joins in, he retreats discreetly to watch with beaming pride.His charm works and, in Dortmund, he convinced me “this is a very special club – a workers’ club” as he railed, wittily, against Bayern’s economic powerhouse. Of course he would have laughed at the irony that, when the interview ran in the , we had to feature this tagline: “Jürgen Klopp is proud to wear Puma – a partner of Borussia Dortmund.” There was no sponsor involvement when I met Klopp in Liverpool and his pleasure in football and life echoed again. “How can you not love this club, this city, these players?” he asked.Five years ago Klopp said: “I got more in life than I was ever supposed to get – family, money, football. None of my teachers, or my parents, ever believed this would happen to me. So how can this perfect life be spoilt because they take our players?”Life is never perfect, in Dortmund or Liverpool, and Klopp knows that glory in a Champions League final can be painfully elusive. But, whether Liverpool win or lose in Kiev, he will be back for another crack next season – while making his players happy as, yet again, they run and tackle and try their hearts out\u0026nbspfor him."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cbae9f324d7a761ce44e173555797b300bb1ca58/0_104_2528_1516/master/2528.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=697acc61e759cc28ddfb01f087f2def2","title":"manchester united fred milinkovic savic baulk fee","story":"• United hope to finalise deal with Shakhtar Donetsk • Lazio asking price for Milinkovic-Savic is €100mManchester United are closing in on the signing of the Brazil midfielder Fred from Shakhtar Donetsk for €50m (£43.7m) but an attempt to add Sergej Milinkovic‑Savic to José Mourinho’s squad has been put on hold for now after Lazio set the 23-year-old’s asking price at €100m (£87.4m).United are in advanced talks with the Ukrainian club and representatives of Fred, who had also interested Manchester City as a potential long-term replacement for Fernandinho, and hope to finalise a deal in the coming days.

It could be very entertaining for the fans, but perhaps not for the coaches. Real Madrid are a team who are a little anarchic. They don’t have a permanent shape: although they will play with four at the back and with Casemiro, Toni Kroos and Luka Modric in the middle, the way they set up from there can change. Cristiano Ronaldo may be through the middle or wider and much depends on his role. If he and Karim Benzema play, it tends to be 4-4-2 but Gareth Bale could start, andor Isco, Lucas Vázquez or Marco Asensio. All mean different things for the shape.That anarchic nature is more a general point, though. Madrid’s players are carried along by the football itself, what they feel in each moment they’re not guided by tactical rigour or a specific structure. What defines Madrid is their inidual ability, how they associate with each other intuitively. Look at players like Benzema, who drifts to the wings and combines, or the full-backs, Marcelo and Dani Carvajal: when Carvajal goes up he doesn’t look to see if the other full-back is deep and that open approach often compromises them defensively.In the middle there’s more control. Liverpool could try to pressure Modric to deny them that, but he has so much ability to carry the ball, overcome difficulties, find passes. His play depends more on team-mates offering options than on the opposition. He and Kroos understand each other well, their positioning and passing is excellent. With Casemiro, they are the only players who maintain a certain order. I’ve very rarely seen Modric lose the ball – he always makes the right decision.Madrid’s anarchy can make planning difficult: they’re unpredictable. But if you can be defensively sound and use the ball well, making the most of the space they leave, you can do them damage. We’ve seen throughout the season that Madrid concede a lot of chances. And if you can keep the ball, you can reduce their opportunities.We won 1-0 at the Bernabéu but we had much more difficulty then than in the second game, which we lost 5-3. At the Bernabéu we scored in the last minute. We’d been under pressure, although it’s also true that we’d tried to keep possession. We wanted the players to stay calm: have faith, choose passes well, be intelligent, keep it, make them run. We knew that chances would come. And although we had to resist, although the tiredness meant we were sometimes less precise than we wanted, that was what happened.At the Benito Villamarín we controlled practically the whole game, except for 15 minutes in the second half when they were superior, scored and turned it round. You can’t do anything about the ability Madrid have when they get the ball, combine and attack: they have extraordinary players, capable of creating danger or scoring easily. We talked to the players about the need to keep the ball. Because Madrid’s forwards don’t always press, that facilitated prolonged possession. And if you keep the ball, even if you’re not going to generate much with it, you can take control.That was how we set it up and that was the way it worked ... except that we lost. And that’s the thing. We were 2-1 up at half-time, and should have been further ahead, but they scored three from the 50th minute to the 65th we then made it 3-4 with five minutes left but they scored again in the 92nd. This is the issue: Madrid have 15 minutes and it’s the perfect storm. There will always be moments when you lose the ball – that’s unavoidable. Against some teams the repercussions aren’t serious. But if Modric gets it, he delivers a wonderful pass ... if Bale gets it, with the speed he has ... if Cristiano reaches a cross or produces a move ... you know they can hurt you, and that was exactly what happened. We had the game perfectly controlled, but you need lots of chances to score they need far fewer.Up front Liverpool have extraordinary players. It’s true that their capacity to defend is weaker but they can hurt Madrid because they have fast, intelligent footballers. When Madrid attack they lose shape and Liverpool can harm them. But, of course, Madrid can do Liverpool damage too. These two are better going forward than going backwards.That said, it’s important to make a point here: in big, important games Madrid tend to be much more rigorous defensively, they’re not as mad they don’t play with that sense of superiority, as if they know they’ll win. And if they are more solid, Liverpool will struggle more – just as Madrid will struggle to generate opportunities if Liverpool tighten up. But teams don’t change overnight. It’s unlikely Marcelo or Carvajal will stop going forward, that Cristiano, Benzema or Modric will change. Even if you tell them to defend permanently, they won’t. And Liverpool are similar. You’re not going to tell them to just defend. It could be very entertaining.Interview by Sid Lowe"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1526fa6de584e9c28a53e4d5398880b4c49f491c/0_43_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=436084e04b097a960c76e68e9287234f","title":"unai emery unveiled englands new captain and liverpools big final football weekly extra","story":"Max Rushden and co discuss new managers, a new England captain and Liverpool’s shot at Champions League glory "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/002f9591534a53925202d97fece8af92d54af82a/0_10_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0e53a1d23adb00183ef811205ad29d4c","title":"wolfsburg women v lyon feminin womens champions league final live","story":"I know what you’re wondering – what’s on the flipchart? Well, apparently Lyon are looking for “echauffement” and “vivacité”. And they’re also planning to play three five-a-side teams, which seems tactically puzzling.Uefa have made the players stay at home by making large versions of their club badges and sticking them on the dressing-room floor. I can’t for the life of me see why. The team sheets are in, and look like this:Music news: If you’re in need of a soundtrack for the hour between now and kick-off, Wolfsburg’s Tessa Wullaert has handily put together a Spotify playlist.It’s the week’s first Champions League final, between Lyon – who won their first two of four ties on their way to this showpiece by an aggregate score of 30-0, that’s thirty goals to none, and their last two by a more demure 4-1 – and Wolfsburg, whose four ties have been won by the rambunctious combined scoreline of 33-7.So, you may be wondering, just how good are these teams? Well, Lyon have won the last two Champions League titles, beating Wolfsburg (on penalties) in the 2016 final, and four of the last seven. Wolfsburg have won two of the remaining three, beating Lyon 1-0 in the 2013 final. The midfielder Lara Dickenmann was in both the Wolfsburg side that lost to Lyon and the Lyon side that lost to Wolfsburg, and is expected to be in the Germans’ starting line-up today.Wolfsburg have already won their domestic title, following up on the one they won last year Lyon have already won their domestic title, following up on the ones they one last year, and the year before that, and for each of the last 12 – twelve – seasons. Wolfsburg have scored 2.75 goals per league game this season, and conceded 0.3 Lyon’s average league game has ended in a 4.666-0.24 victory.A few more Lyon goalscoring facts, because they are so ridiculous: Their top scorer, Ada Hegerberg, has thumped in 51 goals in 30 games this season. Lyon will play Paris St-Germain in the French Cup final on 31 May, having won the five games in their cup run by a combined score of 56-0. Fifty-six goals to nil. Between 24 September and 5 February they won 16 consecutive games in all competitions without conceding a goal (aggregate score: 102-0).Both teams are, in short, extraordinarily good and used to handing out gleeful thumpings. What they are not used to, however, is facing teams quite as good as each other.Britwatch: Chelsea and Manchester City were both beaten in the semi-finals but there are still a couple of Englishwomen to keep an eye on. Lucy Bronze, once of City and now of Lyon, scored the goal that eliminated her former club in the last round, and the assistant referee Sian Massey will be running a line. Useful officiating fact: the referee, Jana Adamkova, played for the Czech Republic in her pre-whistle-blowing days."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3dd7722f85def4e3f18a542dc683a68f90cc2255/0_0_3598_2160/master/3598.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d578db01843dcae3c38b2d0b3e0577f8","title":"detroit become human review","story":"Playstation 4 Quantic DreamSonyThe human v android setup is hackneyed, but this choose-your-own-adventure-style descent into a near-future Detroit is served up with spellbinding artistryWith a gargantuan 4,000-page script, it is a near-miracle that Detroit: Become Human manages to tell a single coherent story at all. Yet this choose-your-own-adventure-style video game, in which humans live alongside an oppressed android workforce, has hundreds of potential storylines. Gradual, ever-developing and interwoven tales lead towards a myriad of endings. So vast is the scope of this mammoth work of interactive fiction that each person who plays it may have a close to unique experience. Indeed, the way that the story bends and morphs around the player is much more interesting than the story itself.Decisions have weight: do you pursue a rogue android across a busy highway, or let it escape? Do you choose to go against an android character’s programming, or comply with its human masters? Main characters can perish, cutting off their narrative completely. Whole scenes – hours of play – can be missed because of a single, seemingly insignificant decision. The variety of choices, and where they lead, is staggering. Detroit: Beyond Human opens up the bonnet, allowing players to see their path through the game on a branching tree diagram, and return later to direct their characters towards a different fate. Once the credits rolled, I could look back at what I had missed I doubt I had even experienced a fifth of this intertwined, spider-webbing multiverse the first time around.You play as three androids. Kara, or AX400, is a subservient housekeeper at the mercy of an abusive owner. Markus has a deep love for his ailing artist “owner”, but whether that translates into sympathy for humankind is your decision to make. The most intriguing character is Connor, as his stake in the inevitable human-android class war is less clear-cut. This robot detective is a professional traitor, programmed to hunt rogue androids who kill or harm humans, often taking him to dingy, Se7en-esque homicide crime scenes.These androids have to work out how (or whether) to free themselves in a human-run society that treats them with fear and hostility.Players are promised the ability to co-write these stories, but too often you feel trapped on train-tracks, able to pull levers to go down different routes, but unable to jump off altogether. In a game that forces you to consider free will at every turn, I repeatedly came to the conclusion that mine was limited. Adding to that frustration, hefty choices can be made almost by accident. In dialogue, you are regularly presented with four one-word reply options and what you choose decides fundamental aspects of your characters, such whether they are cold-hearted killers or inspiring leaders. While this adds gravity to your decisions, it can leave you feeling out of control. In my first playthrough, I ended up pushing all three characters into situations I did not intend to.Although stories are branching, all are wrapped around a central theme of inevitable android-human conflict, a somewhat overdone subject. Adding to unoriginality of the main plot and are some eye-rolling tropes, with forced references to race and class inserted for dramatic effect. Androids, for example, have to sit at the back of a bus. And one story strand pulls up disturbing parallels with history that many will find unnecessarily distressing. At one point, I genuinely encountered the line, “But who’s the real monster here?”Luckily, top-rate actors including Lance Henriksen, who already played an android in the Alien franchise (though this time he is human), carry each scene. And four years of meticulous motion capture and exacting cinematography is where Detroit: Become Human feels like a revolutionary achievement for video games.Countless late nights have gone into the levels, which are better described as film sets. Each room and prop is unique. Skin has pores, and drops splatter the faces of androids, which eerily don’t react. Tiles on a mouldy ceiling in a motel are inidually made. Fibres are visible in the upholstery of a piano stool. Office buildings have defibrillators. I spent a full five minutes admiring the details of a robot vacuum cleaner.Lighting is some of the most atmospheric in any game, and cameras do not merely hover but are directed continuously like a movie, with different filming styles to fit each of the three characters. Though it sells itself as an unrestricted story, some of Detroit’s best parts are the most tightly directed scenes. At one point, you can hack an android receptionist to bypass security. But if you run off to continue to the mission, you won’t see her eyes dart around the room in bewilderment as she visibly attempts to grapple with what just happened. The sum of these tiny touches is a credible future world, carried along by an impressive orchestral score.Detroit: Become Human is a spectacularly crafted game that bends and branches out around the player’s choices in an astonishing and unparalleled way. Although hampered by tired central plots and some predictable, occasionally hokey storytelling, the result is a technical feat in video game development and a meticulously detailed cinematic achievement."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/733ddd3872310a02ebc689d88a3a1919a3154f23/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5d87207ed84a0644f96bf66adc3dddfb","title":"sharent trap should parents put their children on social media instagram","story":"It’s more and more usual for people to share pictures of their children online – and some have even turned it into a lucrative business. Is it always wrong to mix kids and social media?Follow some bloggers or Instagram stars and you will know more about their children than you do about the children of your closest friends and relatives. You will see them sleeping or having tantrums in their swimsuits in paddling pools or having their nappies changed. You will see their mealtimes, their holidays and what they looked like on Christmas morning. You may have seen them in the minutes after they were born, umbilical cord still attached, and perhaps even before they embarked on this childhood of unwitting digital documentation, in a fuzzy black-and-white ultrasound picture. The ethics of this – publishing photographs of one’s children to build a social media following, and then monetising it – have always been shady, but the issue has been amplified this week.On Mumsnet over the past few months, there have been active threads criticising parenting bloggers or “influencers” – that euphemism for advertisers – mainly about the transparency of sponsored posts and advertising content, but also about the perceived exploitation of their children. The account of one Instagram-user, Clemmie Hooper, was taken down this week and though it is unclear who took it down and why – there were allegations of abusive comments under a post – she has in the past attracted criticism for the use of her children. Hooper’s account, Mother of Daughters, had nearly 470,000 followers and documented life with her four girls. The account of her husband, Simon Hooper, who runs Father of Daughters for his 845,000 followers, is still running – and his posts almost always feature one or more of his daughters. The couple have been singled out this week – neither would comment for this piece – but they are far from the only ones.So is sharing pictures online of our children something we should be worrying about? “In an age of visibility, it is important that parents discuss the pros and cons of sharing with their children, even when quite young,” says Sonia Livingstone, professor of social psychology in the department of media and communications at the LSE, and one of the project’s researchers. “We interviewed several families where even small children wished their parents would share fewer photos, and consult them more. We observed in a few families that children are even learning to tell their parents to stop. But insofar as this sharing is to bring families together, even when geographically dispersed, there are also advantages, and children appreciate those, too. It’s a matter of respect and consent, and protecting that is important, more than the actual fact of sharing itself.”Are generations of children now growing up without privacy? “I don’t think so,” she says. “The conditions of their privacy are changing, partly because of their own actions, partly others’. What will matter to children is to feel they have agency, respect and dignity – that’s at the heart of privacy. So anyone sharing or using their images should prioritise this.”Genevieve von Lob, clinical psychologist and author of Five Deep Breaths: The Power of Mindful Parenting, says: “More and more parents are questioning the wisdom of posting so much about their kids online. The pictures that are uploaded can form a permanent digital tattoo. Because it’s all so new for parents, we need to start thinking about asking children’s permission to post online.”If you think about how children are being profiled on the basis of social media images, there is a real riskMost children won’t have the finances to bring a court case, “and a child is normally not considered to have the capacity to bring legal proceedings themselves”. And the implications of such a case on family relationships could be disastrous. Bessant prefers the idea of educating parents and children “so there can be a dialogue at an earlier age. I’ve done research talking to parents about how they share information and what they think privacy is and there are a number of parents who said that once their children start to say, ‘I don’t want those photographs out there’, they would be quite willing to either not post at all, or only post once they have spoken to their kids.”Veronica Barassi, a media and communications lecturer at Goldsmith’s, University of London who is leading the Child Data Citizen research project, says “there is a moral panic” about sharing pictures online. However, she admits there are dangers. “If you think about big data and how children are being profiled on the basis of social media images, there is a real risk. I’m particularly interested in things like facial recognition: the way in which that data is sold, and the lack of transparency, is the most worrying aspect of so-called sharenting.”It’s important that parents consider the long-term implications for their child of having a highly visible digital footprintWhat, then, should parents do? Those setting out with the intention of making themselves and their children famous are one thing. “It’s important that parents consider carefully the long-term implications for their child of having a highly visible and widely shared digital footprint,” says Livingstone. “In our interviews with parent bloggers, we found they were becoming more conscious of this, and often taking care only to present their child in a positive light. Of course, it’s possible that this too could be problematic, creating an ideal self that the child must live up to.”As for the rest of us, who have no intention of using photographs of our toddlers to advertise a nappy brand but are still exposing them online, consent is key and “can begin very early,” she says. “Perhaps sharing should be kept to a minimum early on. Sharing photos with a handful of friends and family is one thing. Sharing on public sites is quite another, and I’m not sure parents should do that at all.”Much of it is common sense, says Bex Lewis, senior lecturer in digital marketing at Manchester politan University and author of Raising Children in a Digital Age. “Try not to put their school uniform in, try not to show that you have a regular pattern every day.” Most parents, you would hope, wouldn’t post pictures of their children naked but there are other things parents should perhaps think twice about. It is probably not fair, she says, to show pictures of a child having a meltdown, “although those are quite funny to watch”. Turn off geotagging, which tells internet users where you are, and lock down your privacy settings. Even then, “there is always a chance someone could screenshot the pictures, but someone could take a picture of your child in the park, and if you thought like that you’d never go anywhere. Keep the child involved in the conversation from an early age. The digital world is an everyday part of our lives now. It’s still evolving, so I’m not sure there are any fixed rules, but having a bit of thought about what you are posting and where you’re posting it is the critical thing.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9dd329c2b580a2058b297832875f2845938a2fb8/0_0_3543_2126/master/3543.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8668e145c0935cfbbe144ea2835fd675","title":"lenny kravitz on 30 years in music people take your kindness for weakness","story":"The soulful rock star picks his favourite songs from his back catalogue – from those trying to win his wife back, to those reflecting on his mother’s death‘What’s wrong with people?” Lenny Kravitz wonders, when asked about the bad reviews he has had. “They talk shit: that’s OK.” The 53-year-old, whose success in soulful, funk-laced rock’n’roll has earned 40m album sales and four Grammys, is in a hangar at Charles de Gaulle airport in Paris, strutting in alligator boots to the sound of his band riffing Always on the Run. Today, he splits his time between the French capital and the Bahamas. You can see why the bad reviews don’t hurt. “This has been my city since I got here in ’89,” he says. “In the 90s, I had a French girlfriend here. You know Vanessa Paradis?”Kravitz has always existed centrally in the Venn diagram of music, fashion and celebrity, but is laying low here while preparing a tour for his forthcoming 11th album, Raise Vibration (he plays Manchester, Birmingham and London in June). Building a set list is easy, he says, but selecting his defining tracks is not. “I’m not good at favourites,” he says behind yellow shades. “They all have an origin. And sometimes you look back and think: ‘Ugh, I was pretty goofy there.’”Even as a toddler, Kravitz was musical. He would bang on utensils in the kitchen and learned to play piano, guitar and drums while growing up in New York City. His family relocated to Los Angeles when his mother, Roxie Roker, landed a role in the sitcom The Jeffersons. He graduated straight from Beverly Hills high school to life as a session musician. “I was the guy you hired to make your demos,” he says. “I did whatever I had to do to survive.”For a music lover as passionate as Kravitz, it is apt that his development came supporting three greats on the road: Tom Petty, Bob Dylan and David Bowie. The latter he opened for at Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles on his birthday. “I was green,” he smiles. Dylan called him out to play Maggie’s Farm one night, too. “I was scared shitless. I didn’t know the words.” After a headline tour of his own, he co-wrote the 1990 single Justify My Love for Madonna – his first No 1. The video was banned, a songwriting lawsuit over the lyrics ensued – poet-actor Ingrid Chavez was later added to the credits – and rumours flew that he was having an affair with the pop queen. “There was no affair,” Kravitz insists. Bonet and Kravitz’s relationship was already on the rocks, with an amicable orce completed in 1993. “I was in not just a depression, but a fog. I didn’t know which way was up.”Still living in Broome Street, Kravitz wrote his second album, Mama Said. The single It Ain’t Over …, though, came to him in an LA hotel room on a Fender Rhodes piano he had had delivered. “I was trying to get my wife back with that song.” Returning to New York, he turned the album in, but wanted to keep this track off it. “I said: ‘I’m not putting that song on ’cos it’s a hit.’ I wanted to stay underground and give it to Smokey Robinson.”Eventually, he was talked round. The song’s smooth funk highlighted his Motown schooling and featured sitar and horns from Earth, Wind \u0026amp Fire’s own Phenix Horns. It reached No 2 in the US chart. “That was the first time I’d walk the streets in New York hearing my song come out of people’s cars. The video was everywhere. I had to stop taking the subway. It fucked up my commute.”With his life changing beyond recognition, Kravitz was working on Paradis’s album and his own follow-up. Are You Gonna Go My Way? – the title track – is a straight-up rock anthem, laced-in licks and raucous vocals. It would become his biggest smash, and an ubiquitous 90s soundtrack. “It won’t go away,” he says. Back then, Kravitz had no idea of its potential. “It was Chinese compared with what was on the radio. Foreign!”The riff came as he and guitarist Craig Ross were mucking about while Paradis was en route to her session. “I couldn’t be disrespecting her time while I was fucking around with my music. So we cut it in five minutes. Boom.” Not knowing what to do with it, he listened to the riff on repeat. “I grabbed a brown paper bag, wrote the lyrics and sung it the next day. I knew it was cool. But a hit song? Forget it.”The song is written from the perspective of another rock star. “I was writing about Jesus Christ,” says Kravitz, repeating the lyrics: “I was born long ago  I am the chosen  I’m the one.” The video of Kravitz flinging his dreads around on the stage was directed by the acclaimed film-maker Mark Romanek Spike Jonze, then an unknown, was the photographer. “The guys who put that shit together were all geniuses,” he says. Kravitz’s drummer, Cindy Blackman, had also just been hired. “I threw that afro wig on her. Wow. Spectacular! The visual, the song, the time. It was a perfect storm.”While Kravitz’s dreams were coming true, his mother had been diagnosed with cancer and she died in 1995. His experimental fourth album, Circus, was consumed by celebrity-related woes. “My life was all over the place,” he says. “Your mother leaves the planet, you’re dealing with these newfound trappings of fame. I had to change my personality. I’m an open person: unity, peace and love! But people take your kindness for weakness.”The song is a heart-rending ballad to a girl he was dating. He dreamed it while staying at New York’s Royalton hotel given its hues, the working title was The Country Song. “That’s the first time that kind of sound came out,” he says. The album was also his first experience with computer-programmed production. “I was using it as a spice.” It gave him his first Top 10 LP in the US, and a No 5 in the UK. But his mother’s death deeply affected him, and it wasn’t until his fifth record – 5 – that he would be ready to dedicate a song to her.In the late 90s, Kravitz was riding high on more belters: Fly Away, I Belong to You and his cover of American Woman, which featured on the soundtrack of Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me. Thinking of You was a slinky grooving highlight on 5 and something of an answer to Always on the Run, his 1991 signature theme, that began: “My mama said that your life is a gift.”He reflects on that connection. “My mum had great expectations for me,” he says. “Success was about being a quality person, having integrity.” At the age of 33, he took a good look at himself. Had he kept his head amid his period of superstardom? “I was always on the run,” he says. “I didn’t have time, I was crazy. Now I was asking: OK who am I? Am I my mother’s son?” On a superficial level, he changed his look, shedding the dreads. That was Bonet’s doing. “I went up to her house in Topanga. She said: ‘You need to cut your hair – it’s time for a change of energy.’ Then she pulled out the razor blade.”In the 10 years after 5, Kravitz released the mainstream Lenny and the funk-oriented Baptism, one of his weakest. Relentless in his music-making, he would return with his best-reviewed album in years: It’s Time for a Love Revolution. Kravitz had a new studio at the Edison hotel in Times Square. By “studio”, he means a full-sized ballroom. “That was a good time,” he smiles. “That song has one of my best bridges.”Based around a piano melody, it is a sombre rumination on unrequited love, to this day one of his most steadfast crowd-pleasers. “There’s always somebody waiting for somebody else to get their shit together,” he says.On the night of Barack Obama’s first election win, Kravitz was in “some cold-ass city” in Canada. For his ninth album, Black and White America, Kravitz responded, with politically minded classic R\u0026ampB. The cover features him as a young boy, the child of an interracial couple who got together during the civil rights movement. Push is a Beatles-esque, horns-driven number about positivity in spite of hardship, inspired by his family’s struggles for acceptance. “I was in shock that I had lived to see an African American president. I never thought I’d see that. Never.”Elsewhere, the record is politicised. It’s Enough – a Curtis Mayfield-esque groove about the Middle East, environmentalism and war – was originally a Ramones-y punk track. His daughter Zoë heard it and told him it wasn’t working. “She was right. I made it smooth, whispered. It made it more powerful.” For Kravitz, still the flower child, it’s a call to action to get people looking for change. That’s what concerns him the most, not the jokes about the giant scarf he was memorably papped wearing in 2012, or the time the crotch of his trousers split on stage, or those snooty critics he has so little time for. “As my grandmother Bessie used to say: ‘You wanna know me? Come live with me.’”Lenny Kravitz plays O2 Apollo, Manchester, on 19 June Arena Birmingham, on 20 June and SSE Wembley Arena, London, on 22 June.

He spoke out following reports on Thursday that unionists remain suspicious that Corbyn supports the unification of Ireland and retains sympathies for Sinn Féin and other republicans.The Irish border issue is one of the most problematic aspects of the Brexit negotiations, with ministers trying to find a way of avoiding checks on the UK’s only land border with the EU. Inside the EU, both Ireland and Northern Ireland are part of the single market and customs union so share the same regulations and standards, allowing a soft or invisible border between the two.Britain’s exit from the EU – taking Northern Ireland with it – risks a return to a hard or policed border. The only way to avoid this post-Brexit is for regulations on both sides to remain more or less the same in key areas including food, animal welfare, medicines and product safety.Early drafts of the agreement Britain hoped to get signed off on Monday said there would be “no ergence” from EU rules that “support north-south cooperation”, later changed to “continued alignment” in a formulation that appeared to allow for subtle ergences.But it raised new questions about who would oversee it and how disputes might be resolved. It was also clearly still a step too far for the DUP.Addressing students and staff at Queen’s University, Corbyn was asked if he would advocate a poll on whether the border should continue to exist between Ireland and Northern Ireland. He replied: “That would be a decision that could be made within the terms of the Good Friday agreement. “If that is the wish, then clearly such a poll would happen. I’m not asking for it, I’m not advocating it. What I’m asking for is a return to the fullness of the Good Friday agreement which would open up the opportunities and possibilities for the future of Ireland as a whole.“That is the point of the Good Friday agreement – not direct rule, not imposition of a political view from Westminster – but devolution of powers to Stormont here and of course the relationship with the Republic. “It is quite clear that it’s there for a poll on both sides of the border, should that be something that is demanded,” he said. While the Northern Ireland secretary, Karen Bradley, has rejected calls for a border poll, unionists such as the MP Lady Sylvia Hermon have voiced concern that the UK’s decision to withdraw from the EU will “change everything” and will result in a border poll. Corbyn also claimed there was a majority in the House of Commons for Labour’s Brexit plans. ‘Opposition to the idea of bringing back a hard border to this land isn’t just about avoiding paperwork or tariffs, important though that is, it’s about deep-rooted cultural and community ties. An open border is a symbol of peace, two communities living and working together after years of conflict, communities who no longer feel that their traditions are under threat.”Corbyn had been invited to give a lecture in Belfast to mark 20 years since the signing of the Good Friday peace agreement. He urged Stormont leaders and the UK and Irish governments to renew efforts to restore power-sharing at crisis-hit institutions in Belfast, insisting peace cannot be taken for granted. “As we stand here today in celebration of 20 years of peace, we must also recognise we are standing at a potential crossroads,” Corbyn said. Northern Ireland has been without a properly functioning power-sharing government for more than 16 months due to a bitter stand-off between the two biggest parties, the DUP and Sinn Féin. A row that broke out over a botched green energy scheme, and widened to encompass long-standing disputes such as the Irish language, gay marriage and Troubles legacy issues, shows no sign of resolution.

Pakistan’s complementary seam attack have been terrific - and there goes another! Broad is trapped LBW by a terrific off-cutter to the left-hander, and is so obviously plumb that he doesn’t even consider a review. Another England batsman falls on the drive. Bess launched into a fast-handed drive at a full-length delivery and edged it straight to Shafiq at second slip. He took a sharp catch, his second since tea, and England are now waist deep in the filth.57th over: England 175-7 (Bess 1, Wood 3) Bess shoves Hasan to leg to get off the mark in Test cricket. Incidentally, we’re having a few technical issues so apologies if the updates are slow to come through.“I wish I had sent this earlier...but do you think Buttler will average more than Ali at 7?” asks Simon Land. “Andor play a defensive innings? Nothing against the bloke, but I am not sure I am on board with this.”He has the potential to average more than anyone at No7, which is why they’ve picked him. I’m not sure he will but I’m glad we’re going to find out – he’s a genius, so we shouldn’t die wondering. And nor should he.56th over: England 174-7 (Bess 0, Wood 2) Bess is beaten, wafting loosely outside off stump at Abbas. He and Wood can both bat. Bess has a first-class hundred, for MCC against Essex in March, and Wood made his first Test fifty in New Zealand. But Pakistan are bowling ever so well. I always wanted to use the phrase ‘ever so well’, thus signifying the completion of my journey from young hopeful to old fart.“Pete Salmon shouldn’t just eavesdrop on the elderly drunks at the pub,” says Mac Millings. “He should go over and introduce himself to Gary Naylor and Phil Sawyer while he has the chance.”55th over: England 173-7 (Bess 0, Wood 1) I don’t know what it is, but I do know Hasan Ali has got it. Figures of 14-2-45-3 do not flatter him at all.Meanwhile, we have a live report from Lord’s.And now Buttler has gone to a blinding catch! He threw every sink in the house into a drive at Hasan Ali, and the ball flew off the edge towards second slip. Asad Shafiq showed extraordinary reflexes to get his head out of the way and take a brilliant two-handed catch by his right shoulder. 54th over: England 168-6 (Buttler 14, Bess 0) “I admire your optimism in making England favourites - I’m not so sure,” says Gary Naylor. “Batting has not been easy, but it’s not been as hard as England, rusty and impatient, have made it look. I’d guess that there are at least three centuries in this pitch and England don’t have many chances left to get them if we look at the tail, Jos Buttler’s four career first-class tons and the fact that Stoneman and Root look like they’ve forgotten what to do with the bat. Pakistan are likely to channel Misbah and Younus and grind England’s four right arm fast-mediums and rookie spinner into the lush earth of NW8 come the weekend.”It’s a fascinating opinion, Gary, but I’m afraid it doesn’t tally with mine. Good day.(Yes, points taken, and I thought England were under par even before Stokes’s dismissal, but I think their bowlers will be too good in these conditions. Either way, and far more importantly, it could be a cracking game.)The impressive Mohammad Abbas replaces Mohammad Amir and has a huge shout for LBW against Stokes turned down. Pakistan are going to review. The main doubt is whether the ball pitched outside leg if not, this is very close.It’s out! I’m not sure anyone expected that to be overturned, as it all looked very innocuous. It just pitched in line - about 52 per cent of the ball - and hit the pad in front of middle stump. England are in trouble now. 53rd over: England 168-5 (Stokes 38, Buttler 14) Hasan Ali returns in place of Shadab Khan. That’s an excellent, aggressive move from Pakistan, who know that Stokes and particularly Buttler could do a lot of damage if they get in after tea. Buttler drives a single to move to 14 from 14 balls one way or another, I don’t think he’s going to die wondering about his Test career.“Morning Rob,” says Adam Roberts. “It’s a treat during these times (Test matches) that I can catch some cricket on ESPN as a salve to getting up so ridiculously early. This morning, the power went off so no TV, no internet, no way to follow what’s going on. Sadly, when it came back on I wasn’t spared the horror of Joe Root’s ‘shot’ replayed for our pleasure.”Here’s Phil Sawyer again “When the drunks around here move on to furniture polish, they’re not talking about it…”“Afternoon Rob,” says Phil Sawyer. “Your reader will be pleased to note that young Has just scored 140 for the Lancashire 2nd XI against Gloucestershire. A spell in the seconds away from the spotlight seems to be doing him a world of good (he got a century in the 50-over stuff the other day as well). And my thanks, as ever, to HighPeakGeek of the County Cricket Live! blog for bringing these scores to my attention. To be honest, I think HPG gets 2nd XI information beamed directly into his brain. He just sees a stream of letters and numbers scrolling down, Matrix-style.”“The drunks in the pub have moved on to furniture polish – missed the start, so it’s completely baffling,” says Pete Salmon. “Mr Sheen best, they reckon.”Don’t eavesdrop too obviously or they’ll tell you to mind your own beeswax. Honk!52nd over: England 165-5 (Stokes 36, Buttler 13) Amir is making the ball murmur, moving it just enough both ways, and Stokes survives an optimistic LBW shout when he pushed around an inducker. It was too high. A lot depends on Stokes, who has a much greater sense of permanence at the crease than he did even a year ago. He has matured into a proper batsman. That’s the end of another excellent session. England lost Cook (70) and Bairstow (27) to bail-trimmers but will still fancy their chances of a solid first-innings total. See you soon for the long evening session.51st over: England 164-5 (Stokes 35, Buttler 13) Not long until tea. It’s been Pakistan’s day but I’d still make England favourites. Shadab, hitherto expensive, is milked for a couple.50th over: England 162-5 (Stokes 34, Buttler 12) A quiet over from Amir nothing to report. In other news, Virat Kohli and Surrey have changed their status to ‘It’s complicated’. Stay tuned: there are plenty more 2008 references where that came from.“Good afternoon Rob,” says Jonny L. “A question – I think. Hameed looked like he was going to play for England for ten years and now can’t get a game for Lancs – can he come back? Any word on what has happened? Such a huge fall for someone who looked such a star and also puts into perspective the achievement of Cook lasting so long at the top.”I’m sure he’ll be fine. He’s still a lot younger than most people when they make their Test debut. The schedule hasn’t helped him but he’s the best young England batsman I’ve ever seen so I can’t believe he’s going to end up in the big black hole marked Lost Talents.49th over: England 160-5 (Stokes 33, Buttler 11) There are few people who won’t wish Buttler well on his return. He’s a genius, an entertainer and a lovely bloke. He had been told to play his way and so he does, slapping Shadab for 10 off the over. There were two emphatic boundaries, one clipped between midwicket and mid-on, and the other hustled through the covers. He has 11 from seven balls. “Hi Rob,” says Pete Salmon. “I’m out here! Wasn’t emailing as having a sneaky one at the pub to watch the lads on the sward. Big group of elderly drunks to my left who spent first ten minutes talking about breasts, and then modulated into a discussion of literary suicides, and the relevance of Eugene O’Neill. Goes to show first impressions can be wrong. They also think England should be about 180 by now, and Root needs to step up. They’ve now moved onto mid-70s Bob Dylan. Will keep you posted.”I need to hear their thoughts on the new Lars von Trier. Actually, I need to hear their views on absolutely everything.48th over: England 150-5 (Stokes 33, Buttler 1) The new batsman is Joseph Charles Buttler. His first ball is almost his last: he feels nervously outside off stump and inside edges just past leg stump. Cook forces Amir through the covers for four to move into the seventies. This, as you probably know, is his 153rd consecutive Test. It’s longevity gone mad!Oh, and now he’s gone! Cook is cleaned up by a stunning delivery from Amir that straightens sharply to trim the off bail as he fiddles down the wrong line. That was a beauty.47th over: England 145-4 (Cook 66, Stokes 33) After a handful of sighters, Stokes hoicks Shadab to cow corner for six. Pick that out! He bats with such authority these days, particularly in home conditions. No, I’m not suggesting we should drop him for overseas Tests.“Hi,” says David Seare. “I just got side-tracked reading some  opinion pieces about how crap the world is. A Cook ton would might restore my inner balance this afternoon.”The world is crap and we’re watching Pakistan in the Lord’s Test. Is that cognitive dissonance?46th over: England 139-4 (Cook 66, Stokes 27) Mohammad Amir replaces Hasan Ali, who bowled a fascinating spell, and is clattered through extra cover for three by Stokes. I’m not sure you’re ever quite in against Pakistan, certainly when the ball is moving in the air, but Cook and Stokes are looking good.“You are my one link to cricket now that it is on BT Sport and I can’t get it on ESPN here anymore….” says Rachel Clifton.It’s back on Sky! And you don’t have that either do you!45th over: England 136-4 (Cook 66, Stokes 24) Reverse swing at one end, wrist spin at the other. This is Pakistan. Shadab, this very promising teenager, is easing his way into what might be a longer spell. Stokes lunges at a googly but softens his hands enough to get a thick edge wide of slip for four, and then Cook drives another emphatic boundary through extra cover. At the moment this is all a bit Oval 2017.44th over: England 126-4 (Cook 61, Stokes 19) All things being equal, Hasan Ali will become a superstar in the next few years. He’s not blisteringly fast like the greatest Pakistan bowlers of the last 40 years but he’s quick enough and has the same ability to get blood out of a flat track through personality, imagination and reverse swing. Stokes survives a big LBW appeal in the course of another excellent over. He whipped around a sharp reverse inswinger that would probably have missed leg. Replays show it was umpire’s call so Stokes would have survived had Pakistan reviewed. The next ball is almost identical – but this time Stokes nails a clip through midwicket for four. This is fantastic Test cricket. 43rd over: England 122-4 (Cook 61, Stokes 15) Shadab Khan replaces whoever he’s replaced. Faheem Ashraf, yeah. An exploratory over brings a single apiece for Cook and Stokes.42nd over: England 120-4 (Cook 60, Stokes 14) Stokes struggled with the bat in the IPL but he looks solid here. A mettlesome drive through extra cover for four reinforces the point. Then, after fielding a straight drive in his follow through, Hasan Ali yelps with pain. This is a terrific contest between two irresistible forces of personality, and later in the over Stokes drags another hot inswinger onto his pads.41st over: England 116-4 (Cook 60, Stokes 10) Cook drives Faheem sweetly through extra cover for four. The cover drive has become a key barometer of Cook’s form, given the necessary foot movement, and he has played it excellently today.40th over: England 110-4 (Cook 56, Stokes 9) Thanks Nick, hello everyone. The compelling Hasan Ali continues to Ben Stokes, who walks down the track and drags an attempted drive onto the pad. Ali goes up for LBW but there was a huge inside edge. The next ball goes the other way to beat the edge, and Stokes responds with a muscular drive through mid-off for four. A superb over ends when Stokes digs out a brilliant full-length inswinger. Pakistan are in the mood just now, nobody more than Hasan Ali. The first two letters of his first name and surname spell haal, and he personifies the haal of Pakistan cricket.39th over: England 105-4 (Cook 56, Stokes 5) Sleepy old over from Faheem to Cook, who only has ten runs in the hour since lunch, but that’s the sort of pace he’s comfortable with. And with that, I shall hand over to the gentle caress of Rob Smyth, who will guide you through the rest of the day. Your emails to him here.38th over: England 105-4 (Cook 56, Stokes 5) Stokes lends a hand to Cook by chipping in with a four, not a perfectly-timed cover drive but struck well enough to reach the ropes.Hawkeye suggests there was a decent bit of movement, even if it didn’t look that way live, but the slope goes the other way (and its effect is generally exaggerated), so it was off the seam. Faheem returns, and does the job instantly, bowling Bairstow clean up. A weird one: didn’t seem to move very much, if at all, and it looked like Bairstow...just missed one on off-stump. 36th over: England 100-3 (Cook 56, Bairstow 27) Hasan is back, back, back. Such a good shot from Cook, little more than a jab off his knees that is timed so well it dashes to the boundary, just in front of deep mid-wicket. He’s denied another boundary from a whacking cut, Imam again showing those familial fielding chops with a great stop at backward point. “I read John’s suggestion as ‘twenty-five ball overs’” writes Bene, presumably while squinting. “For a fraction of a second, I thought ‘that requires an almost Test match level of endurance...’ before I remembered how to read.”35th over: England 94-3 (Cook 50, Bairstow 27) Imam-ul-Haq es brilliantly to his left at point to stop a Bairstow shot, which is enjoyable for three reasons. 1) It was a great bit of fielding. 2) He did it while wearing glasses. 3) The thought of uncle Inzy trying to do that is absolutely delicious. Imam is back in action as Bairstow drives lustily at a fullish ball, but gets a thick edge that ul-Haq Jnr retrieves from the third man way.

Here’s the stage results, which might be forgotten in the light of what happened in the GC race. That embraced disaster for Yates. His is by no means a lost cause, but with two huge stages of climbs to come, he won’t be allowed to relax. Dumoulin will not be giving up his crown. He cracked on the final climb and suddenly, this Giro is open. The gap is halved to 28 seconds. Lopez crosses the line. Dumoulin and Froome cross the line. Counting back to Yates and he looks exhausted. He’s lost at least 20 seconds. Yates is dropping off the wheel of his own group now! Yates in trouble for the first time in the tour and needs to make a bridge to that group of Dumoulin and Froome. Froome goes off the front. Big move here and he’s opened up space. Dumoulin has followed on! And Yates has been dropped!Dumoulin has had a go on the flat. He needed to. Can he take seconds off Yates? No, the English leader gets back on his wheel. Lopez’s escape is making good. He has 33 seconds on the main group. Good ride from the white jersey contender. Yates, meanwhile, is sitting pretty. It’s the places below him that will get shaken up. George Bennett from New Zealand, in tenth, has made a bid for glory off the front of that pink jersey group. Thibaut Pinot’s team, Groupama–FDJ, is trying to get him back to that battle between Carapaz and Lopez. Poels dropping back now, perhaps to try and catapult Froome forward. Wout Poels’ bid to be in the top ten is taking shape. He is ahead of the main group, and wants to climb up from 17th. Now for the GC contenders. Carapaz and Lopez are attacking each other. Lopez has gone away from his rival for the white jersey. Schachmann leading it out. Catteneo off him, then Plaza. Into a hairpin bend they go. None of them can get away. An uphill sprint will decide this. Plaza has their wheel. What a survivor to get there. Three in it? Ok, here’s the last kilometre for the leaders. Schachmann and Catteneo eyeing each other. Who will crack? Hang on, here’s Plaza. Sky’s Wout Poels has gone off the front of the peloton. That’s thrown the cat among the pigeons in the race for the top ten in GC. Catteneo has a dig but now Schachmann has the wheel. He decides they will sit alongside off each other. Yates, by the way, looked comfortable. Meanwhile, Schachmann and Catteneo have pulled away. Just over 2km to go. Back in the peloton, Yates’ team, Mitchelton-Scott are putting it on. Movistar to the forefront as well, as Astana drop down. That’s a battle for the white jersey: Carapaz v Lopez. Spoke too soon? Schachman and Catteneo spin off again. Cat and mouse, with Schachman leading the effort. The 24-year-old German looks strong. Make the leading group into three. Christoph Pfingsten is back on? Four? Ruben Plaza is back in touch. Gutsy. For the remaining ten of the breakaway 12, it’s been a long way to travel to get dropped. Schachmann and Cattaneo are fixed into their roles now, with the Italian sat on the back.The pink jersey group has 10km to go now, but all seems relatively quiet. The fireworks being saved for that final few hundred metres or so. Plaza has almost made his way back. Heroic stuff from the old man, but Schachmann and Pfingsten both go for it, with Schachmann taking the lead and Catteneo has his wheel. Two in it now? Catteneo seems content to limit his workload and sit back. Plaza dropped at the front of the field. There are now three men in it. Schachmann, Pfingsten and Cattaneo are idling a little, and there are 7km to run. Yates, though, won’t have usual helper Jack Haig with him, the Aussie looking to have dropped off the back. Yates, Dumoulin, Pozzovivo, Pinot, Froome all in the group. Ruben Plaza, the oldest rider in the race, has gone for it. Should he get this done, he would, at 38, be the oldest ever winner of a Giro stage. He’s reeled back in, though, and perhaps that was his attempt to ride out his challenge. Kuznetsov goes off the front. Fonzi and Turrin have been dropped. The leaders starting to splinter. Ballerini’s race looks done as he drops off. Taking those sprint points was his job done for the day. Team-mate Catteneo is still in the hunt. Five or six have each others’ wheels. There are now 10km to go for the leading group. The peloton is 15’ 30” or so back. Two races in one here. Here’s a handy profile of that final climb. And Van Poppel has been spat out the back of the group also immediately. 11 riders left in the hunt. Mitchelton-Scott are controlling the front of the peloton at the moment. Van Poppel has begun that 13km climb and the chasers in the breakaway group have hunted him down. Van Poppel is in the foothills of that final climb. Meanwhile, through the town of Mondovi, there is a wobble among the peloton when it takes a sharp turn over a bridge. A couple nearly came a cropper the gap to the leader is up 16’ 22”. The gap is 17 seconds to Boy van Poppel. He won’t be popular if they haul him back. Up in the break, Boy van Poppel of Trek has gone for it off the front. A brave stab at glory, and surely one destined to fail. The rest will work to haul him back but that hill is going to hurt. More on breakaways from Thomas Sargent: “Max Sciandri in the Giro getting away and not winning the stage but coming third for Linda McCartney. It was so rare to have a Brit even in a grand tour that it was exiting to have one in an actual break.” He doesn’t designate a year, but we are looking at the year 2000, I think. If you are confused, yes, a cycling team did bear the name of the late Mrs Macca Thumbs Aloft and her vegetarian food empire. The final, fateful climb awaits for those who have been away for over three hours at this point. Elia Viviani, meanwhile, has stopped at the side of the road. Up at the front Davide Ballerini has taken the sprint and will stay ahead in that competition, not to be confused with the points competition that Viviani leads.

It said the cutoff was temporary while it made the required changes, and told users: “We apologise for any inconvenience, and we intend to restore access as soon as possible.” Pinterest did not respond to a request for comment.Other companies have taken a more permanent approach. Unroll.me, an inbox management firm, announced it was withdrawing services for EU companies due to an inability to offer its product – which is monetised by selling insights gleaned from reading users’ emails – in a way that was compatible with EU law. “We are truly sorry that we are unable to offer our service to you,” the company told EU users.Some online games, including Ragnarok Online, have switched off their EU servers.Other firms have not gone so far as to blame the new regulation but have closed EU operations with convenient timing. Crowdpac, a political fundraising organisation set up by David Cameron’s former “guru” Steve Hilton, announced it was closing its UK wing “for business reasons” until further notice. The company, which was still raising funds in the UK as recently as Sunday, now says it “hopes one day to be back”.Some see the law as a moneymaking opportunity. One service, GDPR Shield, offers to block EU users from companies’ sites. Its website says it can save companies that are not targeting EU users thousands in legal fees.“If you don’t have an in-house legal team, complying with the law requires you to consult with a lawyer specialising in data protection law,” GDPR Shield tells potential customers. “In addition, you’re at risk of vindictive reporting from no-win-no-fee legal firms.”Klout, a social media analytics service, and Super Monday Night Combat, an online game, will shut down on Friday. Lithium, the owner of Klout, said: “Klout no longer made sense as a standalone service. The upcoming deadline for GDPR implementation simply expedited our plans to sunset Klout.”Brian Honan, a data protection expert, said he did not view the shutdowns as a consequence of the new law. “The GDPR’s primary goal is to enhance the protections around the gathering and processing of the personal data belonging to iniduals residing within the European Union,” he said. “Companies have had well over two years to prepare for the enforcement date and to be ready.“Organisations outside of the EU who target and process personal data belonging to iniduals resident in the EU are also required to comply with the GDPR. Organisations outside of the EU that are blocking access or refusing to provide their services to people within the EU are demonstrating how little regard they have paid to protecting the privacy and the personal data of their users, and it could also be argued are commercially being naive by deciding to ignore one of the largest consumer markets in the world.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fd512b80ed87fc2a914a40202e9815438b11ece0/0_967_4788_2873/master/4788.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4075921392701613db38e872b3ab65d6","title":"onenote evernote which is best for small business organise files smartphone tablet","story":"Matt’s dad wants to organise files and make them accessible via his phone and tablet. Which program should he choose?My dad runs a small business and has problems organising his files – Word documents, PDFs, photos – alongside his emails. He wants to be able to easily save the emails and files in folders in date order in a single place. He also wants the folders to be accessible from anywhere on his phoneiPad.I’ve tried simply saving the emails and documents into a single folder on his Mac, but this is a huge pain for the amount of emails he receives. MattOne of the advantages of the digitisation of information is that we can now store many different kinds of data together. Videos and sound recordings now sit happily alongside letters, photos, paper receipts and invoices instead of in separate ledgers or folders, or on different physical media such as cassette tapes, CDs, DVDs etc.Whether it’s worth adding emails is another matter, and I don’t think many people bother. You can, of course, save emails as text files or PDFs and add them to project folders. This works for a small number of emails, but – as you have found – it’s too much work to handle all emails that way. In any case, you can usually find the same emails by looking in a mail folder, or by searching for an email address or a job number. (Always include a job number in emails if a project involves working with different people in different companies.)If your dad wants to access his files from anywhere with a smartphone or a tablet, then he will probably need to put copies online. The simplest way to do this is to upload project folders to an online storage service such as Dropbox, Microsoft OneDrive, Google Drive or whatever. However, he’d still have to use different programs to access some different types of data.An interesting alternative is to store everything in a sort of portmanteau program that will also help organise it. The leading examples are Evernote and Microsoft’s OneNote. These are about as close as you can get to a “paperless office”, at least for a sufficiently small office.Outlook even had a “save to OneNote” feature that made it easier to file emails with other data, but it has gone missing – temporarily, I hope – from the latest version. Otherwise, both programs allow you add emails to your notebooks by almost identical means. First, you can forward them to an email address, so you could set up mail rules to forward selected emails to OneNote or Evernote. Second, you can “print” them to a OneNote or Evernote notebook instead of to a physical printer. It’s very tedious to do more than a few.Still, you can also add things like receipts and business cards by, in effect, using your smartphone as a scanner. Example apps include Microsoft’s Office Lens with OneNote and Scannable or Scantastic with Evernote.The OneNote v Evernote debate has been long and sometimes heated, but they are different products, and each does some things better than the other. If you want to clip web pages and share notes then Evernote is the clear winner.However, I think OneNote might be the better choice for your dad, because its hierarchical structure is logical and almost infinitely expandable. It works like an old-school ring binder or filing cabinet. (It’s very popular in schools.)You can open as many notebooks as you like, and give them all names. Inside a notebook, you can create as many tabs as you like, for different projects. Inside each tab, you can have as many pages as you like.It’s probably easier to get going with Evernote because you can treat it like a slop-bucket and find whatever you need by searching for it. (Yes, Evernote does have notebooks, and you can create stacks of them, but the point stands.) OneNote requires more setting up to work well, but its structured approach may be a better match for your dad’s business purposes.Both OneNote and Evernote are available as free web applications and as apps, so you can try them to see which you like. Just open an email account at Outlook – you don’t have to give your real name or any personal details – and you can use OneNote until you fill up your 5GB of free OneDrive space. If you find it does the job, you can increase the storage to 50GB for £1.99 per month.There are also free OneNote apps for the Mac, iOS, Windows and Android.In the same way, you can try Evernote, and its associated apps. The drawback is that the free Basic version does not have all the features of the Premium version, and is limited to 60MB of uploads per month. To make a proper comparison, you would need to pay £44.99 per year for the Premium version, which allows 10GB of uploads. (The Plus version has been discontinued.)Alternatively, you could sign up for a free trial of Evernote Business, which costs £10.99 per user per month. This is aimed at teams, but it includes Evernote Premium as well. You can compare the features online.OneNote’s other advantage is that it’s integrated into Microsoft Office, and gets third party support from sites like Onetastic. Not everyone cares about Office integration, but most large organisations run on it, and your mention of Word suggests that your dad already uses it.If your dad has Office 2016, then he already has a copy of the desktop version of OneNote. This version can create and store files locally, while also working online.People who already have Office 2016 can subscribe to Office 365 Business Essentials for £3.80 plus VAT per month. That doesn’t include support, but it does include the standard 1TB of online storage, which is enough for most people’s work files.The Office 365 Business version (£7.90 plus VAT per month) adds downloads of the full Office programs plus 247 phone and web support. The Premium version (£9.40 plus VAT per month) adds a custom domain email address plus extra features such as Microsoft Invoicing, Microsoft Bookings, Microsoft Planner and Outlook Customer Manager.Evernote has dominated this category of software on the Mac for two main reasons. First, Microsoft took more than a decade to add OneNote to the Mac version of Office: it appeared on Windows in 2003 – five years before Evernote – and on Mac in 2014. Second, the Mac version has never had the full capabilities of the Windows version. This is annoying even if you don’t really need the missing features.Unfortunately, the Mac version will never catch up. In fact, OneNote 2016 will be the last desktop version for either platform, and Microsoft has already stopped updating it. Worse, it has made the free versions of OneNote 2016 impossible to find, and I did try. (Like all the free versions, these can only store notebooks in OneDrive.)Instead, Microsoft is pushing users towards the app version, which is provided as standard in Windows 10. This sacrifices features such as Outlook integration, Onetastic compatibility, and the ability to create OneNote notebooks on local devices (though notebooks are cached locally).Last month, William Devereux from Microsoft’s OneNote team claimed that the app would be better than the desktop version – it has many new features – and that it would be consistent across the various platforms (web, Mac, iOS, and Android). A scan through the comments shows how well that claim went down.You may find the app does what you need. If not, bear in mind that OneNote 2016 will only be supported until 14 October, 2025.Have you got a question?

This humble area hides an intriguing press of markets, shops, stalls, eateries – and, inevitably, a touch of hipster resurgence. We start our wander with that most Hong Kong of meals: a bowl of noodles. There are very few restaurants in Hong Kong that make their own any more, and there are fewer still that make it the old-fashioned way, by kneading the dough with a bamboo pole. At Lau Sum Kee Noodle (48 Kweilin Street, Sham Shui Po), owner Lau Fat-cheong makes them fresh every day using this technique. He balances on the end of a large bamboo pole, bouncing up and down to knead his springy, al dente noodles. The house specialties are the wonton soup noodles, or noodles tossed with dried shrimp roe. Suitably fortified, we’re heading into the maze that is the Golden Shopping Centre (Golden Building, 146-152 Fuk Wa Street, Sham Shui Po). Time was, this building was stuffed full of stores selling pirated software and DVDs. Every so often the shout would go up and you’d be hustled out of the store, the shutters would clang down behind you, and a few seconds later a policeman would wander past. These days, the arcade is far more legitimate, selling a huge range of tech, video games and accessories.But if you’re looking for a true electronics bargain, head straight for the Apliu Street flea market. This strip of open-air street stalls is a goldmine, selling transistors and resistors, vintage cameras, sparkling lengths of LED lights, second-hand power tools and pre-owned TV remotes. Behind the main strip, shops stock everything from multimeters and tripods to night-vision goggles and pen cameras.Just above Ap Liu Street, Paul Au runs his vinyl fiefdom. He’s not just a little into LPs. He loves them so much that his entire house is dedicated them, at the expense of pretty much everything else. The 28 square metres (300 sq ft) that make up Au’s flatshop Vinyl Hero (Flat D, 5F Wai Hong Building, 239 Cheung Sha Wan Road) contain some 400,000 records, stacked up to the ceiling. Go ready to hunt, and you’re sure to find a gem. Do call ahead before you make a house visit.Head down the road in search of Chan Cheuk-ming, better known as “Brother Ming”. The owner of the humble Pei Ho Counterparts (278 Tai Nan Street, Sham Shui Po) is a Sham Shui Po celebrity. Brother Ming isn’t famed for his food, but his charity. For years now he’s been handing out free meals to the impoverished and homeless of the district. Grab an energy boost in the form of a classic Hong Kong-style French toast: two slices of bread that are egged, deep fried, and served with a huge pat of butter and a healthy drizzle of golden syrup. Then pay it forward by buying a meal or two more for someone in need.Sham Shui Po is the centre of the city’s fabrics trade, with streets lined with shops selling bolts of every kind of material and fabric under the sun. Just down the road, Alri Star Leather Factory keeps the district’s heritage alive with a hipster touch. You can buy leathers of all kinds here, and also the punches, cutters and burnishers you’ll need to go from hide to homemade artisanal goods. Lacking the time or the inclination? Alri also sells handmade, and already completed, leather goods – as does Brothers Leathercraft a few shops down.Afterwards drop by Common Room and Co, a community-minded combination art gallery, bookstore, maker-space and coffee shop, or Cafe Sausalito for something single-origin and cold-brewed. Time for another bite – the most famous of our route. When chef Mak Kwai Pui left the Four Seasons hotel in Hong Kong, he decided it was time for a change from fine-dining Cantonese fare. And so in 2009 he opened Tim Ho Wan, a humble 20-seater restaurant serving everyday dim sum with a twist of technique. It picked up a Michelin star a year later, and has been widely touted as the world’s cheapest Michelin-starred restaurant. That means the queues tend to be long, but at least they’re worth it: especially for chef Mak’s invention, the baked char siu bao: soft, sweet, baked buns filled with tender roast pork. On the way to dessert, stop by nearby Bo Wah Paper Effigies (2C Fuk Wing Street, Sham Shui Po). In Cantonese culture, the living burn paper offerings for their ancestors. These can range from prayer papers to paper currency and extravagant effigies of paper houses, clothing or cars. At Bo Wah, tradition gets an update, thanks to the young Au Yeung Ping-chi, who has fashioned paper representations of giant robots, fishing rods and scuba gear. After all, no one said the afterlife had to be boring.Grab a sweet bite at Kung Wo Beancurd Factory (118 Pei Ho Street, Sham Shui Po), which has barely changed since opening here in the 60s. In the doorway, cubes of tofu sizzle away on large pans. Inside, the packed tables make it clear this restaurant is a Hong Kong favourite. Order the fragrant, sweet and smooth dou fu fa (tofu pudding). Last of all, head up the road for a reminder of the past in the neo-classical colonial edifice that was once the North Kowloon Magistracy. It’s an imposing courthouse edifice that looks entirely out of place in this humble district: but what better way for the city’s rulers to impress their power on the populace? These days, though, the building is the Hong Kong base of the Savannah College of Art and Design, better known as SCAD. A sensitive conservation effort has earned the site a Unesco nod: one courtroom and a jail cell have been preserved, and the school is open to the public through twice-daily tours."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/19a64740d9c0934e941be4331f87f9569c1b633b/0_157_1600_960/master/1600.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=054a50d3c10fd2cf8dc73e77873feaa5","title":"air force members lsd guarding nuclear missiles","story":"Fourteen airmen were disciplined, of whom six were convicted in courts martial of LSD use or distribution or bothOne airman said he felt paranoia. Another marveled at the vibrant colors. A third admitted, “I absolutely just loved altering my mind.”Meet service members entrusted with guarding nuclear missiles that are among the most powerful in America’s arsenal. Air force records obtained by the Associated Press show they bought, distributed and used the hallucinogen LSD and other mind-altering illegal drugs as part of a ring that operated undetected for months on a highly secure military base in Wyoming.“Although this sounds like something from a movie, it isn’t,” said Capt Charles Grimsley, the lead prosecutor of one of several courts martial.A slip-up on social media by one airman enabled investigators to crack the drug ring at FE Warren Air Force Base in March 2016. The details are reported here for the first time. Fourteen airmen were disciplined, of whom six were convicted in courts martial of LSD use or distribution or both.None of the airmen was accused of using drugs on duty. Yet it’s another blow to the reputation of the Air force’s nuclear missile corps, which has struggled at times with misbehavior, mismanagement and low morale.Although seen by some as a backwater of the US military, the missile force has returned to the spotlight as Donald Trump has called for strengthening US nuclear firepower and exchanged threats last year with North Korea. The administration’s nuclear strategy calls for hundreds of billions of dollars in new spending in coming decades.The accused service members were from the 90th Missile Wing, which operates one-third of the 400 Minuteman 3 intercontinental ballistic missiles that stand “on alert” 247 in underground silos scattered across the northern Great Plains. The Associated Press obtained transcripts of seven courts martial proceedings and related documents through Freedom of Information Act requests over the past two years. They provide vivid descriptions of LSD trips.“I’m dying!” one airman is quoted as exclaiming, followed by “When is this going to end?” during a “bad trip” on LSD in February 2016 at a state park about 20 miles (32km) from FE Warren. A portion of that episode was video-recorded by one member of the group a transcript of the audio was included in court records.“I felt paranoia, panic,” for hours after taking LSD, Airman 1st class Tommy N Ashworth said under oath at his court martial. He confessed to using LSD three times while off duty. The first time, in the summer of 2015, shook him up. “I didn’t know if I was going to die that night or not,” he said as a witness at another airman’s drug trial.Others said they enjoyed the drug.“Minutes felt like hours, colors seemed more vibrant and clear,” Airman Basic Kyle S Morrison testified. “In general, I felt more alive.” He became an informant for investigators and was sentenced to five months confinement, 15 days of hard labor and loss of $5,200 in pay.It’s unclear how long before being on duty any of the airmen had taken LSD, which stands for lysergic acid diethylamide. Although illegal in the US, it had been showing up so infrequently in drug tests across the military that in December 2006 the Pentagon eliminated LSD screening from standard drug-testing procedures.In response to AP inquiries, an Air Force spokesman, Lt Col Uriah L Orland, said the drug activity took place during off-duty hours. “There are multiple checks to ensure airmen who report for duty are not under the influence of alcohol or drugs and are able to execute the mission safely, securely and effectively,” he said.Airman 1st class Nickolos A Harris, said to be the leader of the drug ring, testified that he had no trouble getting LSD and other drugs from civilian sources. He pleaded guilty to using and distributing LSD and using ecstasy, cocaine and marijuana.“I absolutely just loved altering my mind,” he told the judge, blaming his decisions to use drugs on his addictive personality. Harris was sentenced to 12 months in jail and other penalties, but under a pre-trial agreement he avoided a punitive discharge."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/07fbe70cc3a40dc90ecfa64beed2eba98b37fb57/0_219_5120_3074/master/5120.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c57661800a1b216cdc9859bf565aee31","title":"canada polar bears labrador rigolet seal hunt","story":"Despite vanishing sea ice and shorter winters, Labrador’s polar bear population is among the healthiest in the world – and it could be thanks to the harp sealsGuido Rich, 28, an Inuit hunter from Rigolet, Labrador, brings his Ski-Doo to a careful stop on the sea ice, mindful of the precious cargo it hauls: the body of an 800lb male polar bear. It takes Rich and two other men to roll the animal off the sled and on to the ice, while his wife and young children watch.His sister, Natasha Pottle, who shot the bear the night before, hands her brother the plastic bags used to store liver, hair and fat samples that will be sent away for lab testing. The animal will provide valuable information for Labrador’s biologists, a small windfall for his family and meat for the community. Rich has barely begun cutting into the hide when a parade of people from the village start arriving to take pictures, offer observations or just watch respectfully.“When you get a bear, everyone in town knows it,” Rich said.Scenes like this are being repeated up and down the rugged, remote coast this year. Despite vanishing sea ice and shorter, milder winters, Labrador’s polar bear population is actually growing – which means a bigger harvesting quota for Inuit hunters.There are more than 2,500 polar bears in the vast coastal area that includes Labrador and northern Quebec, according to Environment Canada – far more than was expected earlier in the millennium – and further signs the bears continue to rebound despite the impacts of climate change.Indeed, although scientists and Inuit sometimes clash over the estimates, the polar bear population of coastal Labrador is among the healthiest in the world.“When I grew up, a polar bear was kind of this mythical creature because you didn’t see them very often. You didn’t hear tell of people seeing them,” said Jim Goudie, wildlife manager for Nunatsiavut, the regional indigenous self-government.“This abundance of polar bears is not something my father’s generation grew up with. It’s only since the mid-80s there’s been the boom. Now there’s polar bears everywhere.”The reason, biologists suspect, is the boom in the harp seal population. As Newfoundland’s seal fishery has collapsed under international pressure, the harp seals of the north-west Atlantic have proliferated. They now number about 7.4 million animals – more then seven times the population in the 1970s.That has created a veritable feast for Labrador’s polar bears, who have shifted their diet from ring seals to their more southerly, promiscuous cousins.“They jumped on the harp seal boom,” Goudie said. “They appear to have adapted for this moment in time … We’re seeing them further south than in the past.”Labrador’s Inuit have hunted polar bears for thousands of years. But only recently have they been able to so carefully monitor and protect the population, thanks to a unique, indigenous-run conservation program managed by Nunatsiavut.The bear shot by Pottle was one of 12 killed by Inuit hunters this season under Nunatsiavut’s quota system, which doles out bear hunting licences through a lottery. A hunter has one week to get a bear before the licence expires and is transferred to another person. Only Inuit residents can apply for a licence, and it’s illegal to sell a licence to a big game hunter who is not from the region.In Inuit culture, a polar bear remains a deeply respected animal, called Nanuk in the Inuktitut language, and getting one is still considered the mark of a great hunter. The harvest remains such an important part of local tradition that it has its own statute in Nunatsiavut’s land claim with the federal government.But Pottle isn’t putting on any airs. Shooting her first polar bear was a terrifying experience, she said.“I was scared,” she said. “It was intense. We chased the tracks out on to the ice and there he was. Then our Ski-Doo stalled and he started coming toward us. That’s when I started calling for my brother.”Her brother, carrying the rifle on his back, circled around to keep the animal at a safer distance. Then he handed the gun to Natasha and told her to shoot.“She was crying, and I said: ‘What’s wrong?’ She said she’s never going polar bear hunting again,” he said. “I said: ‘It’s your licence. You’ve got to shoot it.’”The bear meat will be ided up and shared among the region’s community freezer program, which provides food for the elderly and others who can’t hunt for themselves. Wasting the meat is prohibited by Nunatsiavut law. Failure to share the meat or submit samples for testing means a hunter can be banned for five years.Inuit hunters can sell a bear pelt for $4,000 to $5,000 to a local taxidermist, who will auction it off to buyers around the world. In previous decades, when the international market for pelts was booming, the same bearskin could fetch as much as $30,000. Under Nunatsiavut’s program, a computer chip is embedded in the pelt to prove it was harvested through a legal hunt.Much like the coastal Inuit themselves, the polar bear’s world relies heavily on reliable, vast expanses of sea ice. As the region’s sea ice vanishes because of warming oceans and milder winters, the bear has had to adapt. The animals appear to be thriving, but winter is becoming increasingly unpredictable.The loss of sea ice has been dramatic, according to climatologist Robert Way. He points to the Canadian Ice Service historical database, which shows Nunatsiavut’s northern region has lost about a third of its ice cover in the past decade.Conservationists say the Nunatsiavut model is a lesson for other regions trying to manage their polar bear population. Goudie argues the Inuit, sometimes criticized by animal rights activists for allowing the bear hunt, have a vested interest in preserving the polar bears that live among them.“For Inuit, it would be like losing an entire piece of their culture,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/abd5967a25d14a9161b0523080bbd26f4f3a5c14/0_9_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=58bf6e5fd629499bc7d8ec0803e0e3bd","title":"italy government collision course eu m5s liga","story":"Brussels has shown concern about the rhetoric of M5S and League, but the ragtag coalition has domestic worries of its ownItaly’s unlikely new coalition partners, the anti-establishment Five Star Movement (M5S) and the far-right League, disagree on so much that the new government will have a “conciliation committee” to settle its internal differences.But on some things, most notably an avowed desire to stick it to Europe, the two rival parties agree, and if they follow through on their promises Italy will be set on a collision course with the EU. The question is: will they? Much suggests they will not.As cabinet positions are being debated in Rome, the situation certainly looks awkward. An early clash looms over immigration: the coalition contract envisages an 18-month limit for the asylum process, the detention of irregular migrants, and the repatriation of half a million people to their countries of origin – most of it in violation of EU law.Another, over Russia, could come as soon as next month, when EU leaders are scheduled to roll over sanctions that the government accord – which describes Moscow as a possible partner rather than as enemy, of Europe, and certainly not a military threat – demands be lifted.The loudest alarm bells are ringing over the parties’ stated ambition to rewrite the EU’s rules, and their seemingly dichotomous domestic policies, which combine the rises in public spending promised by M5S with the tax cuts favoured by the League.The coalition contract says economic governance in the EU, “based on the dominance of the market rather than the broader social and economic dimension”, must be reviewed, and the single market reformed to “avoid prejudicial effects on national interests”.If he ends up getting the job – which is far from certain – the coalition partners’ mooted economy minister, Paolo Savona, could cause ructions. A former industry minister who opposed the signing of the Maastricht Treaty, Savona calls the euro a “German cage”.Europe has made little secret of its concern. As the European commission unveiled its economic advice to member states, the body’s finance commissioner, Pierre Moscovici, expressed what sounded like a forlorn hope. But in contrast to foreign commentators, many Italian analysts are sceptical that Eurogeddon is inevitable, or even particularly likely. The government contract is vaguely worded and amounts to little more than a manifesto, they note. Behind the fierce anti-European rhetoric and bluster – a feature of the two populist parties’ election campaigns – there are few indications the new government will seek a serious showdown with the EU.Giuseppe Conte, the lawyer and academic with no political experience tasked on Wednesday with trying to form the new government, will have his work cut out simply finding acceptable compromises between the mutually antagonistic M5S and League and their respective leaders, Luigi Di Maio and Matteo Salvini.Italian presidents have rarely used their constitutional powers to veto proposed government laws, but if he finds himself faced with policies he considers fiscally irresponsible or likely to lead to open conflict with Europe, Sergio Mattarella may decide there is a first time for everything.A significantly more formidable obstacle to the new government’s putative programme may prove to be the 318-seat senate, through which all new legislation must pass and where the coalition partners – not known for their voting discipline – have a slim seven seats.This is, however, Italy’s 66th government since the end of the second world war. Given the obvious tensions, obstacles and constraints, both domestic and international, that it will face, few would bet on its chances of surviving long enough to mend Italy, let alone stick it to Europe.

All 298 people onboard were killed.At a press conference in The Hague on Thursday, the investigators showed photo and video evidence that they said proved they had identified the specific BUK missile system responsible for shooting down the plane. They said they had “legal and convincing evidence which will stand in a courtroom” that the BUK system involved came from the 53rd anti-aircraft missile brigade based in Kursk, in western Russia.The joint investigation team (JIT) looking into the incident is made up of Dutch prosecutors and police and others from Australia, Malaysia and Ukraine. They showed photos and video of the convoy that carried the missile system over the border from Russia to Ukraine, and a series of distinctive markings and serial numbers which they said had enabled them to trace the exact system used in the attack, and trace it to the 53rd brigade.Russian officials have denied all involvement in the incident, and on Thursday the defence ministry repeated these denials, claiming that no Russian missile had ever crossed into Ukraine. Kremlin-linked media outlets have floated a range of implausible theories suggesting Ukraine was responsible for shooting down the plane. Russia has used its veto in the UN to prevent an international tribunal from being set up to determine guilt, meaning any eventual trial would be held in the Netherlands under Dutch law. Fred Westerbeke, the chief prosecutor, said the investigation was in its last phase but could not say when he would be ready to file indictments. Two years ago, prosecutors said there were about 100 people under suspicion of direct or indirect involvement. On Thursday, Westerbeke said that number had come down to several dozen, but he declined to name them. He said there was other evidence that would be kept secret until a court hearing began. “We don’t want to tell everything we know because then we are opening our cards to the other side and we do not want to do that.”The big question going forward will be how a future court will operate, given Russia is likely to continue its policy of stonewalling and denial. Investigators had asked Russian authorities for information about the 53rd brigade but had been ignored, said Westerbeke. If specific Russian military personnel or commanders are indicted, Russia is almost certain to refuse their extradition.Australian foreign minister Julie Bishop said the countries that make up the JIT were now “considering options” about how to proceed further. “That a sophisticated weapon belonging to the Russian Army was dispatched and used to shoot down a civilian aircraft should be of grave international concern,” she said.The JIT stopped short of saying it believed the BUK system was deployed as part of a Russian military mission, saying only that they had identified the base from which it came. In a sign that some evidence is still missing, the JIT repeated a call for those with information about the incident to come forward, including information about the 53rd brigade, promising anonymity. “The next crucially important step is to identify some members of the military in the 53rd brigade... who can directly say who was involved in the transfer or operation of the Buk,” said Ukrainian army general Vasyl Hrytsak, a member of the investigation team, in comments to Reuters. Bellingcat said it would hold a press conference on Friday to present new findings on MH17.In the weeks before MH17 was shot down, the separatists had shot down a number of Ukrainian military planes over east Ukraine, and intercepted communications between separatist fighters made it clear that they initially believed they had hit another military plane, not a civilian liner.Russia has repeatedly denied it was militarily active in eastern Ukraine, despite an overwhelming body of evidence to the contrary. In 2014, Russian troops and hardware were introduced at key moments to back pro-Russia separatists fighting against Ukrainian government troops.After a series of Russian media claims of Ukrainian responsibility were all shown to be false, Moscow appears to have settled on the idea that it is “impossible to tell” which side was responsible. This week a group of families of the MH17 victims wrote an open letter to the Russian people before the World Cup begins in Russia next month.“We are painfully aware of the dark irony that the Russian leaders who will profess to welcome the world with open arms are those who are chiefly to blame for shattering our world,” the letter says. “And that it is these same leaders who have persistently sought to hide the truth, and who have evaded responsibility ever since that dreadful day in July 2014.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3505414.1527073210!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"remaking a country malaysia s new leaders get to work","story":"\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t                                                            Malaysian politician Anwar Ibrahim speaks during a news conference next to his wife Wan Azizah Wan Ismail in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, on May 16th, following his release from prison.

Photograph: Vincent ThianAPMaria Chin Abdullah has faced death threats, detention without trial in solitary confinement and numerous police investigations, as she campaigned against corruption in her native Malaysia. She still faces prosecution for illegal assembly and is banned from travelling to the state of Sarawak in Borneo.Yet Abdullah will today, as she has for the past two weeks, go to work as an MP for Malaysia’s new governing Pakatan Harapan (Alliance of Hope) coalition. The 61-year-old mother of three is a powerful symbol of everything that has changed since the electoral shock on May 9th, when the ruling party was thrown out of power for the first time since independence in 1957.After decades battling human rights abuses by Malaysia’s authoritarian governments, most recently that of former prime minister Najib Razak, she must now confront an arguably bigger challenge: dismantling the old regime and implementing root-and-branch reform in her role as an MP. “For 61 years, it was only criticism but now we have to implement what we say,” says Abdullah. “It’s a tall order as the new coalition is not all homogeneous. Ironing out our differences and the principles of our new democracy will take some years.”The coalition rode a wave of anger against the perceived corruption of the Najib government. It represents one of the most dramatic, bloodless rejections of authoritarian rule in recent global politics, with the United Malays National Organisation (Umno) – in power for more than 60 years – ousted at the ballot box. Even more remarkable is the fact that this reformist revolution was led by former strongman Mahathir Mohamad, prime minister from 1981 to 2003, in alliance with his protégé-turned-nemesis Anwar Ibrahim. As the initial jubilation fades, Mahathir (92), restored as prime minister, faces the monumental task of delivering on his coalition’s promises to repeal repressive laws, reform corrupt institutions and ensure a fairer ision of the economic spoils.Scepticism over his Damascene conversion to participatory democracy is only one of the many hurdles in front of his government.During its long rule, Umno bent the legal system, civil service and state-owned companies to its own ends. But the repression, electoral manipulation and allegations of corruption reached their zenith under Najib, who has been banned from leaving the country after Mahathir launched a new investigation into accusations that billions of dollars were misappropriated from the debt-ridden 1MDB state fund set up by Najib.If Mahathir can get it right, this multi-ethnic nation of 31 million people could become an example in a region beset by repressive governments, reversing a years-long brain drain and transforming the prospects of this emerging market, which has attracted a wide range of global investors.But, from Myanmar to South Africa and Indonesia to Egypt, transitions from authoritarianism to more democratic systems have proved difficult. Anwar, the Pakatan Harapan figurehead freed from prison last week, is under no illusions about the challenge facing him – and Mahathir – if he takes over as prime minister within one or two years, as planned. “I’m a student of history,” he says. “I realise how revolutions and people’s movements have disappointed the masses.”He adds: “The central issue is still governance ... and democratic accountability. We can’t have the election commission involved in a fraudulent exercise, we can’t have the judiciary acting at the behest of the government, we can’t have a media that’s being cowed.”Even critics admit that Mahathir has moved rapidly since he was sworn in on May 10th to start dismantling the system he helped create. The prime minister won a full royal pardon for Anwar, who was first jailed under Mahathir between 1998 and 2004 before he was imprisoned again under Najib in 2015, and secured the departures of the attorney general and head of the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission.He has set up committees to advise on institutional and economic reforms, and to investigate 1MDB, from which at least $4.5 billion was erted and laundered, according to the US Department of Justice.But suspicion remains. Although Mahathir has appointed some leading civil society advocates and technocrats to these committees, he has chosen others, such as economic adviser and former finance minister Daim Zainuddin, who many Malaysians doubt are genuine reformers. His cabinet also contains a mix of opposition stalwarts such as Wan Azizah Wan Ismail, the deputy prime minister and Anwar’s wife, alongside more recent converts to reform such as Muhyiddin Yassin, a former Umno heavyweight and now home affairs minister.Many Pakatan Harapan supporters are giving Mahathir a chance to prove he has changed his spots, after his marshalling of the disparate coalition parties and his popularity with rural Malay voters helped them to win the election against great odds. They say he must maintain the reform momentum in order to keep together his coalition, which includes his Malay-dominated party of Umno defectors, Anwar’s People’s Justice party and the ethnic Chinese-dominated Democratic Action party.“The new government has made a good start but they’re facing a huge task, particularly in terms of legal reform,” says Sevan Doraisamy, executive director of Suaram, a human rights group. Suaram is one of several organisations that waged a decades-long battle to stop the Umno government and the police using vague laws to crush dissent. Last year alone, his organisation documented 155 cases where people faced legal action that violated their freedom of speech and recorded 280 cases of detention without trial under heavily criticised laws. Doraisamy and other activists want the government to institute an immediate moratorium on the use of such laws, before they can be amended or repealed when parliament returns in the next few months. Mahathir showed his new colours by using Twitter to rebuke the police for arresting a man who criticised him on Facebook and promising to review the relevant law when parliament convenes.Amanda Whiting, professor of Malaysian law at the University of Melbourne, says the problem goes far beyond the law itself to a “deeply entrenched” culture of intolerance for criticism and meddling in the judicial process.“There needs to be a cultural shift, they can’t just change the laws,” she says. “There’s a complete lack of trust in some of the major public institutions like the attorney general. There are severe doubts about the probity of decisions made – and the willingness of senior people to bow to pressure – and these are under investigation now.”This culture of corruption, collusion and nepotism has become deeply embedded in Malaysia’s bloated civil service, on which Mahathir has promised to bring the axe, starting with the 17,000 political appointees who served under Najib.Wong Chen, a Pakatan Harapan MP, claims that up to 40 per cent of annual government spending, which is forecast to be $59 billion (€50 billion) this year, is lost to corruption and wastage, with previous Umno governments readily handing out grants and contracts to friendly parties. “The path we need to take is clear,” he says. “The question is: do we have the will?”The allegations of corruption rose markedly under Najib, particularly surrounding 1MDB. At one point, $681 million was paid into Najib’s own bank account, in what he later said was a gift from Saudi royalty, most of which he said he repaid. He has always denied any wrongdoing over 1MDB. Mahathir has gone after his predecessor with zeal, appointing respected anti-graft officials to a task force to investigate possible criminal charges related to the fund. He has authorised the police to conduct extensive searches at properties used by Najib and his family, with several hundred designer handbags and dozens of suitcases full of jewellery, cash and other valuables confiscated from one luxury apartment complex in Kuala Lumpur alone.  Najib’s lawyer has criticised the “cavalier and irresponsible” manner of the police conduct, but Mahathir says the new government is following the rule of law, rather than seeking payback.“If anyone made any mistake, the law will decide, but I’m not going to take revenge in any form,” said Shukri Abdull, the new head of the anti-corruption commission, on Tuesday. The former deputy head of the commission claimed that he was forced out of the organisation during Najib’s reign after receiving death threats for pursuing the 1MDB case. With debt coupons to be paid, Mahathir is under pressure to move fast on 1MDB. New finance minister Lim Guan Eng says that the last government has injected nearly $1.8 billion into 1MDB since April 2017 to cover debt service obligations.“There are a lot of issues,” says one banker in Kuala Lumpur. “They need to identify where all the liabilities are, what shady deals have been done and what is the residual risk.”But Peter Mumford, the Asia director of Eurasia Group, a political risk consultancy, argues that there is a limit to how far the new prime minister will go to tackle corruption. “Mahathir needs to demonstrate he is cleaning up the system, but he will be cautious and selective in draining the swamp,” he says. “There are lots of skeletons in plenty of closets.”The opposition’s anti-graft campaign message was popular because it linked anger at the high cost of living and wide social inequality to the alleged excesses of the Najib administration.In particular, Pakatan Harapan promised to abolish the 6 per cent goods and sales tax introduced by Najib in 2015, to praise from international economists who believed it was wise for the government to ersify its revenue base away from oil production.The GST will be scrapped from June 1st. But the government has yet to come up with concrete plans for how to replace the lost money – which was forecast this year to be around $12 billion, or nearly a fifth of state revenues – or fund other populist pledges, such as reinstating some fuel subsidies and abolishing highway tolls.A senior economic adviser to the government says the rebound in oil prices since 2015 will give Malaysia ample breathing space for now – but not all analysts are convinced.“How are they going to make up for the lost revenues from the GST?” asks Steve Clayton, chief executive of JPMorgan in Malaysia. “There’s a pretty substantial hole to fill.”Mr Mahathir will also have to lay out how he will ensure that the fruits of Malaysia’s rapid economic growth – with gross domestic product expanding by 5.9 per cent last year – are more fairly distributed.Promised reviews – and possible renegotiations – of multibillion-dollar infrastructure projects agreed with the Chinese government as part of President Xi Jinping’s Belt and Road Initiative could help create more local jobs and business opportunities. But redrawing what Mahathir has called “unequal treaties” with China will be tough. Implementing so many sweeping changes at once is complex - and risky. Expectations are high and Malaysians are determined to hold the country’s leaders to account.“Our greatest fear is that the bad habits sneak back in and we end up with UMNO 2.0,” says Baharom, a 52-year-old personal trainer and supporter of Anwar. “But the difference this time is that the people have spoken. If they don’t reform, we will kick them out.”1981: Mahathir Mohamad becomes prime minister for the first time1998: Mahathir sacks Anwar, has him arrested and he is subsequently convicted of corruption and sodomy2003: Mahathir steps down as PM and is replaced by Abdullah Badawi2004: Anwar is released from prison2009: Najib Razak replaces Abdullah as PM and later sets up 1MDB2016: Anwar and Mahathir start reconciliation talks2018 (May): Mahathir elected as PM and frees Anwar, while putting Najib under investigation for corruption – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2018"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3505854.1527092826!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"obscure provision may permit open border if no deal brexit","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBorder at Newry: Prof Federico Fabbrini says the EU could “declare the entire territory of Northern Ireland to be a frontier zone to the EU customs union thereby removing the need for customs controls (at least on the EU side)”. Photograph: Charles McQuillanGettyThe EU could use an obscure provision in an international trade treaty to preserve a frictionless border in Ireland in the aftermath of a no-deal, no-transition Brexit, a new report commissioned by MEPs suggests.The report to the European Parliament Constitutional Affairs Committee on the legal institutional implications of a hard Brexit – a prospect which is unlikely in the current state of negotiations, he suggests – has been prepared by Dublin City University’s energetic Prof Federico Fabbrini, director of its Brexit Institute, and will be presented at a meeting of the committee on Thursday. \u0026nbsp It warns that in the event of a hard, no-deal Brexit in which there was no transition arrangement or withdrawal agreement, from April 1st, 2019, “contingency plans would need to be put in place from the EU side to deal with the sudden emergence of a customs border between Ireland and Northern Ireland”. \u0026nbsp That could be done, he argues, by invoking Article XXIV(3) of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) , which provides for a so-called “frontier traffic exception”. It is one way of doing what four parties in the North have urged in recent days – keeping the North inside the customs union and single market. \u0026nbsp The clause, which has never been used before, allows that custom provisions under the World Trade Organisation regime which would prevail in both the EU and UK in the event of a no-deal Brexit “shall not be construed to prevent: a) advantages accorded by any contracting party to adjacent countries in order to facilitate frontier traffic . . .”This would allow the EU, Fabbrini says, to “declare the entire territory of Northern Ireland to be a frontier zone to the EU customs union thereby removing the need for customs controls (at least on the EU side)”.Whether the 27 remainer states would be willing to allow such a gaping hole in the EU’s external frontier is not clear – they have been most firm to date in their insistence on preserving the “integrity of the single market” and it would immediately raise questions about how to deal with east-west trade across the Irish Sea.Such a policy might also not completely obviate the necessity for border controls to ensure regulatory compliance in areas like veterinaryanimal health standards.Fabbrini’s paper also argues that a hard Brexit would not mean that the UK would not remain obligated in international law to fulfil its commitments to the current EU budget, which runs until the end of 2020. \u0026nbspPrior to the joint report signed in December, some UK politicians insisted that the UK’s obligations to the budget would cease on Brexit. But the UK government conceded in the joint report that it would honour whatever undertakings it had made in the current budget round. \u0026nbsp Although the Brexit talks are based on the principle of “nothing is agreed until everything is agreed”, Fabbrini insists that under the legal principle of “fair play”, “the fact that the UK has already accepted its budgetary responsibilities as a condition of withdrawal implies that the EU will have a strong legal case against the UK for budgetary contributions even in a hard-Brexit scenario”.Although he admits that finding a court with jurisdiction to uphold such an EU case would be difficult, he argues that the UK is unlikely to be willing to test the argument legally.The report also considers the effect of Brexit – whether hard or soft – on the ending of the terms of members of various institutions. Fabbrini argues that UK MEPs should continue to serve after Brexit on March 29th for a further six weeks until the European Parliament concludes its own term and has elections.The UK European commissioner, Julian King, should quit on the 29th, he says. But the UK members of the European Court of Justice should be allowed to finish out their own six-year terms – technically speaking, they do not “represent” inidual states. Leaving them in place, he says, would be “more consistent with the preservation of the constitutional integrity of the ECJ as an institution which has not been tainted by national interests”.Negotiations move to phase II after agreement reached on protecting the rights of citizens in both UK \u0026amp EU, Northern Ireland and the financial settlement of the

pushing a recruitment drive. MI6 chief Alex Younger said it was trying to attract the best candidates including women and members of the black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) communities who previously might not have considered applying.It is about having the widest possible choice of the best talent in the country, he said at a press briefing . I want people who would have never have

100,000 staff will get a pay rise but others are set to miss out, MPs warnSainsbury’s says it is boosting pay for more than 120,000 employees, raising hourly rates from £8 to £9.20, under new contracts but it has come under fire from MPs and staff who say thousands will be left out of pocket due to the changes. \u0026nbspThe company says its workers will receive an average 9.3 per cent pay rise as part of a £110m investment in the group, following a consultation with staff. Sainsbury’s retail and operations director Simon Roberts said: “I believe this is the right thing to do and am proud to be offering such a significant pay boost to over 120,000 store colleagues across the country. “The changes we are introducing from September will make pay and contracts fair and consistent for all of our colleagues, in every store, regardless of age or length of service. ”However, the contract changes that will introduce the new pay rates also mean staff will no longer be paid for breaks. The new deal will also get rid of a discretionary bonus scheme previously available for hourly paid workers, and premium pay rates for night shift work will be restricted to between midnight and 5am.One Sainsbury’s worker told the Independent that many staff felt they were being given an ultimatum over the contracts, and because many of those affected are older workers, there are concerns about their ability to find new jobs. The supermarket is also reducing the number of types of contracts it offers, moving from 22 specific roles, to five broader contracts. The Sainsbury’s staff member said: “It’s a dogsbody contract - instead of being on different contracts we’ll be on one general contract. So they’ll be able to ask us to do whatever they want.”Siobhain McDonagh, MP for Mitcham and Morden, has been campaigning on behalf of a group of around 9,000 workers, who she says will actually lose money under the new rules. Earlier this week, a letter written by Ms McDonagh and signed by more than 100 MPs was sent to the prime minister, asking her to take action. “We are disappointed that 9,000 members of the most loyal staff are going to receive a pay cut,” she told the Independent on Thursday. “We suspect that a lot of them are older and have probably given years of service.“They shouldn’t be hit because they are loyal and hard working and work the unpopular hours.”Ms McDonagh added: “How can a company that made pre-tax profit of £589m last year, with a CEO that receives £930,000 before bonuses, think it is right to force a pay cut on thousands of their most long-standing and loyal members of staff? It’s not right and it’s not British to ask people to work well for less.”Sainsbury’s has said it will include top-up payments for up to 18 months in order to ensure that no workers take a pay cut. After the 18-month period, the company will conduct another pay review. A spokesperson for the supermarket said: “If you look at the retail environment it’s tough out there, as we’ve seen in the announcement from M\u0026ampS this week (the retailer revealed plans to close 100 stores), whereas what we are doing is offering a significant pay rise and we are disappointed that it’s being misrepresented in this way.”Meanwhile, following Sainsbury’s CEO Mike Coupe’s pledge that no jobs would be lost as a result of the proposed merger with Asda, Ms McDonagh said she hoped regulators would seek that assurance in writing. “We already have experience of companies like Kraft making commitments that, when the ink’s dry on the deal, they forget,” she added. or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

More than three in five (63 per cent) “outstanding” grammar schools have not been inspected for six or more years, compared to just over a third (36 per cent) of “outstanding” non-selective schools.The number of complaints made to Ofsted from parents about schools has more than doubled in the last decade, reaching approximately 11,000 a year, Mr Tryl added.Despite concerns about the figures, Ofsted officials said that inspectors will go into “outstanding schools” if there are safeguarding concerns, dramatic fall in results, or a serious complaint.The NAO report added that Ofsted has struggled to meet targets amid falling budgets and high staff turnover – and that the lack of reliable data means it cannot show it provides value for money.Almost two decades ago, a team of 16 inspectors used to go into every secondary school – regardless of their previous rating – for a whole week typically every six years, Ofsted officials said.Now “good” schools get two inspectors for one day approximately every four years, and up to four inspectors for a couple of days if it is in special measures, with reinspection within 30 months.The report found that Ofsted did not meet its target to reinspect schools graded as inadequate, where the quality of education provision is most at risk, in 78 cases.Ofsted also failed to meet its legal target of inspecting a school within five years of last inspection in 43 cases between 2012-13 and 2016-17, the NAO found.In 32 cases it had incorrectly treated expanded or amalgamated schools as new schools in the remaining 11 it deferred on the basis of exceptional circumstances.School inspectors provide only a “snapshot” of standards rather than the “comprehensive picture” they did around two decades ago, officials said, and they cited slashed budgets as one of the reasons behind this.Ofsted spent 52 per cent less in real terms in 2017-18 than it did in 1999-2000.Teachers criticise ‘Islamophobic’ Ofsted approach to hijabs in schoolsOfsted to be given new powers to crack down on illegal schools Over-stretched schools ‘shovelling’ children back to parentsUK news in picturesUK news in picturesAlastair Cook batting against Pakistan during the first test match of the summer at Lord’s cricket ground, London.

We have repeatedly made clear that we want to ensure accountability is proportionate, helps to ensure standards in our schools are high and does not distract high-performing schools from what matters most – teaching and providing an excellent education.“If Ofsted has reason to believe a school is no longer meeting its previous high standards, we would expect it to use its powers to carry out a full inspection – this has always been the case – and remains so.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Is the adoption of other people\u0027s customs and cultures fair game or has political correctness gone mad?\u0026nbspDavid Barnett treads warily\u0026nbspLet’s get this out of the way: I am a straight, white, middle-aged man, so what follows you may take with a pinch of salt or disregard completely. But we’re going to talk, you and I, about the thorny issue of cultural appropriation.It was only a year ago that Oxford Dictionaries put the phrase into their official lexicons, with the definition, “the unacknowledged or inappropriate adoption of the customs, practices, ideas, etc. of one people or society by members of another and typically more dominant people or society.”Cultural appropriation is sometimes so blatant it smacks us in the face. The Black and White Minstrel Show ran on British television for – what seems now to us, looking back at it – and astonishing 20 years, from 1958.Even halfway through its run the show, in which white entertainers “blacked up” to sing songs in a Deep South of America style, was the subject of petitions calling for it to be taken off the air because of its in-your-face racism. It can hardly be seen now without an overwhelming feeling of embarrassment. How did we ever think that was acceptable?The show was harking back to the minstrel shows in 19th-century America, and blackface was a popular form of entertainment until the enlightenment of the 1960s, coupled with rising racial tensions across the US, finally put paid to it. Even Al Jolson, dubbed “the world’s greatest entertainer”, was renowned for performing in blackface. Jolson was Jewish, and while there can never be any excuses made today for blacking up, it’s interesting that in their 2008 book the Encyclopedia of American Jewish History, authors Stephen Harlan Norwood and Eunice G Pollack talk of Jolson’s 1927 movie The Jazz Singer in terms which suggest some kind of what we would today call intersectionality. For example: “Is there any incongruity in this Jewish boy with his face painted like a Southern Negro singing in the Negro dialect? No, there is not…The son of a line of rabbis well knows how to sing the songs of the most cruelly wronged people in the world\u0027s history.”Can a Jewish man really pretend to be a black man without racism? Is this cultural appropriation of the very worst kind or solidarity that only two historically subjugated peoples can appreciate? And what, then, of a Jewish woman who dresses up as a Japanese woman for entertainment?The cries of “cultural appropriation” were resounding around social media even before Netta Barzilai had finished her (ultimately competition-winning) performance of Toys, the Israeli entry in this month’s Eurovision song contest held in Lisbon.Netta wore a stylised kimono and was surrounded by dozens of maneki neko waving lucky cat statues. Twitter in particular was rather exercised by the thought of the cultural appropriation taking place before its very eyes. Or, I should say, mainly white Western Twitter. It seems the only people not too fussed were the Japanese themselves.According to the website soranews24, which repackages and discusses Japanese news stories for an English speaking audience, the overwhelming response on the ground seems to be a mildly nonplussed reaction.The site quoted from Japanese social media accounts which included the responses, “Culture is meant to be stolen. If it’s not worth stealing, then it isn’t culture”, “If people keep claiming ‘cultural appropriation’ then people will not touch our culture. Then, people will not understand our culture and it will be easier to become our enemy”, and, perhaps crucially, “Westerners care too much about silly things”.Is that the problem? Are we, Westerners, liberal Westerners, too over-sensitive of the feelings of others brought on by white guilt? Or are we right to call out what we think is wrong when we see it? Should we wait before speaking, to see what the actual people affected think? Or is it our duty to step in first?Perhaps it’s now we should go back to the Oxford Dictionaries definition of cultural appropriation, particularly the bit that talks about the “more dominant people or society”. Is Israel a more dominant culture than Japan? Or vice-versa? What do we think? What do they think?A couple of weeks before Eurovision, Eastern dress was setting Twitter alight again, this time when a Utah teenager posted online pictures of her wearing her prom dress which was actually a qipao, traditional Chinese dress. The 18-year-old was accused of cultural appropriation and casual racism. People of Chinese heritage chimed in with arguments on both sides of the debate, with some pointing out that the outfit was originally worn by women carrying out domestic duties, and thus not something to be really celebrated, and another writing, “I’m Asian and Chinese, you looked beautiful in that dress, I’m sorry you got bashed for it.”Cyprus\u0027 singer Eleni Foureira performs the song FuegoIsrael\u0027s singer Netta performs the song Toy Belgium\u0027s singer Sennek performs the song A Matter Of Time Estonia\u0027s singer Elina Nechayeva performs the song La ForzaCroatia\u0027s singer Franka performs the song Crazy Albania\u0027s singer Eugent Bushpepa performs the song MallCzech Republic\u0027s singer Mikolas Josef performs the song Lie To MeIreland\u0027s singer Ryan O\u0027Shaughnessy performs the song TogetherSwiss duo ZIBBZ\u0027s singer Corinne Gfeller performs the song StonesBulgarian group Equinox\u0027 singer Zhana Bergendorff (R) performs the song BonesLithuania\u0027s singer Ieva Zasimauskaite performs the song When We\u0027re OldFinland\u0027s singer Saara Aalto performs the song MonstersGreece\u0027s singer Yianna Terzi performs the song Oniro MouAustria\u0027s singer Cesar Sampson performs the song Nobody But YouAzerbaijan\u0027s singer Aisel performs the song X My HeartIceland\u0027s singer Ari Olafsson performs the song Our ChoiceArmenia\u0027s singer Sevak Khanagyan performs the song QamiMacedonian duo Eye Cue\u0027s lead vocalist Marija Ivanovska (R) and guitarist Bojan Trajkovski perform the song Lost And FoundBelarus\u0027 singer Alekseev performs the song ForeverNorway\u0027s singer Alexander Rybak performs the song That\u0027s How You Write A SongRomanian band The Humans perform the song GoodbyeSerbia\u0027s band Sanja Ilic \u0026amp Balkanika perform the song Nova DecaSan Marino\u0027s Jessika featuring Jenifer Brening perform the song Who We AreDenmark\u0027s singer Rasmussen performs the song Higher GroundPoland\u0027s singer Gromee feat.

The fashion shows routinely feature collections riffing off a range of global cultures. For the coming autumn, Gucci recently unveiled a series of headwear inspired by Sikh turbans. Vogue ran a photoshoot in its “Diversity Issue” last year with a model in full Japanese geisha outfit. Not unusual, and perhaps nothing wrong with it… save for in both cases (and in the Victoria’s Secret show last year in which a model flaunted a Native American-style headdress) all the models were white.Here’s where cultural appropriation smacks up against representation. Maybe if Victoria’s Secret had employed a Native American model, if Vogue had used a Japanese model, if Gucci had – as the Sikh Coalition suggested in the aftermath – used Sikh models who would have properly observed the correct way to wear what is, after all, a sacred clothing item, then the later dissemination of these items on to the high street might not be quite so problematic.There’s a difference, too, between fashion and performance. When I was very young, on a holiday at a Pontin’s camp on the North-West coast, I was wrapped in a blanket, had two stripes of lipstick put across my face, and a feather from a passing seagull taped to my head. I was entered into the fancy dress contest (I didn’t win). I was of course, a Red Indian, as Native Americans were called in those less-enlightened times.As bad as the Black and White Minstrels? Possibly. But “Red Indians” back then were almost a fictional, fairytale group of people, the image drawn from Monday matinee westerns not renowned for historical accuracy, from Peter Pan, from Hiawatha and Little Plum. Would I have dressed my children like that when they were the same age? Undoubtedly not. Times change. Sensitivities alter.Utah teenager, Keziah Daum, sparked a huge debate on Twitter about cultural appropriation after posting photos of her traditional Chinese prom dressAnd I look down at what I’m wearing right now as I type this. A T-shirt, which has its origins as an undergarment in 19th-century America. A pair of jeans, which were originally developed in Italy (Genoa, which gave rise to “jeans”) and France (the fabric of Nimes, or de Nimes, from which is derived “denim”). A pair of flip-flops (don’t judge me), evolved from the Japanese zōri which servicemen took back to America post-Second World War (though early flip-flops have been discovered in ancient Egyptian burial sites).I am a melange of styles borrowed, begged and stolen from around the world. Is this cultural appropriation, several generations down the line? Should I be wearing what my grandfathers wore? Polyester slacks and an Oxford shirt, a cardigan, brogues? Where is the line, and on which side of it are we?Music is another cultural appropriation battleground. Every time Katy Perry or Taylor Swift goes “ghetto” for another video, or Lana Del Ray puts on a Native American headdress, it’s there to see. White folks stole rock’n’roll from African rhythms filtered through the American South, we stole electronic dance music from the predominantly-black post-disco clubs of Chicago and Detroit, and Italy. Take away the cultural appropriation, and what’s left? A couple of rousing choruses of Knees Up, Mother Brown or The Lambeth Walk, perhaps.Should we talk about food? Those great British traditions such as pizza, or chow mein, or curry? A few miles from me, Bradford is awash with curry houses. The clientele is largely white. Is that cultural appropriation? Well, no, because most of the restaurants are owned and worked in by people of South Asian heritage. But what was deemed cultural appropriation was when, earlier this year, a restaurant called Fanny’s announced it was opening a venue for the purveying of “posh kebabs” in London’s Stoke Newington.The move was lambasted on Twitter because, for one, Stoke Newington is a hub for Turkish restaurants and takeaways… the people who, you know, invented the kebab. For another, because the people behind Fanny’s weren’t Turkish (one of the founders is called Claude Compton, for your information), and the tag-line “posh kebabs” intimated that these “lads from Fulham” were basically going to beat the Turks at their own game (as a side note, Fanny’s subsequently dropped the “posh” bit from their marketing and logo).Fanny\u0027s Kebabs finally dropped the \u0027posh\u0027 bit from their marketing (fannyskebabsInstagram)If you’ve made it this far, you might be wondering where I’m heading with all this. And the honest answer is, I just don’t know. Cultural appropriation seems, on the face of it, like it should be something that all of us should fight against, but the flip-side of that is knowing exactly just what it is and when we should call it out.As I said at the top of this piece, take what I say with a pinch of salt, given that I am a middle-aged white man. But where does that leave me, if we remove years of embedded cultural appropriation? Dressed in my grandad’s clothes, listening to a 78 of George Formby classics, and clutching a chip butty? And on that score, should I be calling cultural appropriation on the New York magazine The Insider’s awestruck piece last month on a Turkish restaurant that was selling this remarkable new thing, a sandwich stuffed with fries?The answer’s no, of course, because cultural appropriation will never affect me in the way it does other, marginalised people. I have working-class roots but I’m still pretty close to the top of the privilege chain all I can realistically get away with is some faux outrage at posh kids slumming it at Wetherspoons and Greggs for Instagram likes.But maybe those who identify as white, liberal allies should hit the pause button before calling out cultural appropriation, and just take a moment to think. The obvious stuff, the outright horror of the Black and White Minstrels and the more subtle but by no means any less problematic racism, yes, by all means, dig in. Dog-piling on teenagers for wearing a prom dress, maybe hold off a bit.Cultural appropriation is a big desert, and one on which we might have to draw our own personal lines in the sand as to what we know in our guts is wrong, and what we think might be, possibly, a little bit off.And with that, I bid you sayonara.Black and White minstralsor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Sainsbury’s retail and operations director Simon Roberts said: “I believe this is the right thing to do and am proud to be offering such a significant pay boost to over 120,000 store colleagues across the country. “The changes we are introducing from September will make pay and contracts fair and consistent for all of our colleagues, in every store, regardless of age or length of service. ”However, the contract changes that will introduce the new pay rates also mean staff will no longer be paid for breaks. The new deal will also get rid of a discretionary bonus scheme previously available for hourly paid workers, and premium pay rates for night shift work will be restricted to between midnight and 5am.One Sainsbury’s worker told the Independent that many staff felt they were being given an ultimatum over the contracts, and because many of those affected are older workers, there are concerns about their ability to find new jobs. The supermarket is also reducing the number of types of contracts it offers, moving from 22 specific roles, to five broader contracts. The Sainsbury’s staff member said: “It’s a dogsbody contract - instead of being on different contracts we’ll be on one general contract. So they’ll be able to ask us to do whatever they want.”Siobhain McDonagh, MP for Mitcham and Morden, has been campaigning on behalf of a group of around 9,000 workers, who she says will actually lose money under the new rules. Earlier this week, a letter written by Ms McDonagh and signed by more than 100 MPs was sent to the prime minister, asking her to take action. “We are disappointed that 9,000 members of the most loyal staff are going to receive a pay cut,” she told the Independent on Thursday. “We suspect that a lot of them are older and have probably given years of service.“They shouldn’t be hit because they are loyal and hard working and work the unpopular hours.”Ms McDonagh added: “How can a company that made pre-tax profit of £589m last year, with a CEO that receives £930,000 before bonuses, think it is right to force a pay cut on thousands of their most long-standing and loyal members of staff? It’s not right and it’s not British to ask people to work well for less.”Sainsbury’s has said it will include top-up payments for up to 18 months in order to ensure that no workers take a pay cut. After the 18-month period, the company will conduct another pay review. A spokesperson for the supermarket said: “If you look at the retail environment it’s tough out there, as we’ve seen in the announcement from M\u0026ampS this week (the retailer revealed plans to close 100 stores), whereas what we are doing is offering a significant pay rise and we are disappointed that it’s being misrepresented in this way.”Meanwhile, following Sainsbury’s CEO Mike Coupe’s pledge that no jobs would be lost as a result of the proposed merger with Asda, Ms McDonagh said she hoped regulators would seek that assurance in writing. “We already have experience of companies like Kraft making commitments that, when the ink’s dry on the deal, they forget,” she added. or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

The two stars are a mere 20 kilometres apart – but they are around 6,500 light years from Earth.One of the stars is a cool, lightweight star called a brown dwarf. The other is an energetic, strange and spinning star known as a pulsar.Scientists spot strange lasers coming towards Earth from \u0027space ant\u0027The gas coming out of the brown dwarf appears to be magnifying the energy from the pulsar, and sending out a bright streak of radiation.The gas is acting as like a magnifying glass right in front of the pulsar, says Robert Main, lead author of the paper describing the observation being published May 24 in the journal Nature. We are essentially looking at the pulsar through a naturally occurring magnifier which periodically allows us to see the two regions separately.The pulsar could eventually destroy the brown dwarf. They are locked together in a system sometimes called a black widow – just as those spiders eat their mates, the pulsars are thought to kill the stars they are attached to.The discovery could help explain fast radio bursts, the intense blasts of radiation that are occasionally sent down to Earth. Those powerful signals are until now entirely unexplained – and have prompted suggestions that they are the result of either undiscovered physics or even artificial technology.Many observed properties of FRBs could be explained if they are being amplified by plasma lenses, say Main. The properties of the amplified pulses we detected in our study show a remarkable similarity to the bursts from the repeating FRB, suggesting that the repeating FRB may be lensed by plasma in its host galaxy.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

The footage is about MI6 spies and the next scene should be of an action James Bond type in a dramatic fight for survival. Instead, the camera pans out to show an aquarium and the visitors a woman reassuring her alarmed child.MI6’s first ever television advertisement is aimed at attracting recruits from ethnic minority communities and women and breaking stereotypes. The message is that the officer from the Secret Intelligence Service is not a macho white man, but the young black mother.MI6 are in the process of relaxing their rules of entry to reach the new recruitment pools. An official said: “We are making our Services’ nationality rules slightly more flexible to support our ersity agenda and a wider selection of candidates.”Blair denies knowledge of man tortured in Libya after MI6 renditionThere are no problems with getting people to join, say MI6, with 800 more staff due to be taken on to add to the current approximate strength of 2,700. There was a rush of applications after the nerve agent attack in Salisbury on Sergei and Yulia Skripal, something which tends to happen after high-profile cases involving terrorism and espionage.The aim of the campaign is to reach people who may not see the Secret Intelligence Service as a natural career. The voiceover for the advertisement says: We are intelligence officers, but we don’t do what you think. It is not keeping your cool in the shark tank, it is picking up the silent cues that matter. Secretly, we are just like you.”MI6 have won a number of awards in recent years for promoting gender and ethnic equality. Latest figures, however, show that progress needs to be made on both racial and gender balance. Overall, women make up 24.1 per cent in the senior civil service grade and 37.8 per cent among the non senior category. There is not a single black or other ethnic minority member of the service\u0027s senior staff and that group makes up just 6.8 per cent of the non-senior workforce.The advertisement will be first shown on Thursday evening. Alex Younger, the MI6 Chief, said at a preview for journalists: “I want to dispel the myths that still too often see potential candidates rule themselves out. The service I am proud to lead is global, modern and most capable with a deserved reputation of being one of the best intelligence services in the world.“My message remains simple, there is no ‘standard’ MI6 officer: if you have what it takes, then apply to join us. Our work is exciting, intellectually challenging and it matters. Regardless of background, if you have the skills we need and share our values, I want you to consider a career in intelligence in a service that reflects today’s society, MI6 needs the best people this country has to offer.”UK news in picturesUK news in picturesAlastair Cook batting against Pakistan during the first test match of the summer at Lord’s cricket ground, London.

She said: “I wanted a change after the birth of my third child. I wanted to do something that made a difference and this absolutely ticked that. Joining the service and serving the country seemed to be a worthwhile thing to do. I have found combining my job with my family life very manageable, certainly compared to the commercial world, which can be quite inflexible.”“I was apprehensive at first, I thought one of the requirements for the job was the ability to blend into the crowd, to be a grey man, which is not me, of course, at any level. But I find what I do interesting. I have been able to work against a full range of targets. I can put my views forward, challenge group think. I have been able to use my difference to my advantage.A senior director who had been 20 years with MI6 said an awareness of the need to be more inclusive “has been a process of evolution”.

Sir Ivan Rogers, the UK’s old ambassador to the EU, was criticised after he advised ministers in 2016 that leaving the EU would take around 10 years. He stepped down from his post shortly after.The EU says under the December agreement just Northern Ireland would stay in full alignment with the single market and customs union to prevent a hard border, while UK negotiators say they actually agreed that the whole UK would do so. The relevant text is somewhat ambiguous as to what was agreed.EU officials do not want the backstop to apply to the whole UK because it would give Britain access to the single market without having to uphold the so-called “four freedom” or submitting to the European Court of Justice. The UK says it cannot accept the backstop only applying to NI because that would create a potential customs border between Great Britain and NI  – which the DUP oppose. Theresa May has relied on the DUP for her majority in the House of Commons since she called an election and lost seats last year.The time-limiting element has now been introduced by the UK because Cabinet Brexiteers like Boris Johnson fear that an indefinite backstop could be a backdoor way of keeping the UK aligned with the EU in perpetuity. Ministers have publicly confirmed that a time-limited backstop is on the way.Brexit threatens life on the Irish border: in picturesBrexit threatens life on the Irish border: in picturesJohn Murphy flies the European flag outside his home near the border village of Forkhill, Co ArmaghAn abandoned shop is seen in Mullan, Co Monaghan.

They say commitments already made by British negotiators in December – that the backstop would apply “unless and until” another solution is found – rule out a time-limit.The UK’s transition is designed to give officials more time to come up with another solution to solve the border – but means there would be yet another cliff-edge.A Government spokesperson did not deny the reports of the plan, only telling The Independent: “We\u0027re not going to be drawn on speculation – the PM has said we will bring forward our plans on the backstop shortly.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

And if that is the wish, then clearly such a poll would happen. I’m not asking for it, I’m not advocating it.“What I’m asking for is a return to the fullness of the Good Friday Agreement which would open up the opportunities and possibilities for the future of Ireland as a whole. That is the point of the Good Friday Agreement, not direct rule, not imposition of a political view from Westminster, but devolution of powers to Stormont here, and of course, the relationship with the Republic. And it’s quite clear that it’s there for a poll on both sides of the border, should that be something that is demanded.”Following his initial comments, Downing Street was quick to highlight that Theresa May “has been absolutely clear about her commitment to the Union on a number of occasions”.In his speech at Queen’s University Belfast, marking 20 years since the referendums that endorsed the Good Friday Agreement, Mr Corbyn called for the revival of power sharing at Stormont.To help end the deadlock, Mr Corbyn called on the UK government to reconvene the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference, which is provided for in the Good Friday Agreement.DUP MP Sammy Wilson threatens the party will pull support from Theresa May’s government if she backs down over post-Brexit Irish borderHe declared that “Labour will not support any Brexit deal that includes a return to a hard border on this island.”The leader argued that Labour’s proposed new “comprehensive UK-EU customs union, with a British say on future trade deals and arrangements, coupled with a new, strong relationship with the single market would prevent communities being ided”.But the SDLP has already written to all Labour MPs urging them to defy Mr Corbyn’s will and back a plan to stay in the single market, saying it is the only way to avoid a hard border.Brexit threatens life on the Irish border: in picturesBrexit threatens life on the Irish border: in picturesJohn Murphy flies the European flag outside his home near the border village of Forkhill, Co ArmaghAn abandoned shop is seen in Mullan, Co Monaghan.

The agency emailed a notice to all US citizens in China about the employee at the consulate in Guangzhou who said there were “subtle and vague, but abnormal, sensations of sound and pressure”. It advised Americans to contact medical professionals if they experience any “unusual auditory or sensory of phenomena accompanied by unusual sounds or piercing noises”. The incident harkens back to when nearly two dozen US employees working in Havana had sought medical treatment between December 2016 to May 2017 for headaches, ear pain, dizziness, and hearing issues. Symptoms, sounds and sensations reportedly varied dramatically from person to person. Some have permanent hearing loss or concussions, while others suffered nausea, headaches and ear-ringing. Some are struggling with concentration or common word recall, The Associated Press has reported.A subsequent FBI investigation did not reveal evidence of a “sonic attack”. However, the reports put the largest strain on US-Cuba relations since former president Barack Obama forged closer ties in 2014. Recording of \u0027sonic weapon attack\u0027 on US diplomats in Cuba releasedBetween September and October 2017, US President Donald Trump expelled 17 Cuban diplomats from the US, ordered US staff in Havana to come back, and issued a travel warning to the small, island nation - all implying the administration believed Cuba had some role in the mysterious illnesses of the diplomats. Cuba, for its part, denied any wrongdoing and attributed the illnesses to a possible psychological cause. The State Department said it is not aware of any similar situations in China and did not identify the person who reported the systems or when that information was relayed to the agency.

The Home Office remains tight-lipped and government spokesmen have offered little of substance. Visa applications are “rigorous and proper”, Downing Street has suggested, while a security minister has noted that “more cases over the next few weeks could be on their way”. Many questions remain – has Mr Abramovich been denied a visa? If so, on what grounds? Is this a demonstration of muscle before the inevitable new documents are issued? Or has this been directed by Downing Street?Roman Abramovich must reveal finances to get back into the UKAnd this, says the Russian exile businessman Vladimir Ashurkov, is highly problematic. “If the British are trying to send out a message, it is a really weak one,” he says. “Mr Abramovich is one of richest men in Britain, owns a football club, and is a prominent public figure. The public deserves to know what the government really thinks about him.” Mr Abramovich has held British visas for several years. But the rules on his Tier 1 investor visa were tightened in 2015, after his last renewal. Applicants now have to show that £2m of the investments they make into the UK are from legal sources.The oligarch is unlikely to have much problem in doing this, if that is indeed the only hurdle he has to leap. But whatever the British decision actually is, it suffers for being non-transparent, says the author and security expert Mark Galeotti. It would be one thing if he was targetted for being a Russian oligarch, and quite another if the government was acting on intelligence.“If they have some specific information about Abramovich, they should make it public, so the punishment actually has some deterrent effect,” he says. It is also unclear whether the British government decided to move against Mr Abramovich because of coincidence – a visa renewal so soon after Skripal – or due to his proximity to power. Russia warns UK it is \u0027playing with fire and will be sorry\u0027 over Salisbury spy poisoningMr Abramovich is considered to be very close to the Kremlin, but he is not unique in that regard, and is not quite in Vladimir Putin’s inner circle.But the oligarch is also considered a reliable go-to and source of finance for many projects, says Valery Solovei, Professor at the Moscow State Institute of International Relations. And that link has been enough for Moscow to draw its own conclusions. World news in picturesWorld news in picturesPeople protest outisde the Tamil Nadu House after at least 10 people were killed when police fired on protesters seeking closure of plant on environmental grounds in town of Thoothukudi in southern state of Tamil Nadu, in New Delhi.People demonstrate in Paris during a nationwide day protest by French public sector employees and public servants against the overhauls proposed by French President Emmanuel Macron, calling them an attack by the centrist leader against civil services as well as their economic security.Newly appointed Catalan president Quim Torra arrives to visit jailed Catalan separatist politicians at the Estremera jail near Madrid.Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro casts his vote during the presidential elections in Caracas.

By attacking Russia’s vulnerabilities – the nexus of money and politics – the conflict with Britain has become not only serious, but also highly personal. “The mood in the Kremlin is that they want to have nothing more with this British government,” he says. “There is no way back for Theresa May or Boris Johnson as far as Moscow is concerned they are waiting for the next elections.” Why it’s a big problem for Putin if the Balkan countries enter the EUThe British moves have been heavily ridiculed in state propaganda. News programmes have suggested the UK is out to punish Russia, whatever the grounds, with Theresa May portrayed as the main bogeywoman. “The average Russian isn’t going to shed tears over poor oligarchs, but the lack of clear reasons has allowed the Kremlin can put whatever spin they want on it,” says Mr Galeotti. “But the rich Russians who once thought London was open to them have begun will now look to find somewhere to go. It doesn’t modify behaviour at all.”  Following tightened legislation and warnings of an impending crackdown, hundreds of millions of pounds of Russian cash has already left British shores over recent months. The trend looks set to continue. “The UK was once considered a safe haven for Russians, but no more,” says Mr Solovei. “Well-off Russians have begun to look for other places to put their cash, nervous about the possibility of new and unpredictable sanctions.” John Woodcock disagrees over comment Jeremy Corbyn was ‘a robust critic of the Russian governmentt for more than 20 years’A parliamentary report published on Monday raised the prospect of a further strengthening of the sanctions regime against Russia. It claimed “dirty money” was in danger of undermining the reputation of the City of London. In its most radical sections, it suggested coordinated moves to make it harder for Russia to raise money on the markets. One of the people interviewed for that report, Mr Ashurkov, said that it is unlikely the UK would gain broad agreement for a move that would likely enrage Moscow further. “That, at present, seems an unwarranted step,” he said. or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

And the politicians realise the scaremongering isn\u0026rsquot working.\u0026ldquoOf course Britain can be successful after Brexit, we were before and we will be again.When asked whether this signalled the failure of Project Fear, Mr Moreland said: \u0026ldquoI would hope so.

The remaining 35 per cent were uncertain.There was more good news for Mrs May when considering the fate of the UK-based workforce itself. When asked whether British workers will become \u0026ldquoless talented and skilled after Brexit, 39 per cent of respondents disagreed while just 31 per cent agreed.And while 35 per cent of people agreed they were \u0026ldquoworried about the lack of up-skilling of the UK workforce after Brexit, 36 per cent said they were unsure while a further 29 per cent said they did not agree.Outside of London\u0026rsquos Remain bubble, confidence in the UK\u0026rsquos economic future was particularly high.When asked \u0026ldquodo you believe high-skilled jobs will leave the UK for the EU?, 37 per cent of respondents in London said yes.This figure shrunk to 33 per cent in Manchester, 32 per cent in Glasgow, 29 per cent in Newcastle and just 19 per cent in Birmingham - where Brexiteers outnumbered Remainers in June 2016\u0026rsquos in-out referendum.The poll also showed a difference of opinions when broken down by gender. Women, for the large part, appeared more positive about the future of Britain\u0026rsquos economy than men.Just 11 per cent of women, compared to 17 per cent of men, said they were considering leaving the UK after Brexit.

He said EU companies would have to pay a similar amount, doubling the cost to \u0026pound13bn.In addition to these cost business taking steps to meet EU regulation would cost \u0026ldquoseveral billion pounds more and in doing so take the overall cost to around \u0026pound17bn to \u0026pound20bn.Mr Thompson also said that it wold take between three and five years to implement Britain\u0026rsquos new customs arrangement depending on which model was chosen but was hopeful there would be a \u0026ldquofunctioning border by January 2021."},{"url":"https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/1/183x122/964590_1.jpg","title":"brexit theresa may european union transition period hard border northern ireland","story":"She will propose another transition covering customs and trade that will follow the period already agreed that will run until the end of 2020.This proposal has not been tabled in Brussels yet and could face stiff opposition from EU negotiators and Brexit-backing Conservative MPs.The Prime Minister will ask European bosses for a customs and regulatory alignment implementation period from 2021 to 2023 at the earliest in order to avoid infrastructure and checks at the Northern Irish border, according to The Times.Under the latest proposal, Britain would impose EU external tariffs, follow the customs code and implement regulatory alignment on industrial goods.There could be a separate all-Ireland agreement that would see some checks on farm products going to Ireland from the mainland.

and it went up to £7.38 from April 1, 2018.The wage increased from £5.60 to £5.90 for 18 to 20-year-olds, and from £4.05 to £4.20 for under 18s.However, apprentices were only entitled to £3.50 if they are under-19 - this increased to £3.70 from April 1, 2018.In April 2018, the minimum wage for 25-year-olds rose from £7.50 to £7.83 an hour.The national limits are legally binding.Anyone who thinks they are not getting the National Living Wage or National Minimum Wage should complain to their employer in the first instance.If this does not get anywhere, the next step is to take the complaint to HMRC who will investigate.Those who are self-employed, voluntary workers, company directors and family members who live in the home of the employer and do household chores do not qualify for either rate.There is no difference in pay for those that live in London compared to elsewhere.The only discrepancy is for people working in agriculture or horticulture.Workers already employed before October 1, 2013 are entitled to the pay set under their contract of employment.This is a voluntary scheme aiming to recognise the actual cost of living, to which 3,000 employers have signed up.Under it, the lowest rate of pay is calculated according to the cost of living in the UK based on the changing cost of a basket of groceries.The amount is set by the charity Living Wage Foundation, and accredited employers include local authorities, NHS trusts, banks, retailers, charities and construction companies.The foundations calculations put the real Living Wage at £8.75 an hour - and £10.20 in London.These rates also apply to over-18s in recognition that young people face the same living costs as everyone else.And while companies are not legally entitled to pay more than the National Living and Minimum Wages, those which have signed up to the real Living Wage scheme have pledged to pay all workers those rates.The rate is calculated every November, and accredited employers are committed to any increases.While theres no legal obligation for your employer to pay you more than the National Living Wage (£7.50 from April 1, 2017), if your company is accredited by the Living Wage Foundation you should be receiving more than that.The foundations head of partnerships Graham Griffiths said anyone concerned can use their online whistleblowing service, and any employer not adhering to the Real Living Wage faced losing its accreditation.Graham said one area where it was challenging to pay the living wage were retail and hospitality but pointed to Ikea, Aldi and Lidl, which have agreed to pay the same rate.The scheme was launched in 2001 by parents in East London, and the foundation was set up in 2011.In 2005 following a growing interest from employers, the Greater London Authority established the Living Wage Unit to calculate what the lowest pay should ideally be.In 2008 Trust for London selected the scheme as a special initiative and made a grant of more than £1million to campaign for it and set up an accreditation scheme for employers.In April 2016 it became the inspiration for the governments higher minimum wage rate, which it rebranded the National Living Wage.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Nobody would believe that.Yet the happy couple set aside family rows, petty jealousies and drunken sabotage and basked in the warm embrace of an adoring public.Windsor’s Disney-style ceremony was watched in broad daylight north of the equator and the middle of the night Down Under by happy viewers of all races and creeds.There is a message here for us all.Harry and Meghan’s wedding did more than unite this nation in sympathy and affection for a popular prince and the love of his life. It showed this country is world class.The sub-plot, of course, was the emotional union between the damaged children of two broken families.Fans have long yearned for Prince Harry to find happiness after the roller-coaster life and shocking death of his fabled mother, Princess Diana.They have warmed to a young man who transformed himself from a mixed-up kid to a likeable soldier, helicopter pilot and champion of war-damaged Invictus casualties.As for his bride, Meghan Markle is the glamorous star of hit TV series Suits, who dreamed as a child of becoming a princess.Best of all in this age of right-on political correctness, she is the daughter of a charming African-American mother and an Emmy-winning Hollywood lighting specialist.The House of Windsor is now truly multicultural.It is also hip.Our amazing sovereign, at 92, and doughty Prince Philip, 96, both heading for their royal telegrams, are the Queen and King of Cool.Where else in the world would you see an Elton John double act with Windy City preacher Bishop Michael Curry?This was a truly uplifting occasion, worn lightly by a once-stuffy Royal Family.Nobody does it better when it comes to choreographing mounted cavalry, trumpets, banners and horse-drawn carriages with an electric-powered E-Type and a vintage Rolls-Royce.All underscored by a sense of humour, as Harry and his supportive brother William exchanged banter at the altar of Windsor’s historic St George’s Chapel.Even the weather turned out in tribute, bathing Windsor Great Park’s glorious greenery in spring sunshine.There may have been some muffled coughs over Markle family squabbles but they were nothing compared with the torrid dramas leading to the Queen’s own “annus horribilis”.The world has become used to British pageantry.But this Royal Wedding was a timely reminder that Britain is not just a small island with a fading history on the edge of Europe.The Duke and Duchess of Sussex ride in a carriage down The Long Walk back towards Windsor Castle after getting married in St Georges Chapel, WindsorThe 21st-century United Kingdom is an unrivalled brand on the global stage.The world was witnessing more than mere pomp and circumstance.This was UK plc on international parade, joining hands with the global community in a way no other nation can match — even the mighty USA.Had Meghan married into the family of a French or American president, a German Chancellor or a Kremlin tsar, would anyone have tuned in?Neither China nor Russia could captivate so many friendly eyeballs.The Olympics might do it.But London 2012 revealed Britain is best on these occasions, too.On Saturday, Britain proved it is capable of reaching out to a world beyond borders.Harry and Meghan’s marriage bonded the UK indelibly with the US.If the new Duke and Duchess have kids, they will be American citizens — as well as British due to Harry’s lineage — and will eventually be liable to American tax.Importantly, this wedding had special significance for the 2.5billion citizens of 52 Commonwealth countries, especially in Africa and the Caribbean, who swear allegiance to the Queen.My Australian in-laws were constantly on the phone from Sydney this weekend, all thoughts of becoming a republic abandoned, to discuss the finer points of royal protocol.But this event was watched from lands with no current ties to Britain — South America, the Far East and the Gulf States.It was a showcase of modern Britain forever adapting to change, the key to our success as an outward-looking nation.There was a clear hint of defiance, too. This steely couple were doing it their way.Our Brexit negotiators — on both sides of the argument — should take note.That big wide world, viewing us in high definition on Saturday, is where Britain’s future lies.These are our markets.The audience liked what they saw and they want some of what we’re having.In marketing terms alone, it was priceless.Too often we underestimate our strength and standing.We have developed an absurd inferiority complex.We’ve been led to believe we are too weak and puny to stand alone on the global stage.Yet we are among the world’s greatest economies, second only to Germany in the EU.We are a nuclear power with a real professional army which has helped keep the peace in Europe, and have an envied place on the UN Security Council.Republican lefties despise all this stuff.They smear Britain’s record as a brutal colonial power while ignoring our global lead in abolishing slavery.Disturbingly, some Conservatives seem to agree the UK is washed up and past its prime.Since we cannot run our own economy, they say, we should hand the job to unelected bureaucrats in Brussels.These, remember, would be the same Brussels flunkies who created the euro, wrecked the economies of member states and put millions of unemployed young people on the scrap heap.Most of those workless youngsters gratefully upped sticks and moved here.I wonder why?Saturday’s Royal Wedding showed we are in the Premier League.Now the world is watching, perhaps with slightly less enthusiasm, as another British saga lurches towards its climax — another broken family consumed with jealousy and bent on revenge.The cast is familiar — the statutory drunk, a bully who prefers to talk with a gun in his hand, some characters who would prefer a car crash to a happy ending.Can we stop the bickering and reach a good Brexit deal?Why can’t the Leavers and Remainers put the country first, join hands, bury their differences and take a vow to work together to serve the national interest?Inspired by the Royal Wedding, by the poem Invictus, we can rise above petty differences.“We are the masters of our fate: We are the captains of our soul.”Want to celebrate Harry and Meghans wedding like a royal?Weve made a brand new Snapchat lens just for the big day!Unlock The Suns Royal Wedding lens on Snapchat here and send us your snaps to @TheSunUKOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Oh well.Most married couples leave it 18 months before they reach that arrangement.But on that bombshell it was on with the Royal Wedding, which normally divides the nation into two distinct camps.There are the royalists, who have great fun watching all the pomp and pageantry on television.And the republicans, who have great fun hating all the pomp and pageantry on television.So the only real choice to be made, for all of us, is: Which channel?Personally, six hours of a photobombing Kay Burley giving it the full Partridge on Sky News was a punishment that’s way beyond me, as was five hours of the E! channel gang ­yelling: “Oh my God. Wow!”ITV was never going to be anything less than thoroughly professional in the hands of Julie Etchingham and Phillip Schofield, once he shut up about Holly Willoughby, so I went with the Beeb, where Naga called it a night shortly after announcing Prince Harry was now: “The Duke of Essex.”Oi! Oi! “Sussex rather.” Oh. Pity.The real surprise for some of you, though, might have been discovering that to give it an informal vibe, ­alongside Kirsty Young, BBC1’s 9am-and-beyond coverage was now being fronted by the strangely contorted ­figure of Dermot O’Leary — the former host of ITV’s The Marriage Ref.A show that may have been the ­perfect rehearsal for most royal ­weddings, but probably not this one.They weren’t alone, obviously.The Beeb had the joint surrounded, in fact, by among others Huw Edwards, ­fashion expert Jo Elvin, who was “across the dress” (as clueless as the rest of us), Alex Jones, Ore Oduba and Anita Rani, who performed the ­essential task of repeating what the other person had just said.Ore: “First glimpse of the dress, it’s going to be a moment.”Anita: “It’s going to be a moment.” Traditionally, of course, on these great state occasions, the moment TV crews start interviewing other TV crews is the cue for the coverage to descend into flannel, repetition, idle speculation, cliche (“Excitement’s ­building”), imponderable questions and outright stupidity.On Saturday, by slight contrast, the trigger was actually the arrival of Oprah Winfrey and the first trickle of celebrity guests, who had a clearly ­nervous ­Dermot asking: “When the invite says ‘hats’, does that mean hats are an absolute given?”“Absolutely, it does,” said Kirsty, slapping him down testily.It got progressively worse with each arrival as well.So by the time Amal Clooney wafted in alongside husband George, who was dressed as one of Modern Romance, even basic motor tasks seemed beyond some of the BBC team.Kirsty: “It can be difficult to wear a hat, can’t it?”Jo: “I think so, yes.”In fairness, it should also be stated this idiocy was certainly not restricted to the BBC.I switched over to ITV during the ­arrivals and heard Meghan’s old drama teacher, Gigi Perreau, say: “This is incredible and we’re right there. Well, we’re here but we’re also there, so it’s fabulous.”It’s just the nature of the beast.With so much time to fill, everyone will say these things.Only the BBC, though, could possibly leave me feeling queasy with the choice of one of its Royal Wedding experts.This was left-wing “social commentator” Afua Hirsch, who was privately educated and has led a life of unimaginable advantage, compared to most of us, but is also a professional victim who thinks pretty much ­everything is “racist”, wants Nelson’s Column torn down and wasn’t about to drop her agenda with such a large audience at her mercy.“While I have felt alienated by the inherited privilege,” said Afua, who’s enjoyed more than most, “my own struggles with identity have made me appreciate the need for cultural ­continuity.“So while I didn’t relate to the Royal Family, I did relate to that need for a sense of tradition.”Quite a brass neck, isn’t it, speaking out against the whole concept of the Royal Family, while simultaneously using them to increase your TV profile, as Afua had been doing all week.Instead of telling her so, or pointing out Harry’s ex Chelsy Davy had arrived while she was guffing away, a nodding Dermot said he could listen to Afua “all day”.A claim I doubt, frankly.Indeed, I reckon he’d have been throwing himself off Windsor Castle’s ramparts before breakfast if he’d tried.No one else, I suspect though, was listening to a single word she said.Nor will they have needed Afua’s lofty approval to enjoy a day filled with so many memorable events, including Bishop Michael Curry’s fiery address to the congregation, the ­reappearance of the Duke of Edinburgh and Meghan’s Rolls-Royce ­hurtling up the Long Walk past 100,000 Union Flags like it was being driven by Richard Hammond.These are all magical moments you’ll possibly want to watch again — and if you do, having sat through both start to finish, I’d probably recommend the ITV version.It had the better ­historic detail, was never in any danger of missing Chelsy Davy’s arrival and rounded everything off nicely as well.Over on the BBC, meanwhile, Kirsty did it by searching for profundities and going where angels feared to tread.“Something has travelled between Harry and Meghan that might be the next page of the story, where they give us a gorgeous little product of their union which we might enjoy too . . . ?”Though not if Naga’s honeymoon arrangements are to be believed, they won’t.Obviously.Want to celebrate Harry and Meghans wedding like a royal?Weve made a brand new Snapchat lens just for the big day!Unlock The Suns Royal Wedding lens on Snapchat here and send us your snaps to @TheSunUKOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Later, I went back with him after he had built a night school for the boys, and asked over a cup of tea: “Why are you doing this, Harry?”He replied: “This is the most important thing I do.”It tells you everything about who his mother was.Inside the Chapel, the hymn was Guide Me, O Thou Great Redeemer, which was played at Princess Diana’s funeral and one of her favourites.Di’s sister Lady Jane Fellowes delivered the only reading. Listening to it was Sarah, the Duchess of York, who had not been invited to other recent royal weddings.Inviting Fergie was a brilliant thing to do. During Diana’s troubled times every Sunday she would drive down to Berkshire to have lunch with Fergie, spending the afternoon talking about their divorces.Outside in the Chapel courtyard were 2,000 people from Harry and Meghan’s charities, including servicemen who have lost limbs.Harry is following Diana’s hugely successful campaign to stop landmines by working with those who have been wounded by IEDs.When Harry was flying back from one of his tours of Afghanistan he shared the plane with three soldiers who were in a coma.He realised these soldiers, if they recovered, would have limbs missing and facing a life of misery — which is why he inspired them with his support for the Invictus Games.And Harry and Meghan asked guests to make donations to the Children’s HIV Association.Harry has clearly never forgotten how his mother took the stigma out of Aids by embracing sufferers, including babies in Brazil.And then there was the ring. On Saturday night Meghan was wearing the emerald-cut aquamarine ring Diana first wore in 1996.Harry once told ITV’s Tom Bradby: “I wanted to do something that would make my mother proud.” He succeeded on Saturday.Want to celebrate Harry and Meghans wedding like a royal?Weve made a brand new Snapchat lens just for the big day!Unlock The Suns Royal Wedding lens on Snapchat here and send us your snaps to @TheSunUKOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I’ve not sold it and that’s all I’m saying.”According to eBay rules, bids can only be retracted within one hour if there is less than 12 hours in the auction to go. The decision to allow a bid to be cancelled is up to the seller.Payment is only received once the winning bidder officially confirms the transaction - with funds usually transferred by PayPal.Claire was one of the 1,200 non-VIP­ members of the public invited to share in Meghan and Harry’s big day outside St Georges Chapel on Saturday.Sharing her excitement, she tweeted: I got to watch the royal wedding right outside Windsor Castle in this amazing setting. Such an amazing day #Golden ticket #Royal connections.But while some have accused Claire of cashing in - others are also alleged to have taken advantage.The hessian sacks, inscribed with the royal couples initials, contained a welcome letter, commemorative chocolate coin, bottled Windsor Castle water, fridge magnet, official order of service and a tin of shortbread.One seller called Chrisofwilliams, from Merthyr Tydfil, Wales, stands to make more than £40,000 after putting his commemorative bag on eBay.The gift was initially listed for 99p on Sunday, with the seller saying: Buy a piece of history and memorabilia to celebrate a momentous special day for Britain’s and the royal family.I am selling my limited Goody bag for guests of Royal wedding of Meghan and Harry 19th May 2018.Official bag with full contents containing commemorative chocolate coin unopened sealed and in original condition, labelled spring water bottle unopened and sealed in original condition: royal wedding fridge magnet unopened in original packaging, the castle spectator badge and a tub of ‘handbag shortbread’ unopened as well as a Marriage order of service booklet and a 20% off voucher of middle ward shop in Windsor castle.Don’t miss out on this limited once in a life time opportunity to have a piece of royal history.”The hessian gift bag was given to the 2,640 guests who were invited to the wedding of the year.But many saw the monetary value in flogging off the bag, selling it online.So what does the bag actually contain? - Bottle of Windsor Castle Still Spring Water 500mL- Harry and Meghan Traditiaionl Handbag Shortbread Biscuits- Royal Wedding 2018 Belgian Milk Chocolate Coin 90g- Royal Wedding Commemorative Magnet- Voucher for royalcollectionshopAnother online listing has reached £420 while another hit £411.One of of the listings, the seller declared proudly: “At the wedding today I received this wonderful gift bag for guests.”And the post promised: “I forgot to mention all money raised will go to charity.”Another seller has even been trying to flog PDFs of the Royal Wedding order of service - for £5 each.As the non-VIP guests departed on Saturday the wedding reception turned into an ­outrageous party with a very royal dance-off and “beer pong” games. The Sun can reveal that chat-show superstar James Corden — who was compering the event — instigated an extraordinary dance routine which featured Prince Charles, Prince William and Harry.The royal couple chose I Wanna Dance With Somebody as their first dance at the fun-filled, early-hours wedding bash.Harry, 33, and Meghan, 36 — now the Duke and ­Duchess of Sussex — let their hair down to the hit by Whitney Houston at Frogmore House, Windsor, where telly’s Corden hosted dinner and fireworks for 200 guests.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

So is Her Majesty the Queen. They haven’t felt the need to label themselves as such we know from their actions.As the basic scriptwriting rule dictates, show don’t tell.To her credit, Meghan Markle championed many charitable causes that advocate female empowerment before she met Prince Harry, and no one is suggesting she shouldn’t continue with this work.But what grates about the above statement is the unsaid inference that here is a feisty, independent woman who, unshackled by pomp, ceremony and dutiful political impartiality, is going to drag the stuffy, deluded old monarchy kicking and screaming into the 21st century.That this go-get-’em gal from the US of A is going to shake things up with a few bumper-sticker sentiments and teach those Brits a thing or two about how the world works.Or perhaps we should leave it to Patrick Jephson, former private secretary to Princess Diana, a man very much in the know on the inner workings of the House of Windsor.In his book, The Meghan Factor, he says: “The one key skill Meghan absolutely must perfect is how to avoid being seen as any kind of a destabilising force. It’s a useful guideline when weighing the pros and cons of any intended course of action, from saving a local playgroup, to saving an endangered species, to saving the planet. What always comes first is saving the monarchy.”Quite. In other words, don’t get up the collective nose of the British public or they might just, ahem, pick it and flick you off into oblivion.As we saw on Saturday, as Bishop Michael Curry’s address entered what felt like its third decade, The Queen’s resolutely impassive expression suggests she’d make a fine poker player.We have no idea what she thought of it, nor Donald Trump, Brexit or the highly political Me Too campaign. She has opinions, of course. But what she doesn’t do is wear them like a badge.Just like her great-great-grandmother Victoria, who advocated “never complain, never explain”, The Queen knows the future of the monarchy lies in being a non-political figurehead who promotes national unity.Jephson adds: “If you acquire a profile, a purpose and a passionate public devotion independent of the royal mainstream, then you risk being perceived and presented as a threat to the Crown itself.”We already know what Meghan thinks about an awful lot of things, because her life so far can’t be edited.We also know that her soapbox has just got bigger thanks to her new status which, to those unused to it, could foster the corrosive misconception that everyone is hanging off your every word.Read my pursed lips: They’re not. They’re just being polite.So Meghan must learn fast that she’s a very minor cog in an ancient royal machine that has survived so long by saying nothing and doing its duty to its loyal subjects.Frustrating that may be for a “feminist” (or, indeed a manist), but that’s the trade-off for the largely taxpayer-funded life of luxury that is granted, not self-generated.As a celebrity, you can say what you like and we can choose to listen or not. But opinions divide people and, as a royal, you are supposed to represent everyone.Meghan needs to understand, and implement, that distinction sooner rather than later.HUMAN rights lawyer Amal Clooney was officially crowned “best-dressed guest” by fashionistas observing the Royal Wedding.According to one, she was “a sublime vision in marigold”, though personally speaking, Colman’s Mustard yellow might be more accurate.Either way, Ms Clooney once again proved adept at pulling focus from the other mere mortals floundering in her ever-stylish slipstream.By contrast, the Duchess of Cambridge’s understated, Alexander McQueen frock coat got a sniffier reception from certain fashion quarters, not least because she’s worn it three times before.They’re missing the point.A wedding is about the bride, not the guests.And Kate understood that perfectly by wearing something that wouldn’t propel her into the limelight on Meghan’s big day.Now that’s style.THOSE attending Chelsea Flower Show (no, me neither) have declared that “she-sheds” are the latest must-have – kitted out with radiators, chandeliers and squishy sofas.Alternatively, we could have all that inside the house and just send the other half out into the garden.AN Islamic school in Birmingham has warned female pupils against using tampons.The guidance, adopted as school policy, states: “Among the types of pads, tampons may not be appropriate due to insertion.”But the head of the school insists it has “no connection to faith”.Hmmmm. Meanwhile, it has emerged that women are having “virginity restoring” operations on the NHS at a cost of £1,000 a time.The 30-minute procedure involves the hymen – which can break after using tampons, doing sport or having sex for the first time – being stitched or reconstructed.One relationship counsellor suggested that one of the reasons was that some religious women were “over- whelmed” by feelings of sexual guilt and wanted to be “as pure as possible again” for their husband.Want to? Or are forced to by religiously driven, moral expectations not placed on the man they’re marrying?Either way, is this really something the NHS should be funding when money for other, more vital, operations is so scarce?MEMO to Sir Anthony Hopkins: Yes, families do fall out and just because you’re related doesn’t mean you have to like each other.But saying you “don’t care one way or the other” whether your 48-year-old daughter Abigail has children or not seems overly cold and perhaps partly explains your 20-year estrangement.In future, a simple, “We don’t speak and I’d rather not go in to it”, might be wiser.HOW come, in this age of state-of-the-art camera phones, when anyone spots the Loch Ness monster, beast of Bodmin Moor or any of the other fearsome creatures supposedly roaming our shores, the evidential photo is always out of focus?Exhibit A: The “lion” spotted in Oldbury in the West Midlands this week.Yep.

It’s the uncertainty caused by Remain diehards in the Commons and Lords bent on scuppering it and even destroying our Government.It is destabilising for firms not to know what Brexit will look like. If Theresa May formed a position fully honouring the result, and told the EU to like it or lump it, the unease would end overnight.Our economy would take off like a rocket.IT is disgraceful that Google is revealing rape victims’ names via the “autocomplete” function on its searches.

The Government must think again so that people don’t fall into debt or are left at risk of losing their home.”Lib Dem MP Stephen Lloyd added: “These lamentable figures show that thousands of people have still not responded to the significant changes on mortgage interest loans being pushed by the DWP.This is yet another cack-handed benefit change by the Tories which is wholly unnecessary, and is already causing anxiety amongst some of our most disadvantaged, marginalised citizens.The DWP said that any SMI claimants who havent got a phone call about the change will still get the benefit for at least six more weeks.Those affected are urged to contact the official hotline on 0800 731 0459 for pensioners or 0800 169 0310 for anyone of working age.A spokesman said: Over time, someone’s house is likely to increase in value, so it’s reasonable that anyone who has received financial help towards their mortgage should be asked to pay that back.“Everyone who signs up to the loan will continue to get help with their mortgage interest, and it’s only repayable if there is available equity when the property is sold.“If people decide to decline the loan now but change their mind in future the loan can be backdated so in effect there would be no break in payments.“We have already contacted everyone currently in receipt of SMI to explain the change but we are making sure people have time to review the documents, obtain advice and consider their options."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000180243126.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"flight mh370 photo mystery latest news conspiracy theories","story":"Christine Negroni said analysis of pics of washed up wreckage shows the Boeing 777s wing flaps were retracted when it smashed into the sea in March 2014, meaning the plane was out of control when it hit the water.The findings cast further doubt on bombshell claims made by former Canadian air crash investigator Larry Vance.Vance told Australias 60 Minutes earlier this month that pilot Zaharie Ahmad Shah flew off course on a suicide mission and planned to kill himself and the 238 others on the journey from Beijing to Kuala Lumpur.Mr Vance said: He [the pilot] was killing himself unfortunately, he was killing everybody else on board, and he did it deliberately.And in his new book MH370: Mystery Solved, Mr Vance says evidence suggests Shah tried to ditch the plane as gently as possible to avoid creating wreckage that would make it easier to find.But Ms Negroni has blasted his conclusions as preposterous and absurd — and these photos could prove her point.In a post on her website, she fumed: Ladies and gents, thanks to 60 Minutes, pilots Vance and Hardy are in the cockpit.They’ve fuelled up with alternative facts and are taking us on a flight to the absurd.“Will we ever return from this remote region of reality? Stay tuned.”She accused the show of airing “far-fetched”, “hokum” details — in particular is claims about the wing flap suggesting a controlled landing.Vance had said the wings flaps that washed ashore in 2016 were extended as they would be in a controlled landing.Mr Vance told Australian show 60 Minutes that the flaps were extended, just as they would be during a controlled landing.It lent weight to his theory that the pilot flew on a sinister murder-suicide mission, trying to ditch the plane gently in the water to prevent floating wreckage that could be visible to search teams.But his claim that the flaps were extended has been refuted — as photos show they were in fact in the retracted position.Flaps remain retracted during a flight and are deployed in controlled landings.If they are not extended, it suggests the pilot was not fully in control when the plane went down.MH370 search director Peter Foley said: “If it was being controlled at the end, it wasn’t very successfully being controlled. The flaps weren’t deployed.But Ms Negroni wrote Vance should have revisited that statement when a forensic examination showed the flaperon was very likely stowed, not deployed when the plane crashed.”She pointed to an October 2017 report by the Australian Transport Safety Bureau, which said: It was established from the debris that the aircraft was not configured for a ditching at the end-of-flight.Analysis indicated that the flaps were most likely in a retracted position at the time they separated from the aircraft making a controlled ditching scenario very unlikely.Ms Negronis view has been backed by MH370 search director Peter Foley.He said: “If it was being controlled at the end, it wasn’t very successfully being controlled. The flaps weren’t deployed.One flap is being withheld by French authorities as they carry out their own criminal investigation.But a second flap that washed up in Tanzania in 2016 shows it was “probably not deployed”, according to Australian analysts.Mr Foleys agency did confirm that “it’s absolutely evident” someone had initially flown the plane off course, ruling out some mechanical or electrical malfunction.Various governments and private agencies have scoured the ocean for the main wreckage of the doomed flight but have failed to find it.A total of 239 people were on board, including 153 Chinese nationals, 50 Malaysians, seven Indonesians and Australian, French, Canadian, New Zealander, India, Iranian, Dutch, Russian, Taiwanese, Ukrainian and American nationals.Parts of this article originally appeared on News.au"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000283428196.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"burn wood they said itll be green they said how the eco freaks got us all wheezing","story":"Pollution in our cities is worse than it’s been for many years. The way things are going you could give your kids 20 Rothmans a day and they wouldn’t be much worse off than they already are.And the reason for this is a genuine scandal. A real eye-opener. It shows what happens when people in authority take notice of the people who know absolutely nothing. The Green lobby. The eco-freaks. The obsessive loons. The climate change fanatics.If you’re middle class, you’ve probably got one. They’ve become incredibly popular in the last decade.Trouble is they spew out enormous amounts of something called PM2.5 particles. That’s soot to you and me.They’re the major cause of soot in our cities and the main reason everyone you know is gasping for breath.We’re about to be sued by the European Union because pollution from these stoves is way above acceptable limits.But why do we have them?Because at the behest of the green movement, the government encouraged us all to have them. Burning wood is much better, they said, than gas or coal or oil. Renewable! Doesn’t churn out as much CO2!No, it just churns out lethal amounts of soot. Billions of pounds were spent by our government on a scheme to convert us to renewable heating systems.The brainchild of the disgraced Lib Dem halfwit Chris Huhne. Millions more was spent converting one of our biggest power stations to woodchip. The wood is shipped over 3,500 miles from the US (there’s eco-friendly for you). And it’s all made everything a lot, lot, worse as a consequence.Then there are diesel cars. You may have one. The government is getting tough on those, too.It’s now been discovered that they are much more polluting than petrol cars. It’s another major cause of pollution in our towns and cities.So why do we have them? Because the idiotic Greens told us to. Back in 2001 the Labour government offered tax breaks on diesel cars. Everyone rushed to buy one.A member of that Labour government has now ’fessed up and said it was the wrong decision, no question.But they wanted their Green credentials.And just look what trouble it has caused — 37,800 more deaths every year in this country simply as a consequence of those wood burning stoves. It is close to unbelievable.I wonder what the Greens will come up with next as an idea to save the planet.Maybe we should burn magpies, or sour cream and chive Pringles, or our own trousers.The truth is they haven’t got the remotest idea. They urge these measures upon us without the slightest notion of what might happen as a consequence.And the problem is that important people take them seriously. Governments, for example.And we end up paying through the nose for their idiocies — and then, a little later, gasping for breath.The wood burning stove business should convince all members of Parliament. Never listen to a green.No matter how nice he or she might seem. Just ignore them. They’re bad for your health.WHAT a shame – Roman Abramovich can’t get back into the country because we haven’t cleared his visa. So he’s sitting on his yacht somewhere, getting snippy. I’m not sure why we let Roman in in the first place.You don’t get his kind of money by being lovely to everybody, do you?First we helped wreck the Russian economy in the early 1990s by plundering its state run industries. Then we opened the doors to a whole bunch of Russkie gangsters – sorry, oligarchs – with boats the size of Poland. Anyway, I’ll probably end up glowing like a Belisha beacon just for writing this.BROADCASTER Dan Snow has admitted he lies to his daughters.He’s told them that during the war there were loads of female Spitfire pilots. Zooming around, shooting down krauts. He says he doesn’t want them to feel limited by their gender. He should have gone further. Told them that back then Britain was led by a nice lady called Winnie.And that the first person up Everest was a little girl called Hillary. And as for that Ada Hitler . . .THE Iraqis are executing the IS jihadi brides. Loads of them.Some of them are whining that they had no idea their husbands were evil Islamists. One of them said she thought she was marrying a rapper.Yeah, right love. We’ve got a few here, mind.Women who went out to join IS and then thought better of it. They’re lucky we won’t extradite them to Iraq.HEY – got your Royal Wedding gift bag yet? Guests to the wedding are flogging them on eBay for as little as £20,000. Hell of a bargain. I’ve got a bid in on one right now. It says it contains:I’VE got a bit of a soft spot for Victoria Beckham. She’s been criticised for not smiling at the wedding of Harry and Meghan.Some people have suggested Posh Spice was looking a bit grim because David had been out on the pull again. Nah. She wasn’t smiling because, basically, she’s a miserable cow.And I like that. Why should she have to wander around grinning like a village idiot?Keep the sulk and the pout, Vikki, love. Plus I liked what she was wearing at the bash. She was dressed as if for the funeral of someone she didn’t know very well. She looked great.SO, all four of the great American authors are dead. Both Tom Wolfe and Philip Roth died this week.Saul Bellow and the finest of them all, John Updike are already dead.These gentlemen were my heroes when I was growing up. But how long will they be remembered?Updike is already unfashionable on account of his alleged sexism. Wolfe and Bellow were quite right-wing, so the literary critics will quickly consign their books to the “dead white male” rubbish bin of history. And as a consequence, we will have lost an awful lot.Keep their work alive, whatever the critics tell you.

Our aim is to stop Brexit democratically.We want to connect people across the country to their MPs, so they directly hear from their voters, the majority of whom want to have a real debate on Brexit before our options are taken off the table, including the option to stay and lead in Europe.Mr Soros sparked anger earlier this year when it emerged he was helping to fund the group.The billionaire hedge fund tycoon is known for funding political causes all around the world, including his native Hungary and his adopted home of the US.Best for Britain was previously also supported by Gina Miller, who took the Government to court to force them to give MPs a say on Brexit"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/vlcsnap-2018-05-19-12h51m48s181-e1526732327165.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"prince harry ex girlfriend chelsea davy royal wedding phone call","story":"Tearful Chelsy was so upset by their chat that she nearly pulled out of going to the star-studded ceremony at St George’s Chapel, a family friend told Vanity Fair.The Prince spoke to his ex, who he dated for seven years from 2004-11, to let her know that while she was welcome at the ceremony and afternoon reception – her invite did not extend to the party in the evening.It is believed that Harrys other ex, Cressida Bonas, was also left off the guest-list for the bash at Frogmore House.Harry and Meghans black-tie party, compered by James Cordon and attended by an array of A-listers including George and Amal Clooney, Idris Elba and Tom Hardy, was the hottest party of the year.A friend of Chelsy’s told society magazine Vanity Fair: “It was their final call, a parting call in which they both acknowledged Harry was moving on.“Chelsy was quite emotional about it all, she was in tears and almost didn’t go to the wedding. In the end, she went and promised Harry she wouldn’t try and gatecrash the party.”Harry’s call may have been weighing on Chelsy’s mind as she took her place among other guests in St George’s Chapel on Saturday, as cameras caught her pulling a bit of grimace during the service.Even the BBC Three Twitter account made light of the situation, writing when your ex turns up to your wedding.While other viewers poked fun with a series of memes suggesting that Chelsy was jealous or could even shout out objections while the Arch Bishop of Canterbury was officiating.Harry and Zimbabwean-born Chelsy hit it off when they were both students at boarding school.She even met the Queen at a society wedding and was a guest at Prince Charles 60th, as her relationship with Harry became more serious.But law student Chelsy had struggled with the pressure of dating a royal in the spotlight and the couple split.She told the Times: It was so full-on. Crazy and scary and uncomfortable.I found it very difficult when it was bad. I couldnt cope. I was young, I was trying to be a normal kid and it was horrible.Despite their separation, Chelsy was invited to Prince William and Kate Middletons wedding and remains firm friends with many in the same circle as the young royals.After her appearance at Kate and Wills wedding, there was speculation she was back with Harry - but he insisted he was 100 per cent single.Chelsy was not the only one of Prince Harrys ex-girlfriends to attend his eagerly anticipated nuptials.Cressida Bonas was also seen chatting to fellow guests in the grounds of Windsor Castle.She was introduced to Harry by Princess Eugenie in May 2012 and the prince quickly became infatuated with the pretty dance graduate.The free-spirited pair attended the Glastonbury music festival together, a rugby match at Twickenham and were frequently spotted around London on discreet dates.But Burberry muse Cressida reportedly called off their two-year romance after struggling to adjust to life in the spotlight.A friend of the couple revealed in 2014: “It’s very sad that they have decided to split but this is a completely amicable separation and they are remaining the very best of friends.”"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict0004079711098.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"meghan markle the queen royal adviser samantha cohen private secretary","story":"The new Duchess of Sussex is to be given a helping hand in her induction into the royal family by Samantha Cohen, the Times reports.The 49-year-old is the monarchs assistant private secretary, and had handed in her notice last September.However it has been reported she has agreed to stay on as interim private secretary for a further six months, and wont be leaving in the summer as planned.She had decided to leave following the ousting of Lord Geidt, the Queens private secretary, who announced his resignation last July after 15 years in service.It is thought Meghan, 36, will spend six months with her, learning how to be an effective member of the firm, after marrying Harry on Saturday. A source told the Times: It will be six months of listening.It is not going to be quiet, though.

I have my ears pierced, I cry at the end of The Greatest Showman and I enjoy shopping for clothes.Everyone has the right to say how they want the world to see them. Everyone has the right to be happy with themselves.Goodness knows there’s enough things to be unhappy about. You shouldn’t be one of them.But the Labour Party has now decided that anyone who says they are a woman is eligible for political roles that are for women only. They do not ask for any more proof than that.As a Labour member and a woman on Wednesdays, that means I am eligible to stand for one of those roles.So, when the position of Women’s Officer came up for election, I decided to apply. The post involves encouraging women to join the party and speak for women and their experiences - and can only be held by women.Standing for the position was a chance for me to talk about self-identification with my local Party and bring my concerns to their attention.Of course, I was not expecting to win, but I was ready to do the job if I did.I was happy to let people make a democratic, informed choice.Women are worried that letting men say they are women without any checks is dangerous.There is a fear that some men will identify as women just so they can go into changing rooms or loos and spy on or attack women.Women also say that it will affect women’s rights to dignity and privacy, for example on women-only hospital wards or in shelters.Those are also real concerns, but a small minority of people don’t want them to be talked about.They call feminists like Germaine Greer - who has said transgender women are not women - out-of-touch or get angry when people yell out body parts or facts on TV.Those people are stopping a very important debate. I don’t feel that’s right.And self-identification is not just Labour’s position.Nearly every political party in the UK says that the Gender Recognition Act should be changed so that anyone can legally change their sex just by saying they are a man or a woman.The Labour Party made their decision so they could be ahead of the change to the law.Some trans people say that the current requirements set out by the GRA are humiliating and difficult to cope with on top of living their lives. That is a real concern and one that has to be listened to.However, I don’t agree with the idea that you should be able to legally change your sex just by saying you want to.It ignores the very real struggles that trans people face every day.It says that I have had the same life experience as people such as the L’Oreal and Playboy model Munroe Bergdorf, journalist and TV presenter Paris Lees and Lily Madigan - a transgender schoolgirl who was sent home from school for wearing a girls uniform.It says that their life-long fight to feel right in their bodies is the same as me identifying as a woman once a week.I can’t begin to imagine what their journeys have been like, but I know those journeys need to be recognised by more than just words.Following a recent meeting of Woman’s Place UK in Basingstoke, I talked with a reporter about my nomination for the Womens Officer role. The article that he wrote led to the Labour Party suspending me yesterday, with immediate effect.I am not allowed to attend meetings or stand for election and there will be an investigation.They seem to think that I am not enough of a woman.Some people online think the same. I have to ask the question, how much more of a woman would I need to be?I hope that what I did shows we need the debate on gender identity.We need to find the common ground so that trans people can live as they want to, while allowing women the dignity, privacy and safety that they deserve.We are all here thanks to women, so let’s talk to them.Really? I mean, really? I first came across David Lewis smug grinning face in a magazine earlier this week. Announcing he was a woman from morn to midnight on Wednesdays and boasting that he is changing nothing. Not his clothes. Not his routine. Not his womanly beard.Why? Because 15 minutes of fame. Because trans rights has gone too far. Because proposed law changes.He is not trans: has no idea what it is to be trans.The situation he is describing does not happen and has not happened anywhere, except when anti-trans campaigners break the law to make a point.Being trans is not fashion, trend or choice. Mocking transness in this dishonest way hurts people.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Hugh Ind, who was director-general of immigration enforcement, is being moved out of the Home Office after 27 years\u0027 service in the department. He will take up a new role in the Cabinet Office within the next three weeks. The move is so quick he will be replaced by an interim director-general, current asylum chief Tyson Hepple, while a permanent replacement is found. A Home Office spokeswoman declined to say whether Mr Ind\u0027s departure was due to the Windrush scandal. Officials claimed he had neither resigned nor been sacked - simply moved.  Mr Ind was the official who prepared a leaked memo showing the Home Office had a target of achieving 12,800 enforced returns in 2017-18. The leak last month triggered a chain of events that led to Home Secretary Amber Rudd resigning after she denied targets existed. Mr Ind also returned to the spotlight when he confirmed there had been “a handful” of wrongful deportations overall in the last six years. The staffing changes were announced by Home Office permanent secretary Sir Philip Rutnam in a low-key notice buried on the government website. He thanked Mr Ind for his huge contribution to the Home Office and unswerving dedication to public service, and wished him every possible success going forward. Mr Ind, who joined the Home Office in 1991, will now lead the Public Sector Apprenticeships Strategy. The \u0027Windrush generation\u0027 are British residents who arrived from Commonwealth countries before New Year\u0027s Day 1973. They are named after the Empire Windrush, the ship which brought some of the first Caribbean migrants to Britain in 1948. Anyone who arrived in the UK from a Commonwealth country before 1973 has a legal right to stay, unless they left the UK for more than two years. But they faced being threatened with deportation under new immigration rules despite living and working here for decades. People were ordered to prove they have the right to be in the UK to rent property, work or access services and benefits. The government failed to keep detailed records of Windrush arrivals, and landing cards were destroyed in 2010. The Home Office set up a task force with the aim of sorting out cases within two weeks. Windrush immigrants are also being granted fee-free citizenship and a compensation scheme, the rules of which have not been set yet.

The shock audio was released on YouTube today in what appears to be an extraordinary breach of UK national security. Mr Johnson was scrupulously diplomatic through most of the call, which he used to condemn Russia\u0027s behaviour, vow a crackdown on oligarchs and talk about the poisoning of Sergei Skripal. But the UK Foreign Secretary then persistently asked for more detail when told about fake claims that the Kremlin had given money to Jeremy Corbyn. And he confirmed that ex-spy Skripal and his daughter Yulia are both still in the UK, though he didn\u0027t specify where. The video was tweeted today by Russian pranksters Alexei Stolyarov and Vladimir Kuznetsov, who style themselves Lexus and Vovan. A Foreign Office spokesman confirmed it was real, saying: The Foreign Secretary realised it was a hoax, and ended the call. We checked it out and knew immediately it was a prank call. The use of chemical weapons in Salisbury and Syria, and recent events in Armenia are serious matters. These childish actions show the lack of seriousness of the caller and those behind him. Critics claim the pair have links to the Russian security services and a senior UK diplomatic source said: This seems to be the latest desperate attempt by the Kremlin to save face after it was internationally shamed in the wake of the Skripal attack.  Boris rumbled them pretty quickly and ended the call. It is tragic to see a major international power reduced to failed pranks you would usually only see on Trigger Happy TV. Armenia, located in the sensitive eastern bloc near Georgia and the Russian border, elected its new Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan earlier this month. Mr Johnson started the call by congratulating him and calling for the UK and Armenia to strengthen relations forthwith. In return, the man posing as Pashinyan thanked Mr Johnson for giving the time on his day off. He also said I\u0027m a fan of your poetry - picking out a satirical poem Mr Johnson wrote about the Turkish President having sex with a goat. Early in the call, Mr Johnson said Russia was unable to resist malign activity and we have to stand firm against them. You throw a stone in Kensington and you’ll hit an oligarch, the Foreign Secretary said. It\u0027s very important for the Russians to know that certainly the UK is absolutely determined to stand against them.  We will continue to tighten the squeeze on some of the oligarchs who surround Putin. But the call got increasingly awkward towards the end as the man posing as Pashinyan said Russian President Vladimir Putin has influence over Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn.

MPs were told they won\u0027t be able to debate 15 defeats to the EU Withdrawal Bill , which were inflicted in the House of Lords, until at least June 11.  The apparent last-minute delay came despite Tory Chief Whip Julian Smith telling MPs they could expect a showdown in the near future. One furious Tory pointed the blame on the whips\u0027 office, saying the behaviour was unhelpful and discourteous. It means the Bill - which converts EU law into UK law - will have been out of the House of Lords for almost a month before it is even debated again, let alone voted on.  It comes amid reports that deadlocked Theresa May is trying to delay the end of a transition period until 2023 - which Downing Street denied.    The Lords amendments could force Theresa May back to the negotiating table, remove the fixed March 29 Brexit date, and keep Britain in the EU customs union permanently.   The government wants to overturn as many of the 15 defeats as possible, but will face opposition from Labour, the Lib Dems, SNP and Tory rebels.  Theresa May has a tiny Commons majority so a handful of rebels would be enough to inflict defeat - and change the course of Brexit. For the same reason, the timing of the crucial Customs Bill and Trade Bill have still not been announced yet either.

The slogan was scrubbed from top Housing Ministry documents just months after Theresa May made it a central vow at the Conservative Party Conference. Used by Tory ministers since at least 2016, \u0027Fixing our broken housing market\u0027 was the title of a government White Paper in February last year. The 2017 Tory manifesto also vowed to fix the dysfunctional housing market before the Prime Minister used the phrase in her October conference speech. It was last used by Tory ministers just three days ago. But the slogan has vanished from the Housing Ministry\u0027s annual \u0027single departmental plan\u0027 - where it was previously objective number one. It has been replaced by deliver the homes the country needs in the new plan, which was published with little fanfare on Wednesday.  Neither the words fix nor broken feature in the new plan. Government sources today insisted no policy had changed - just the wording of the slogan. But Shadow Housing Secretary John Healey said: Words count and what the government says matters. Even Tory Ministers now admit they have no plan to fix the housing crisis. It\u0027s been eight years of failure all fronts on housing from falling home-ownership to rapidly rising homelessness. The new plan promises to make the vision of a place you call home a reality and create socially and economically stronger and more confident communities.

But just as you need to carefully plan your route to that seaside resort or holiday cottage, it makes sense to plan ahead for the actual journey, too. That way you’ll all still be in the holiday mood when you reach your destination and really ready for fun! Below we’ve teamed up with Halfords to reveal the 5 secrets to the perfect car journey which will leave you feeling relaxed and refreshed when you arrive. They cover everything from picking the right tunes to play on the way to why it pays to plan when you\u0027re off on a road trip. 1. Get the sounds right    A great road trip needs a great soundtrack. But with the whole family in the car, creating a playlist that keeps everyone happy can be a challenge. Even if Dad likes Dua Lipa, Mum likes Metallica and the kids change their minds every few seconds, there is a way to keep everyone happy: using a streaming service en route.  This bank holiday there’s 10 per cent off selected audio systems at Halfords – including a Pioneer car stereo. Featuring a digital radio and with support for Android devices and iPhones alike you can stream from Spotify, Apple Music and use apps like Google Maps and Waze. Remember: Halfords experts can help you with your choice and fit your new stereo seamlessly into your car. The experts can fit your new stereo in-store from as little as \u0026pound30. 2. Keep the kids happy    Keep the kids entertained and you’ll be amazed how quickly “are we nearly there yet” becomes a thing of the past. Whether it’s for big screen classics or cartoons, the Nextbase Car Dual DVD, below, is an ideal solution.  The pack includes two DVD players with built-in nine-inch screens.  You can use each separately, or connect them together to watch the same movie on both. There are speakers to listen out loud, or you can hook them up to a pair of optional wireless headphones. With the ability to play different films at the same time, it will be sure to keep the kids happy - and give you peace and quiet on the journey, even if they want to watch different films.  The chances are that if you’re travelling as a group you’re all going to want to keep your mobile devices charged up. Halfords has a range of portable phone chargers to keep your USB devices topped up – the Halfords Premium Triple USB Charger can charge three devices at once. 3. Don’t get lost    While it\u0027s pretty easy to think of things to fill a long car journey there\u0027s no sense in making it longer than it has to be. If you don\u0027t already have one, or yours is too old to be useful, then consider a new sat nav. You can pick up a great device, like the Garmin Drive, which includes lifetime map updates and traffic camera alerts for just \u0026pound79. The Garmin Drive will also ensure you get there quickly - by rerouting you and diverting you away from traffic.   Halfords also has 20 per cent off a range of other sat navs for the bank holiday, so take a look online or visit your nearest store to find one that suits you. Any questions? Check our Halfords’ Sat Nav Buyers’ Guide. You might also want to pick up a Nextbase Dash Cam, for peace of mind on the road. Halfords also has 20 per cent off on a range of dash cams ahead of the holiday. In-store experts can even fit seamlessly into your car.  4. Watch your levels    Don\u0027t risk something delaying your journey because you remember 10 miles in that you\u0027ve run out of screenwash or that the oil level is low. Why not book a FREE Summer Car Check for your car at a time that suits you. Book online and trained colleagues will carry out a free car bulb check and check your battery, wiper blades, engine oil level, air conditioning and check for any windscreen chips.

And now, for the Duchess of Sussex, the serious work begins.  She and Prince Harry were already back on royal duties yesterday at a Buckingham Palace garden party celebrating Prince Charles’ 70th birthday .  But she has made it clear that her role in “the Firm” will be to do more than wear stylish dresses or just be arm candy for her husband.  Shortly after the wedding, her official biography on the Buckingham Palace website was out and in it she boldly announced she is “proud to be a woman and a feminist”. It was a signal she will be using her huge platform to support causes that help the advancement of women. Insiders say she has the blessing of the palace to do so.  It didn’t take long for the haters to pile in at the mention of the word feminist and I must admit that I initially groaned at the thought.  Of course I believe in equality of men and women which, by definition, makes me a feminist. But I’ve always felt excluded from feminism and feminist debates because they’re always dominated by one voice – well-off middle-class women. Instead of being inclusive, it is exclusive and rarely addresses the views and needs of ethnic minority or working-class women. It seems those who benefit most are usually already well paid and well connected. I’ve been to networking events about gender equality in business or the media and I can usually count the number of non-white women on one hand. During panel discussions I never hear anyone talking about tackling the lack of social or racial diversity. Instead it’s a certain group of women fighting for women like themselves. Women of colour have fought against sexism and racism, but their voice is rarely heard. I believe Meghan can change that. Yes she’s well-off and privileged, but her background, and the fact she was raised by a black woman, gives her a different perspective.  As her bio says, she’s had a keen awareness of social issues from an early age, instilled by her wonderful mother Doria Ragland . “Those early experiences helped shape her lifelong commitment to causes such as social justice and women’s empowerment,” it says.

Ex-boozer Adam Joy, 40, consumed a staggering 12,800 calories in lager alone every week - which is three-quarters of the total recommended intake for a man. Thanks to the endless pints gifted to him by punters, he was consuming a dangerous 135 units of alcohol a week when the safe total is just 14. But he decided to overhaul his unhealthy lifestyle when he reached 26st 4lbs and struggled to make it up the stairs at a Twickenham game with his son.  As well as ditching the booze, he swapped fatty kebabs for home-cooked dishes and even introduced healthy curry nights at his boozer, the Bird in Hand in Dartford, Kent. In just six months he has lost nine stone - and is still losing more every week - and has been named Male Slimmer of the Year at his Slimming World group. He now cooks all the family meals for wife Carol-Ann, 46, and kids Caitlin, 19, and Jack, 13, rustling up the likes of veg, meat and fruit.  Adam has also taken to cutting off all the fat from the meat and no longer suffers from arthritis and high blood pressure.   He also often posts on Slimming World\u0027s Pinch of Nom Facebook group with complete strangers asking him for help.   Adam now hopes his incredible weight loss story will help inspire men up and down the country to shift the pounds. He said: I started becoming unhappy after seeing pics of myself at my 40th birthday party last August. Then when I took my son to the England game at a Twickenham game I realised how unfit I was. We had seats at the top of the stadium and I was struggling to make my way up. But I\u0027ve completely turned it around now. If I can do it anybody can. I\u0027ve managed to shift the weight because when I do something I always commit. Beforehand I was boozing heavily and eating really unhealthy. If walked past a bakery I just had to go in.  Also working behind the bar meant that every night was a Friday night. We\u0027d have darts on Monday and Wednesdays and quiz nights on Thursdays. Punters would always offer to buy me a drink and I\u0027d always accept. I wouldn\u0027t have lunch or dinner during a stint behind the bar. I would wait until the shift ended before ordering myself a takeaway - it was usually a kebab. Since joining Slimming World I\u0027ve felt great. Before joining I was 26st 4lbs. I\u0027m down to 17st 4lbs which I haven\u0027t been since I was 18-years-old. Adam has won Slimmer of the Week award 12 times as well as nabbing the Slimmer of the Month gong for the last four months. He has also won Male Slimmer of the Year after shifting more weight than any other bloke.  His healthy eating habits have even rubbed off on his regulars with around 25 taking to his low-fat homemade curries in his award winning boozer. He continued: At the weekend I had my 40th birthday suit refitted. I lost six inches on my neck, 14 inches on my chest and 12 inches on my waist. The tailors were astonished by my weight loss. I hope my story inspires blokes to take up weight loss and Slimming World. I\u0027m a real man\u0027s man and when I walked into the class I was greeted to a room full of women.

Brian Mulroney and his twin brother John, the children of Meghan\u0027s best friend Jessica, were two of the couple\u0027s four page boys on their big day. The brothers had the important job of carrying the bride\u0027s five-metre long veil up the steps of St George\u0027s Chapel. But when they stopped at the top, as Meghan prepared to walk down the first part of the aisle alone, Brian\u0027s face was an absolute picture. Now his dad Ben, the son of former Canadian prime minster Brian Mulroney, has explained exactly what happened to make the seven-year-old so excited - and it\u0027s all to do with a trumpet.  Speaking to Canadian breakfast show Your Morning, the TV presenter said: I asked him, and he said he\u0027d never heard a trumpet before. I think when he walked in, he saw all the people there, and the flowers, none of that was there during the rehearsal.  Brian and John joined Prince George and Prince Harry\u0027s godson Jasper Dyer, six, who is the son of Amanda Dyer and Mark Dyer, as page boys. Their sister Ivy, four, was a bridesmaid, along with Princess Charlotte, Florence van Cutsem, three, Remi and Rylan Litt, aged six and seven. The youngest bridesmaid was two-year-old Zalie Warren.  Meghan didn\u0027t have any grown-up bridesmaids or a maid-of-honour, so all the attention was in the adorable little helpers. They all features in two of the couple\u0027s beautiful official wedding photos, taken by Alexi Lubomirski in Windsor Castle\u0027s Green Drawing Room.  Harry and Meghan have postponed their honeymoon to get going with royal duties, and attended their first official engagement as a married couple on Tuesday.

The new Duchess of Sussex will be assisted by Samantha Cohen, 49, who had been the Queen\u0027s assistant private secretary, and is expected to be brought up to speed with protocol and expectations of life with the monarchy. Ms Cohen gave notice of her resignation last September following the ousting of Sir Christopher, 56, the Queen\u0027s private secretary, who announced in July he was leaving after 15 years of royal service. But she has now agreed to stay on as interim private secretary to Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, according to The Times. The Duchess of Sussex, 36, is planning to spend six month\u0027s learning how to be an effective member of the royal family, the paper adds.   Samantha, an Australian and reportedly one of the Queen\u0027s most trusted aides, will guide the newlyweds through their first year of marriage.  It is thought Meghan will spend the rest of the year meeting charities and other good causes in a national tour only punctuated by their honeymoon while learning from mentor Ms Cohen, a mum of three.  A source told The Times: It will be six months of listening.  She is seeking out advice from a range of people. She is going to proceed with humility.   It is not going to be quiet, though. It is going to be a very busy office. She has worked every day of her life. She is used to a demanding schedule. Meghan - who announced her retirement from acting following her engagement to Prince Harry - has already made her first official outing in her new role at a garden party at Buckingam Palace to celebrate her father-in-law, Prince Charles, turning 70 this year. The garden party saw 6,000 guests enjoy the sunshine and a speech from the Duke of Sussex celebrating the charity work of his father - despite being momentarily distracted by a bee - much to his new wife\u0027s amusement. It is claimed Samantha Cohen found herself at the centre of an incredibly power struggle between Buckingham Palace and the Prince of Wales last year.  The Queen\u0027s most senior courtier Sir Christopher Geidt announced he was leaving in July last year following 15 years of service to the royal family. Two months later Ms Cohen, the third most senior courtier, submitted her resignation. Sources at the time claimed that the 49-year-old had quit in solidarity with Sir Christopher, who had been ousted following a series of complaints from Prince Charles and Prince Andrew with the Queen backing her sons over her staff.

The new Duke of Sussex dated Chelsy on and off for seven years from 2004 to 2011 and the jewellery designer was invited to the stunning wedding ceremony at St George\u0027s Chapel on Saturday - but not the evening reception at Frogmore House.  Another of Harry\u0027s exes, Cressida Bonas, was also at the Windsor Castle wedding.  According to Vanity Fair in the days before the wedding Harry , 33, and Chelsy, 32, had a tearful \u0027parting\u0027 phone call.  The publication claim a source told them: It was their final call, a parting call in which they both acknowledged Harry was moving on.  Chelsy was quite emotional about it all, she was in tears and almost didn’t go to the wedding. The prince and Chelsy remained good friends after their 2011 split with the 33-year-old invited to Prince William and Kate\u0027s wedding the same year. That set tongues wagging the pair were back on but Harry said he was 100% single amid a flutter of speculation he was interested in Pippa Middleton after she took the headlines for her bum at the ceremony.  But Zimbabwean Chelsy has spoke about the media scrutiny their romance suffered.  In an interview she said: It was so full-on: crazy and scary and uncomfortable. I found it very difficult when it was bad. I couldn\u0027t cope. I was trying to be a normal kid and it was horrible. Chelsy appeared uneasy while sat in St George\u0027s Chapel preparing to watch her one-time-beau tie the knot with American actress Meghan Markle.       But there is no bad blood between the pair. At the lunchtime reception Chelsy greeted the bride and was all smiles as she hugged her tightly, a source told the Mirror. Harry and Zimbabwean-born Chelsy met when they were both students at boarding school. She even met the Queen at a society wedding and was a guest at Prince Charles 60th 10 years ago, as her relationship with Harry became more serious.

The couple tied the knot at St George\u0027s Chapel on May 19 in an extravagant - but touching - ceremony. Their family and friends gathered - along with millions of people around the world - to see the happy pair say I do. With so much going on though you may have missed a few things. It\u0027s a little frightening when you consider how much work went into a single day. We\u0027ve taken a look at the facts and figures to break it all down for you. Meghan followed in Princess Diana\u0027s footsteps Harry and Meghan read traditional vows from the Common Book of Prayer, though Meghan left out the word obey - just like Diana did. Kate Middleton also left the word out when she married William in 2011. Meghan made history  Meghan began her wedding procession alone - after her father remained in the USA or an operation - though she was joined by Prince Charles at the Quire. She\u0027s the first royal bride to walk down the aisle without an escort. Meghan and Harry got new titles Hours before the wedding, the Queen announced they were now the Duke and Duchess of Sussex. Their wedding rings broke with tradition Harry broke with tradition, choosing to wear a wedding band. He went with a platinum band with a textured finish. Meghan\u0027s was made of Welsh gold, which Queen Elizabeth gifted to her.  There were a ton of celebs at the wedding and reception  David and Victoria Beckham were there, as were Amal and George Clooney. James Corden rocked up with his wife, and compered the reception later, even getting the royals to dance off. Meghan\u0027s friends, including Serena Williams, Priyanka Chopra and her Suits co-stars also were invited to the wedding.  Harry\u0027s exes were at the wedding Cressida Bonas and Chelsy Davis both attended, but everyone was fine with it, because that\u0027s what the royals do. Meghan\u0027s veil had intricate details  The 15-ft long veil was designed by Givenchy\u0027s Clare Waight Keller. She had flowers for every single commonwealth country as per Meghan\u0027s request. Meghan wedding dress  The first was by Givenchy, the second was by Stella McCartney and was more Hollywood in its look - a lily white halter neck. Meghan wore shoes from Aquazurra made in silky satin, with nude mesh and soles painted in baby blue.  Meghan\u0027s tiara was her something old She wore Queen Mary\u0027s old tiara which was lent to her by Queen Elizabeth II. She deliberately had subtle make up Just like Kate, Meghan had her close friends do her makeup rather than a professional.  Meghan\u0027s dad wasn\u0027t there Thomas Markle Snr had causes quite the drama beforehand. He was set to attend the wedding, but caused controversy when it was revealed pap pictures of him reading a book about London and googling his daughter were set up. It later emerged he needed a heart operation and would be unable to fly to the wedding or walk Meghan down the aisle. He told TMZ: My baby looks beautiful, and she looks very happy. He added: I wish I were there, and I wish them all my love and happiness.  Though her mum was - and alone   Doria Ragland sat alone, though it\u0027s thought the Bride and Groom sorted the seating. Harry\u0027s family were on the right, Meghan\u0027s on the left. She had a tear in her eye as she watched her daughter get married. What Harry said to Charles When Prince Charles reached Harry at the altar , Harry looked at him and said: Thank you, Pa. The entertainment in the church was amazing There were 23 boy choristers from St George\u0027s School as well as Sheku Kanneh-Mason, the 19-year-old who won BBC Young Musician of the Year, who was the cellist at the wedding. There was also a gospel choir who sang Etta James and Stand By Me. There were twins as page boys  The son of Meghan\u0027s best friend Jessica were page boys - Brian and John held her veil and looked very excited about it all. Prince George was also a page boy and his sister Charlotte was a bridesmaid.  Jasper Dyer, 6, was also a pageboy.  Who were Meghan\u0027s bridemaids? There were no adult bridemaids. Meghan chose children to take on the roles. Florence van Cutsem, 3, Zalie Warren, 2 - and Markle\u0027s goddaughters - Remi and Rylan Litt.  Jessica Mulroney daughter Ivy, 4, was also a bridemaid.   There was an A-list guestlist 600 invitations were made by Barnard \u0026amp Westwood for the event, though only 200 were invited to Frogmore House. The couple also invited members of the public, with 2,640 people getting an invite.

It was a big logistical event Volunteers helped out on the day, with 140 Royal Borough Ambassadors stewarding. It cost \u0026pound30 to park at the Review Ground on the day, and there were 6,000 spots. Security operation About \u0026pound30m was spent on security for the wedding. The Met Police identified 160 \u0027stalkers\u0027 before the event.  TV channels All the channels from around the world descended on Windsor. Most impressive though was Sky who laid 27km of cable to broadcast the coverage in UHD, making them the first broadcaster to televise it in 4k. Their first dance was to Whitney Houston They went for something a bit different and had I Wanna Dance With Somebody - instead of dancing alone they invited their guests to the dancefloor with them. They went into a bit of jive and lindy hop. Jaguar E-Type  The number plate was the date of the wedding. The car was a silver blue classic convertible Jaguar E-Type Concept Zero, originally made in 1968 but made into an electric car. The reception was at Frogmore House ...so called because of the frogs that live in the low lying marshy area. It\u0027s only open on three ticketed charity days. Guests partied in a glass marquee, it was also where they had their sit down meal.  The cake was massive There was quite an ingredients list for the cake.   The flowers were donated to a hospice  Floral designer Phillippa Craddock directed a team, including florists from St George\u0027s Chapel and Buckingham Palace, to create the wedding displays. The flowers have gone to St Joseph\u0027s Hospice in Hackney, East London.   They had a great evening reception  There\u0027s so many details from the reception we gathered them all together in our behind-the-scenes break down of what happened . Highlights included a firework display at 11pm, George Clooney dancing with Meghan, but being shunned by Fergie and a special cocktail being created for Harry with ginger in it as a nod to his red hair.  Dirty burgers were served with candyfloss. Serena Williams played beer pong Apparently she played it like it was tennis.  Idris Elba had a turn on the decks While DJ Sam Totolee provided the music in the main, Idis did a stint as well. Think 80s and R\u0026ampB. Elton John sang a Disney song  He also sang Tiny Dancer, Your Song, and I\u0027m Still Standing. The Disney song was Circle of Life.

Her eyes were closed and she seemed peacefully asleep, with fairy lights around her bed as her favourite music played softly in the background. The image still brings so much comfort to her mum Stephanie because, tragically, Daisy wasn’t asleep, she had died at the age of just 12. It was thanks to a special mattress Stephanie was able to collect such precious memories during a week with her little girl after she had passed away. For the mum and her three other children, being able to say goodbye to Daisy in their own home was crucial to the grieving process.  “She just looked like she was asleep,” the 49-year-old mum says. “It was amazing to be able to feel like she was with us. You have these visions of her looking like something from Silent Witness, lying there in the mortuary, but it was just like having her home again.” Daisy died in 2017 of a rare condition called Costello syndrome, which affects fewer than 300 children worldwide. It is caused by a mutation of a cancer- causing gene, which meant Daisy had a 17% increased risk of developing a cancerous tumour, heart and bone problems. She lived longer than doctors expected but eventually it was too much for her body to cope with. After she died, Daisy’s family were able to take her home to Wimbledon, South West London, for an extra week before they laid her to rest because of the special cold mattress. “When Daisy came home she was in her nightie, we put her duvet on her and tucked her toys around her,” Stephanie says. “I played her music, the soundtrack to Frozen, we had some candles on. My children and I just drifted in and out of her room. It was like she was sleeping. But I did keep expecting her to wake up and say ‘go away!’  “People might hear that and say, ‘Oh my God, that’s really freaky’, but it felt like the most natural thing in the world. I felt I’d reclaimed her. I’d brought her away from a traumatic death and a medical environment and she was just my little girl tucked up in bed.” The technology is not widely available but a small number of hospices have the mattresses. Stephanie, a writer and campaigner, explains: “It’s a blue, plastic-coated mattress and it has cooling fluid and is attached to a tube. It acts like a padded fridge or a freezer block, you put that on the bed and put normal bedding over the top. “I was astounded that there is very little information about these cold mattresses. If Daisy had been under a different hospice, we wouldn’t have been able to take her home after she died. “The most horrific thing for me is that she would’ve had to go to the mortuary. Embalming was the other option, which is horrible. How horrific – you’ve just lost a child and then have to go through that. “The mattresses seem to be really rare, we were so lucky our hospice uses them.” They took Daisy home for a night and then spent seven nights with her at Shooting Star Chase children’s hospice, where she spent so much of her life.  It has been a traumatic couple of years for the family. Stephanie’s husband of 23 years Andy died from cancer a year before Daisy in December 2015, leaving Stephanie as a single mum to Daisy, Theo, 21, Xanthe, 19, and Jules, 15. Being able to spend the extra time with Daisy has been hugely beneficial to them all. Theo and Jules decided that the night with Daisy at home brought them enough closure, but Stephanie and Xanthe spent the rest of the week with her in the hospice, where they re-created Daisy’s bedroom. Stephanie says: “My other daughter spent so much time with Daisy in the hospice, she painted her nails, did her make-up. After Andy died, she didn’t want to be there right at the end. “But actually with Daisy, she said being able to spend time with her and dress her up in her favourite Princess Anna dress, from Frozen, and put all her toys around her was so healing.” Now Stephanie is able to remember her daughter at peace. “Daisy looked so relaxed at the end,” she says. “She had been in a lot of pain for the last few months of her life and was very tense. When she died, we all said how long she looked because she wasn’t tense any more. “In my mind I have that beautiful picture, not on a ventilator and bloated from the fluid, with tubes everywhere. “I have a nice picture. Had I not been able to have that, my last memory of her would’ve been before she went to the mortuary.” "},{"url":null,"title":"world cup heist solved 52","story":"NewsThe mystery of who stole the World Cup trophy in 1966 has finally been solved - gangland brothers \u0027nicked it for the thrill\u0027WORLD EXCLUSIVE: After a 10-month investigation, the Daily Mirror can reveal the Jules Rimet trophy was stolen by London gangster Sidney Cugullere and his brother Reg - and why they dumped it in a hedge\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByTom Pettifor06:43, 24 MAY 2018Updated12:43, 24 MAY 2018NewsVideo LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in 8CancelPlay now\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailSidney Cugullere loved to boast that he was the first Englishman to lift the World Cup – long before a victorious Bobby Moore at Wembley. Gangland’s “Mr Crafty”, Sidney was the man who stole the Jules Rimet trophy months before England hosted the 1966 tournament, the Mirror reveals today. Until now mystery has surrounded its theft, and what happened to the precious cup in the week before it was found again by a dog called Pickles. But now, with the 2018 World Cup just 22 days away, our investigation tells for the first time the story behind one of the world’s most notorious thefts.   \u0027He was thieving from a young age\u0027: The life and crimes of the man who stole the 1966 World Cup  Armed robber Sidney, then 40, stole the trophy with the help of brother Reg, say three independent sources with knowledge of the heist including Reg’s son Gary. And he did it just for fun, says Gary, who decided to tell the story after he was approached by the Mirror. He said: “Sidney just nicked it for the thrill – not for financial gain, but just because it was so easy.” It led to one of the biggest manhunts in Scotland Yard’s history and became a bigger story than that year’s general election.  But Cugullere died of cancer in 2005, aged 79, having never been caught.  Only a handful of relatives, friends and gangland figures have known the truth. One source said: “Many a time Sid would say he was the first Englishman to lift the World Cup in 1996 and that he did it before Bobby Moore. “He was an opportunist and the stealing of the Cup was just that. He didn’t have any inside information or help from the guards.  It was spur of the moment.” He had tried to extort a ransom of \u0026pound15,000 for the trophy with the help of pal Ted Betchley, but the plan went wrong after his friend was arrested.  Yet still he was not exposed as the culprit.   The Mirror has spent 10 months tracing Cugullere’s history and family after a source disclosed the thief was a man named “Sidney Coo”. Using interviews with insiders, police files and National Archives records we pieced together the most complete picture so far of what happened. Cugullere, jailed for more than 25 years for other offences, took the winged Greek goddess figurine on Sunday 20 March 1966 from the Methodist Central Hall in Westminster, Central London.   History of Jules Rimet trophy as mystery behind stolen 1966 World Cup revealed  It was insured for \u0026pound30,000 and was being exhibited in a glass cabinet by the Stanley Gibbons stamp company.  Sir Stanley Rous, the president of FIFA, had only agreed to it being released from the FA headquarters on condition it was watched 24 hours a day. The exhibition was closed on the Sunday and there were four guards on duty, split into two pairs. One source said Cugullere told him in the 1980s how he had pulled off the burglary.  He had driven to Westminster from his home in Walworth, South East London, to case out security after hearing the Cup was on display there.  Wearing a brown removals-style coat he walked into the area open to the public and went to the locked room where the trophy was housed in a padlocked cabinet. The source said: “There were those door handles you get on schools, the large metal ones, and he realised he could unscrew them and get in. The handle fell and was hanging there.” The handles were holding a wooden bar across the rear doors. Once removed, Cugullere could get inside. The insider said: “Sid had a bag with his tools including bolt cutters. “He said he couldn’t believe it was just in a glass-fronted wooden cabinet with a chain and a little Woolworths padlock on it, and no security watching it.  He cut the chain and in seconds got the cabinet open. When he got it out, he braced himself to lift it, expecting it to be very heavy.  “But he said it was so light it was untrue. He said it wouldn’t have made much as scrap in them days.” Cugullere then put the trophy in his bag and walked out. Gary says his father Reg told him he was also in the Methodist Central Hall, but did not see Sidney take the cup. He said: “On the street after coming out of the doors Sid lifted his jacket and said, ‘’Ere you are, Reg, look at this’. He opened one side of his jacket and the World Cup was there.  “My dad went: “F***ing hell, Sid, what the f*** do you think we are going to do with that?” Back at the Methodist Central Hall, security guards were in for a shock.  Senior guard Frank Hudson was meant to be keeping a constant eye on the Cup with colleague George Franklin on the first floor. Franklin later told police he checked the Cup at 11am before going for a coffee with Hudson.  At 12.10pm, one of the downstairs guards found the padlock on the case removed and the trophy stolen. The next day police issued a description of a lone thief in his late 30s, around 5ft 10in with sallow skin, dark eyes and greased-down black hair. The description fitted Cugullere. Sidney took the trophy home, but soon realised his wife Nell “would have flung him out” if she found it. So he called Reg, who took it home in his car to Leighton Buzzard, Beds.  And that’s when police nearly found the trophy they were all searching for. The source said: “Reggie had it under the front seat. He got pulled at a general stop by the police and they searched the car but didn’t find it.” Rewards totalling \u0026pound5,500 were soon offered for its safe return, far more than Sidney could get if he melted down the 14in gold-plated silver Cup.  DI Len Buggy of the elite Flying Squad led the probe.  His break came when the Chelsea and FA chairman Joe Mears was phoned by a man calling himself Jackson, who said a parcel would be arriving the next day. It arrived three days after the theft, on the Wednesday, and contained lining from the trophy and a ransom note demanding \u0026pound15,000 in five and one-pound notes.  The note, written by Cugullere, said: “Dear Joe Kno (sic) doubt you view with very much concern the loss of the world cup...to me it is only so much scrap gold.” He said the cup would be “for the POT” if the ransom was not paid. Buggy posed as Mears and arranged to meet “Jackson” in Battersea Park – in fact Sidney’s friend Ted Betchley, 46, a former docker.  Betchley was arrested. He insisted he was just the middleman, paid \u0026pound500 for his part, and was jailed for just two years. Gary said soon after the theft Reg and Sidney hid the World Cup in Reg’s father-in-law’s coal shed.   He added: “My dad was freaking out and he knew there was no way they could sell the cup.  They didn’t melt it down or destroy it because it’s the World Cup. They realised they had to give it back.”  Seven days after the theft, on March 27, docker David Corbett was taking his cross-bred collie Pickles for a walk when he spotted the cup in the street. It remains unclear how it got there. Corbett collected \u0026pound6,000 in rewards. Bobby Moore went on to lift the Cup after England defeated Germany 4-2 in the eighth World Cup final.

The 39-year-old PR director, from High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, said he always tells staff when there\u0027s an issue with his food, and usually comes away with a free dish or a discount. The worst culprit is the burger - they always put mayonnaise on burgers, he said.  Mayonnaise is a tyrant of a condiment, and very arrogant. It thinks it makes everything better but it does not.  Chris, dubbed Britain\u0027s biggest moaner by  The Sun  , said he prefers to be known as the best at not putting up with poor service and mistakes.  And he has advised other diners to speak up when there are problems with orders.   He told the BBC  that he earns around \u0026pound1,000 a year by sending mayonnaise-ridden food back after specifically requesting his food comes with no may.  Chris added he makes money complaining about others elements of service too. In total, he estimates he\u0027s made about \u0026pound3,000 since he started complaining.

It wasn’t exactly encouraging.\u0026#8221Mark was 19 when he left Dundee and decided to travel Europe by rail, and it was those experiences that prompted him to write a book, a gay coming-of-age adventure titled Changing Trains.\u0026#8220The main character in the story is Sam, but much of it is based on my own experiences travelling alone in Europe in 1985,\u0026#8221 he said.\u0026#8220I’m a big fan of the novelist Christopher Isherwood, whose books formed the basis for the film Cabaret.\u0026#8220My title is a nod to his book Mr Norris Changes Trains.\u0026#8220Isherwood’s Fraulein Schroeder is remembered in my book as Madame Gilbert and all the young female characters that Sam encounters in my book kind of collectively represent Isherwood’s Sally Bowles.\u0026#8221\u0026#8220When I travelled across Europe in 1985, we were still in the cold war era \u0026#8211 weird to think we could heading that way again now \u0026#8211 and it was pre-Shengen, so I had to go through border controls as I entered and left each country and there was no euro at this point, so I had to get my head around constantly changing my currencies \u0026#8211 pounds to francs to pesetas to lira. This is all described in the book, and I have a little fun with it.\u0026#8221Mark began writing the book in 2010, while he was travelling between his work in London and a small house in France.\u0026#8220I’m a huge fan of Ian Fleming’s James Bond stories and when I travelled to places like Paris, Monte Carlo, Venice and the French Riviera \u0026#8211 all places that have appeared in Fleming’s novels \u0026#8211 it really felt like you were in the world of Bond, so I play with this a bit too,\u0026#8221 he said.\u0026#8220And when I went Interrailing, I travelled \u0026#8211 as everyone did back then \u0026#8211 with a number of compilation tapes for my Walkman, so the soundtrack to the book is also very 80s.\u0026#8220Everything from Duran Duran’s Bond theme ‘A View to a Kill’ to Simple Minds’ Glittering Prize album. Fab music.\u0026#8221The story starts in Dundee, and Mark said it was central to the story of Sam\u0026#8217s journey from uncertain, undecided small-town boy to a modern, outward-looking European with a sense of direction in his life.\u0026#8220Once the main character Sam has left Dundee and is discovering new cities like Paris, Barcelona and Monte Carlo, he often compares them with his origins. His experience of ‘otherness’ opens new possibilities to him, ones that weren’t available in Dundee at that time,\u0026#8221 Mark said.He initially started looking for a publisher for the book but decided instead to self-publish and said the reviews had been great.\u0026#8220I’ve been amazed at how many people have said it really took them back to that period and reminded them of their own lives back then. I love that it resonates with them,\u0026#8221 he said.\u0026#8220I’ve also done some readings in London and a few guest spots on blogs.

Prior to that the Tangerines were unbeaten in 15 of 16 league games he played.With the 25-year-old set to return around the start of the new season, Duff believes it was vital United beat off interest from Championship rivals Ross County to get him fixed up on a new two-year contract. Having known him since he was a kid at Aberdeen the best part of a decade ago, Duff is well placed to judge what he can do.“I actually watched one of United’s play-off games with Fraser and from speaking to him I know he is working hard to get back fit,” he said.“He’s about to start running again so it shouldn’t be too long before he is back. That, and him signing a new deal, is very good news for United.“You saw the quality he has when he played for part of last season.“He was a bit of a stand-out in the United team and I will not be surprised if that’s the case again next season.“It really will not surprise me if they build the team around him because that’s the level of ability he has.”With most of last season’s team gone, Fyvie will be surrounded by new faces.That will make United something of an unknown quantity and bringing so many players in at one time has to be something of a gamble.For Duff it’s a calculated risk and, so long as the right type of player is sourced, he believes the team can gel.“I think if you go out and get the right players with the right attitude and philosophy, it can work.“You want players who want to come in and work hard to prove, basically, why the club signed them and that they should be playing at a club like United. If they do that then United can be where they want to be.”And having spent the best part of a decade at Tannadice from the start of his career, he would like nothing better than to see them back in the top flight.Last week he was back in a United strip for Dave Bowman’s annual game to raise cash for skin cancer and dementia charities. Running out at Tannadice reminded Duff where United should be.“You look around the place and it’s geared up for the Premiership but no one has the divine right to be there, you have to earn it. It will be a battle again next season because it’s a tough league.“But I was here nine-and-a-half years from when I was a kid and the upbringing here was very good – second to none – so I want United back up.”At 36, and despite recently taking on a new job with the Connect Energy Group that involves a lot of travelling, Duff has no plans to hang up his own boots.Next season he’ll again be plying his trade in the Highland League with Inverurie Locos.“The new job is keeping me busy but I do get Saturdays off so I’m available and happy to keep playing.“We finished third last year, so the aim is to go a bit higher next season.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"livingston star byrne on dundee united radar","story":"\t\t\t\t\tLivingston promotion hero Shaun Byrne is the latest player to be linked with a move to Dundee United.But the Tangerines will face stiff competition from elsewhere if they do move for him.The 24-year-old was part of the side that clinched promotion to the Premiership by beating Partick Thistle in the play-offs on Sunday.He’s now out of contract and that’s alerted United, Falkirk and a string of English clubs.

proud of stints at both dundee and united but focus is now on hibs","story":"\t\t\t\t\tSought-after Simon Murray’s future will not be decided until July at the very earliest.And while the striker, who’s just finished a loan spell at Dundee, is extremely flattered by interest from the other side of Tannadice Street, his first choice is to remain at parent club Hibs.Murray is currently enjoying his summer break but is well aware of speculation linking him with a return to first full-time employers Dundee United.Beaten Scottish Cup finalists Motherwell are also known to be considering a summer move for him and, dating back to his time at United, several clubs in Europe have monitored his progress.As recently as Dundee’s victory over St Johnstone last month, one sent their chief scout to update their file on him.For the 26-year-old, however, the next piece of business he aims to be involved in is a battle to re-establish himself at Easter Road.“I am contracted to Hibs for another year and, although I spent the second half of the season on loan at Dundee, my aim has always been to go back there.“I still finished the season top scorer for them and, even when I went to Dundee in January, the plan was always to go back.“At the time I spoke to Neil Lennon and he stressed whether or not I went was entirely down to me.“I could have stayed and he would have considered me for selection but really the move came up because Anthony Stokes had left and they needed a No 10.“They wanted Scott Allan and the only way the deal was going to be done was if I went to Dundee, so the gaffer did say to me I would be back in the summer.“He’s told me I can stake a claim for a place in the team next season and I know, if he says that, he means it, because he’s very honest with me.”Should things not work out in his second season at Hibs, Murray will look at his situation.“Obviously, if they sign another striker or decide to go another way I’ll have to think about what happens next, so it is good to know other clubs are interested. If it doesn’t work out, the only person I will blame is myself but I feel the move to Dundee has been good for me because it’s got me a lot more Premiership experience.”He admits had the loan interest at the turn of the year been from someone other than Dundee, there’s a fair chance he would have opted to stay put.“A lot’s been said about me being a Dundee fan and that was a factor.“More important was it was a move that wasn’t going to involve me having to get used to a new city or league.“I stayed at my mum’s when I was back up and I already knew some of the boys, so it was easy to settle in. I’m not saying I wouldn’t have gone somewhere else but all that made it an easier choice to come.”And, as a proud Dundonian, Murray admits the fact he’s joined a select band of players to have worn dark blue and tangerine is pleasing.“I will look back at the end of my career and be proud I played for Dundee and United. While I’m a Dundee fan, even before I was at United I was never one who didn’t want them to do well.“I always went to see both teams and I still do. I’m a football fan and I want to see both sides from my city doing well.“Now I’ve got a United connection, they are a club I will always have a lot of time for.“They were the team that gave me my chance in the game full-time and I’m grateful for that.“I still know a lot of people there and they are very good people who I respect a lot.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/05/5b03eb105ae54.jpg ","title":"zimbabwe international striker macauley bonne tops dundee wishlist","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee are in the hunt for a goalscorer and Leyton Orient marksman Macauley Bonne is top of their wishlist.The Zimbabwe international scored 25 goals for the National League side last season, sparking the Dark Blues interest.Born in Ipswich, Bonne started his career at Colchester United, where he played with current Dundee midfielder Glen Kamara briefly, before loans at Lincoln City and Woking.It’s been at Brisbane Road, however, where he’s shone, smashing in 22 league goals last season.With a year remaining on his current deal there, a fee will be required to prise him from Orient and that could be a sticking point with the non-league side holding out for six figures.With Shrewsbury, Portsmouth and Burton Albion all interested, too, Dundee have fierce competition to land the 22-year-old striker.Orient are also keen to keep him on a longer contract but a mid-table finish in the National League is unlikely to have been enough to keep him amid interest from other clubs.Dens gaffer Neil McCann highlighted a lack of killer instinct in his side throughout last season, something he is determined to rectify this summer with a proven goalscorer.With money in the bank from the January sale of defender Jack Hendry, Dundee have the funds behind them to strengthen that area of the team.And having already raided the English non-league for Roarie Deacon last summer and Elton Ngwatala last week, Neil is hoping he can attract another National League star to come north of the border.\t\t\t"},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7486028.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"She did it  Swindon star Maisie Sly s film wins at the

2020.\"Alex Paterson, chief executive of HES, said: \"Through schemes such as City Heritage Trust funding, organisations best placed to understand local needs have the opportunity to not only improve

by communities themselves \u0026ndash by the individuals and organisations who know best how to tackle the issues affecting their communities and harnessing the energy of local people. We are seeing the positive impacts previous funding rounds have had on local communities, including the employment opportunities generated and stronger economies from successful commercial ventures.\"Cabinet Secretary for Culture, Fiona Hyslop, said: \"The City Heritage Trust scheme will help ensure the conditions and quality of their local historic environment can be improved and preserved for future generations, while bringing immediate, tangible benefits to communities across the country.\"Thursday 24 May 2018 4:36 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04101000/04101605.jpg","title":"New community cafe for Merkinch","story":"\u0026nbspA NEW caf\u0026eacute in the heart of an Inverness community is aiming to become a much-needed social hub for the area\u0027 residents.The Coffee House has opened in the Bike Shed in Merkinch in a joint partnership involving the Methodist Church and King\u0027 Fellowship which runs a successful coffee shop in a converted fish processing factory in the Smithton Industrial Estate.The facility, in Grant Street, will open initially Wednesdays to Fridays between 10am and 3pm serving barista-made coffees at affordable prices but the aim is to extend to a fourth day and also to open in the evenings.Chris Dowling, pastor of King\u0027 Fellowship, said surveys had revealed residents felt the area desperately needed a caf\u0026eacute.\"We hope mums will call in on their way back from dropping off the children at school, as well as others in the community who might feel lonely or isolated,\" he said.\"Part of the vision is to create the best coffee shop in the Highlands in the heart of Grant Street but also a place for the community to meet.\"Thursday 24 May 2018 4:36 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04102000/04102991.jpg","title":"New riverside artwork unveiled","story":"\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspArtists Sans facon and OSA unveiled their design -
