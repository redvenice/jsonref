The DIY chain is classed as an essential retailer under the government’s high street lockdown rules, but it shut up shop in March before making a staged return with 155 stores last week.B\u0026ampQ has followed the example of supermarkets by limiting the number of customers in stores, switching to card-only payments and installing perspex screens at checkouts. Owing to the bulky nature of some DIY materials, the retailer is allowing two people to shop together so that they can “self-serve” larger items.Rival chain Homebase is also returning to full strength. It currently has 70 of its 164 stores open, but said they would all be open by Saturday. The Homebase chief executive, Damian McGloughlin, said a lot of hard work had gone in to ensure it could “safely welcome customers back through our doors”.Pret a Manger said that on Friday, another 20 London stores would reopen to sell sandwiches and coffee as either takeaways or for delivery through apps such as Deliveroo and Just Eat. Stores will only open until 2pm, with the new wave of openings taking the number trading to 30.Pret’s chief executive, Pano Christou, said the shops looked and felt a little different from before because of physical distancing measures: “I believe we’ve found a way to operate that reflects the government’s guidance and looks after our teams and customers,” he said. “We’ll keep on learning from these shops as we look to reopen more over the coming weeks.”A growing band of fast-food companies including Nando’s, Burger King, KFC and Wagamama have also started to lift the shutters.

As such, government may need to be flexible with its future support schemes in the same way that industry is going to have to be flexible with its recovery plans.”In its lobbying of ministers, the employers’ organisation has been arguing that there will be a medium-term need for government to support a recapitalisation effort for businesses that will struggle to repay debt incurred during lockdown.“Some of the current schemes don’t work for everyone, with a lot of firms very nervous about taking on big debts in this climate with no certainty about when they can repay it,” Phipson said. “In that context, government should be working with the banks and other partners to consider a wider range of options.”Make UK said that on the basis of its survey of almost 300 companies, the fall in manufacturing was likely to be larger and that conditions were unlikely to return to anything like normal for some time to come. It urged the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, to consider extending the government’s furloughing scheme beyond the end of June. Its survey showed:Phipson said: “While many manufacturers continue to operate and supply our food, vital medical equipment and PPE, there is no disguising that for the sector overall these are deeply worrying times.“The extent of the collapse in demand is such it means that the recent OBR forecast could be an underestimate unless there is a quite remarkable turnaround, which, to be frank, just isn’t going to happen.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3af5ea9786616d8c2775becb9c4e1f1869b92f9e/0_253_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7767ed79f202002c5917437efab0b4db","title":"coronavirus disruption automation","story":"New technology tends to be difficult to implement. Unfortunately for many workers, difficult is the new normalIt’s funny how quickly the strange and unfamiliar become routine. After weeks of awkwardness at the supermarket checkout, suddenly the choreography is getting easier: I’ve almost mastered the new rhythm of packing, waiting decorously for the cashier to move their hand away before swooping on whatever they’ve passed across the scanner. Even the sight of conveyor belts being doused with disinfectant after every customer seems almost normal now, although it shouldn’t.Supermarket workers have been the forgotten heroes of lockdown, valiantly turning up to work for not much money in one of the few public places the virus can still easily spread, providing the only friendly faces some customers will see until next week. All of which makes the constant appeals over the in-store PA for shoppers to download self-scanning apps – don’t check out, just zap everything as you sling it in the trolley and go! – frankly disconcerting. It sounds the kindest thing, shielding till staff from our filthy germs. But what stops me signing up is a nagging worry about what happens to the cashiers when most people no longer need them. Doing them out of a job seems no way to reward their service. But is queueing at their checkouts morally any better, if all it does is endanger them?Here then is the horrible choice coronavirus will spring on us as the working world creaks slowly back to life: between lingering fear of infection on one hand, and the relentless march of automation on the other. Recessions don’t so much change the world as speed it up, accelerating trends already rippling beneath the surface. And even before this epidemic hit, a much-quoted Office for National Statistics study estimated around 1.5m British jobs were at high risk from automation. Now the epidemic is pressing fast-forward on all of that, with four in 10 companies surveyed by the consultants EY admitting they’re now bringing forward their plans for automation. Machines can still pass on the virus – think of all the grubby paws touching that bank ATM before yours – but at least they don’t get sick themselves.The business secretary, Alok Sharma, will shortly publish detailed safety guidance for opening businesses back up. But we know that social distancing will be in place until at least the end of the year, or maybe longer without a vaccine. When people can’t safely hotdesk, stand side by side on a production line, or even queue up for lunch together in the canteen, the only realistic way of operating many offices and factories will be with far fewer people moving around the same space.For some, that might just mean more working from home. But how does, say, a fast-food restaurant kitchen churn out the same number of burgers with less than half the staff? The best employers will move heaven and earth to protect their people, but for some the obvious answer is automating, and slashing the wage bill.What has saved many jobs until now is that new technology tends to be expensive and disruptive, annoying customers. But disruption is the new norm, and if lockdown has intensified a craving for human contact it’s also left both businesses and customers strapped for cash.Online yoga at home can’t match the conviviality of a live class, but if it’s cheaper and safer than going to the gym, people might settle for it. This week’s mass redundancies at British Airways, meanwhile, reflect the harsh reality that the days of middle managers hopping unthinkingly on a plane to Brussels or Frankfurt probably aren’t coming back. Weeks of being forcibly grounded have taught companies that video meetings have their drawbacks, but they’re cheap by comparison. What could have been a gentle managed decline for aviation, driven by the climate crisis, now looks like more of a crash landing with knock-on consequences for others reliant on business travellers: hotel chains, cab drivers, expense-account dining. It has never just been about robots taking work from humans, but technology reinventing processes in ways that mean the work is no longer there to be done.Like every technological revolution before it, this one will surely bring some changes that genuinely enhance our lives, even some that may protect us from shocks to come. We’d barely have survived this one if it hadn’t been for the high-speed broadband that makes working from home feasible, or the consolations of Zoom calls and family WhatsApp groups, and this time the race for tests and vaccines may drive valuable innovation in pharmaceutical industries. But the coming turmoil will be tough on the low paid and low skilled, on older workers who don’t have years left to rethink their choices, on people whose lives were already precarious and now will get more so. The economist Nouriel Roubini warns ominously of a new wave of automation “further fanning the flames of populism, nationalism and xenophobia” as wages are forced down all over again.The idea that taxing our new tech overlords, and redistributing the money to support a happy life of leisure for all, will resolve all this is comforting but scarcely credible. A major rethink of tax and welfare systems will obviously be part of the answer. But a universal basic income can’t realistically be high enough to guarantee the good life for everyone, and lockdown has taught us there’s only so much sourdough most people can bake before starting to crave something real to do.There are no easy answers here, only the grim certainty that if politicians don’t start grappling seriously with the question then once again they risk being overtaken by events. Britain planned for a pandemic like this for years, but still wasn’t ready for it. Don’t let the same be true of its aftermath."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/84bfeb53090147672d7ae394c452aab6d5f983fa/165_313_2957_1773/master/2957.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2713c349679a11e47ec09991fb8c541a","title":"famous photographers donate prints for food banks in pictures","story":"Martin Parr, Nadav Kander and Elaine Constantine are among 160 British and UK-based photographers who have donated images to sell for the Trussell Trust, prompted by a huge rise in the number of people relying on charity.

We see the benefits of this in our daily lives, whether it’s filing and paying taxes online, renewing a passport, booking a driving test or registering to vote. Offering services online means they can be provided far quicker and at a lower administrative cost, saving citizens time and helping government bodies to get the most out of finite budgets.However, because the services are now available through a computer or smartphone, there is an inherent risk of hackers gaining access to highly sensitive personal information.The public sector is now realising, as are many private companies, that this means cybersecurity can never be just an afterthought, and nor is it just a means of protecting online services from hackers.Important though that still is, digitally astute public bodies are starting to see cybersecurity as a mindset and a suite of enabling tools that help innovate new services to make life more convenient for the public. They also drive budgetary efficiencies through reduced administration, less paperwork and smoother running IT projects.As Stephen Wray, director of the cyber risk services team at Deloitte, explains, this means public organisations are now embracing cybersecurity as a vital consideration right from the start of a project. “It used to be a case of building something and then passing it on to the cyber team at the end of a project to see if it was secure,” he says. “Today, though, smart organisations realise they need to build in security-by-design throughout the entire process.”This is not just because compliance has been brought into sharper focus by the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which offers members of the public more privacy and greater control over how companies and government departments collect and store their information.In Wray’s opinion, public organisations seeking the best advice will come to see compliance as “a carrot, not a stick”, because by ensuring secure-by-design practice is incorporated from the start to the end of all projects, government services are empowered to deliver optimal features and at the same time provide a defendable position should there be a cybersecurity incident.People expect any provider of public services to be as flexible as any private company they deal with. Rather than fill in forms and queue in a town hall, they want to press a button on a smartphone to access services. This digital first approach requires a total rethink about how security is applied.“Cybersecurity has just got so much bigger. It used to be about securing a clearly defined perimeter,” says Wray. “Now cyber is everywhere. It is foundational and an enabler for all digital technology. Organisations are having to think about the wider picture, often critical systems and key assets are not within an organisation’s control and a significant portion of the value of the organisation rests in its supply chain. They may have computer-controlled devices, such as security cameras or automated doors to a public building, or huge swathes of citizen data managed and maintained by somebody else. Systems are built on systems and things can get complicated very quickly. It is within this complexity that hackers thrive. That’s why you need to start out every project with security in mind from the start.”Deloitte is finding that embracing this approach of security-by-design is enabling public bodies to turn around the preconception of cybersecurity as an expensive bolt-on to a suite of tools that can actually boost IT efficiency. “When organisations build security-by-design into everything they do, they prevent over-specification of the solution and avoid putting in too many features that are often unnecessary, unused and expand the opportunity for vulnerabilities from a security perspective,” says Wray. “What we’re seeing is that when cyber is built in from the start, public sector bodies don’t overscope, they can get it just right.”And when they get it right, they achieve two huge strategic goals at the same time. Not only do they protect citizens’ data and help maintain the public’s trust in government services, they also keep pace with the public’s expectations for how they should be empowered to interact with those services. Rather than get left behind, the public sector can be at the forefront of designing innovative services.“People want to use the latest, smartest products and services, but they can’t unless they’re safe,” says Wray. “It doesn’t matter what new technology can do, it’s only of use if it can be made secure for the public to enjoy. That’s what makes cybersecurity such an exciting, enabling capability. Without it, you couldn’t launch anything new without risking the trust customers have in you.”Wray cautions that government bodies must not only work on the technology but also the people within their organisations. “People can be your strongest link,” says Wray. A user-enabled security approach means that well-trained and cyber savvy workers can contribute to the overall security posture of the organisation. A single compromised computer could provide a path to a treasure trove of citizen data. But healthy password use, security policy adoption and being able to identify and report phishing will counter some of the most prevalent and common attack vectors.Getting the people focus right and embracing cybersecurity throughout the life cycle of any new service is essential. When combined, these measures allow the public sector to delight citizens with convenient, slick new ways of accessing services that they might have previously only imagined was possible through a Silicon Valley startup."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b71146d7470fdf70872d4544c8edfc6f014cdc97/0_0_4829_2899/master/4829.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b0f7f06e895f21cdc09326c1e8f5ef2c","title":"sixth formers how has coronavirus impacted you","story":"We’d like to hear from students in their final year of A Level studies about how the lockdown is impacting themCoronavirus has impacted all levels of education, from nurseries to final exams.

It’s a bucolic setting – surrounded by trees smothered in ivy, primroses and old hedgerows. One of his pleasures is sitting under a hedge and listening to a robin sing. “It’s just an eruption, an incredible drive to produce this cascade of notes to say this is my space and my time and I’m going to prosper. It’s really pumping it out, it’s a fabulous natural concert and it’s available to everyone,” he says.Packham, who has created the self-isolation bird club with his step-daughter, zoologist Megan McCubbin, can see marsh tits, greenfinches, great tits and chaffinches on his bird feeder. “All of this wildlife is quite literally on my doorstep. This is an opportunity – and we need to be finding opportunities in this chaos – to reconnect with nature,” he says.Lockdown is a chance to get to know the natural world that surrounds us, and notice its abundance – even in the most familiar places.This week, the \u0027s Age of Extinction site is looking at bioersity in cities and urban areas around the world, shining a spotlight on the under-appreciated world of nature hidden among the highrises and busy roads.The Covid-19 outbreak has seen cities and towns across the world go into lockdown which has enabled wildlife such as wild boar, deer, monkeys, foxes and even lions to venture into territory previously dominated by humans. It has also offered us the chance to notice and appreciate the natural world in cities in an unprecedented way.In this special series of reports we\u0027ll be looking at how animals and plants adapt to city life, what to look out for right now and how we can encourage more wild cities in the future.It could be a plant peeping through pavement cracks, a moth fluttering around a bulb in the bathroom or the sound of birds screeching overhead during the spring migration.Even city-dwellers, whose skies are filled with pigeons, have the chance to become armchair ornithologists. These birds – whose wild ancestors are cliff-dwelling rock doves – have an interesting repertoire of behaviours that people often overlook, says Packham, who describes them as a “delight” to watch.Males court females by puffing up their breast, putting their head down, fanning their tail and following them around in circles. “All natural behaviours for rock doves but you don’t need a telescope or binoculars because it is quite literally happening under your feet. For students of bird behaviour, or people just getting into it, this is the time to take advantage of that,” he says.The problem is people don’t like successful animals, says Packham. “It doesn’t matter if it’s a rat, a cockroach or a pigeon. They live alongside us and they prosper and rather than celebrate it, we get resentful and think there are too many of them.” For anyone not convinced by the merits of pigeons, they are the main part of the urban peregrine falcon diet, which the BBC presenter describes as “unquestionably one of the sexiest organisms on the planet”, so that’s another reason to be grateful for them.There is a lot more to urban birdwatching than pigeons, says David Lindo, also known as the Urban Birder, who has spotted ring ouzels, swifts, bramblings and hobbies in London in the past 12 months. “London has an amazing ersity of birds. Even in the middle of a real concrete jungle area you can still see things – it’s a challenge,” says Lindo, who first got into urban birding because he had no one to take him out to the countryside.Lindo is currently self-isolating in the Spanish city of Mérida in Extremadura. From his sun terrace he can spot 20 species in an hour, including six types of bird of prey. “It’s just great to see short-tailed eagles gliding across, or to look up and see a massive black vulture – I love it,” he says.As well as looking up, people must look down, says London-based botanist Dr Mark Spencer, who believes people should get on their hands and knees to look at unglamorous plants (he doesn’t like the term “weed”) peeping through cracks in the ground.To get a better view of modest plants sprouting around the home, Spencer encourages people to buy a x10 magnifying hand lens, which costs about £5. They make small, innocuous-looking plants look much more interesting. “It opens up a new and incredibly beautiful world. Things like hairs on leaves become quite extraordinary, and people don’t notice these things. A hand lens is a great way of shifting your perception of what’s in front of you,” he says.In spring, the natural world is perhaps at its most beguiling during the hours of darkness, when billions of birds are migrating into the northern hemisphere. Because people aren’t able to spend their evenings in the pub or the cinema, more than ever are sitting outside listening to this natural phenomenon.The great bird migration began with common scoter ducks flying over the UK in early April. According to the Bird Guides website, the number of reports received on the night of 1 April was unlike anything seen before in UK birding history.“At least 60 sites, the vast majority in Lancashire, Yorkshire and Northumberland, logged the species, with some localities reporting that multiple flocks were passing over on a near-constant basis for extended periods of time during the night,” the website reads.So many people reported hearing the birds, researchers could track the exact route of the migration as it made its way across the country. Using this data, Alexander Lees, a senior lecturer in conservation biology at Manchester politan University, is looking to write a paper charting migration corridors. “We’ve been able to map the overland migration route of these birds for the first time ever essentially – it’s been incredible,” he says.Citizen science is research performed by non-scientists, usually members of the public. It has led to numerous discoveries, from new planets and animal species to insights on coral reef restoration and butterfly populations. Nasa, the Natural History Museum and even the US government are among the many organisations that ask members of the public, including children, to help collect data, interpret results and solve research problems for scientific projects.Citizen science plays a vital role in monitoring plant and animal populations around the world, often through mobile phone applications. iNaturalist, a joint initiative between the California Academy of Sciences and the National Geographic Society, allows users to photograph and identify plant species around the world, informing scientific research. Nearly 35m observations of 269,859 species have been uploaded to the platform in towns, cities and rural areas from every continent.Yes. Whether you are documenting the organisms you see during your daily hour of exercise or just recording what you see from your window, the bioersity you document will further scientific research. While stuck at home, you could even help scientists\u0026nbspcount penguins in Antarctica, monitor\u0026nbspglobal seal populations\u0026nbspor\u0026nbsprecord large mammal sightings\u0026nbspin Gabon.Zooniverse\u0026nbsplists several projects you can help with that are not just limited to bioersity.\u0026nbspThe Wildlife Trusts\u0026nbspis asking for volunteers on citizen science projects.\u0026nbspiNaturalist, eBird and Tree ID are among the hundreds of citizen science phone applications for bioersity available.\u0026nbspOther birds such as quail, terns, sand martins, chiffchaffs, swallows, warblers and cuckoos, are among those doing the spring migration. Most migrate at night to avoid predators, and in the cooler air they use less energy. “If these birds arrived during daylight hours people would be just aghast at what’s happened. A sky full of birds,” says Lees.As well as birds, moths are also most active at night and there is no need for a moth trap to see them. Leaving a light on in a room and opening a window (close the door so they don’t fly into the rest of the house) or leaving the porch light on should attract them. Moths such as the large yellow underwing, silver Y moth and hummingbird hawk moth are widespread, visible in urban as well as rural areas.There are 2,500 species of moth in the UK. July and August are peak times but they will already be out in spring. “When the weather is warm in summer, you can bring in hundreds of moths … It’s a good idea to start at this time of year and ease yourself into it. It’s a bit scary when you get 200 moths in a trap at once,” says Dr Emma Coulthard, a lecturer in ecology at Manchester politan University, who encourages the public to log their findings via the Garden Moth Scheme.As the lockdown in the UK continues, nature-watching in its cities and the countryside should only get better. Despite the catastrophic impacts of coronavirus, the great British garden, whether a tiny inner-city space or sprawling rural plot, could be at its best for years.“All those gardeners, those green-fingered folk, will have time on their hands,” says Packham. “I imagine our gardens will blossom, they will probably be at their best by the end of this summer, because people will have time and they’ll be out there tending to stuff.”Sam Hobson is an award-winning wildlife and conservation photographer based in Bristol and best known for his work with urban wildlife. He shares his top tips for capturing great wildlife pictures.For those of us with time on our hands during lockdown, the enforced slowing down is a real opportunity to reconnect with nature and discover the wildlife on our doorsteps. Often, we’re too busy to stop and notice, but when we slow down, we can tune in to nature and start to notice what’s been there right under our noses all along.Even if we have no space but a window ledge, growing plants, watering and nurturing them and watching as they flower and start to attract insects can lift the spirits, while bringing peace and tranquillity to your space – and of course it’s the perfect opportunity to develop your wildlife photography skills and take some great pictures.1. Enjoy it!The best wildlife photographers are people who do it for the pure joy of it – not to win awards or for social media likes. Doing something purely for yourself and not being motivated by the approval of others can be so much more enjoyable! It doesn’t matter what camera kit you’ve got or how rubbish your pictures are if they are just for you.2. Become a wildlife photojournalistDocumenting a story is a great way to bring a narrative to your pictures. You could try to photograph and identify every insect you find in your garden, or simply document the growth of the plants and flowers. Looking back at a set of pictures taken over weeks is a great way to appreciate how quickly things change at this time of year. Perhaps make a lockdown diary or go on a back garden bug safari with your children and start a garden wildlife lockdown list.3. Start a species projectFocusing on a particular species is a great way to create an exciting gallery of images. Really paying attention to just one species is the best way to learn about its habits and behaviour, and develop your wildlife photography skills. Every time you take a picture of a subject, you automatically look for new ways to do it: a new angle, better lighting or perhaps an action shot.4. Champion the underdogFollowing on from the previous tip, don’t get hung up on trophy-hunting the sexy species! The less glamorous the animal, often the better the photographic opportunities – likely the ones ignored by other photographers. You don’t need to travel across the world to photograph elusive wildlife – I have won awards with pictures of local pigeons, gulls and foxes. Even if you can only find slugs in your garden, you can still get creative!5. Let it come to youOpportunistic pictures are the most difficult to take getting the camera out in a rush and trying to get a good picture before something disappears can be frustrating – and can make us miss an exciting wildlife encounter entirely. My best pictures come from observation and planning. For example, if you know that bees keep returning to a particular flower, or birds are regularly coming to a feeder, you can lie in wait and be ready with your camera when the next one returns. Wildlife is particularly bold at the moment as there are fewer people on the streets and the reduced noise means animals can better listen out for danger. You might be able to attract something not usually found in your area like a hedgehog or fox by leaving out some treats in your garden (it’s easy to research online what is responsible and appropriate if you’re planning to feed something).Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow bioersity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3a39321d75f435522b0006f3898e7bf2a8125f49/0_373_3961_2377/master/3961.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2a0a1e0d25b16326bae7afb3402a6cc1","title":"wildlife through the window what readers have spotted during lockdown aoe","story":"From frogs to baboons,  readers from around the world have sent us their best shots of urban wildlife taken from their homesby  Phoebe Weston and   readersWe asked  readers living in cities and towns across the world to share their images of the wildlife they can see from their homes. You answered in your droves, from Canada to Cardiff, and here are some of the best.I’ve set up my desk against the bedroom window with a nice view into the back garden. I’ve been aware of foxes around before, thanks to the noise they make at night, but never expected to see them in broad daylight, which I have done several times now. More unexpected, however, was the lunchtime visit from a muntjac deer which I’m glad to have clear evidence of, as I might have taken it as a sign of cabin fever. I had no idea they were even about in the middle of Birmingham.Overall, I have seen about 12 species of butterflies in my small, but sunny Leeds front garden, and this year I hope to see more. Last week a comma butterfly, fresh from hibernation, guarded my house for three sunny days. I also found a comatose bee on my doorstep. Transferred to a dandelion, it took 15 minutes to refuel and be on its way. I forget Covid-19 altogether when looking at insects and other natural things.This chipmunk has made a burrow or den beneath the living room window and visits every day to collect peanuts that we put out for it on the porch. If we are late putting peanuts out, heshe often sits on top of the barbecue and looks in through the kitchen window to see if anyone is there. The picture was not taken from a window but from the open kitchen doorway. I had to lie on my stomach to get the ground level shot. We are slowly getting “Chippy” to come closer to us and hopefully heshe will come and take peanuts from our hand at some point.I was in my kitchen, which overlooks a large sycamore tree in the yard, when I saw two Eurasian blue tits feeding on its seeds. I grabbed my camera and one of them just stared at me, intrigued by the sound of the shutter. Other trees are already in foliage but this one is a late bloomer for some reason, which is lucky because the leaves would have otherwise hidden the beauty of the moment.Bavaria was the first German state to implement lockdown measures. Seeing nature awakening provides some consolation. From my balcony I can see a plum tree which was in full bloom a few weeks ago and attracts different types of birds (blackbirds, nuthatches, blue tits, robins and a woodpecker), as well as red and black European squirrels. One of these squirrels has gotten quite bold lately and started coming to my balcony when I put out some nuts for him (or her?). I will soon celebrate my 28th birthday under lockdown and his visits keep me company and brighten my day.My wife and I live in the very heart of Cardiff. Across the road from us, on the banks of the Taff, resides a flock of pigeons, some ducks, four geese and a bevy of mute swans. Some of these swans seem to think that the grass is greener on our side of the road, and so like to take full advantage of the new pelican crossing which has been thoughtfully provided by Cardiff council. No pelicans have been sighted thus far, but we live in hope.A brown tree frog showed up one day to sleep in our tillandsia (Spanish moss) and has since returned several days a week to nap in the same spot for the entire day before leaving in the evening to do what tree frogs do. It was incredible the first time I noticed it hanging there, sleeping, its eyes slightly opening when it sensed my presence. During periods when it doesn’t show up for several days I actually find myself missing it. The garden of our home is quite small, but in the two years we’ve been here I’ve managed to turn it into something of a microcosmic jungle here in our neighbourhood of Ekkamai in Bangkok.Upon searching for the cause of a dull thump against one of our windows we discovered this sparrow hawk, just three yards from our window on our terrace. It was in the process of trying to kill its prey – a pigeon nearly its own size. After considerable struggle, the pigeon managed to escape behind a big stone. The hawk – pigeon feathers dangling at his claws – hung around for a while but then decided she had lost and went off. For the rest of the day the pigeon remained in hiding behind its stone. The next morning it was gone.I’m widowed, retired, ninety years old, and spend my time reading, writing, talking and looking at the , waiting for the crisis to end. I live on the second floor of a seven-storied apartment building in Vancouver’s West End – the most densely populated neighbourhood in Canada, they say. I saw an Anna’s hummingbird hovering outside my bedroom window and then fly to its nest sitting on the upper hinge of the window. Two chicks hatched, but one disappeared, pushed out of the nest, perhaps? I saw the other fed from time to time by the adult and it survived to fly off two days ago leaving the perfectly-formed 4cm nest as a memento.Despite living in a residential street close to town, our garden backs onto fields which are normally used to produce hay. Since last year’s harvest the farmer has left the fields alone and they have quickly become a haven for wildlife, with foxes, roe deer, buzzards, a kestrel and barn owls making appearances. The latter have become regular visitors. Watching the skill with which they hunt is a real privilege, aided by the fact that they seem very happy to fly in broad daylight. We do sometimes feel like frauds when watching wildlife diaries at the end of David Attenborough, as they explain the trials and tribulations of capturing footage. We sit down with a cup of tea until the owl appears and then I change out of my dressing gown, nip down to the back fence and get some photos while it spends up to an hour hunting.I’m a 42-year-old art teacher and I’m taking time out from full time teaching to rediscover my own art practice. I’m currently printmaking my local landscapes. Every morning I get up and spend hours at my window watching local wildlife. It’s very therapeutic and calming. I see lots of different birds including a majestic pair of red kites that fly over every day. Cats prowl along roof tops along with skittish squirrels that run along the fences. I also perch myself up on my windowsill listening to the bird song … there is nothing quite like it. Always brings a smile to my face especially the chirping of a robin.I was on my way to the supermarket and spotted a flock of herons sitting outside the entrance to a local shopping centre. Never seen them there before! Felt like a scene from I Am Legend. They didn’t move an inch when I walked past them but they were gone when I left the supermarket. They come from a park about half a mile away and my guess is that they went exploring because the streets and park were eerily empty. Or maybe even in search of food if they’re used to being fed by people going for a walk in the park?I have been working from home for the past three weeks, and during this time, I have consistently noticed wildlife slowly lurking into our inner realms. This lizardchameleon was one that popped its head and part of the body in a manner that reminded me of a scene from the film Jurassic Park. The silence and controlled movements of human beings must have strengthened nature’s courage to reclaim their lost space.We live in a modern detached house with an average size garden. We dug up the lawn and ditched the flower beds about 10 years ago and planted UK native species, such as a field maple, whitebeam and rowan. The garden attracts many birds throughout the year. We have a small flock of sparrows which live in the hedge during the day. Goldfinches and starling visit in large numbers to feed at the bird feeders. We have a pair of dunnock, two robins and at least one wren. The wren is usually in the hedge away from the house but it conveniently paraded across the patio and over the boulders around the upper pond – hence the close up photographs. I do not think the lack of traffic during lockdown has encouraged more birds into the garden – however, I do have more time to sit and observe them.We have recently been noticing “extra-largish” cat tracks crossing through our inner city property in Calgary (Alberta, Canada). And the other evening, we were thrilled to finally spot this magnificent bobcat strolling through our back alpine rock garden. By far, this was our most impressive “live” wildlife encounter here at home and we were grateful to have enjoyed the view from our dining room window.David and Stephanie Ferguson, Calgary, Canada This picture shows a female chacma baboon. On the day I was taking a lockdown sanity nap when she appeared. She poops in front of the window – perhaps to mark her territory. This window was a point of entry once. Not sure if it was the same baboon, but she scored a bottle of almonds and some bananas on that day. Baboons come here every day. One of our neighbours blows a vuvuzela to warn us to close windows and doors."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/17b590e5d628184973e22d56181d68c5b56104e8/0_87_1125_675/master/1125.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=be621f845f927c7208dbf49e56ff5a83","title":"fashion statements in a pandemic are you ready for the it mask","story":"A precaution against spreading infection and a signifier of being a good citizen, the face mask may yet give new meaning to a ‘must-have’ accessoryOne particle of Covid-19 typically measures 100 nanometers in diameter. That is a ten-thousandth of a millimetre invisible, in other words. But the virus has transformed how the world looks: the empty streets, the trail-free blue skies, the rainbow-decked windows – and the clothes we wear. Clothes – not fashion, but clothes – have been on newspaper front pages for weeks. The public health and political crisis around PPE has filled our screens with arresting images of NHS workers in robes and visors. This is a human drama on an enormous scale, and in our highly visual culture, it calls for an image more vivid and more emotionally resonant more than any line graph. Masks are, suddenly, all around us. Our lockdown wardrobes, a sartorial journal of emotions – first the run on tracksuits, then the pivot to video-call power dressing – is shifting into a new gear. With every passing day, my Instagram feed features fewer sweatshirts and more masks. As the world begins looking ahead to a post-lockdown world, face masks look set to play an increasingly central role in our lives.Fashion has always been about both fitting in and standing out. Mask wearing can be a way of pledging allegiance to good citizenship – like wearing a poppy in the first week of November, or a T-shirt in support of the NHS – and an opportunity for self-expression. There are sleek high-tech masks and there are sweetly homespun ones there are designer logo masks and sloganned high-street ones. Jeans, running shoes, even sunglasses: many of fashion’s hero products have utilitarian roots. Although where mandated by law as it already is in some regions, the mask will bring new meaning to the phrase “must-have”. The New York-based fashion brand Collina Strada is selling brightly coloured masks fastened with ribbon-trailing bows, made from deadstock fabric from past collections. The masks, which have an opening to insert a filter, retail for $100 for every one sold, the brand donate five to healthcare workers. A note on the website adds: “If you or a loved one is sick and this is out of your price range, please reach out to us directly we have other masks available to send to you at no charge.”Fashion can be tone deaf at moments such as this. Boohoo was quick to market with jaunty £5 fabric masks, with the slogans “Eat, sleep, isolate, repeat” or “If you can read this, you’re too close”, but withdrew them swiftly after a backlash. But many designers want to put their skillset to good use, rather than plunder panic for profits. The independent London fashion week designer Christopher Kane offered on Instagram to post unused fabric and a simple mask-making pattern to anyone who asked. Having now fulfilled thousands of requests, the studio has used up all its fabric, but has made the pattern available to download, so that you can make a mask at home with any cotton fabric, and ribbon.Edeline Lee, another young London fashion week talent, whose dresses are worn by Olivia Colman and Taylor Swift, has launched a nonprofit mask project selling packs of three masks for £24. Instead of cotton, Lee’s masks are made from nonwoven spunbound polyproylene, the fluid-resistant, breathable fabric used to make surgical masks. Each purchase covers the cost of a further 80 masks sent to frontline workers who, Lee says, can wear them over their officially issued respirators to make them last longer. On the Edeline Lee Instagram feed, the masks can be seen in elegant black and white, shot by a husband-and-wife team of photographer and model and styled over Zoom. A fashion statement and a statement of solidarity are not, it seems, mutually exclusive.

Until then, here are Tucci’s top turnsStanley Tucci plays Maestro Cadenza in this recent version of Beauty and the Beast, a florid and neurotic musical star who, at the beginning of the film, is transformed into a harpsichord, while his wife, played by Audra McDonald, is mortifyingly turned into a wardrobe. A cartoony cameo-sketch playing on Tucci’s gift for uptight, a-ish roles.A classic, and perhaps rather basic supporting character turn for Tucci, the sort of unpromising role that he invests with authority. In Sam Mendes’s 30s mob drama, he plays Frank Nitti, the Chicago wiseguy who has to reject an overture from Mafia footsoldier Mike Sullivan, played by Tom Hanks. A solid, but unremarkable Tucci turn.A very rare example of Tucci getting an alpha-romantic lead role, in which his iconic baldness signifies old-school virility. He plays the philandering photographer who has donated sperm to a fertility lab, and then finds himself being (illegally) tracked down by the woman (Lisa Eichhorn) who has got pregnant by his seed and now wants to have a real relationship with the father of her child – to his bemused dismay.Here is Tucci in pure comic cynical-bad-guy role, the sort of thing that has been his bread and butter during his career, although he can do so much more. He plays the ruthless campaign manager of a US presidential candidate, played by Kelsey Grammer, who is horrified to learn that the poll is so close that it hinges on just one guy: an amiably clueless good ol’ boy, played by Kevin Costner, who isn’t sure how he’s going to vote. And so Costner’s innocence comes up against Tucci’s reptilian corruption. Some nice lines for Stanley.Tucci roles ide into wig and non-wig and this, with Alan Rickman directing, is very much the first category. He is Philippe, Duc d’Orléans, the roguish brother of Louis XIV (played by Rickman himself), who wears a long flowing tonsorial creation under a similarly lavish hat. He also has a playful quasi-Brit accent to emphasise how louche and racy he is supposed to be, exchanging waspish badinage with everyone at court.There have been some jaw-dropping wig roles for Tucci in his career, and this has to be the most outrageous, which also foregrounds his gift for the menacing and sinister. In The Hunger Games, he plays Caesar Flickerman, the smoothie blue-haired TV celebrity whose job is to interview the gladiatorial contestants (such as Jennifer Lawrence’s Katniss Everdeen) before they go out to face certain death. His creepy blue wig is complemented by fake teeth.Nora Ephron’s film is the second (and less successful) pairing of Tucci with Meryl Streep. Here he plays Paul Child, a smart, discreet and very masculine character who is a US diplomat in Paris in the 1950s, married to the eccentric and forceful Julia Child, played, of course, by Streep. He is gently tolerant and affectionate about her search for a real pastime. When she becomes a star of cooking, he must take a back seat that’s even further back. Tucci handles this supporting role with gallantry and aplomb.George A Romeo’s horror classic gives Tucci a juicy but small villainous role. He plays Dr John Wiseman, the obnoxious, incompetent and philandering surgeon whose mistakes cause a law student to become paralysed. And when this man gets a trained monkey to help him with his daily tasks, he finds that this monkey can carry out acts of revenge, which is bad news for Dr Wiseman.So many actors find that superhero roles are a career must, and perhaps Tucci will one day play a great supervillain. However, he had another potent supporting role in this MCU adventure, laying out the origin of Steve Rogers’s Captain America. He is Dr Abraham Erskine, a mysterious German scientist at a military recruiting station – and a refugee from the Nazis – who spots Steve and sees the potential in him.Here is another of the louche, sexually calculating and slightly smug roles that Tucci knows so well how to play, bringing something unexpectedly sympathetic to the table – and it’s one of his rare lead roles. Tucci is the creative writing professor and failed novelist who is appallingly and humiliatingly attracted to a student, who submits to him – and there, incidentally, is the title pun – the first chapter of a novel she is writing. The chaotic sex scene is rich in disaster for this conceited middle-aged male.Perhaps it was always Tucci’s destiny to play the quasi-Woody Allen character in a Woody Allen film, but he does it without an out-and-out impersonation, probably because Allen himself is in the picture. Tucci plays the writer Paul Epstein, who is, in fact, a character who has sprung from the mind of writer Harry Block (played by Allen) and clearly a cipher for Harry. Tucci has some nice scenes opposite Demi Moore, who plays his former therapist, now wife, who becomes an increasingly devout in her Judaism – although, again, Tucci is a little upstaged.Here is another type of role that Tucci was born to play – the tough, overworked, slightly eccentric lawyer who takes on pro bono work to fight for the underdog his hairpiece here has something frizzy, wiry and greying. Tucci plays the real-life attorney Mitchell Garabedian, who represented people who were abused as children by Catholic priests in Boston but then found powerful vested interests associated with the church were closing ranks against him. The press, in the form of Mark Ruffalo, ride to his assistance.Tucci and Emma Thompson is a smart pairing, so much so that it is a surprise that they haven’t worked together more often. Here, he plays Jack, an academic, who is discontented with his marriage to Fiona, a workaholic high court judge, played by Thompson. Depressed by the declining intimacy in their marriage, but declaring his intention to be honest, he tells her he is thinking of having an affair – if that’s all right with her. It’s a strange, complex role: sympathetic in a way, but asking your wife’s permission for an affair is curious. Tucci carries the contradictions well.Here is the kind of seductive, persuasive, humorous supporting performance that is a keynote of Tucci’s career. In this comedy inspired by Nathaniel Hawthorne’s novel The Scarlet Letter, Tucci plays Dill, the liberal, understanding father of a high-school student, Olive (played by Emma Stone), and married to Rosemary (played by Patricia Clarkson). As the parents, the two have a lovely chemistry. It is when Olive becomes the centre of gossip at her school that her parents (chiefly her mum) have to take an interest. Tucci and Clarkson have great family scenes in the kitchen and it’s entirely plausible that smart, funny Tucci is Emma Stone’s dadThis JC Chandor drama about the 2008 financial crash features Tucci as Eric Dale, the head of risk analysis at an investment bank who is laid off at the very beginning of the film. The humiliation of a proud, difficult man is well conveyed by Tucci. But his character is in possession of a terrible secret that had been revealed by the research he had been doing: the bank is horribly overextended in its investment positions and could collapse at any moment. Eric is now caught between still wanting to warn people inside the firm, and being quite content to let the whole thing go.Tucci fans are crying out for the great man to be given a big Shakespearian role on screen: something like Claudius in Hamlet or maybe Brutus or Coriolanus from the Roman plays. Puck in A Midsummer Night’s Dream is a nice role for Tucci nevertheless. At the time, I thought Michael Hofmann’s version of the play, starring Michelle Pfeiffer and Rupert Everett as Titania and Oberon with Kevin Kline as Bottom, was a bit chocolate boxy, but it has a charm that I perhaps overlooked. Puck is a relatively innocuous figure in the film, and Tucci plays him as something like a Martian, but with tiny horns. Of course, Tucci has always been a Puckish figure in films generally, someone with a propensity for mischief.Here is one of the outrageous Tucci comedy extravaganzas, one of the few films that really taps into his gift for broad humour, his physicality, and indeed makes a comic point about his legendary baldness. Tucci plays Link, the office colleague and pal of Bobby, played by Richard Gere. When Bobby signs up for ballroom dance lessons because he is in love with a woman there (Jennifer Lopez), he discovers to his astonishment that Link is a secret ballroom enthusiast and there is an amazing dance-contest scene in which Link throws away an absurd wig and, reinvigorated by his public baldness, dances a spectacular cha-cha-cha and pasodoble. The scene is cleverly shot to flatter Tucci’s dancing skills and his lean frame looks good in his figure-hugging catsuit with flame motif.Throughout his film career, Tucci has kept really villainous typecasting at a careful arm’s length, although on TV he notably played the creepy and possibly murderous philanthropist Richard Cross in Steven Bochco’s pioneering long-form TV drama Murder One and got a Golden Globe for playing the Nazi war criminal Adolf Eichmann in the TV movie Conspiracy. In Peter Jackson’s movie version of Alice Sebold’s novel The Lovely Bones he plays a serial killer – the murderer responsible for the death of Saoirse Ronan’s character, with whom he has an excruciating, all-but-unwatchable scene as he lures the innocent young girl into his lair. This is the performance that got Tucci his Academy Award nomination and perhaps it is precisely because Tucci always manages to get humanity and charm into his “bad guy” performances that he is a good fit with this role. His murderer is not just a cartoon sweaty creep but someone who could, however briefly and unconvincingly, convey something sufficiently amiable or avuncular to get away with his monstrous murders.For many, this will always be the classic Tucci performance: at the age of 46, he nailed a glorious comic role that won the hearts of audiences young and old, male and female. He plays Nigel Kipling, the fastidious, quick-tempered, but warm-hearted art director who works at the super-prestigious Manhattan fashion bible Runway, effectively a lieutenant to Runway’s terrifying editor Miranda Priestly, played by Meryl Streep. (The story was based on Anna Wintour at Vogue.) It is Nigel who has to explain the workings of the magazine to the wide-eyed newbie played by Anne Hathaway, and he appears to be the only person who is not totally terrified of Miranda. With marvellous brio and technique, Tucci shows us who Nigel is – the smalltown boy who idolised fashion at a young age and, for all his airy sophistication, is still thrilled, every day, to be working at Runway. But he is also the vulnerable, lonely man who is deeply hurt when Miranda appears to be grooming him for a top job only to take it away from him at the last moment for her own machiavellian reasons. A Tuccissimo film.The whole online world is thrilling to Stanley Tucci’s lockdown videos showing how to make perfect cocktails – but he has always had a certain theatrical savoir faire around a kitchen. And this foodie film has to be his magnum opus, the passion project he co-wrote and also co-directed with Campbell Scott, a longtime friend and colleague. Tucci himself starred with Tony Shalhoub (another close friend) playing two Italian immigrant brothers, called respectively Secondo and Primo, in New Jersey in the 1950s, who jointly run a restaurant called Paradise. Primo is the head chef and Secondo is the manager, and it is Secondo’s unhappy responsibility to deal with the clientele who are a little baffled and intimidated by Primo’s fiercely purist attitude to the authentic Italian dishes he is serving. Secondo figures they should be serving safer and more Americanised dishes as their competition do, and when a rival restaurateur kindly offers to set up a special promotional “big night” at Paradise featuring a visiting celebrity singer, Secondo jumps at the chance, little guessing that this man might have his own ulterior motive. It’s a big, generous, passionate role for Tucci, who sparks off Shalhoub well. He has a part hairpiece, indicating receding rather than a vanishing hairline, and we are allowed to see Tucci as a younger man: more idealistic, more vulnerable and even more boyish."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e16909014ff126f1eb2060ed99cf9a0c0f6ab45a/454_457_2331_1399/master/2331.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=24439315ba15585b026a13b31fe3211a","title":"which is the best alien movie","story":"The series has delivered a horror masterwork, a seminal shoot-em-up and some auteurist gems ... but how do they rank?What better way to celebrate the recent Alien Day than to place the eight movies in the long-running space saga into some kind of order of excellence? And also perhaps to ask how so many film-makers have managed to muck up the original film’s formula.Let’s start at the bottom. The two Alien vs Predator movies from 2004 and 2007 are now remembered largely for their staggering blandness, as if everybody involved had forgotten what made the early films so chilling. Ostensibly B-movies, but lacking the joyful, half-cocked knockabout bombast of a Roger Corman or Ray Kellogg film, they even disappointed fans of the crossover comic books that spawned them. If 20th Century Fox thought it was getting the new Ridley Scott when the studio hired Paul WS Anderson to direct ’s Alien vs Predator they were sadly mistaken. Bringing the xenomorphs to Earth, as Fox had intended to do in 1992 prior to David Fincher’s Alien 3, turned out to be the dumbest move since John Hurt decided to take a closer peek at the funny egg thing on LV-426. Even a smart moment of stunt-casting – Aliens’ Lance Henriksen as Charles Bishop Weyland – couldn’t paper over the cracks of this weirdly bloodless film. Aliens vs Predator: Requiem upped the gore but dropped quality levels even further, with untried music video directors Colin and Greg Strause at the helm. That the saga survived at all after this twin descent into movie purgatory is remarkable in itself.Next worst, because their collective failure made a mockery of attempts to revive the space saga, are 2012’s Prometheus and 2017’s Alien: Covenant. When Scott was persuaded to make his first science-fiction film in the best part of three decades, hopes were high that we might see a return to the pared-back slasher-in-space majesty of his 1979 film. But where Alien was a claustrophobic, searingly linear story of blue-collar workers coming into contact with the ultimate cosmic horror – a movie in which nobody knew what the hell was going on – Prometheus was a sprawlingly portentous slice of backstory that promised to tell us absolutely everything. Then failed to do it. Its only real triumph was Michael Fassbender’s cold-eyed android David, whom Scott decided to bring back for the sequel. In the end, nobody actually wanted to know how the xenomorphs were originally spawned, because the most fascinating thing about these acid-blooded monstrosities is their devilish inscrutability.I’m placing Jean-Pierre Jeunet’s Alien Resurrection (1997) next. It’s a flawed movie in terms of its inception (would a clone Ripley retain the personality and memories of her “parent”?) but Sigourney Weaver delivers an eye-poppingly nutty performance as the part-human, part xenomorph Ripley 8, and there are some enjoyably sickly moments to compete with anything in the previous three movies. The scene when Ripley meets earlier failed versions of herself that have been pickled for posterity, and Brad Dourif’s fondness for the murderous extra-terrestrials, even as he is about to become a vehicle for their reproduction process, particularly stick in the memory.Alien 3 (1993) is next on my list. David Fincher’s battles with Fox over the final cut are well documented, as is the flawed decision to kill off poor Newt after she did so well to survive the horrors of the previous episode. But the movie boasts an impeccable supporting cast of British character actors who all enjoy themselves immeasurably, and the decision to retain the earlier films’ use of a pinched and airless setting within which the xenomorphs can wreak their mindless violence turns out to be a splendid one. Weaver, as ever, is excellent throughout.And now we come to the big decision: whether to plump for the original Alien, which shattered the horror paradigm forever, or its 1986 sequel Aliens, which launched James Cameron towards Hollywood megastardom and stands as one of the greatest action movies of all time. I’m going to plump for the latter in first place, if only because the advanced special effects of the 1980s made Giger’s slimy xenomorphs so much more scary and realistic. There are few moments in Hollywood history more iconic than Ripley’s final exo-suited battle with the alien queen, a scene so gratifyingly violent that the film-maker couldn’t resist plagiarising himself in Avatar.

Here’s how to make some quick, surprising and simple mealsIn this time of struggle and strife, the tin has come into its own. It is a humble creature not often at the forefront of anyone’s mind, but in reality the tin (and its jar, packet and pouch cousins) are often the backbone of what we cook and eat. The store cupboard provides a springboard from which you can be creative and spontaneous.Tinned foods are delicious, nutritious and inexpensive (not to mention extremely long-lasting). Their existence is a blessing that means you can eat juicy figs and de-choked artichokes all year-round, guilt and air-mile free.The following 10 tins are just a drop in the ocean of options. There has never been a better opportunity to try things that perhaps you have previously turned your nose up at or neglected at the back of your crammed cupboard. Heat a splash of olive oil in a large frying pan. Once warm, add one chopped garlic clove and fry until starting to colour. Add a pinch of chilli flakes and paprika and cook for a further 30 seconds. Tip in a 400g tin of tomatoes, 2 tsp Worcestershire sauce, 1 tsp brown sugar, 2 tsp cider (or similar) vinegar and a drained 400g tin of cannellini beans. Season, then simmer over a medium-high heat for 15-20 minutes. Serve piled high on toast topped with a crispy fried egg or a blanket of cheddar.Mix together a drained 400g tin of green lentils, 70g plain flour, one egg, 3 tbsp chopped chives (or another soft herb), 1 tsp caraway seeds, 1½ tsp paprika, a finely chopped garlic clove and 200g coarsely grated beetroot (or carrot or parsnip). Season. Warm 1 tbsp oil in a large frying pan. For each fritter, dollop into the pan a heaped tbsp of the mixture, flatten slightly and fry for about four minutes on each side until golden. Meanwhile, mix 1 tsp harissa into 2 tbsp yogurt. Serve the fritters with a generous spoonful of harissa yogurt.In a large saucepan, heat 2 tbsp olive oil over a low heat. Sweat 2 finely chopped onions gently, with a pinch of salt until very soft (30 to 40 minutes). Add two sliced garlic cloves, two bay leaves, 1½ tsp dried mint and 1 tsp turmeric cook for a few minutes until the garlic has softened. Tip in drained 400g tins of butterbeans, lentils and chickpeas along with 500ml vegetable stock. Bring to the boil, then turn down and cook for 20-25 minutes. Add 200g of spinach and allow to wilt. Season and ladle into bowls, drizzling over a little more olive oil.Heat 1 tbsp olive oil in a large frying pan. Add one finely chopped onion and cook gently for 10 minutes. Add two finely chopped garlic cloves, one bay leaf, 2 tsp smoky chilli flakes, a pinch of cinnamon, ½ tsp cumin and two carrots, cut into rounds, then cook for 2-3 minutes. Tip in two 400g tins of black beans (including the liquid) and 300ml of vegetable stock. Bring to a boil and simmer for 20-25 minutes until it has thickened. Season, pile into bowls and serve with rice, a dollop of soured cream and, if you have it, some fresh coriander.In a large frying pan, heat 2 tbsp olive oil, add two finely chopped onions and soften gently for 10-15 minutes. Meanwhile, in another frying pan, heat 4 tbsp oil, add two aubergines, cut into chunks, with a pinch of salt, fry on high for 5-10 minutes, stirring often, until the aubergine is golden. Remove from heat. The onions should now be soft add to them two finely chopped garlic cloves, ½ tsp fennel seeds, two bay leaves and a pinch of chilli flakes. Fry for 2-3 minutes, then add 200ml red wine. Bring to the boil and reduce by two-thirds. Finally, add two 400g drained tins of beluga (or similar) lentils, two 400g tins of tomatoes and the browned aubergine. Season, reduce the heat and simmer for 15-20 minutes. Serve this ragu with soft polenta, pasta or a hunk of bread.To make a quick chutney, put 50g fresh coriander, 20g mint, one garlic clove, the juice of half a lemon, 40g desiccated coconut and one roughly chopped chilli into a blender with 2-3 tbsp of water. Blitz until smooth, set aside and season. Roughly blitz a drained 198g tin of sweetcorn and add to a bowl add a non-blitzed, drained tin, two eggs, 100g self-raising flour, 2 tsp mild curry powder and one finely chopped red onion, then season.

Serve the cakes with the chutney and a lemon wedge.You will need three 125g tins of mackerel. Heat 2 tbsp of the oil from one of the tins in a saucepan over a high heat. Add 1 tsp mustard seeds. When they pop, add 1 tsp fenugreek seeds and three cardamom pods. Fry briefly, then reduce the heat and add one finely sliced onion plus a pinch of salt. Sweat for 10-15 minutes until soft. Add 1 tbsp grated ginger, five crushed garlic cloves, one chopped chilli (or equivalent) and 20 curry leaves fry for 1-2 minutes. Add two 400g tins of tomatoes and season. Simmer for 15 minutes then add the mackerel, taking care to keep the pieces whole. Reduce the heat and warm the mackerel through. Just before serving, stir in 100ml of coconut milk.Heat the oven to 200C180C fan400Fgas mark 6. Melt 50g of butter with seven tinned anchovies in a frying pan over a low heat, add one finely chopped onion and three bay leaves cook gently for 20-25 minutes until the onion is soft. Meanwhile, boil 350g tube-shaped pasta in salted water until tender. Drain and rinse under cold water. Once the onion is soft, stir in 50g plain flour, cooking for two minutes. Add 650ml milk, a little at a time, stirring until combined before adding more. Cook, stirring, until the sauce has thickened a little. Remove from the heat and melt in 230g grated cheddar.

There are good reasons for this: it is tasty, easy to make and we are forever looking for things to do with those bananas that have gone past the “slice on porridge” stage. A quick glance at the ingredients list and you will notice that sweet potato and quinoa are not regulars on a typical banana bread recipe, but I think they should be. The sweet potato allows you to lower the fat and sugar content, while also bringing a healthy dose of vitamin A and fibre. Quinoa gives a chewy, gooey stodge to the crumb while providing a protein hit. For those doing intense home workouts, you can also substitute some of the flour for protein powder. To really pimp it up, I like to toast and then spread with peanut butter (although that is my answer for everything).2 bananas (1 needs to be large and very ripe)100g dark chocolate80g plain flour20g cocoa powder100g soft brown sugar2 tsp baking powderPinch of salt50g sweet potato30ml light olive oil (plus more for greasing)1 egg1 tsp vanilla150g cooked quinoaLine a 20cm loaf tin with foil, grease the inside and lay slices of one of the bananas on the base.Preheat oven to 170C (fan assisted).Roughly chop the dark chocolate into a large mixing bowl.Add the flour, cocoa powder, sugar, baking powder and salt, and mix all of these dry ingredients together.Finely grate the sweet potato and set aside.Blend the ripe banana, oil, egg, vanilla and quinoa until smooth, add to the sweet potato.Combine the wet and dry ingredients together, then pour over the sliced banana in the loaf tin.Bake for 40 minutes (or until a toothpick comes out clean).Turn upside down, gently remove the foil and then allow to cool."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4b44c55b1fb062754b8764221634edc24f2434c0/0_188_3541_2123/master/3541.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9b39b8607eabe079b58d38a902e0ca9f","title":"arsenal pablo mari football","story":"The defender on his journey to the Premier League, via Flamengo, and how it all stopped when he had just startedPablo Marí had arrived, or hoped he had. Fourteen years after leaving home, 11 since his professional debut and eight since his second – and last – top-flight match in Spain three months after the historic trophy that changed things and one after the move that might change everything, he wondered if his moment had come and knew that if it did he would grab it and not let go.Joining Arsenal was his fourth loan in as many seasons, his eighth club in seven years across four countries, three levels and two continents, including the team he never even met, and he had made 267 appearances, but something had started.And then it stopped.After all that, the coronavirus crisis halted everything. At the other end of a Zoom call in north London, bare white wall behind him, the Spaniard smiles. “At first, part of you thinks: ‘Jeez,’ I finally got here, then had to leave again after two days to finish negotiating the contract, came back, it was hard to get going, I hadn’t done pre-season while everyone had been competing seven months. Bit by bit you get through the days, the weeks, and the moment you say ‘I’m ready, I can compete’, this happens …”“The first thought was: ‘Damn, I wanted to keep playing.’ But this is no small thing it’s not a cold or flu. When you see its magnitude, professional questions are secondary. What matters is everyone’s health.”Pablo Marí saw that first hand. Signed on loan from Flamengo in late January, a difficult deal finally done, he sat in the stands when Arsenal were beaten by Olympiakos on 27 February. Four days later he made his debut against Portsmouth in the FA Cup. And five days after that came his first Premier League appearance, against West Ham. He was at a “disadvantage” – a new arrival, on loan, halfway through the season, joining one of Europe’s top five leagues for the first time since he was a teenager and making his first start at that level – but he impressed again. Two appearances, two victories, two clean sheets.He did not get a third. The game against Manchester City on 11 March was postponed after the Olympiakos and Nottingham Forest owner, Evangelos Marinakis, tested positive for Covid-19 and Arsenal’s players went into isolation. The next day Mikel Arteta tested positive, too. Seven weeks passed, the Spaniard on lockdown in a house with practically nothing in it before he returned to his club’s London Colney training ground on Monday.This was not how he planned it, but then nothing has been quite the way Pablo Marí planned it, lockdown another chapter in an unusual journey. His route to Arsenal, at 26, was not exactly direct. “I’ve been a professional 10 years and por gracia o desgracia, for better or worse, I’ve been round and round.”That’s one way of putting it. Pablo Marí joined Mallorca at 14, making his debut in Spain’s third tier with the B team aged 17, then twice played in Primera – two substitute appearances six months apart. There were three years at Gimnàstic de Tarragona but that was followed by single seasons at Girona, where he barely played NAC Breda in the Netherlands and Deportivo La Coruña, ending with playoff defeat.He didn’t belong to any of them. When he left Gimnàstic, in 2016, it was for Manchester City but the next day Pablo Marí was gone again, loaned to Girona. When he was finally sold, after two more loans, it was to Brazil of all places. “Well,” he says, “by then we’d changed cities four times in four years, so our mentality was different. A footballer’s life is short and we’d been waiting years for an opportunity. We didn’t care where and we knew the moment we got it, we were going to take it.”“That can feel a bit strange, but City were transparent. The plan was always to go on loan. They help you find teams but never oblige you and the last word always has to be yours. After two years, I said I wanted to return to Spain, go step by step awaiting a chance in Primera. Look, a player has to have one thing very clear: how much you’re prepared to lose to be a professional. You have to ask yourself that question and be honest. It will never, ever be all lovely. Or all awful. My objective was clear: whether it was City or not, I was going to get to a big club. I was absolutely convinced, ever since I left home at 13.”At 25, it still hadn’t happened and yet he insists: “I never thought of giving up. Never. I’ve had really bad moments, but you can’t ever leave something you love. Football might have thrown me out, but I was never going to throw it out.” Even if, after a decade, you’d been stuck in the third tier? “I’d still be playing. Absolutely for sure.”Then Pablo Marí smiles again. “And look how things happen.”Pretty well, just not the way he imagined it. The breakthrough came 5,200 miles from home. Flamengo, Brazil’s most popular club, offered City €1.3m. “My footballing curve I never thought this could happen. But over the years of work, injuries, without opportunities, I’ve learned that deep inside an attitude builds which says: ‘The moment someone gives me the chance, there’s no way I’m letting go.’ Flamengo gave me that. Any doubts went up in a cloud of smoke.”Almost overnight Pablo Marí went from the second ision to the Maracanã, a place where “80,000 people never stop singing, living their day like there’s nothing else in the world”. Right place, right time. “If I’d gone younger, it might have been different. It’s thanks to those years fighting, hard times, that those six months were so wonderful.”Pablo Marí’s first medals followed, the first Spaniard to win the Brazilian title and the Copa Libertadores, secured with two late goals. “Una barbaridad,” he calls it. “I still don’t have the words and don’t think I ever will. I’ll never forget it it’s etched on my heart.”Nor will one particular Flamengo fan watching from London. When it is suggested that he is David Luiz’s hero now, Pablo Marí laughs. “I don’t think I’m his idol, but we did talk about the final. He’s helped me loads: anything I needed, he was there. David is so intelligent, great in the dressing room, always joking but the first to pull on his overalls to work.“And we were very comfortable playing alongside each other, which is a good sign: a big club needs the centre-backs to connect.”The connection was swiftly broken by Covid-19. A foreigner in London for only six weeks and his house for two, Pablo Marí might have been tempted to head home but he stayed. From there, he talks about Arteta, “Close to the players but demanding too” about new teammates, players of “tremendous quality” and their duties to everyone at the club, including through pay cuts. “We’re discussing how to help, talking constantly. We have to support the club and the employees who work so hard for us. It’s important to contribute.”Pablo Marí does not know if the season will be salvaged and says mentally it is best not to think about that. What he does know is how he would like things to look beyond that. He doesn’t want to walk out of lockdown and out of another club, either. “England’s good for me: there’s a thousand things to improve, but I fit. I’m happy and I’d really like Arsenal to use the purchase option. With the coronavirus situation I don’t know what’s happening, it’s difficult, but I hope I can belong here.“My moment has arrived. The chance to sign for four years, an opportunity I think I’ve earned. It’s time. I like the idea of no longer going round and round. If I have to, I’ll keep going until my career ends, but I think I’ve found a club to put down roots. A traditional club that supports its people, people who believe in it and give everything. I’d like to be part of that, a great footballer for many years for Arsenal.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fea5e075179e9bf3d0a574989d48e1f3df8baa60/0_537_7957_4773/master/7957.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=12641aaae16e386f70f140ff88d95929","title":"this moment is leaving a mark on me framing rio under covid 19 shadow nicolo lanfranchi","story":"Nicoló Lanfranchi arrived in Brazil to make a film about traditional medicine and ended up charting a tragedy that acquired a deeply personal dimensionby  Dom Phillips in Rio de JaneiroPhotographing a funeral is never easy, no matter how professional the photographer, and even more so amid a pandemic. But for Nicoló Lanfranchi, capturing the burial of Covid-19 victim Elizabeth Baez, 82, which took place this month at the São João Batista cemetery in Rio de Janeiro, was especially difficult.As he photographed the gravediggers in protective clothing with Elizabeth’s son Henrique, 49, the only mourner allowed, watching on from behind a mask, Lanfranchi thought of his own father, Piero. At 72, Piero was in intensive care with Covid-19 in a hospital in Voghera, in Lombardy, northern Italy – one of the worst-affected places on Earth.“I imagined myself in the same situation, and I started facing this possibility and I was really touched,” he says. After the funeral, Lanfranchi told Baez about his father. Baez thanked him for capturing his mother’s lonely burial – and for sharing his own story.That Brazilians – a sociable, gregarious people - are so open to brief yet profound human interactions like this is just one of the many reasons Italian photographer and film-maker Lanfranchi has returned here every year for the past two decades. The other is to take pictures.“It is a huge life school for me. I have to be focused, it is dangerous, no one can help me and I feel responsibility to bring back images and the stories,” he says. “It cleans my mind.”Born in Milan and based in Berlin, Lanfranchi has worked as a freelance photographer in portrait, travel, news, and photojournalism. He prefers to spend time on assignments he once spent three weeks on board the Aquarius ship as it rescued refugees around the Mediterranean for a series of  dispatches.Coronavirus has been one of the toughest subjects to cover. “I’ve been worried about the virus,” he says. “My father was on my mind.”Lanfranchi first came to Brazil in 2000 because he practises the Afro-Brazilian art of capoeira and came to be “baptised” in an initiation. Originally developed by enslaved African people as a martial art disguised as a dance, capoeira is an example of how this vast, varied country absorbs cultures.“Other people call this a melting pot. It is more the syncretism, the capacity of an organic form to absorb different things,” says Lanfranchi.In 2012 he photographed wildcat miners in the jungle, in 2014 a soccer tournament in a prison in João Pessoa. In 2015 Brazil suffered the worst environmental catastrophe in its history when a tailings dam near Mariana collapsed, killing 19 people and sending millions of litres of mining waste sluicing down the River Doce to the sea.Lanfranchi worked with Greenpeace, Amnesty, Vanity Fair and eventually supplied dramatic images images for a  story that Davilson Brasileiro and I wrote about an investigation into the disaster’s causes by federal prosecutors.In January 2019, Lanfranchi and I had just left the Raposa Serra do Sol indigenous reserve in Brazil’s far north when another tailings dam collapsed, in Brumadinho in the same state of Minas Gerais, killing hundreds. At the disaster zone, Lanfranchi’s persistence, his ability to charm and cajole, and his skill at composing photographs in chaos rendered memorable images of the deadly, avoidable tragedy.He arrived in Rio on 3 March to make a short film about traditional medicine in Brazil’s semi-arid interior, but the pandemic shelved the project. Isolating in Rio’s beachside Ipanema neighbourhood, Lanfranchi discovered that the great composer Tom Jobim had written many of his bossa nova classics in an apartment in his building, including Chega de Saudade (Enough of Longing), most famously recorded by João Gilberto.That nostalgia infected Lanfranchi and he sought to take photos that captured time standing still and the fearful melancholy of a city where life was on hold.He bought N95 masks, found a driver who knew the city and began working out how to photograph the pandemic when so many situations – health centres and hospital wards – were inaccessible. He cleaned his equipment with alcohol gel, and changed and washed his clothes each time he got home.Using a drone worked for photographing empty beaches and an upscale members’ club for a story on how coronavirus spread among its privileged members. He also used it to capture families on their balconies.He put the drone down to capture food distribution in the City of God favela, street sanitation in nearby Niterói, and people ignoring social distancing advice across Rio.Some did this from sheer economic need, others didn’t take the pandemic seriously. The country’s far-right president, Jair Bolsonaro, dismissed coronavirus as “a little flu” and argued that protecting the economy was more important than social distancing even as confirmed coronavirus cases and deaths rose.Lanfranchi was dismayed to see Brazilian solidarity corroded by fake news and far-right populism. “I felt how sick the country is, people are supporting a president who openly does not care about the health of the population,” he says.This disconnect resonated as his father’s health worsened. Piero Lanfranchi had gone to hospital to get a plaster removed but caught Covid-19. Father and son communicated via text, until the time came for a plastic box to be put over Piero’s head to help him breathe and he sent a last message.Lanfranchi could not have seen his father even if had been able to get a flight back to Italy. Hospital visitors are not allowed, there are road blocks in Lombardy. On Saturday he got the news: despite the plastic box, his father had died.“He was alone, this is the worst thing, and something I wouldn’t wish on anybody,” says Lanfranchi, tears cracking his voice.Now the only thing he can think to do is plan a new assignment.“This is a historical moment, it is leaving a mark on me, and in a certain way I think about the other families affected with this, and I am with them,” he says. “I do not want to be beaten by the virus.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4c98c6ec02edf86c78a21525e05572c4636a0b0a/0_78_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=542a8396aec2d70ceb2a60dedf49de54","title":"our pandemic subconscious why we seem to be dreaming much more and often of insects","story":"Stress can affect the quality and length of sleep. Scientists have been collecting dream data during the coronavirus crisis, with surprising resultsMost of us don’t often remember our dreams, but the anxieties of life in isolation and disruption to our normal sleep-wake cycles seem to be changing that. Several researchers are collecting dream data during the pandemic, including Dr Deirdre Barrett, a clinical and evolutionary psychologist at Harvard Medical School. She explains that, although it seems that we are dreaming more often, we are actually remembering them better because we’re sleeping more, but also waking up more during the night. “With more options to sleep, including napping in the day and longer lie-ins, dream recall is maximised, but you have to wake up out of a dream to remember it. We know that increased stress is a cause of waking frequently during the night.”Barrett collects and analyses dreams from survivors of traumatic events, including 911. She is now analysing 4,000 pandemic dreams from more than 2,000 survey respondents. “There are huge commonalities between how our dreams respond to traumas and crises. With clear visual associations, dreams are more literal. After 911, people were dreaming of buildings falling, hijackers with knives and planes crashing into things,” she says.Without singular images to focus on in dreamworld, we plug in our own visual metaphors. When Barrett analysed dreams after the 1995 sarin gas attack on the Tokyo subway, she found that people reported “lots of monsters and invisible assailants rather than actual gas attacks”. Some dreams she has collected during the current pandemic are literal – “people are having trouble breathing or spiking a fever” – but many are abstract. After all, we know coronavirus is there, but we can’t see it. “There are earthquakes, tidal waves and tornadoes every kind of uncontrollable disaster. But the biggest dream cluster is bugs flying bugs attacking the dreamer, cockroaches swarming, masses of squirming worms.”More sleep generally means greater scope for REM sleep – the last stage, when we typically dream. Waking up more often during the night may mean better dream recall, but it can leave us feeling exhausted the next day. As for what we see in our dreams, research has long suggested that their contents are linked to our waking mindset. We process intense memories, current stressors and emotions during REM sleep our dreams are often heavy with symbolism and strange renderings of reality. It could also be that, as life is reduced to the size of a few rooms in lockdown, we have far less daily stimuli to draw from and are subconsciously digging around in the past.Those who have worked in crisis situations are familiar with the effects stress can have on dreams. Naveen Cavale is a plastic surgeon at King’s College Hospital in south London, specialising in reconstruction after traumatic injuries. Unpredictability and high-stake interventions are his baseline. Cavale says he usually “sleeps very well”, but this was challenged when he travelled to Gaza in 2015, just after the ceasefire was declared, to help repair the catastrophic injuries of victims of the conflict. Anticipating the crossing from Israel to Gaza kept him up at night, but the vividness of his dreams when he got to Gaza was even more striking.“I was shown a video by a surgeon of one of the busiest nights in the hospital. True chaos. I’m a very visual person and would lie awake in my hotel bed playing it over and over in my head,” he says. Cavale has visited Gaza 15 times now, and sleeps well there, but after visiting will often dream in vistas that have affected him. “I see the spindly minarets of mosques, fires inside half blown-up buildings and colossal craters where bombs have taken out entire blocks.”Some people say that they are sleeping better than ever during lockdown, and may be able to apply a “whatever gets you through” mentality of napping with abandon. For others who are struggling, it may be helpful to think about underlying drivers of stress and its impact on sleep. But as someone who keeps dreaming of my body being invaded by wormy parasites, it is strangely soothing to learn that I’m not the only one."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ec9a11c9f3182b4e492f2b110dcaadd3011b61b6/0_0_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c0a6739eefb07ac98818790ac92303aa","title":"yoga with adriene how the youtube star won lockdown","story":"With gyms and studios worldwide off limits, online exercise classes are booming – and one Texan teacher has become the ‘patron saint of quarantine’. By  Marisa MeltzerHop into something comfy and let’s get started!” This is how Adriene Mishler, YouTube’s biggest yoga guru, begins many of her videos. For those of us who are not spending our quarantine days writing an update of King Lear or attempting to follow along with Barry’s Bootcamp on Instagram, Mishler’s just-show-up approach to yoga is a comfort and a welcome distraction. In recent months, she has been described as “the patron saint of quarantine” (Paper magazine), “the most influential yoga teacher on the planet” (Refinery29), and “Our saviour” (a fan on Twitter).Mishler was already huge before the pandemic – her channel, which has more than 7 million subscribers, is the first to pop up when you search for “yoga” on YouTube – but the lockdown has catapulted her to a new level of fame. Fans on social media recommend their favourite videos, post charcoal drawings of her and express their undying devotion to her for keeping them sane. One devotee even built a digital replica of her home studio in the video game Animal Crossing. There are countless memes about her, as well as ones about her dog, a blue heeler, or Australian cattle dog, named Benji, who frequently makes cameo appearances lounging beside the mat, or wandering into shot.Working out at home in the time of coronavirus is fraught. Most of us don’t have much space to spare, let alone weights or props to replicate the gym (or a steam room or a woman arguing on her phone while jogging on a treadmill next to you). But even for those of us committed to being deeply unambitious during this period, exercise does eventually seem like a good idea, if not just to make up for all the pasta dinners and handfuls of milk chocolate – also to alleviate boredom, or sore backs from sitting cross-legged on the couch all day, or to introduce some movement beyond padding in slippers a few feet from the bedroom to a makeshift standing desk (a laptop propped up on a cupboard), or to give the illusion of some form of routine.Even though every form of exercise, from pilates to ecstatic dance, is being offered in online workouts, and in many cases for free, yoga seems to have risen to the top. It doesn’t require any fancy accessories – you don’t even need a mat – and there’s a meditative aspect that helps with all of our extremely warranted anxiety.Mishler has pitched herself as the perfect first step for yoga novices. Whatever ails you, Mishler seems to have a class for it. She has videos for back pain, vulnerability (an entirely seated practice with a lot of lying in the foetal position), anger (a lot of breathing exercises and child’s pose to calm down) and self-care (literally hugging yourself). There is yoga for runners (a seven-minute full body stretch for before or after a jog) and for those in the service industry (relief from being on one’s feet all day), and even yoga for writers (“focus the brain and body inward so you can perform, create and be your best”). Some of the classes can be done in bed.Maybe what attracts so many people to Mishler is what she’s not: she isn’t threatening, has none of the holier-than-thou quality of someone who just came back from rigorous spiritual training, and nor is she stone-faced or humourless. On screen, Mishler, who is 35, comes across as sweet and wholesome, like the one popular girl in school who was actually kind. Her classes tend to be slow-placed, with clear instructions for absolute beginners and insight for more experienced students. She’s good at telling you how to avoid injury, which is important when there’s no teacher in the room to correct or guide you deeper into a pose. She can occasionally seem a little homespun – with her Texan “howdy” – or get a little spiritual and write on her website that “Yoga is really the art of waking up”.Right now, while we are stuck – in our cramped apartments, our crowded living rooms, our sunless basement flats, our solitary terraces – yoga offers us a solution, an escape, a way to unwind. It doesn’t come larded with the kind of ambition that drives people to train for marathons or visit the gym several times a week to lose weight. Yoga is only interested in the present, an apt philosophy at a moment when the future is so uncertain. As a teacher, Mishler is not doing anything revolutionary, but she has struck a chord in these anxious times. By not doing too much, and not asking us to do too much, she’s become the woman of the hour.These days Mishler receives so many requests that her press office sends automated emails apologising in advance if it takes a while to respond. But after I got through to her voicemail – which features her singing a song about leaving a message to the tune of the Chili’s “baby back ribs” jingle – Mishler called me back about a minute later, apologising for missing the call.On the phone from her home in Austin, Texas, Mishler sounded exactly like she does in her videos: extremely friendly, sincere and polite. She thanked me for asking how her quarantine is going. “It’s best-case scenario,” she said. “My boyfriend lives eight minutes away. He’s the only person that I see, and he can work at his home and I can work here. A lot of people assume I must be golden … Oh come on, buddy!” – she broke off to yell at Benji the dog, who was barking in the background. Others are having a much harder time of it, she said, such as her friends who have kids, but she admitted to having occasional wobbles. “You have your own discombobulated moment each day where you feel like you’re in the Groundhog Day movie.”Mishler grew up in an arty family in Austin. As a teenager, she took acting classes, in which she learned about mind-body practices such as yoga. Later, while trying to make it as a professional actor – among her early roles was a cameo as “cute female student” in an episode of the TV show Friday Night Lights – she qualified as a yoga teacher and taught some classes. Her main frame of reference for exercising at home was Jane Fonda’s classic 1980s do-it-for-the-burn aerobics videos, along with Rodney Yee’s yoga DVDs, which featured a lot of instruction but not much fun.The origins of Yoga With Adriene go back to the set of a horror movie, where she met an independent film-maker called Christopher Sharpe, who had helped create a popular YouTube channel starring his wife, the chef Hilah Johnson. Afterwards, Sharpe and Mishler stayed in touch, and in 2012, when Sharpe was looking for new YouTube projects, he asked Mishler if she wanted to start a yoga channel. In September that year, they began uploading videos.“I had this inkling, if we all had an at-home yoga practice, it would change everything – it could become like a normal hygiene practice, or saying a prayer if you’re a spiritual person,” Mishler told me. “A daily practice that can be medicinal – you could roll out the mat if you’re stressed. That was a huge stretch in 2012, but I was so broke that I thought it was worth a try.”Yoga studios and, really, gyms in general, can be intimidating places. There’s the fear of looking as if you don’t know what you’re doing. It’s easy to stand out by being the largest person in the room, or the only man in the yoga class, or the only woman lifting free weights, or the only person of colour, full stop. Plus, they’re expensive and they require commitment.Mishler’s channel aimed to remove these stresses. One thing that made her videos appealing was that they weren’t filmed in a professional studio or in a fancy home, settings that were popular in older workout videos. By filming in a private space – Mishler did her workout in a living room – the videos felt more intimate and personal, tapping into the same qualities that were becoming popular in other YouTube genres, from singing covers of a song in a bedroom to cooking in regular home kitchens.While the setting was clean and bright, it wasn’t aspirational, unlike the Rodney Yee videos, filmed on beaches with spectacular views or at the foot of snow-capped mountains. Mishler was just a nice-looking woman in a nice-enough room wearing a tank top and leggings that didn’t even match. It suited her, but it was also a deliberate decision – a strategy, even though she hates that word – to make her the yoga girl next door.In this, Benji is a useful ally. He serves not just as a beloved pet, but as a muse and a beacon of calm as he sleeps on the sidelines. “He is a great tool for the storytelling. His presence just lends itself so well to not feeling like it’s a super-produced video,” she said, and as if he knew he was being referenced, Benji barked several times in the background. “Benji is a way to tear down the fourth wall without being pretentious. Maybe that’s too heavy of a word. We’re here together and he helps set the tone.”As Mishler was crafting the channel’s tone, Sharpe was carefully studying how YouTube users search for yoga and other workouts, compiling lists of key terms and optimising the titles of the videos. Instead of just creating classes that might suit potential needs, they looked at Sharpe’s studies and tailored classes according to what people were searching for. This is why Mishler’s classes include Yoga for Back Pain, Yoga for Lower Back Pain, Yoga for Upper Back Pain, as well as Upper Back Love, and, of course, Lower Back Love.The YouTube channel wasn’t an overnight hit. It took about two years of posting a new video each week to reach 200,000 subscribers, and that was the point at which it started to become commercially successful. Mishler’s videos aren’t heavily branded, but the website Social Blade, which tracks growth on YouTube, estimates that the channel could make as much as $188,500 per month on advertising revenue alone.For hardcore fans looking to venture further into the Mishler universe, there is also a subscription service ($9.99 per month) called Find What Feels Good, in which the best-friend vibe is amped up even more, via exclusive classes, vlogs, meditations and blog posts. She also leads retreats, and holds large events for International Yoga Day each June. But this year, a retreat in Mexico City combining Spanish lessons and yoga – Mishler’s mother is Mexican – scheduled for May had to be cancelled, as did an upcoming event at the United Nations.On 12 April, Mishler began her email newsletter with the following: “I am sending you some loving energy from my humble abode. It is Sunday. Just in case you need a reminder.” And then she included a poem, which, depending on your perspective, will be either painfully twee or gently comforting:Today is another day in which we are blessed with the opportunity to rise,To continue, and awaken.To slowly nod with forgiveness,Squint the eyes –Just a bit,And whisper,I got this.I attended a Californian high school that offered yoga as part of its physical education programme. At 16 I signed up for it – along with all the other misfits who weren’t enrolled in typical private-school sports such as lacrosse or field hockey – and learned crow pose and breathing techniques from a long-haired ageing hippie with a gentle demeanour. I liked it enough, but didn’t take yoga classes again until after university, when I found myself living down the street from a yoga studio.In 2015, after I joined a studio in Manhattan, I would go to a yoga class every couple of days. This year I took the plunge, going from being a yoga student who attended class a few times a week to teaching a restorative yoga class once a week at a downtown studio called Sky Ting. I have never thought of myself as a natural teacher, but I loved it. Teaching was, frankly, kind of a power trip. I like being in charge, putting together a playlist, watching students tumble out of class in a relaxed afterglow. My classes were in the late afternoon on Thursdays. Friends came by, but so did people I didn’t know, and they started to come every week, which was thrilling: I knew what I was doing enough that people wanted more. I started in the second week of January, but was only able to teach for two months before business was suspended.On a recent Sunday evening, I taught one class via Instagram from my sitting room. My yoga studio provided its teachers with notes on setting up, from how to best position our phones to tips on creating as inviting a space as possible in a tiny New York apartment (plants and natural light are good, dirty floors and clutter are best avoided). I tend not to speak a lot during my classes. It’s a conscious choice based on years of wishing that I could zone out and not have to hear a teacher chattering along. But a lot of silence while demonstrating poses alone in front of a screen just translates to dead air, which feels awkward, so I found myself making commentary to fill up the silence. My class, like Mishler’s, was treated to a spontaneous appearance by my bulldog, Joan, when she wandered over to investigate what I was doing. I missed touching my students, running a hand down their spine to encourage deeper relaxation or massaging their foreheads to relieve tension. But I also loved that anyone could join, and students could say hello or send a comment through the app. (That said, I could have done without the person who kept messaging me to say I should change my music.)Because so many studios have taken their classes online, I’ve also got to tune into some of my favourite far-flung teachers and friends, from Portugal to Los Angeles. When I spoke to one of these teachers, Kyle Miller, about her experience of teaching on Zoom, she was near-rapturous. “Getting to see everyone, talk and hang out in the moments before and after class, getting to watch the students as they practise and teach right to them, it’s been incredible and unexpected,” she said. “It honestly feels like I’ve socialised. I ride a high after my streams!” Yoga teachers, it seems, are perhaps the world’s most gifted people when it comes to putting a positive spin on things.Mishler is not really a superstar teacher like the types who headline Wanderlust – the global travelling yoga festival that is sort of like Coachella for the spiritually inclined, at which fans shell out around $200 to take massive yoga classes led by teachers talking rapturously about the need to be humble. Nor is Mishler an influencer in the current sense, posing for highly branded and sponsored photos with perfect hair. Her own Instagram is simple and relatively unflashy, featuring photos of the sky, grocery store flowers and, of course, Benji. She is careful not to sound too out-there or new age, and will often poke fun at something she says by using an exaggeratedly calm, smug-yoga-lady voice. Her online persona recalls a time when normal people could become famous on the internet for being good at being themselves – Justin Bieber before he became Justin Bieber.Mishler acknowledges that she has made compromises to broaden her reach. She understands that she grew her audience based on a canny understanding of how to target her videos, but there is an awkward disconnect between the kind of yoga she wants to teach and what is most sought after on YouTube. Her most popular videos are, she said, “a tight race between anything that has ‘anxiety’ in the title and also the yoga for weight loss”. She feels weird about that, she says. “I do not teach yoga for weight loss, that’s not my end goal, but, you know, when that is in the title in the SEO, it attracts a lot more people than it would have otherwise,” she said, sounding a little defensive. “I know there is integrity in the content,” she said.While the coronavirus pandemic has brought legions of new fans, it might also mean that, for the first time, Yoga With Adriene could have some real competition. Every yoga brand is trying to ride out this wave of isolation and come out with more followers at the other end. Local studios from all over the world are live-streaming from home so students can take classes with their favourite teachers, not just what’s free on YouTube. Big brands are also pushing their online classes, including Nike, Alo, Gaia, Sweaty Betty, CorePower, Lululemon and Yoga Journal. Meanwhile, on YouTube, there are now numerous videos that seem to borrow heavily from Yoga With Adriene’s formula: accessible classes performed in homey environments. New competitors include Yoga By Candace and Yoga With Tim. They both include their dogs.Whenever we are let out of our homes, my guess would be that yoga studios will have waiting lists. They’ll likely be different from before, operating at no more than a quarter of their usual capacity allowing students (who’ll bring their own mats) to keep two metres apart. But even with those compromises, it will probably feel better than practising one more day in front of a screen.What seemed reassuring in quarantine might feel claustrophobic when we’re let out, and for Mishler, it’s possible that there might be a downside to being so closely associated with a strange and miserable time. While we all troop gratefully back to class, Mishler will still be taping herself at home, doing yoga to a camera in her sitting room, Benji by her side. But worrying too much about the future is not quite in the spirit of Yoga With Adriene, which is all about the here and now. As she writes on her website: “The process is the candy.

But we’re discussing a book we all really enjoyed. And, apart from a few hitches like some people’s frames freezing, it was really, really satisfying.”A few short weeks ago, that would have been unthinkable.“There was no training whatsoever. And if my computer wasn’t turning on I’d ring IT and they’d sort it out. Up until about 2000 you could learn the program specific to what you needed to do. There wasn’t a need to go beyond that if you didn’t want to.”But that’s all had to change for her generation: “We’ve been forced to encounter technology in a very different way if we want to continue to have any quality of life.”The need to connect is precisely what’s driving many seniors to do just that, according to RMIT’s Dr Torgeir Aleti, who’s researching how technology helps support connectedness and social inclusion among older people.This confirms what he and his colleagues have suspected for a long time: “It’s just a stereotype that is constantly perpetuated, that seniors don’t know this stuff.“The idea that it’s not for me, I don’t have the skills, or the resources, or I’m afraid of being bullied, or of doing something wrong – these things are now being pushed into the background because we’re in a situation where it’s that or just patting the cat for two weeks while I’m waiting to … go out again,” Aleti says.Many are turning to younger generations for help, with mixed results.“Over the phone, it’s, ah, it always starts off civil, and I always begin with the intention that somehow I’ll be able to solve her problem for her,” says Cheetham’s daughter, Naomi. “But as you know personally with technology, sometimes it becomes overwhelming, no matter how tech-savvy you may be.”Tasks that could easily be demonstrated in person quickly turn into a multi-step tangle of complicated workarounds – like talking someone through using Zoom for the first time.“I taught her to do a video call on WhatsApp first, and how to switch her camera around so I could see what she was doing on her screen rather than her face. It was an enormously clunky way to do it,” Naomi says.“That’s when I realised she’d need a cheat sheet. I used the Snipping tool to show all the screens. It was like Ikea instructions – as few words as possible.”Her mother sent that on to others, who passed it on to their friends too.“Naomi is great,” Cheetham says, “I can’t sing her praises enough.”But … “I find the best teachers are people of my own generation. That seems to work best for me, anyway.”Glen Wall, the vice-president of U3A Network Victoria, agrees.He’s seen a remarkable uptake in technology among members of the University of the Third Age organisation, which runs courses for older people, and has been moving classes online since early March. In less than three weeks 15 tutors in his area of Whittlesea were running sessions over Zoom, taking about half their students – the early adapters – with them. Wall says a second wave is now coming onboard.“People are sort of socially figuring it out,” he says. “I know of a 94-year-old … who talked his 93-year-old mate into buying his old iPad off him. He bought a new one and he’s taught his mate to push that button so he can talk to him every morning.”“Community connecters” are crucial to spreading the knowledge.“They’ll be the sort of person that can use technology or find out how to, and then have the ability or passion to share the experience,” Wall says.One such person is U3A member Awhina Te Amo, a full-time carer for her 70-year-old mother, who has Alzheimer’s disease. Before social distancing, Te Amo accompanied her mother to line dancing, choir, tap dancing, chair aerobics and tai chi. Now a lot of it is virtual.“We also stay connected with others through WhatsApp, email, and I’m currently working on a YouTube channel,” Te Amo says. “We have a little group on Facebook and I’m teaching others what I’ve been learning. I’m just passing on the knowledge as best as I can.”Relying on a trusted circle of people is the key to solving many technology dilemmas, according to Wall. “If a person talks about what they are looking to do – not how – in their group of friends, they will most likely find someone that’s actually done it. And that person will show them.”Meanwhile, Cheetham is persevering with the unfamiliar. “If there’s one thing this coronavirus is going to do, it’s going to shift the balance from interactions more strongly in the direction of tech communication,” she says.“So it’s one thing to prefer something else, but to be functional my generation are going to have to do it.”U3A Online and RMIT’s Shaping Connections project are both great places for older Australians to start building their technological skills. The federal government also has helpful resources, including an e-safety page for seniors a number of short courses with detailed instructions on everything from online shopping to using apps and a series of webinars about staying safe online."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5830b3f4955e9cd30402472ea103049202d75eb2/0_0_7360_4414/master/7360.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=45c269e5436550f06d597f831524e7d9","title":"nabihah iqbal the london musician who got locked down in pakistan","story":"After losing two years’ worth of music in a break-in, DJ-producer Nabihah Iqbal went to Karachi – and got stuck there for weeks. But she reconnected with her family, the guitar – and a lot of okraIn years to come, Nabihah Iqbal will hopefully look back on the past seven weeks and think that everything happens for a reason.The London-based musician got stranded in Pakistan’s most populous city, Karachi, on 6 March, having flown out for two weeks to visit her critically ill grandad. Just days before Iqbal left the UK, her studio was burgled, including a laptop containing two years’ worth of original music.“I’ve never been in a situation before where I’ve been in a foreign country and I have literally zero idea about when I can go home,” Iqbal tells me over the phone from Karachi (she arrives back in the UK today, having finally secured a place on a charter flight for stranded Brits). Her grandad’s steady recovery and the “impending doom” of the country’s Covid-19 outbreak have taken priority over her lost second album, but Iqbal holds everything in delicate perspective, wary of the profound uncertainty facing her industry.Brought up in London on a diet of Britpop, punk and metal, Iqbal began to expand her musical tastes as a student. The breadth of her studies in history and ethnomusicology forms the basis of her fortnightly show on NTS Radio, which itemises the clumsy “world music” label into its distinct elements, ranging from Ireland to Indonesia. Meanwhile, Iqbal began to produce broken-beat synthpop as Throwing Shade, retiring the moniker in 2017 for her debut LP, Weighing of the Heart. Her radio shows retain a scholarly approach to sound – “I’m a bit of a geek” – often opening with vignettes on different musical traditions or instruments.Such globetrotting has given Iqbal a cultural sensitivity that is now directed towards the urgent reality of coronavirus in Pakistan. A regular visitor to her ancestral home, Iqbal sees an unfolding disaster that many in the west have overlooked. “People are already suffering so much, especially the poor,” she says, adding that British people tend to be “still in quite privileged positions. We don’t have to worry about where our next meal is going to come from. In Pakistan, people are going to be starving to death before they even die of the virus.”We speak on the first day of Ramadan, as reports emerge of the country’s imams refusing to close mosques and doctors’ pleas for PPE being ignored by the government. It seems that negligence transcends borders, even when people cannot. “I feel really lucky,” says Iqbal, who has been quarantining with her mother and grandparents.Iqbal’s new album was supposed to be finished by the end of the year, but a fresh start now awaits when she returns to London. “It’s so annoying and upsetting, but I can’t do anything about it,” she says, joking that her music might still be released by whoever stole it.Her fans would probably accept the compromise. For now, they will have to survive off the salvaged demos that Iqbal compiled into a radio show at the end of March. It is a woozy blend of guitars, collapsing synths and the piano and vocal licks that defined Weighing of the Heart. The closing segment features Lucinda Chua playing cello and Yussef Dayes on drums: a small reminder of London’s fervent collaborative jazz scene.As for life in quarantine, she says: “I thought: OK, I’m in Pakistan, I need to try and do some sort of music. I managed to buy an acoustic guitar from a shop here, just a couple of days before the lockdown.” Hours spent perfecting Nick Drake melodies have followed. “It’s retaught me the special nature of actually just playing the instrument and not having anything else trying to come up with ideas, just me and a guitar.”With live performances facing an uncertain future, now is a good time to be songwriting. “I think everybody’s probably thinking: I need to make a banger,” Iqbal says, laughing. “Just live off royalties and not have to worry about playing gigs ever again.” It is certainly one option, but she also articulates a sense of shared anxiety, both financial and artistic. “The coronavirus situation has made me rethink the whole process of being a DJ, and as a musician who makes most of their money from gigs. When you have to worry more about finances, it’s also harder to focus on being creative. If there’s no end in sight, then we need an alternative.”In Karachi, Iqbal is grateful for the extra family time. “Me and my grandad tried twice to drive to the seaside, but both times we got stopped at police roadblocks,” she says. My mind jumps to recent news reports of brutal police suppression during the pandemic, but she assures me these officers were “actually all right”.She has also taken to sharing Pakistani herbal remedies on Instagram, dubbing herself the Lockdown Herbalist. She has introduced her followers to bairi and neem trees, aloe vera from source and digestion aids such as ispaghol. Iqbal is quick to point out the western ironies. “In England, it’s just a very bougie thing you’ll go into Whole Foods and you’re like: what’s trending? What health supplement can I try today?” she says with a chuckle. “Whereas, when you come to a country like Pakistan, it’s very ancient all of these things are ingrained in the society and culture for thousands of years. My grandma would literally have a heart attack if she saw they were selling little pots of turmeric in posh London chemists for £50.”By the time she returns, London will have changed irrevocably from when she left. “I guess the atmosphere’s going to be quite sombre,” says Iqbal, who, coordinating with others online, has been pressuring the high commission for Pakistan and Westminster MPs for answers.I suggest that they are at the mercy of a confused repatriation policy, with the foreign office advising Britons to take commercial flights home from Pakistan, despite its strict lockdown. “It does feel that way a bit. It shouldn’t be, because even if there’s just one British citizen stranded somewhere, it’s the duty of the British government to make sure that person can get home safely,” she says. Despite her lost music, Iqbal remains grateful in the face of the crisis: “You just realise that nothing else really matters except being with your family.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/99ee90a785d912c450554f42f115b291de484e39/0_0_4924_3286/master/4924.jpg?width=700\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=93c9e85c73fb5b6c0ae812ebbd9109a3 700w","title":"breathless boris is left floundering as he faces foe he cant outbluster","story":"At his comeback virus briefing the PM repeats same old words, but even he struggles to believe themBoris Johnson has every right to sound knackered. It’s little more than a couple of weeks since he came out of intensive care and his partner has just given birth to a baby boy. But sounding breathless before he had even gasped out his opening sentence at his first Downing Street press conference since falling ill with the coronavirus probably wasn’t the commanding, reassuring presence he had hoped to convey.The Boss may be back, but the man who longed to be the new Churchill isn’t even the old Boris. The upbeat ebullience and jingoism no longer comes naturally. He can still come out with the same words, but he can no longer even bring himself to believe them. For the first time in his life, there are signs of self-doubt. When he looks in the mirror, he now sees his reflection beginning to fragment. His persona that has been carefully constructed over 55 years to protect himself from the pain of being himself is falling apart. Yet still he can’t quite access the humility that might go some way to healing himself.Not that Boris didn’t give it his best shot at papering over the cracks, but it cost him dear. By the end of the press conference he was just two pinprick, bloodshot eyes peeping out of an ashen-white face. If he really feels the need to get back to work so soon, then he can’t have much faith in the rest of his cabinet. There again, that’s one area where you can’t really fault his judgment.“I’m not going to minimise the lack of personal protective equipment or the failure to expedite testing,” he said. Before proceeding to do just that. The lack of PPE and adequate testing – today was the day we were supposed to have reached 100,000 daily tests – have been two of the leading factors in the UK’s mortality rate, but according to Boris the government hadn’t put a foot wrong. The lack of an apology becomes more insulting by the day to the families of the nearly 27,000 people who have died. It appears that the only people in the entire country not to have heard of the 2016 Exercise Cygnus, that highlighted the risks of a pandemic, are the entire government frontbench.Rejoice, rejoice. Sunlight was visible. We had avoided the worst-case scenario of 500,000 dead by burrowing under the alpine mountain. Boris appeared to have both forgotten that we were already well past the 20,000 “best-case result” of his chief scientific adviser, Patrick Vallance, and that – even allowing for statistical variations – the UK had a fatality rate significantly higher than that of Germany or South Korea and might even have the worst record of any country in Europe.The line that the government did the right things at the right time becomes ever more untenable. What can’t be admitted is that Boris effectively took a 10-day holiday in March, at a time when he could have done more to protect the country. Seldom has so much been owed by so few to so many.Boris then breezed on to the R rate – AKA the reproduction rate. Here satire nearly died. For as scientists struggle to pin down the UK’s R rate to between 0.6 and 0.9, no one has the first idea of Boris’s own reproduction rate. We know its current level is at least six – though even Boris doesn’t appear to know if it’s more – and with every likelihood of adding to the score in the years ahead. If Boris were a virus he would be deadly.On and on he bumbled. We would have to wait until some time next week for the government to make it clear it still had no real plan for ending lockdown. Things were definitely getting better but no one had a clue how to ease things while ensuring R remained lower than one. Even Vallance and England’s chief medical officer, Chris Whitty, couldn’t help Boris out with that one. The only certainty was more uncertainty.The questions only revealed how little everyone really knew, as Boris had no clear answers to anything. He couldn’t say anything on tourism to Cornwall – “there will be more information later” – and his suggestion that people with mental health issues should call NHS helplines rang hollow as successive Tory governments have cut mental health provision to a bare minimum. Even if you’re really desperate, you’re lucky to get an appointment inside six months these days. An embarrassed Whitty eventually had to intervene and point people in the direction of mental health charities if they needed urgent help.Otherwise, there was just more of the same. The scientists urging caution while Boris talked big about the economy bouncing back, avoiding the second peak and enforcing the wearing of face masks which only a month ago he had said were a waste of time. But deep down, Boris knows he’s met his match. Up till now, he’s never found a situation in his life which he couldn’t bluster his way out of. Now he’s come up against a power greater than himself coronavirus is so far immune to almost everything. In a straight contest between coronavirus and bullshit, the coronavirus wins every time."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b3688b4586d0bfebdd4f5980dc6dc67d832dd7b0/0_0_5825_3497/master/5825.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=1df4c24bf8afd69b28139a0d3f1ef13b","title":"nasa moon landing bezos musk blue origin spacex","story":"Alabama company Dynetics also chosen for moon landing project, as three firms prepare to competeNasa has selected three private space companies to lead the development of lunar landers for its forthcoming moon landings.The three companies are Blue Origin, owned by Amazon’s CEO, Jeff Bezos Elon Musk’s SpaceX and Dynetics, based in Huntsville, Alabama, Nasa announced on Thursday.The lunar landers will carry the astronauts from lunar orbit to the Moon’s surface and back again. Blue Origin’s contract is worth $579m, SpaceX’s $135m and Dynetics will receive $253m.These awards will cover the next 10 months as each team works with Nasa to determine how their proposed solution would work in practice. In the past, Nasa has specified exactly how it wants spacecraft to be built. Now, however, it is working more collaboratively with smaller aerospace companies who have developed newer, more cost-effective ways of building space hardware.“These are three companies that we believe have a lot of capability that are going to enable us to get to the moon,” said NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine.The three companies are now in competition with each other to see who can develop their proposals into workable landers. Each has taken a slightly different approach.Blue Origin proposes a three-stage lander that would abandon its landing engines on the moon’s surface to lighten the load when it is time to return to Earth. SpaceX wants to use its general purpose “Starship” spacecraft, which it says could also be used for Mars missions. Dynetics plan an innovative lander that could be launched on any rocket.“We’ve selected the best of industry’s ideas to team with Nasa,” said Doug Loverro, associate administrator of Nasa’s human exploration and operations mission directorate. “This is really the last piece of the puzzle to go ahead and get us back to the moon. We’ve got all the other pieces in work already, and this is the last big piece. We are ready to move forward on this.”The landings will be the first time astronauts have walked on the moon since the Apollo moon landings of the late 60s and early 70s.The current Nasa programme is known as Artemis, after Apollo’s twin sister and the goddess of the moon in Greek mythology. It aims to land the first woman and the next man on the moon by 2024.This is four years earlier than Nasa’s original plan, which called for the building of a lunar space station called the gateway. Astronauts would dock there first, before transferring to a lander and “taxiing” to the surface.In what is widely regarded as a politically motivated directive to make the landing coincide with the end of Donald Trump’s putative second term in the White House, the vice-president, Mike Pence, directed Nasa in March 2019 to accelerate its efforts by four years.To meet this express time table, Nasa said at today’s conference that it was likely it would bypass the lunar gateway completely for the first landing. This fast-track approach would evolve into the sustainable lunar programme of 2028 that it has been planning with international partners such as the European Space Agency and the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency.Also during the press conference, Bridenstine said he had talked to politicians from both sides of the aisle and received broad, bipartisan support for the lunar effort. But Congress needs to approve the Nasa budget, which will have to increase by $3bn in 2021 to support the lunar lander development. Nasa’s 2020 budget is $22.6bn.At least one other company, the aerospace giant Boeing, had submitted a proposal. Nasa did not award it anything and declined to comment on the reasons for Boeing’s exclusion at the press conference. In December, Boeing’s Starliner spacecraft, designed to take Nasa astronauts to the International Space Station, had to abort a test flight."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6063a611715a43db4e329edf271051b054d72d17/0_108_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0415dbb5214f98c24301684d8fb9f9c2","title":"first week of proposed fixture list for return of horse racing out next week","story":"The British Horseracing Authority said on Thursday that it will publish a provisional programme and fixture list for the first seven days of racing following its resumption, whatever the eventual date might be, by the end of next week, while a provisional programme until the end of June which is “as close as possible to the original programme for the period” will be available soon afterwards.The next step in the BHA’s planning for a phased return to racing, which is intended to reflect what is likely to be a gradual loosening of the current lockdown restrictions, follows a call for racecourses to submit “expressions of interest” to stage racing under “full quarantine conditions at secured sites” in the earliest stages. Lingfield and Newcastle, which both have on-site hotels, are believed to be two tracks under consideration, with attendance limited to staff “essential to delivering the race fixture”.The BHA’s latest update on resumption planning, issued on Thursday evening, also clarified recent advice that early meetings will be restricted to “the most experienced riders”, extending the definition to include apprentices with a 3lb claim.The BHA also said that there will be no limit on the number of runners that an owner or trainer can have in a single race, despite fields’ sizes initially being restricted to 12, while inexperienced horses will qualify for a handicap mark after two runs rather than three, provided that they have finished in the first six on both occasions.While no firm date has been set for a resumption in Britain before the government’s review of the current lockdown which is due next week, Norway joined Sweden in racing behind closed doors this week. Germany is scheduled to resume racing next Monday with France following a week later on 11 May.French racing is poised to resume with several big-name horses in action on a valuable card at Longchamp, where Sottsass, third home in last year’s Prix de l’Arc de Triomphe, and Victor Ludorum, the favourite for the Poule d’Essai des Poulains (French 2,000 Guineas) are both expected to go to post.Victor Ludorum, a 7-2 chance for the rescheduled Classic on 1 June, is expected to run in the Prix de Fontainebleau, while Sottsass, last year’s French Derby winner, is being prepared for his four-year-old debut in the Prix d’Harcourt.Meanwhile, documents filed by the liquidator dealing with the failed online bookmaker MoPlay have shown that BetFred did not pay MoPlay directly to acquire the firm’s client list prior to the migration of around 180,000 MoPlay accounts and balances on to its books. reported on 19 April that a number of former MoPlay customers had complained that their balances had not transferred to BetFred as they had expected. The liquidator’s report lists a number of reasons why this might have been the case, including accounts being “frozen” or “suspended” at the migration date. As a result, this may have included customers who attempted to withdraw balances in the days before MoPlay ceased trading, when the firm stopped processing withdrawal requests."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/acde30c5d73415b78b965997bf00896a83aa4e5a/0_53_2048_1229/master/2048.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f2a7d044afd99bc9186b16676855b03a","title":"peter ebdon retires from professional snooker due to injury","story":"The former world champion Peter Ebdon has retired from professional snooker because of injury. The 49-year-old has opted to end his career rather than have spinal surgery after enduring neck, back, shoulder and arm pain.Ebdon won the 2002 world championship, beating Stephen Hendry in a 18-17 thriller, and reached the 1996 and 2006 finals. He won eight other ranking events, including the 2006 UK Championship, during 29 years on the circuit.Ebdon told the world championship sponsor Betfred: “I had an MRI scan about seven weeks ago which picked up significant wear and tear in my neck. There is serious deterioration in some of the vertebrae and I have been in pain since Christmas.“Two of the vertebrae need to be replaced, which is not an operation I want to have because if it went wrong I could be in a wheelchair for the rest of my life. It’s far too risky. The professor explained to me that it wouldn’t be a cure. It could work, but it could make things worse and I would probably need to have it again in 10 years.”The reigning world champion, Judd Trump, tweeted: “Happy retirement to pdebdon what a fantastic career ... Also learn a lot from playing him in my early career and he loved to take on some crazy shots at times which I have a lot of respect for lol.”Barry Hearn, chairman of World Snooker Tour, congratulated Ebdon on his “wonderful” career. Hearn wrote on Twitter: “Heard the news of your retirement and I just wanted to say thank you for your services to snooker and congratulate you on a wonderful professional career.

Many clubs within the professional game had expressed fears that without external financial support the sport faced a bleak future, with the Hull KR chairman, Neil Hudgell, having warned rugby league could cease to exist as a full-time sport by next year.However the RFL’s plea to the government has been answered, with all clubs within the sport’s three professional isions – Super League, Championship and League One – eligible to apply for funding. The government says the funding has been issued due to the value rugby league provides for its local communities, plus the importance of next year’s World Cup in England. “This support enables the sport to survive, to reshape and to be ready to restart in our 125th year,” the RFL’s chief executive, Ralph Rimmer, said.Oliver Dowden, the secretary of state for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, said: “We recognise that many clubs operate on very tight financial margins. Without their ability to stage matches with spectators and despite the government’s extensive economic package, the professional game has come very close to collapsing. This is a massive shot in the arm to secure the survival of rugby league.“Sports across the board are facing unprecedented pressures, and we are supporting them through wider government measures. In this case we are intervening as an exception, not to save an inidual business or organisation, but to protect an entire sport, the community it supports, the World Cup held here next year, and its legacy for generations to come.”How the £16m rescue package is distributed is likely to be discussed by the RFL and its clubs in the coming days. Many in Super League privately believe the funding should be heavily weighted towards top-flight clubs, though with the government underlining the importance of rugby league to its local communities, a significant portion will probably be spent on funding the sport at grassroots level.The government’s confirmation that the money has been issued as an emergency loan, rather than a grant, also implies rugby league will be responsible for repaying it over a period of time, though the terms have not been disclosed. “Rugby league is a sport that makes a significant social impact in the communities it serves, which is even more important now as we respond to the economic pressures resulting from Covid-19,” Steve Barclay, chief secretary to the Treasury, said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/24274defb13a5152647d45fcac3b9b804b5659c1/0_0_4697_3124/master/4697.jpg?width=300\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1f4feb62252b44941f65e728d6dca0cb","title":"borgen is back heres why you should catch up before its netflix return","story":"A new series of the Danish political drama is in development, and its depiction of government is in stark contrast to our current, gloomy realityThere was a nice Facebook post in early April by the Danish prime minister, Mette Frederiksen. In it, she is doing the washing up while singing along to a hit by the 80s Danish popsters Dodo and the Dodos during her country’s weekly TV lockdown singalong.Frederiksen is having a good crisis – not just the kitchen karaoke, but in acting quickly and clearly to shut down the country, limiting deaths, at the time of writing, to 443. Compare that with neighbouring Sweden, which has taken a less stringent approach and where there have been 2,462 deaths. There are obviously loads of factors involved, but could it have something to do with the fact that Frederiksen is a woman?Denmark does a good female prime minister – or statsminister, as you will know if you have watched Borgen. Birgitte Nyborg, the character at the centre of the political drama, is said to be influenced not by Frederiksen, but by the only other woman to lead the country, Helle Thorning-Schmidt. Still, that Facebook post was very Borgen. (Borgen, which means castle, is what the Danes call their parliament.)The news that Netflix has bought the rights to the series – and will reunite the cast and crew, along with Adam Price, the show’s creator, to make a fourth season – should provide some much-needed cheer. You could argue it was an unlikely hit. When it came to Britain in 2012, we already knew, thanks to Forbrydelsen (The Killing), that DR, the Danish national broadcaster, did gripping character-based drama. But that show had mysterious murder at its heart, plus an enigmatic and undeniably hot cop who wore appealing knitwear. Political nitty-gritty, though, in a little country more famous for pastries and Lego? It is hard enough to get excited about our own politics, never mind others’ that require subtitles.Borgen is more than intricate political drama, though: it is intimate drama, politics made human. It is about democracy and people: relationships between people, the relationship between work and home (especially interesting at the moment). It is about journalism, women, values, having children, not having children. It is about you and me.Nyborg (played by Sidse Babett Knudsen) is a fabulous character: strong, ambitious, confident, but also genuine and honest. She has a three-dimensional home life, a hot husband and she rides a bicycle – of course.A lot of real people could learn a lesson from Nyborg and Borgen. Politicians – I am looking at you, the cabinet – could learn that ambition and power don’t preclude honesty and ideology. Spin doctors (spindoktorer), press officers, political editors and journalists might learn something about how to get more people to engage with and trust in politics. When Borgen aired in the UK, the ToryLib Dem coalition was in power I remember caring more for and about Nyborg – and Katrine the TV news reporter and Kasper the spin doctor – than I did for David Cameron, Nick bloody Clegg and Steve frigging Hilton.The new series won’t be around until 2022 (boo), but Netflix is going to put up the existing episodes some time this year. Soon, let’s hope – it is ideal lockdown fare. If you haven’t seen it, you need to get involved if you have, you will almost certainly want to again. You will find the cast infinitely more palatable than Boris Johnson, Michael Gove, Priti Patel, Matt Hancock and Dominics Raab and Cummings. You would definitely want Nyborg at the helm right now. Or Frederiksen, or Thorning-Schmidt (who is married to Stephen Kinnock, of course, although that is by the by). I would take any Danish woman, frankly.Denmark is clearly a better place to be: because you are less likely to die there at the moment because singing 80s pop songs together sounds like (even) more fun than collectively clapping and banging saucepans because Borgen."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/00151ee4568ac0c19cd16adcb53f8297c8dc0232/15_58_1404_842/master/1404.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e5bf3f067335e773406dd8bfd66eb6a2","title":"are you planning to mark a special occasion during lockdown","story":"If you are preparing for a big life event in the next fortnight, our photographer would like to capture the moment – from a safe distance Lockdown has wreaked havoc on our social lives.

Here are some answers.The “official” death toll, if you go by what the UK government present to the public every day in Downing Street, is 26,097 deaths as of 5pm 28 April. Until Wednesday this figure focused solely on people who have died in hospital, however an additional 3,811 deaths in care homes and the community have now been included. Deaths in all settings where a positive Covid-19 test has been recorded by Public Health England will now be reflected in the figures each day, according to the government. However, even this doesn’t appear to be entirely straightforward. Figures recorded by the Office for National Statistics and the Care Quality Commission show at least 4,996 deaths were recorded in care homes in the two weeks to 24 April – a toll which is clearly at odds with the government’s latest figures, as many of the deceased will not have been tested. In addition to this, the key government figure is lagging, as it can take days or weeks for some deaths to be counted. Clearly this widely circulated figure, even when deaths in the community are included, is an undercount.The figures to date do not show deaths in care homes are exceeding those in hospitals in England and Wales but it’s possible the impact of the virus is on different trajectories in different places.There are more than 15,000 care homes in England and 3,096 deaths were recorded in care homes in England and Wales as of 17 April. At the same point there were 14,796 deaths in hospitals – a far higher death toll.Early models from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) indicated that the UK could have the worst death toll in Europe, with as many as 66,000 deaths. While that figure now looks overblown based on the model’s daily death toll, it’s still possible the UK could emerge as one of the countries with the highest number of Covid-19 fatalities in Europe.The 26,097 deaths that we know of in the UK puts it ahead of France, which includes care home deaths in its total, and on a par with Spain when comparing the cumulative total, something the government has been keen to distract from by talking about deaths per capita.On that basis the UK currently has 38.4 deaths per 100,000 people, which places it high above Germany which has recorded 7.5 deaths per 100,000 people, on a par with France where the rate is 36.3 per 100,000, but behind Belgium with 63.3 deaths per 100,000. However comparing deaths per capita has limited uses as it does not follow that a larger population should lead to more deaths. If countries are locked down early, testing is in place and hospitals have capacity to treat patients, the spread of the virus can be contained and the death toll should be lower.Figures on excess deaths from EuroMOMO also indicate England could have the highest proportion of excess deaths when compared to European nations.Aside from the problems around how deaths are counted and when, there are further concerns about the accuracy of the Covid-19 death toll. The final figures will depend on Covid-19 being mentioned on the death certificate, which is not as simple as it sounds.Following the Coronavirus Act 2020 medical practitioners in England and Wales do not have to test the deceased to confirm they had Covid-19, they only have to be satisfied that the patient had symptoms consistent with the virus. This means the final official death toll will depend in some part on the discretion of thousands of doctors as to whether Covid-19 is recorded on the death certificate. This could lead to an under count in the number of fatalities rather than an over count, which is one of the reasons we look at excess deaths.Excess deaths are the number of deaths above what we might expect to see at this point in the year. They are a good indicator of how many people may have died as a result of Covid-19 - directly, with the virus on the death certificate, and indirectly."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/691b7b1603990f850c9d6c6f90a26704198d92fc/0_116_4799_2880/master/4799.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c616fef6eeb8bc22d574d297fd160e73","title":"chris patten urges uk investigate coronavirus origins china","story":"Ex-Hong Kong governor also says China is ‘turning screws’ on city during pandemicThere is an “overwhelming case” to send a multilateral mission to Wuhan to investigate the coronavirus’s origins and spread, the former British governor to Hong Kong has told Dominic Raab.Chris Patten wrote to the foreign secretary this week to raise his concern about “two issues that will affect us and the rest of the world for some time to come”: the Chinese government’s initial cover-up of the outbreak, and how it has apparently taken advantage of the pandemic to “turn the screws on Hong Kong”.Patten told Raab he was concerned to see China’s ambassador to the UK engaging in “wolf diplomacy” by denying there had been a cover-up about the origins and early spread of the virus and implying that “respected politicians” in the UK and abroad were “peddling lies and disinformation”.He said there was an overwhelming case in support of “establishing as soon as possible a multilateral expert mission to Wuhan to find out exactly what happened there”.“Since Chinese communists are adamant that they have nothing to hide, they would presumably welcome such an inquiry,” Patten wrote.A spokesperson for the Foreign Office said: “Coronavirus is a global challenge and it’s vital that countries come together to tackle this shared threat. The foreign secretary has been clear that, in time, we will need to learn lessons and ask rigorous questions about why this outbreak happened, why it couldn’t be stopped earlier and what can be done to prevent another outbreak in future. This is something that we will look at with all of our international partners.”On Thursday a vice-foreign minister for China, Le Yucheng, said the government “resolutely opposes” an international investigation, which he said would be “politicised” and aimed at stigmatising China.On Wednesday Britain’s ambassador to the US, Karen Pierce, backed calls by the US and Australia for an inquiry, but said containing the outbreak was the first priority and such inquiries would come later.It came after the UK foreign affairs parliamentary committee asked the government whether it planned to “hold China accountable” by making representations at gatherings of WHO, G7, or G20 members.In his letter, Patten said the pandemic raised questions about the breach of Chinese obligations to the international health regulations of 2005 and as a member of the World Health Organization.“I want to make clear straight away that Britain and other countries should have no argument with China and the Chinese people,” he said, praising the medical staff who fought the virus from the early stages.“The issue is not our relationship with China. It is our relationship with the dangerous and immoral Communist party. In Wuhan the Communist party used the police to try and shut the doctors up. Totalitarian regimes always rely on secrecy and mendacity.”Patten also urged Britain to step in on the deteriorating political situation in Hong Kong, where Beijing representatives and supporters have alarmed observers with intrusions on the city’s semi-autonomy.Beijing’s top organisations in the region, the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office and the liaison office, recently weighed into domestic political arguments, drawing accusations they were acting in contravention to Hong Kong’s mini constitution, the Basic Law.In response, authorities claimed the law did not apply to those offices, sparking furious condemnation from defenders of Hong Kong’s democracy. Authorities have also increased their crackdown on protesters, arresting 15 senior leaders of the democracy movement.Patten said China had “taken advantage of the fact the international community is understandably focused on fighting the pandemic in order to turn the screws on Hong Kong”.He said the statements about the Basic Law were a “flagrant breach of the joint declaration” signed by Britain and China when Hong Kong was handed over to the latter in 1997. Patten was part of the declaration negotiations, and has previously lobbied the UK government over Chinese intrusions on it.“They seem intent on destroying Deng Xiaoping’s concept of ‘one country, two systems’.”Patten asked for assurances the government would press for a mission to Wuhan and would “call out China for its breaches of the joint declaration”, and watch for attempts to undermine Hong Kong’s rule of law or corrupt the electoral process."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b1884d395d61e37a249940f1e0ab785d0bbc5d5d/0_129_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=58c34d62a22bf101d9485a4e72c61bc6","title":"danes and czechs say easing lockdowns has produced no covid 19 surge","story":"Encouraging signs from EU states who acted early, as South Korea reports no new casesDenmark and the Czech Republic have said partially easing their lockdowns has not led to a surge in new coronavirus infections, as the WHO continued to urge extreme caution and Germany relaxed some restrictions but extended others.As EU governments grappled with the complex and conflicting imperatives of easing the lockdowns crippling their economies while avoiding a disastrous second wave of infections, meanwhile, South Korea reported no new cases for the first time.Of the 44 European countries to have imposed restrictions to curb the spread of the virus, 21 had started easing some of them and a further 11 were planning to do so soon, said Hans Kluge, regional director of the World Health Organization in Europe.Kluge warned that all governments must remain extremely circumspect. “As I have said before, this virus is unforgiving,” he said. “We must remain vigilant, persevere and be patient – and ready to ramp up measures again as and when needed.”There was, though, encouraging news from the Czech Republic and Denmark, where phased exits from strict lockdowns implemented early in the pandemic are under way. In Denmark, daycare facilities and schools began reopening two weeks ago, followed by hairdressers and other small businesses on 20 April.“There are no signs at all that the partial reopening has caused a bigger spread of infection,” said Christian Wejse, a scientist at the department of infectious diseases at Aarhus University. “At least there is no indication that we are heading into another wave. That has been the concern, but I can’t see that at all.”The Czech health minister, Adam Vojtěch, said the country’s number of new cases had been below 100 for the past eight consecutive days and also reported that a staggered reopening of shops and services had not so far led to a surge in infections.“So far we do not see a negative trend resulting from previous relaxations,” Vojtěch said. “We will proceed with caution, gradually in the upcoming waves, and I believe we are on a good path.”Proceeding cautiously, Germany on Thursday said places of worship, museums, gardens, zoos, playgrounds and monuments could reopen over the coming days after the chancellor, Angela Merkel, met the heads of the 16 German states.But the federal government and state leaders postponed decisions on whether to reopen all schools and kindergartens and said physical distancing rules would stay in place at least until 10 May, with no further relaxations to be decided before 6 May.Merkel said reopening cafes and restaurants at this stage would be problematic because of the difficulty of checking whether “people around one table are from one family, or from different households”. She said Germany’s goal currently remained to prevent the virus from spreading rapidly.“We don’t have any medication, we don’t have any vaccine against the virus and ... therefore, the goal will always be to slow down the virus,” Merkel said, adding that Germany had so far been “successful in achieving this goal”.Germany began easing its lockdown last week, when some shops were allowed to open provided they practised strict social distancing, but Merkel and government advisers have expressed serious concerns about the dangers of going to far, too fast, with the risk of the infection rate stating to rise again.In Spain, where the daily death toll fell to its lowest in six weeks on Thursday, the health minister announced time slots for specific outdoor activities, in an effort to avoid confusion and further contagion when adults are allowed out on Saturday to exercise for the first time since mid-March.Salvador Illa said that except in smaller towns with fewer than 5,000 inhabitants, people would be allowed out to walk or take other exercise from 6am to 10am and 8pm until 11pm, while people who needed carers or were over 70 could be out from 10am to midday and from 7pm until 8pm.Parents will be able to accompany children aged under 14 on walks between midday and 7pm. “We need to keep acting very wisely and very prudently and follow expert advice,” Illa said. “We got into this together and we need to get out of it together. There’s no other way.”France categorised each of its 95 départements as either red, amber or green according to its risk level, with much of the north and east of the country – including Paris – red, and much of the west and south-west green. Based on infection rate and intensive care bed capacity, the designation will be updated daily until 7 May, when a decision will be made on how fast each will be able to come out of lockdown on 11 May.The country’s environment minister, Élisabeth Borne, said the government will contribute €50 per person towards bicycle repairs from 11 May, as part of a package of measures to encourage cycling and keep cars off city roads.Under pressure from some regional politicians to lift Europe’s longest lockdown sooner, Italy’s prime minister also said the country’s gradual return to normality must be carefully coordinated and based strictly on scientific advice, if it did not want to see a surge in infections.“I’ll say this clearly, at the risk of appearing unpopular,” Giuseppe Conte told parliament on Thursday. “The government cannot immediately ensure a return to normality ... We are still in this pandemic.”The economic devastation wrought by Covid-19 on the continent, however, is already apparent. After Germany on Wednesday said it faced its worst recession since 1949, France, Italy and Spain revealed equally dire figures on Thursday.France and Italy officially fell into recession following historic first-quarter economic declines, while Spain warned of an annual contraction “unprecedented in modern history”. The European Central Bank head, Christine Lagarde, said the crisis threatened “an economic contraction of a magnitude and speed unprecedented in peacetime”.Epidemics of infectious diseases behave in different ways but the\u0026nbsp1918 influenza pandemic\u0026nbspthat killed more than 50 million people is regarded as a key example of a pandemic that occurred in multiple waves, with the latter more severe than the first. It has been replicated – albeit more mildly – in subsequent flu pandemics.How and why multiple-wave outbreaks occur, and how subsequent waves of infection can be prevented, has become a staple of epidemiological modelling studies and pandemic preparation, which have looked at everything from social behaviour and health policy to vaccination and the buildup of community immunity, also known as herd immunity.This is being watched very carefully. Without a vaccine, and with no widespread immunity to the new disease, one alarm is being sounded by the experience of Singapore, which has seen a sudden\u0026nbspresurgence in infections\u0026nbspdespite being lauded for its early handling of the outbreak.Although Singapore instituted a strong contact tracing system for its general population, the disease re-emerged in\u0026nbspcramped dormitory accommodation\u0026nbspused by thousands of foreign workers with inadequate hygiene facilities and shared canteens.Singapore’s experience, although very specific, has demonstrated the ability of the disease to come back strongly in places where people are in close proximity and its ability to exploit any weakness in public health regimes set up to counter it.Conventional wisdom among scientists suggests second waves of resistant infections occur after the capacity for treatment and isolation becomes exhausted. In this case the concern is that the social and political consensus supporting lockdowns is being overtaken by public frustration and the urgent need to reopen economies.The threat declines when susceptibility of the population to the disease falls below a certain threshold or when widespread vaccination becomes available.In general terms the ratio of susceptible and immune iniduals in a population at the end of one wave determines the potential magnitude of a subsequent wave. The worry right now is that with\u0026nbspa vaccine still months away, and the real rate of infection only being guessed at, populations worldwide remain highly vulnerable to both resurgence and subsequent waves.South Korea, meanwhile, once one of the hardest-hit countries in a pandemic that has so far infected more than 3.2 million people worldwide and killed nearly 230,000, reported no new cases for the first time since the disease was detected there, boosting hopes of an eventual return to normality.An aggressive test-and-trace strategy and widespread social distancing had allowed the country to bring the spread of the virus under control, President Moon Jae-in said. “This is the strength of South Korea and its people,” he declared on Thursday.Elsewhere, the virus continued to advance. Cases in Russia surged past 100,000 on Thursday as the country recorded its largest daily increase. The country is now the centre of the outbreak in Europe, but a relatively low death total of 1,073 prompted the Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov to say it had avoided a catastrophic “Italian scenario”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/853c569ba8287f13ffab2229193d4e7d5c6c812a/0_232_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=baef4534573aabf5973f04eef565cf91","title":"eu foreign policy chief denies changes to report on china coronavirus disinformation","story":"Josep Borrell says staff had not bowed to Beijing pressure, but some MEPS remain unconvinced The European Union’s foreign policy chief has rejected allegations that a report on Chinese disinformation and the global coronavirus pandemic was watered down in response to pressure from Beijing.Speaking at a specially convened meeting of the European parliament’s foreign affairs committee, Josep Borrell said the content and the timing of the European External Action Service’s public assessment on disinformation and the pandemic had been determined by the EEAS alone. “We have not bowed to anyone,” he said. “There was no watering down of our findings, however uncomfortable it could be.”A brewing row deepened last week after the New York Times reported that EU officials had delayed, and then rewritten, a report after China tried to block its release. “The Chinese are already threatening with reactions if the report comes out,” a senior official told colleagues in an email seen by the paper.Borrell, a former Spanish foreign minister, suggested there was confusion about two separate reports – a confidential one intended for diplomats, and a second for the public that was released on Friday by the EU’s monitoring website, EU vs Disinfo. “There are two different publications,” he said. “Don’t make the mistake that the second one is the first one with a little bit of change.”His initial explanation did not convince all MEPs. Belgian liberal Hilde Vautmans said his first statement had not been complete and called on Borrell to release earlier drafts of the disinformation report.Nathalie Loiseau, a former career diplomat and now one of Emmanuel Macron’s closest allies in the European parliament, gave her backing to Borrell. She said the EEAS public report had been “impactful” and did not mince words. But she wanted to know why it failed to mention Chinese diplomats’ false claims about France, a key element thought to have been left out of the public report. A Chinese embassy website had claimed falsely that 80 French politicians had signed a statement using a racist slur to denigrate the head of the World Health Organization.Borrell replied that this case was not included because it was considered to fall into a different category, “bullying by a diplomatic mission”, rather than disinformation in open sources. He added that the case had been very widely reported by the media, “so we were not trying to hide anything”.The EU’s chief diplomat also told MEPs he first knew of the row when he read the newspapers last Friday. He criticised MEPs for attaching more weight to an apparently disgruntled member of staff who had leaked emails to the New York Times.The EU’s counter-propaganda unit, the East StratCom taskforce, was created in 2015 to counter Kremlin-backed disinformation after Russia’s annexation of Crimea. It has since expanded to cover disinformation targeted at the western Balkans and neighbouring countries. The coronavirus pandemic has given it a global focus, with reporting on China and Iran.While declining to reveal the extent of EU contacts with China, Borrell did not hide Beijing’s discontent, saying: “The Chinese were not happy. They were not happy at the beginning and they are still not happy now.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c9004c84679f79a978b858028ece90dc3f747681/77_0_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=28ef0284a4235efa83b18cd391f8ec5a","title":"have you participated in coronavirus medical trials","story":"We’d like to hear from those who have volunteered in medical trials related to coronavirusHuman trials for a coronavirus vaccine began last week, the latest stage in Oxford University’s race to find a formula which could end lockdown and save millions of lives.

The claim was also shared on Twitter, including by Lord Sugar. We’ve been asked to check this by lots of readers. This claim is false.”Lord Sugar later tweeted to say that he believed his earlier tweet to be “fake news”, but defended his decision to share it. He wrote: “I just passed it on.

In one of the poorest districts in Europe, a stronghold of the local mafia, there appears no light at the end of the tunnel despite Italy being set to begin its route out of lockdown from next week.Unemployment skyrocketed in the Zen – built in the 1960s as the city’s Zona Esione Nord and falling into dilapidation in the decades after – when retailers were forced to close in order to contain the spread of Covid-19.“It’s easy to say ‘stay at home’ when you have a spacious apartment and a job waiting for you when it’s all over,” says Rosi Pensato, 43, a Zen resident who is unemployed with four children to feed. “It’s easy to say we’re all in this together when your bank account will get you through the next several months. Put yourselves in our position. We were already poor before Covid-19, and at the end of it we’ll be even poorer.”Designed at the end of the 1960s by Italian architect Vittorio Gregotti, a key figure in 1970s postmodernism and architect of Barcelona’s 1992 Olympic stadium who died in March after contracting coronavirus, the Zen was inspired by the idea of a walled city. Alongside apartments, theatres and workspaces were planned but Gregotti’s dreams for a visionary quarter were soon dashed as many of the blocks were left unfinished and the neighbourhood transformed into a citadel of petty crime and one of the most formidable strongholds of the Cosa Nostra.“Many people living in the Zen get by in the grey economy,” says Ivano Abbruzzi, 48, president of Albero della Vita Foundation, an anti-poverty NGO that fights poverty in Italy’s most depressed areas. “Since the government-imposed lockdown, these people have been short on money and food. There are families that struggle to put dinner on the table, and whose kids – accustomed to eating their only meal at the school canteen – are in tears now that the schools have closed.”Since the quarantine, Rosi’s cupboard has often been empty. She, her unemployed husband and their four children are getting by on welfare benefits of about €500 a month.“I haven’t been ashamed to knock on my neighbour’s door and ask for some flour or pasta,” she says. “Our flat is very small and my kids play in 10 square metres. In such a small space, the days never end.”As Italy’s lockdown seems to be winding down, the inhabitants of the Zen are full of rage and desperation – an extreme example of some of Europe’s most destitute areas on the edge of a nervous breakdown.Many supermarkets near the Zen are being patrolled by police after attempted raids by some residents. In late March, a hamburger chain announced that it was suspending home delivery in the Zen after a driver was mugged there.“If the state doesn’t step in to help these families, the mafia will take its place,” says the mayor of Palermo, Leoluca Orlando, whose administration has already issued subsidies for 3,000 families in the city. “Mafia bosses are poised to capitalise on people’s needs and to stoke the fire of the crisis.”The shopping vouchers are however insufficient to cover all the families running out of cash. The brother of a Cosa Nostra boss was reported by the newspaper La Repubblica to be distributing food to the poor in the Zen and journalists have since not been welcome. Mafia lookouts on scooters provide surveillance when the police or other intruders enter the neighbourhood.Despite the lockdown, drug dealers await customers as Neapolitan pop music – Italy’s answer to gangsta rap – blasts out of apartment windows. Business is bad for them, too, but the vast profits made over the years will allow them to weather the storm.Caterina Santoro, 24, born and raised in the Zen, does not have such a cushion but because of the widespread crime in the district, continues to be perceived with prejudice. With three children, she and her husband live with her mother and brother. Her youngest child, two, suffers from a heart ailment. Because of the coronavirus emergency, all hospital checkups have been put on hold for the child.“People see us as criminals,’’ says Caterina. ‘‘They tend to forget that we are not all drug dealers or mafiosi. They forget how poor we are. In the best of times, my husband brings home €400 a month. I can’t even discuss the future. People here are having trouble feeding their kids.”The future in the Zen looks grim, a time bomb that could explode by year’s end as the recovery of retailers is less than certain.“The problem is Italy’s chronic inefficiency in combating poverty,” says Abbruzzi. “We were slow to react when the financial crisis of 2007-2008 hit, after which poverty trebled across the country. Experts now agree that the impact of the coronavirus crisis on the economy will be even worse. Once again, we are slow to respond. Just imagine the consequences in a neighbourhood like this.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4ee3c4b1300d0bb500c05cecfb481fb00b3968d4/0_161_4828_2897/master/4828.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=ae75c5215369659a0ee0904623c6098c","title":"was britain unprepared for a pandemic podcast","story":"As medics and carers report widespread shortages of protective equipment, the government is facing pressure to explain why it appears the UK went into a pandemic under-resourced.

Photograph: Alan BetsonCatholic schools that reward pupils who attend religious ceremonies are discriminating against non-Catholic pupils, the Workplace Relations Commission has found.In a ruling, the commission found that Yellow Furze primary school in Co Meath discriminated against an atheist pupil by rewarding his classmates who attended a First Communion choir ceremony with homework passes.The ruling is likely to have implications for Catholic schools – which make up 90 per cent of primary schools – in how they organise religious events and incentivise children to attend them.The mother of the child at the centre of the case said her son was upset after being “penalised” with homework for not attending the choir ceremony.Atheist familyShe argued that he did not have the option to take part in the ceremony as the family are atheist.“He came out of school crying,” said the boy’s mother, who declined to be named on the basis that it would identify her child.“On that day my son was the only child in the class who was not participating. He was also the only non-Catholic child in his class. We are atheist and this is not a choice that is open to him.”The school submitted in the hearing that the claim was “wholly unfounded” and said all children – regardless of their religion – were able to participate in the ceremony.As a Catholic school, it said it enjoyed a proud tradition of participating in religious ceremonies and that music was an integral part of this.It added that its code of behaviour provided that all children who participate in extra-curricular activities or events on behalf of the school will receive a “reward” for their doing so.The commission, however, found that there was prima facie evidence of discriminatory treatment under the Equal Status Acts towards the boy on grounds of religion.It also found that the parents were deeply hurt and upset by the treatment of the school to the point they have removed their boy from school.Review policiesBy maintaining it is appropriate to award a benefit to children to attend a religious ceremony, the commission found that the school “does not appreciate this action had an adverse effect on students who are not of a Catholic faith”.The commission awarded a sum of €5,000 in respect of discriminatory treatment and ordered the school to review its policies to ensure it complies with the provisions of the Equal Status Acts.A notice to this effect should also be placed in a prominent position within the school. The school did not respond to a request for comment to the finding on Thursday."},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

Photograph: Nick BradshawRichmond Park in Inchicore Dublin, home of St Patrick’s Athletic, is one of the most atmospheric grounds in League of Ireland football. Supporters approach it down a slope recessed from the houses around it and past the mural which is the club’s logo “ní neart go cur le chéile” (there is no strength without unity).At this time of year the League of Ireland would normally be a third of the way through the season, but the nets are tied up and the pitch looks brown in places from the recent spell of dry weather.In the shop where club gear, half-time tea and coffees are sold and after-match interviews are conducted, neat bags are laid out on the floor filled with non-perishable food items such as pastas, rice, tea bags, bolognese sauces and tins of beans.Laid offThe food has been sourced from Food Cloud, the not-for-profit organisation that supplies charities with unsold supermarket food. There have also been donations from local businesses, but demand is such “that it is not nearly enough”, says St Patrick’s Athletic community officer David Morrissey.The food is being distributed by volunteers to families in the Inchicore area. It is an initiative by the club, the Inchicore-based addiction services charity, Frontline Make Change, and the Dublin South City Partnership through the Kilmainham-Inchicore Network.So far 80 families in the area have asked for help. These include families where a householder has been laid off and are struggling to pay the bills, says Aoife Hannon of the network.Many families of children with special needs depend on the local schools for support with meals. Others are elderly people who are trapped in their homes by the pandemic.Social welfare payments are now being paid on a biweekly rather than weekly basis and some families are struggling to budget.Mr Morrissey approached the board of St Patrick’s Athletic and its owner, real estate developer, Garrett Kelleher, about using Richmond Park as a community hub during the pandemic. They readily agreed.“We are not trying to solve the world’s problems, but we are trying to supply people a couple of days before money might come in with the basics. If people are stretched, we can supply them with a couple of breakfasts and dinners,” he says.He is hoping that local people will bring non-perishable goods for distribution locally to Richmond Park on Saturday between 12pm and 2pm, and on Monday and Tuesday between 2pm and 4pm.He says demand is far greater than supply at present and, if local people and businesses can help, more people can be helped more often.Besides, as he points out, the club is sharing in the struggles of many people locally. Last week, St Patrick’s Athletic announced that they were laying off all their playing staff and coaches.League of Ireland football clubs have always struggled financially, but this is a crisis of a different magnitude when all of football is mired in uncertainty and no money is coming in.Bigger problemsSt Patrick’s Athletic director of football Ger O’Brien is one of the volunteers who turns up to distribute the food to local people, many of whom he knows personally.He says the situation facing footballers is no different to those facing so many others. His own partner had to close down her hair salon last month and lay off nine staff.He maintains St Patrick’s Athletic have aspirations to be more than a football club – they want to be a part of the regeneration of an area which has had more than its fair share of reverses over the years.“There are bigger problems than football,” he says, “but we are looking forward to having Inchicore full of supporters again.

The plan is also expected to be subject to ongoing changes over the summer months, with inidual measures open to alteration or reversal. However, there is pressure from Ministers to ease the cocooning recommendations for the over-70s and widen the 2km travel restriction. Some TDs have also called for hardware and DIY shops to reopen.The National Public Health Emergency Team will make a recommendation to Cabinet on Friday on what Taoiseach Leo Varadkar called a “road map to reopen Ireland”. The Government will also announce an overall package of supports to go in tandem with the easing of restrictions. Mr Varadkar said easing restrictions would depend on the progress of Covid-19, along with healthcare capacity and resilience, testing and contact-tracing capacity, the ability to shield at risk groups and the risk of secondary morbidity. He said the lifting of restrictions would be done in “a stepwise, tiered manner”. He also added: “Restrictions may have to be reintroduced if it looks like the virus is going to surge back.”It is expected that the existing restrictions will largely remain in place for a number of weeks, expected to be a fortnight, past their initial May 5th expiry date. At a briefing for Ministers on Thursday, chief medical officer Tony Holohan said the plan would be reviewed in “three-week cycles”. Numerous Ministers pressed for restrictions on those over 70 to be eased. Dr Holohan said it was up to Government to make decisions, with Ministers privately acknowledging they may have to erge from medical advice at some point. Cabinet sources said the isions between Ministers who want to ease restrictions relatively quickly and those who were cautious has become more pronounced, with one predicting the meeting on Friday “may not be all plain sailing”. The initial stages of the plan envisage allowing the over-70s out for a walk on a “no-contact” basis, with sources previously suggesting others may be asked to stay at home while “cocooners” are out. Meanwhile, there was no agreement reached in talks on Thursday on a proposed new national safety protocol to apply in workplaces. However, it is understood that trade unions considered a draft protocol, prepared by Government officials and presented in recent days, to fall far short of what was needed.It is understood that detailed guidance will be given for workplaces in areas like social distancing and cleaning protocols as well as around canteens and other gathering places. Office workers will be encouraged to work from home, and flexible working hours will also be encouraged when offices return to avoid overcrowding on public transport.Builders hope to restart the construction industry by picking up work in almost complete sites, before moving to outdoor work on sites such as housing estates and then moving to new estates.Businesses and manufacturing are expected to open in the early stages of the plan if they adhere to social distancing and health rules.The Health and Safety Authority and environmental protection officers from councils are understood to be tasked with ensuring such requirements are met.Separately, Minister for Justice Charlie Flanagan has said An Garda Síochána is planning an “extensive” operation this bank holiday weekend to ensure that the public adhere to travel restrictions.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4242314.1588280674!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"miriam lord it s kerry v china as the healy raes look to the east","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDanny Healy-Rae arrives at Leinster House for Thursday  afternoon’s Dáil session. Photograph:  Crispin RodwellThere is more than a touch of the Skibbereen Eagle about Danny Healy-Rae this weather as he continues to keep a beady eye on China from his eyrie in Dáil Éireann.Or Buses-Buses Healy-Rae, as we later discovered. This is what they call him in the United Nations.Both his contributions to the coronavirus debate this month have included a cut at the Chinese and their handling of the viral outbreak. The first one was at the beginning of April, when he thanked the Government and chief medical officer Tony Holohan for their “massive” work. But he wasn’t so keen on the medical equipment which came our way from the Orient.“I see that the Taoiseach thanked the Chinese for the stuff that we need – the PPE stuff that we need. I just want to say I would thank the Chinese as well if they had kept their virus. We wouldn’t need the gowns and the equipment that we are looking for now if that had happened.”Four weeks on in the Dáil and Buses-Buses Healy-Rae’s opinion hasn’t changed one bit.He wanted the Taoiseach to explain why he isn’t demanding an investigation “into how and when this virus actually began in China”.Does he not want to know the answer? All the people who have suffered as a result of it certainly want to know.“This virus was in China long before January 20,” he told Leo Varadkar.“Some of the PPE stuff that ye paid for, and went out of your way to thank them publicly for, was given to them by the Italians in early December. I’m asking you now not to buy another bottle for to contain this virus from the Chinese until we know what’s the truth.”Brows furrowed all on sides.“Because the people are entitled to the truth and I am calling on the United Nations to carry out an international investigation into what happened because we need to know,” said Healy-Rae, channelling the Skibbereen Eagle’s celebrated 1898 editorial warning the land-hungry Czar of Russia that the newspaper was onto his caper.The Taoiseach did not agree to carry this message to New York, probably because Ireland is still trying to win a seat on the UN Security Council, so he won’t want to be making any waves in diplomatic circles at the moment.Huge relief in Beijing.The TD for Kerry did not use one of his two buses to travel from the Kingdom with his brother Michael on Thursday. The Healy-Raes were the RIG’s (Rural Independents Group) two designated representatives at this week’s sole sitting of the House.Later in the afternoon, both men addressed the economic consequences of the Covid-19 crisis, particularly as it affects their county.In a change to their normal chamber format, Michael sat near his usual berth in the front of the last section opposite the Government benches while Danny, who usually sits next to him, was socially distanced to a pew two rows back and across the aisle in a different section. So they couldn’t discuss things among themselves as they tend to do before and during contributions.Michael modestly averred that while he is “very glad that Kerry is the tourism capital not just of Ireland but of the western world”, this sector has been severely impacted by the shutdown. He hoped the Government can come up with sensible proposals to help businesses and workers to keep going.There are many jobs people can still do without falling foul of the current restrictions.“I’m not being smart about social distancing” but if somebody wants social isolation “they should go out and work on a digger”. Nobody would get near them on a building site.Danny would know all about that. He runs a thriving plant hire business. Last year it recorded an 85 per cent increase in post-tax profits to €444,227.Michael was also worried about the situation facing coach companies. He knows of some operators in Kerry who bought and registered new vehicles at the beginning but they haven’t done a mile on a road. Their value will drop by €30,000 next year without having been driven.His brother Danny was in full agreement. He is fully up to speed on this too.“There’s a yard of buses parked in Killarney. ’Twould cost millions of euros to fund what’s gone into that yard and they’re all parked. But every one of those buses had a driver, and maybe two drivers, and all of those drivers now are not getting paid a cent. They are being left behind. It’s wrong, I’m sorry to say . . .” he boomed, getting quite worked up.But the Ceann Comhairle put a halt to his gallop because he was over time.As Danny was still thanking Seán Ó Fearghaíl for his forbearance, his brother rose to make a very important point of order.“I have to declare through the ethics that you’re supposed to declare a possible conflict with some of the – through a connected person, you’re supposed to mention that and I know I’m doing that and . . .”But where was Danny? Two rows and the width of an aisle above him. Michael turned around quickly and shot an urgent look up along the benches towards his brother. “And . . ?” he prompted.Danny, still on his feet, sounded flustered. Across the floor and holding the fort, Minister for Enterprise Heather Humphreys looked absolutely fascinated.“I-I-I’m sorry, I must, eh . . .” stuttered Danny.Michael jumped in. “We have to declare, yeah.”“I have two buses, honestly, that’s what I have and, and, and . . .”Two buses. Just the two, confided Buses-Buses Healy-Rae, all of a dither.So Michael chimed in from below for the benefit of the Chair, who was doing his best but failing to keep a straight face. “And it’s just doing the thing properly like, you have to declare . . .”Then Buses-Buses cut loose and decided he was going for full disclosure (apart from the farming, the lands, the shares and the plant hire business).“And of course, I have a pub like all the others that are closed . . .”“We know that, we heard about it,” chortled the Ceann Comhairle. “A good one too, by all accounts.”“And there needs to be a roadmap,” said Buses-Buses, finding his voice again having declared the two coaches and the pub.“And do you have a hotel as well?” wondered Heather, who couldn’t stop laughing.“There needs to be a road map, Minister, for publicans and their likes all around the country because it looks like that many of them won’t be reopening, but for the ones that will try to there needs to be a roadmap put in place and they need to be told when, roughly, they will get to open their doors again,” cried Healy-Rae, ignoring the Minister.“I’m sure they will reopen in Kilgarvan anyway,” soothed Ó Fearghaíl.That’s for sure.Otherwise Buses-Buses Healy-Rae will take it all the way to the United Nations."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4241903.1588275015!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"roadmap to reopen ireland varadkar says five criteria at play flights may resume in august","story":"An Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has warned that the easement of the current Covid-19 restrictions will be slow and gradual, but that a roadmap to reopen Ireland is being developed.

However, he said the changes to the current restrictions will be made every two to four weeks and will not happen as fast as the restrictions were put in place.And he warned that restrictions may have to be reintroduced “if it looks like the virus is going to surge back”.Speaking during a sitting of the Dáil on Thursday, Mr Varadkar also raised the prospect of commercial flights recommencing in August and rejected claims the State was favouring carriers rather than consumers on flight refunds.“I want to see Ryanair and Aer Lingus operate some time later in the summer, possibly August, and I would not like to be in a situation whereby we have to bail out airlines because they have failed,” he said.The Dublin South West TD criticised the Government for “allowing airlines off the hook” and said Aer Lingus should be re-nationalised.He said the Government “wants the airlines to be able to keep cash and issue vouchers instead, which is effectively bailing out the airlines with consumers’ money”.The Taoiseach told him that whether carriers are publicly or privately owned “is not my major concern”.Earlier Mr Varadkar called a special briefing with Chief Medical Officer Tony Holohan for Cabinet members on Thursday morning. Many ministers relayed their concerns about restrictions but it is understood Dr Holohan suggested there will be no major moves in easing restrictions when the current period of lockdown ends of May 5th. The Cabinet is to meet at 3pm on Friday to sign off on the exit plan from the lockdown.Mr Varadkar s said gardaí and the PSNI need to co-operate to enforce movement restrictions on both sides of the Border, rather then the Government amending regulations to deal with day trippers. It emerged that emergency legislation restricting movement to 2km from home did not cover visitors from the North unless they stayed overnight.Mr Varadkar told the Dáil he had consulted the Attorney General and no changes to emergency legislation are needed.“Unless we prohibit people crossing the border, which we are just not going to do, what is required is co-operation,” he said, adding that An Garda and the PSNI need to co-operate to enforce laws on both side of the border.Five criteriaIn the Dáil Mr Varadkar identified five criteria for future decision making on restrictions - the progress of Covid-19 along with healthcare capacity and resilience testing and contact tracing capacity the ability to shield at risk groups and the risk of secondary morbidity.He said that they will find a pathway out of the tunnel but “we are still in the tunnel and have some distance to go.”Speaking in the Dáil the Taoiseach also expressed concern that people who need medical help are not seeking it. Mr Varadkar said “cancer hasn’t gone away”.He said Ireland was now in sixth place in the world for testing per head of population and 160,000 tests had been carried out.Personal protective equipment was now being delivered regularly to nursing homes but there were concerns that in homes with no Covid-19 cases there was a risk that someone could bring it in who was doing the testing.Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin said here is widespread unease about the manner in which some decisions are being taken, and he said that there had to be more clarity on how policies are decided.Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald said it was unfortunate that Government Ministers were thinking out loud and kiteflying and setting out May 5th as a red letter day and then accusing them of being complacent.Ms McDonald said testing of up to 100,000 a week was necessary while the Taoiseach said that 100,000 was not a target but testing would take place as necessary.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4238990.1587996510!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"it is not clear if green party s emissions reduction target is feasible","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tRenewable gas has great potential in displacing oil and natural gas for heating and transport and struggles to have its role recognised.The Green Party has announced that a red line for entering into government is a commitment to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by at least 7 per cent each year to 2030. While climate science underpins this call for rapid and immediate decarbonisation, research areas such as energy systems analysis help us to understand what pathways might make this formidable challenge achievable. Our analysis shows emissions from the energy system can be reduced at this level, and that this could bring significant benefits to society, for health and wellbeing, jobs and economic growth at this critical time. However, meeting the target would require far-reaching and transformative changes in energy technologies, infrastructure and behaviour. Crucially, there are also key unanswered questions on the level of emissions reductions that can be met from agriculture. Ireland releases about 60 million tonnes of greenhouse gases each year, crudely broken down into 40 million tonnes from energy (electricity, heat and transport) and 20 million tonnes from agriculture. Ireland’s climate policy ambition, encapsulated in the 2019 Climate Action Plan, is to reduce total greenhouse-gas emissions to about 45 million tonnes in 2030 (equivalent to an annual average reduction of 3 per cent) by 2030, with average annual emissions reductions of 4 per cent and 1 per cent from energy and agriculture respectively. These emissions reductions would be met, according to the climate plan, with targets for energy efficiency (including retrofitting half a million homes), electric vehicles (nearly one million EVs), electric heating (more than 600,000 heat pumps), and renewable electricity (70 per cent of electricity from renewable sources) by 2030. The Green Party strategy is to more than double these emissions reductions. It is not clear, however, whether the additional measures they have set forth are sufficient to meet the overall target. Focusing on actions needed in the energy system, which represents about two-thirds of today’s greenhouse gases, a 7 per cent annual fall in emissions would mean a more than halving in a decade, from close to 40 million tonnes now to less than 18 million tonnes in 2030, a drop of 22 million tonnes. The Government’s Climate Action Plan announced last year aims to deliver reductions of 14 million tonnes from energy by 2030. Where might these additional savings come from over and above the actions in that plan? Scenario analysis using energy systems modelling tools suggests cost-effective measures in electricity, transport and heat which could deliver the savings. Electricity generationOur analysis suggests electricity generation, currently responsible for about one quarter of energy-related emissions, would need to decarbonise the fastest. Ireland has a strong foundation for this to take place, comprising successful policy development since the mid-1990s, world-leading expertise in electricity grid integration of variable renewable resources and a clear collective public-private focus on meeting the targets set. Options for emissions savings over and above those outlined in the Climate Action Plan could include carbon capture and storage Transport, which is currently almost totally fuelled by imported oil and responsible for about 40 per cent of energy-related emissions, can be the next most significant source of emissions savings. This level of ambition also is broadly in line with the ambition in the action plan. Achieving this ambition requires technological and demand measures across passenger and freight transport – not only electric cars but biofuel and biogas use in road freight and shipping. It would also require a shift in travel patterns. The Green Party’s desire to massively increase funding for walking, cycling and public transport, and to take urban development seriously, is necessary to meaningfully tackle transport emissions. The scale of the challenge here should not be underestimated: the dramatic fall in traffic we have seen as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic will likely only lead to a reduction in energy-related emission of 5 per cent in 2020. The key finding from our analysis indicates we can seek increased ambition relative to the action plan in two areas: decarbonising heating and reducing energy demand. This would require us to stop burning coal and peat in our homes, to undertake an unprecedented energy efficiency retrofitting programme, and to almost eliminate oil from our heating systems, using instead efficient heat pumps running on electricity as well as sustainable biomass. In industry, a switch from oil to renewables and natural gas could also bring significant savings. AgricultureHowever, key questions surround what can be achieved from agriculture, which accounts for the remaining 20 million tonnes of emissions. Unless emissions from agriculture are reduced much faster than what is envisaged in the plan, energy-related emissions will have to be reduced by more than 80 per cent (or 14 per cent per annum) by 2030 to achieve the overall 7 per cent reduction target. Increasing ambition beyond the plan also requires further deliberations on some of the less-discussed decarbonisation options. There is a level of political consensus regarding the need for energy efficiency, electrification of heat and transport and increased use of renewable electricity. Using renewable fuels directly for heating and transport comes through in our analysis and here there is less consensus. The biofuels obligation is arguably our most effective policy measure in our attempts to meet our mandatory emissions reduction targets but rarely acknowledged for the role it plays. Renewable gas has great potential in reducing agricultural emissions and also displacing oil and natural gas for heating and transport and struggles to have its role recognised. Looking beyond 2030 on a path to the longer-term goal of fully decarbonising the energy system, new technologies and fuel chains such as carbon capture and storage and hydrogen will need to be considered. While decarbonisation is not free, it can be done in a way to improve society and achieve multiple other aims, including health, bioersity and creating liveable towns and cities. For example, deep home energy efficiency retrofits will create jobs, and by preventing the need to burn solid fuel, which is responsible for very significant air pollution in Ireland, save more than 1,500 premature deaths each year. Decarbonisation measures can also play a central role in the economic stimulus needed in the months and years to come. A plan to decarbonise will also need to be flexible: changes will occur in the future, technology costs will change more than expected, sudden events will occur, economic fortunes will change. It’s vital that implementation and progress of decarbonisation is properly monitored and adapted. Even though these payoffs are promising, targets mean nothing unless they are backed by policies. Not all the targets in the action plan have clear policy measures associated with them to ensure delivery. It is already formidably challenging, and according to modelling from the Environmental Protection Agency, will not be delivered with existing policies. Ireland is on track to increasing emissions by about 0.4 per cent annually. Carbon budgetsIt is a matter of urgency to put legislation in place to commit to legally-binding carbon budgets to give a strong signal to the economy and to hold stakeholders accountable. In 2015, Ireland committed to the Paris Agreement, to limit global warming to 2 degrees above pre-industrial temperatures. Climate science tells us that what matters for global warming is not what we emit in the distant future, but the cumulative amount: every tonne matters. The more we emit now, the more expensive technologies we will have to rely on in the future to remove those emissions. Whatever ambition is ultimately chosen as government formation progresses, it cannot be delivered without the necessary investment supports, infrastructure development, societal partnership and political leadership.

Photograph: Robin UtrechtEchoes WireBarcroft Media via GettyAccording to the official Dutch count, there have been 4,795 coronavirus deaths in the Netherlands. This is an underestimate: it only includes people who tested positive, and mortality data suggests actual deaths are 40 per cent higher. It also disguises deep regional differences.In the worst-hit region of North Brabant in the south, twice as many people died between March 16th and April 5th, 2020, than in the same period last year. But in the northern region of Groningen, home to a university city the size of Cork, deaths were just 4 per cent higher in the same period.What can explain this stark difference in a country half the size of Ireland that is one of the most densely populated in the world?The man held partly responsible is Prof\u0026nbspAlex Friedrich, a virologist and head of microbiology and infection control at\u0026nbspthe University Medical Center Groningen (UMCG), the major hub of medical care in the northern Netherlands.Friedrich announced on March 19th that the north was departing from national Dutch policy. While the public health agency would be restricting testing to only severe and priority cases, he announced the north would follow\u0026nbspthe World Health Organisation’s advice: “test test test”.\u0026nbsp“In the Netherlands, in our country, they said that diagnostics is interesting for statistics but not important for the fight against the disease. There I strongly disagree,” Friedrich told The .The UMCG set up a test centre on its grounds, hired medical students for extra staff, and asked the local health authorities to direct people there for screening.\u0026nbsp“We just did it,” Friedrich recalled. “You save lives by doing diagnostics. Proper diagnostics, case tracing, information, is one of the strongest weapons we have to fight the virus.”International insightCrucial to the decision-making was an international perspective. Friedrich did not rely on the limited academic studies available on the new virus, but directly telephoned doctors in Italy to ask what they were seeing in their patients.He learned they were spending twice as long in intensive care than Dutch national modelling accounted for, and he adapted the hospital’s plans accordingly. Friedrich maintains that learning from the experience of other countries is crucial to fighting the pandemic.This insight was important, but so was luck.School holidays in the Netherlands are staggered. The north had theirs a week earlier than the rest of the country. It meant that Dutch people from the south and west were much more likely to bring coronavirus home from skiing holidays in Austria and Italy, as they travelled when outbreaks there were more widespread. This was compounded by the mass public events of carnival season, which are held in the south but not the north.This meant when the Dutch government finally began banning public events on March 10th, it was too late for Brabant, but not for Groningen, according to Friedrich.“We talked to the public health service and said we are going to do something different from the national way,” he recalled.A few initial detected cases in Groningen were health workers who had travelled abroad. But soon\u0026nbsptests were discovering Covid-19 in health workers who had travelled only to other regions of the Netherlands.“We realised there was no difference anymore between the south and the west of the Netherlands and northern Italy. So we told our staff: you are not allowed to go outside our region, and if you do so you cannot come to work. You have to stay at home for two weeks,” Friedrich said.With 15,000 staff and as the central healthcare node for the whole region, the UMCG was big enough to set policy for the wider north. According to Friedrich, the decisive intervention was screening healthworkers, whether or not they had symptoms. A fifth of those who tested positive never developed any.“In healthcare institutions, 10, 20 or 30 people can be infected by just one person,” Friedrich said. “In other parts of the country where the numbers are still high, I suspect it is outbreaks in healthcare institutions and long-term care that are the major drivers of the epidemic.”‘Group immunity’Though Friedrich has been part of the outbreak management team that co-ordinates the Dutch response to the crisis, he is critical of aspects of national strategy.On March 16th prime minister Mark Rutte announced that the Netherlands would build “group immunity” by allowing the virus to roam the population in a controlled manner. The government subsequently walked back from this, but the policy still has its adherents.Friedrich is not one of them.“Herd immunity can never be a public health strategy. It can never be controlled, and it means people will die, and if you are not very careful a lot of people will die,” Friedrich said.“It’s not a law that we’re all going to get infected. It’s just the consequences of our insufficient action to protect people.”He has doubts about whether survivors of the disease even reliably built immunity. “Immunity does not happen automatically,” Friedrich said. “It might be very local, in the nose or throat. But then you could swallow the virus, and get an infection in your gut.”Delaying the spread gives doctors and scientists time to understand the disease and develop more effective treatments, which Friedrich believes will emerge more quickly than a vaccine.“For a vaccination you need to produce it for all the billions of people on the planet, which takes time, and you have to administer it,” he explained.“It’s not like a therapy that you give to a sick person: there, you might take into account there are side effects, but consider them acceptable because you have to save a life. If you are giving a vaccination to healthy people all over the world, you need to be very, very sure that this is safe.”His focus now is preparing for the winter, the worst season for respiratory infections. Friedrich expects it to bring a wave of infection that was worse than the first.“We need personal protective equipment, we need more intensive care beds, we need more healthcare staff, we need more diagnostics in all hospitals in the country,” Friedrich said.“You cannot expect things will go back to normal, thinking that normal is the world as it was before February. That is not really realistic. We have to change so that we can handle this.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4242208.1588271612!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit eu tells uk it must set out plans for northern ireland customs checks","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tEU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier: the commission told member states that the Northern Ireland protocol was the biggest challenge in implementing the withdrawal agreement. Photograph: Olivier MatthysPool via ReutersEuropean Union officials have told Britain it must set out its plans for customs and other checks under the Northern Ireland protocol, as Northern business representatives urged Westminster to offer more clarity.

The exchanges in the specialised committee now urgently need to be followed up by tangible measures,” it said.Earlier, the commission told member states that the Northern Ireland protocol was the biggest challenge in implementing the withdrawal agreement governing Britain’s exit from the EU. In a technical note seen by The , the commission said the most politically sensitive issue required the most extensive adaptations by businesses and needed the most timely preparation.“To avoid disruptions of business activity, the United Kingdom should urgently engage with the business community in Northern Ireland, as businesses must be able to prepare for the new requirements well in advance. The commission services are available to provide any assistance that may be required,” the note says.“The commission expects the United Kingdom to provide the requested details, and detailed timelines, on the implementation measures it intends to take as a matter of urgency. The commission also expects the United Kingdom to enter into technical implementation discussions with the relevant commission services immediately.”Thursday’s meeting, which was conducted virtually, was co-chaired by officials from Britain and the European Commission and attended by Irish and Northern Irish officials and representatives from a number of other member states.“The UK was clear that our approach at all times will be focused on protecting the BelfastGood Friday Agreement and gains of the peace process, and on preserving Northern Ireland’s place in the UK. UK officials reaffirmed our commitment to complying with our legal obligations under the protocol, just as we expect the EU to comply with theirs,” the British government said in a statement.MPs on the Northern Ireland Affairs committee on Thursday heard calls from business, farming and retail representatives in the North for more clarity about how Britain plans to implement the protocol.Aodhan Connolly of the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium said the details needed to be pinned down and businesses needed to hear how the cost of extra paperwork would be mitigated.“If we don’t have those mitigations there is a simple equation. If the new costs because of this protocol are higher than the profit margin, either the product or the business model becomes unviable.

Photograph: Chris BerginReutersThe devastating impact of coronavirus on the US economy was laid bare by new figures on Thursday which showed that 30 million people have filed for unemployment benefits in the past six weeks.The department of labour reported 3.8 million new applications for unemployment benefits in the week ended April 24th, as businesses across the country shut down in the face of the global pandemic.The jobless claims were announced a day after GDP figures showed that the US economy shrunk by 4.8 per cent in the first three months of the year as the pandemic began to shut businesses in March.A much larger contraction is expected in the second quarter of the year, as the full impact of the collapse of much of the US economy is registered.The dire economic figures were published amid continuing debate in the US about reopening the economy in the face of a pandemic that has killed more than 60,000 people across America.ExpireSeveral states with stay-at-home orders that were due to expire on Thursday were expected to begin lifting restrictions from Friday. In Texas, the governor is permitting restaurants, cinemas and museums to reopen with 25 per cent capacity. Other states including Maine and Alabama were also poised to permit some businesses to resume limited activity. \u0026nbspBut the governor of California was said to be considering closing beaches following widespread concern over pictures of packed beaches in the Los Angeles area last weekend.Speaking in the White House, New Jersey’s governor Phil Murphy – the latest governor to meet with Mr Trump in recent days – said that the financial hit to his state could be between $20 billion and $30 billion, as he pleaded for federal aid.Senior Republicans – including Mr Trump and Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell – have questioned whether the federal government should bail out states, as discussion turns to another economic rescue plan on Capitol Hill.Protective maskMeanwhile, following widespread criticism for not wearing a protective mask during a visit to the Mayo Clinic on Tuesday, vice-president Mike Pence donned a mask as he toured a GM factory in his home state of Indiana on Thursday which has begun making ventilators.“You’re making a difference for America,” Mr Pence told one employee as he toured the floor.Mr Trump, who has not left the White House in several months, has indicated he may travel outside the capital next week, with an event scheduled in Arizona on Tuesday, followed by a possible trip to Ohio.In an interview with Reuters, Mr Trump also said that he believes that China “will do anything it can” to make him lose November’s presidential election. He said he had “a lot” of options to punish China, which he has consistently blamed as the source of the coronavirus.“There are many things I can do.

The other day I found myself supervising work on phonics, physics, fractions and French - simultaneously. Despite my 15 years as a teacher and headmaster, this proved challenging, so I can only imagine how difficult this might be for others.Making the switch from classroom to kitchen table has been easier for my girls than most: they’ve plenty of space and resources at home, their schools have been quick to adjust the workset as circumstances demand. Both their parents have the benefit of flexibility allowing us to adapt our work to help with home-schooling.This clearly isn’t going to be the case for many others. A recent survey of teachers suggested that only around a third of children were engaging with the work set by their school. Even the strictest and most successful of them – like my old one Bedford Free School – are finding that engagement sinks well below 100 per cent. Inevitably, it will be those children who most need to work who are not doing it.This won’t just be because of laziness. Parents still have day jobs to do, and it is vital that they continue with these and provide for their families. Many won’t have the space or resources to do the tasks set with ease. And despite valiant efforts by the teaching profession, the sudden switch to remote learning inevitably means that the effectiveness of approaches will be extremely variable within and between schools, to say the least.It is still very early days too soon to reach firm conclusions about what this means for the nation’s children. However, several issues are worth considering now in order that we can plan for them.First of all, the achievement gaps in education are likely to get even wider: between pupils whose families can support their learning now, and those who can’t between well-funded private schools and the more constrained state sector and between schools with strong cultures of learning, and those without.Helping pupils to catch up - both before and when they come back to school - is a massive challenge. More than ever, we need to rally round our nation’s children and help in their learning. And we need as many kids back in school as soon as is safely possible.Let’s be clear – school sites have closed, not schools. Staff have endeavoured to support their pupils remotely, in a pastoral, as well as an academic, capacity. However, this is an exhausting second-best to looking after and educating them in person. For the purposes of education and wellbeing, and to enable more parents to get back to work, the government should announce now when and how they expect more children to return to school.The closure of school sites happened with minimal notice, causing a logistical nightmare for everyone involved. This was excusable given the circumstances, but reopening schools needn’t be like this. Heads and teachers need time to prepare, and parents and pupils need to know what’s coming too.How do we deploy school staff to get as many kids as possible back to school safely? Only have some year groups back? Run two school days in one so we can allow for some distancing – say 8am to 1pm, and 2pm to 7pm? Bring ex-teachers like me back into the classroom to bolster adult numbers? Recruit a volunteer army? Are we taking temperatures at the school gate? Instead of pupils moving from lesson-to-lesson, should we keep their classes in one place and move teachers to them?Finally, we need to learn from this crisis to prepare for future ones more effectively. We should ask where technology improved things, and where it made them harder. Anecdotally, lower-tech approaches seem to have had the best engagement, but proper analysis is vital here.And how do we future-proof our schools to make them more pandemic-proof? Independent schools, with their larger budgets and smaller classes, have an obvious advantagehere. Do we need to upgrade the state school estate over time to make it less virus-friendly? Develop a reserve pool of teachers-in-standby? If we can find money for the NHS to deal with pandemics, should we do the same for our schools?Regardless of the above, in the strange new world of the Covid-classroom it’s already clear that many parents have discovered how hard teaching is, and have a newfound respect for the profession. And children have been reminded of the many things about school they miss.My girls can’t wait to get back – not just because they want a change of teachers – and I’m sure they’re not alone. We now have a vital opportunity to build on this, bring people together, and make our schools even better in future.

Now there are “Captains” Harry, Tobias and Frank: a band of children who have been so inspired by the 100-year-old’s efforts to raise money for the NHS that they have taken on their own physical challenges.Frank Mills, a 6-year-old from Bristol has raised an extraordinary £250,000 in a fortnight for NHS Charities Together after watching Captain Moore do his sponsored walks on the television. Frank has spina bifida and finds walking difficult, and usually gets around with a frame or wheelchair. He decided to walk 10 metres a day during lockdown, hoping to raise £99 to reflect Captain Moore’s then age. Frank has overshot that goal by 2,611 times, and has currently raised £258,460 from over 16,000 supporters.“He doesn\u0027t understand how amazing it is”, says his mother Janet. “At school they’ve learnt numbers up to a hundred, but past that he has no concept of how big it is.”Frank has a lot of experience with the NHS: he spent the first five months of his life in neonatal intensive care after being born at just 25 weeks. Since then he has had several surgeries on his legs and head. Despite how traumatic this experience could have been, he has generally very positive experiences of going to hospital, says Janet, and every time the family drives past Bristol Children’s Hospital he calls out “That’s my hospital!”“He just wouldn’t be here without them”, says Janet. Harry Ragless, also 6, has been so inspired by Captain Moore that his neighbours have dubbed him “Captain Harry”. Harry also has spina bifida, and usually spends 80 percent of his time in a wheelchair, but after watching Captain Moore push himself to walk, he too is stretching himself and using his walking frame on the family’s daily walk. He is joined by his parents and 2-year-old sister Sienna, who brings along her doll’s pushchair.Harry, who is otherwise a fan of dancing and pop group Little Mix, set out to raise £100. He has far overshot that goal by collecting £2,600 so far. The money will also be going to NHS Charities Together, like Captain Moore’s donations.“It’s good physio for him too, it’s a win-win because it keeps him active”, says Selina.Another young boy who is being named “Captain” is Tobias Weller, 9, from Sheffield. He has cerebral palsy and autism, so when lockdown began his mother Ruth Garbutt knew she had to create a routine to replace the physio he would usually get at school. They decided to do a morning walk of around 50 metres on his walking frame, which is the most he could do at the time. After a few days of this, Tobias saw Captain Moore on television and thought that he too could use the walks as an opportunity to raise money for charity. He chose to split it between Paces, the school he attends which caters for children with cerebral palsy, and Sheffield Children’s Hospital. So far, he has raised over £16,000.He regularly goes to this hospital for treatment, and has spent two weeks there recovering from surgeries. “He’s genuinely loved it”, says Ruth. “He always asks ‘When can I go for another sleepover at the hospital?’”The walks have gradually built up Tobias’s strength and can now walk 750 metres in one go. He has decided to in total walk the length of a marathon over the course of lockdown.He soon started to get the attention of the neighbours, who now come out to cheer him on every morning on his walk. “People wave as we go past the houses every single day”, says Ruth. “It’s spectacular.”To donate to Frank Mills\u0027s fundraising page click here, Harry Ragless\u0027s page is here and Tobias Weller\u0027s is here.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"fly tipping has soared 300 per cent lockdown university analysis","story":"Reports of fly-tipping in rural communities have soared by 300 percent during the lockdown period, analysis shows, as tip closures are blamed for contributing to the rise.Researchers from the universities of Southampton and Portsmouth studied data from local authorities across the country, about half of which have stopped or reduced their waste management services since March 23.The teams suggested that the surge in reports of illegal waste dumping could be linked to the closure of rubbish tips in parts of the UK, which has left many people with nowhere to take their unwanted goods.It comes after local councillors and MPs called for tips to become accessible again- with social distancing measures introduced- in order to curb the “reprehensible” levels of fly- tipping found in their areas over the last month.The researchers said there are few spaces left for the extra waste created by those undertaking DIY projects at home to be deposited, as charity shops remain closed. Professor Ian Williams, of the School of Engineering at the University of Southampton, said: “This pandemic has been a wake-up call to governments and the waste sector to ensure that supply chains and markets for recyclates are erse and resilient.“Our current waste management system will need to evolve to be resilient to the impacts of these rare, extreme, global events to create a successful circular economy.” David Renard, environment spokesman for the Local Government Association, added: “There are concerns that unscrupulous traders are exploiting social distancing rules in some areas to try and provide illegal waste disposal services.“Councils appreciate residents may have larger amounts of rubbish building up and they will continue to work hard to keep waste and recycling services working as effectively as possible.” The Government\u0027s latest guidance states that “where possible key waste sites should be maintained” by councils, as long as social distancing rules are adhered to and staffing levels are “adequate”.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"link obesity covid 19 now blatant ignore","story":"Being overweight is increasingly being seen as a risk factor in its own right, rather than as something which happens to be associated with other conditions Following the devastating outbreak of Covid-19 in China in December and January, details began to emerge of the risk factors predisposing sufferers to the more serious manifestations and to the risk of death. One review, published in The Lancet on 11 March, based on 191 patients in Wuhan, who had died or been discharged from hospital, together with findings from other studies, indicated that risks were greatest among older patients, especially males. Other factors included a history of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, respiratory disorders, immune suppression and cancer - in that order.Since then, further studies have indicated a high frequency of obese patients that have been admitted to Intensive Care Units with the virus and requiring invasive mechanical ventilation, and that the severity of the disease seems to increase with their Body Mass Index (weight in kg ided by height in metres squared).Obesity then emerged as a predictor of poor outcome. At this time, many experts assumed the link with obesity could be accounted for by the well-known association between obesity and type 2 diabetes. However a number of peer reviewed articles have since been published in respected journals from countries, especially in Europe and the USA, where obesity is highly prevalent.Findings from one study in France in particular, indicates that severe obesity (BMI of 35 or more) may be a risk factor for severe illness and invasive mechanical ventilation, independent of age and whether or not patients may be suffering from diabetes or hypertension.  Another study, from the United States, found a significant difference in admission and Intensive Care in patients, younger than 60 years of age, but with increased BMI. This raises questions as to what exactly it is about obesity that may predispose the body to severe viral impact. Our understanding of obesity has been changing in recent years along with the increased research effort that has accompanied its recognition as a burgeoning non-communicable public health disease around the world.Levels vary in relation to a range of associated disorders that may reduce the quality of life and life expectancy. It is a chronic disease, whose origins are influenced by the interplay of our genes, the environment, and human behaviour. In recent years we have become far more aware of the notion of \u0027obesogenic\u0027 environments in which our surroundings and living conditions, including the availability of fast food outlets and processed food, for example, can drive obesity.The experience of Covid-19 has shone a new light on obesity one that may cause us to rethink our current ideas about obesity and about the nature of fat as other than an inert tissue but rather as an organ in its own right with complex interactions with the immune system and with inflammatory processes.At a clinical level, what seems to be happening when patients experience rapid deterioration some 7-10 days after first showing symptoms of Covid-19 is a complex immunological reaction, in which the patient’s immune system attacks the patient’s own organs and in which there is significant vascular pathology with clotting causing organ damage and failure. Researchers from the University of Cork have recently outlined a concept to test that may help us understand the mechanism between obesity and the virus. They suggest that adipose tissue in obese people may itself have a more active role than has been assumed until now and that obesity may predispose patients to have greater shedding of virus particles, which then interact with the immune system to catastrophic effect.From a public health perspective these new insights raise the prospect of obesity being considered as a risk factor in its own right rather than as something which happens to be associated with other conditions, in particular diabetes. This should now stimulate new lines of research - and perhaps a change in attitude. The days of seeing obesity as a simple lifestyle choice could well be numbered.The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

But April 30 was the last day the guidance was in place and it has not been renewed. Mr Trump said that the core messages - encouraging Americans to still socially distance - have been included in new guidance explaining to states how they can open up in phases. The US president said he expects his old rules to “fade” away as inidual states begin to loosen their restrictions originally adopted to counter Covid-19. Each state, with separate projections for when its number of coronavirus cases will peak, is taking different approaches to reopening, though some have grouped together. Both Republican and Democrat governors have moved to reopen - a sign that it is not just Mr Trump’s party hoping to get Americans back to work as soon as possible. In Florida, restaurants and retail shops will be able to let customers inside at reduced capacity from Monday. In Colorado, some non-essential businesses have been allowed to reopen for curbside service this week after its stay-at-home order expired. But in California, the governor Gavin Newsom closed all beaches after photographs showed scores of sunbathers by the sea last weekend. In a separate move, the mayor of Los Angeles is now offering free coronavirus tests to all residents, becoming the first major US city to do so. In other areas, such as Washington DC or Arizona, stay-at-home orders remain in place until mid-May. More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"matt hancock confident meeting 100000 daily coronavirus testing","story":"Matt Hancock is “quite confident” he can meet his 100,000 tests a day target, allies said on Thursday night, as the number carried out surged to 81,611.The Health Secretary on Friday faces a “nail-biting finish”, according to an official, to see whether he delivered on his promise to boost testing by the end of April.Boris Johnson on Thursday announced the daily figure had risen by nearly 30,000 in 24 hours. Capacity is now at nearly 90,000 a day, a government source said.Another source said he would find out the “magic number” of how many tests were carried out on April 30 by Friday afternoon.Thursday\u0027s official tally marked a significant jump from the 52,429 of the day before.Nearly 20,000 more daily tests need to be conducted to meet the end of April target, a commitment made by Matt Hancock after the government faced heavy criticism for being too slow on testing.Asked about the latest surge of tests, a source close to Mr Hancock said the government has become “much better at matching demand to capacity.”“The strategy was - put all the things in place, build all the structures in the system, and ramp up in the end,” they said.The plan was called the “hockey stick” in the Department of Health, The  understands - referring to its sharp upward curve at the end of the long flat stick.The Health Secretary is expected to announce at Friday\u0027s press conference whether the target has been reached.One government official said: “It will be a nail-biting finish.” A Brexit-style countdown clock was installed in the Department of Health at the start of April, as hundreds of officials worked to meet the target.A week ago, Mr Hancock launched a drive to rapidly try and boost testing numbers, which still stood at just over 29,000 a day on Saturday.An online portal was set up to book tests, and eligibility was expanded to a wider list of key workers, and then over-65s, if they have symptoms of the virus.In a final push on Thursday, ministers tweeted out links to the government’s testing application page. Health minister Lord Bethell said: “We’ve covered a lot of ground in the last week” and urged people to check if they are eligible to apply for a test online.On Wednesday, 100,000 Covid-19 testing kits were posted out to randomly-selected people across England. Some hospitals began testing all patients, regardless of whether or not they had symptoms.Whitehall staff said Mr Hancock told them in a final meeting before the target day: Whatever happens tomorrow, we\u0027ve done what we needed to do.However, Chris Hopson, chief executive of NHS Providers, said: There are still health and care workers showing symptoms who are not able to get tests because we are still struggling with capacity and some of the testing centres are too far away.Speaking to BBC Breakfast he said NHS staff and patients would need to be tested regularly to control the spread of the virus once lockdown measures are eased.Mr Hopson said there would need to be between 110,00 and 120,000 Covid-19 tests a day for NHS staff to be tested once a week.Meanwhile, Sir Iain Duncan Smith said having more mobile testing centres set up is “vital”. So far only 17 mobile testing units have been set up, out of a planned 96.The former Conservative party leader told Chopper\u0027s Politics podcast that testing numbers had started to tick up because of the way the Armed Forces had worked hard in getting these testing centres close to where the need is, because you can\u0027t expect a care worker coming off shift to travel 20 miles or something to go and get tested.So having test centres in all the main areas is vital. And that\u0027s what they\u0027re rolling out now, which will increase and improve their ability to be able to meet their test because they\u0027re able to test many more than they\u0027re actually being tested. That\u0027s the key gap to close.On Thursday morning, Robert Buckland, the Justice Secretary, suggested the government may not hit its target. He told Sky News: Even if you don\u0027t hit the target on the due date the direction of travel is the most important thing.”He added: Even if we don\u0027t hit it, and it\u0027s probable that we won\u0027t, we will in the next few days hit that target.”On Thursday, Labour MPs called on Mr Hancock to resign if he does not meet his pledge.Diane Abbott said: “As this is literally a matter of life and death, of course he should resign if the target is not met.”Defence minister Johnny Mercer responded: “Not sure you should be going really hard on the \u0027resign\u0027 thing.”More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"military flypast message queen 150000 cards incredible captain","story":"In normal times, only Her Majesty the Queen gets a military flypast on her birthday. But these are not normal times and Tom Moore is no ordinary senior citizen. On Thursday, ‘Captain Tom’ - as the nation now knows him - turned 100 and the whole country wished him the happiest of birthdays. The Queen sent him a personal card and note, Boris Johnson recorded a video message of gratitude and Michael Ball, the star with whom he now has a Number One hit single, sang him ‘happy birthday’ live on BBC Breakfast television. The Army appointed Captain Tom an honorary colonel - although he still prefers Captain - and 150,000 birthday cards filled a nearby school hall where his grandson is a pupil. He is now odds-on to receive a knighthood.Thursday was Captain Tom’s big day. He had started out in lockdown with the modest ambition of raising £1,000 for the NHS by walking 100 laps of his daughter’s garden in the run up to his 100th birthday. You might just say his fundraising attempt caught the public imagination. By Thursday night, when the appeal finally closed, he had been sponsored to the extraordinary tune of £30 million. Almost 1.5 million people made donations.He didn’t just get one flypast either, but two. The first saw a Spitfire and Hurricane fly above his home in Marston Moretaine in Bedfordshire, in a tribute from the RAF and was followed a few hours later by two Army Air Corps helicopters, one of which contained a reporter and photographer from The . Captain Tom sat in his gazebo below as we waved down, the rain finally holding off as we flew past at 60 knots and 300 feet up.On the ground Captain Tom remained defiant in the face of the Covid-19 pandemic that wrought havoc, killing more than 25,000 and bringing the country (and the world) to a halt.“In the end we will get through,” he declared in one of many television interviews and messages, “We will win and people will recover from this invisible enemy that we have got.“Eventually we will win we always do win in this country. Sometimes it takes time but this time certainly we will win.”A day of celebrations began with Captain Tom issuing his own hand-written message sent out to his now army of supporters. It was typically modest, self-effacing stuff. “People keep saying what I have done is remarkable, however it’s what you have done for me which is remarkable,” he wrote. The response to his charity appeal, he said with some understatement (he is from Yorkshire after all), had put a “spring in my step”.He wrote: Reaching 100 is quite something. Reaching 100 with such interest in me and huge generosity from the public is very overwhelming… I felt a little frustrated and disappointed after I broke my hip and it knocked my confidence. However, the past three weeks have put a spring back in my step. I have renewed purpose and have thoroughly enjoyed every second of this exciting adventure, but I can\u0027t keep walking forever.”He signed off the message with only a little sign of fatigue. My legs may be tired, but my mind is racing and I\u0027m hoping to be back very soon with other ways in which I can help people, help others. Please always remember, \u0027Tomorrow Will Be A Good Day\u0027.His daughter Hannah Ingram-Moore said her life too had been transformed. “I want to look the great British and overseas public in the eye I sincerely want you to know that for all the joy, hope and inspiration my father has given you you have renergeised him and given him renewed purpose.”The day had begun with a police guard of honour at his door - in part to pay tribute but also to offer protection and to make sure any crowds that did turn up kept their social distance - and a telegram from the Queen offering her congratulations. The day before she had made him an honorary colonel of the Army Foundation College at Harrogate but Captain Tom preferred the lesser rank. “I’m still Captain Tom but if people choose to call me Colonel, well thank you very much,” he said in one interview.Speaking as a Spitfire and Hurricane from the RAF’s Battle of Britain Memorial Flight flew overhead his home, Captain Moore - who held the rank during his war service - reminded the watching world that the nation is in dark times now but had been before. He said he was “one of the few people here who have seen Hurricane and Spitfires flying past in anger” but added: “Fortunately today they are flying by in peace. That is one of the outstanding things.  In his own birthday message to Captain Tom, Mr Johnson posted a video message describing the centenarian as a “point of light”.The prime minister said: “Your heroic efforts have lifted the spirits of the entire nation. You’ve created a channel to enable millions to say a heartfelt tank you to the remarkable men and women in our NHS… By recognising them as a point of light. Captain Tom, that is exactly what you are - a point of light in all our lives.”The Archbishop of Canterbury tweeted his own birthday message:On his own Twitter account, Captain Tom thanked his supporters. “You are all magnificent,” he wrote, overwhelmed by the photographs of almost 150,000 cards lined up in his grandson’s school. When you see all those cards from children it really makes you, if you were a weeping person, it makes you weep,” he said, although Captain Tom is not a crier. “The work and thought all those children have put into their cards. But I can\u0027t promise to read them all.NHS Charities Together, which promised by the end of the week to have already distributed £20 million to good causes of the total so far raised, thanked him too. Its chief executive Ellie Orton said: Captain Tom\u0027s incredible dedication to our appeal has captured the hearts and minds of the UK, and rightly so - what he has achieved will make a lasting difference.”The praise and the awards didn’t end there. A keen cricket fan, he was also made an honorary member of the England cricket team by former England Captain Michael Vaughan, who said: “This is our way and our time to say thank you. The nation’s heartbeat. I can now officially call you an honorary member of the England Cricket team.” Joe Root, the current England captain, and his predecessors Sir Alastair Cook and Sir Andrew Strauss sent their own birthday greetings.Thursday too, he was awarded the Freedom of the City of London and in Marston Moretaine, the Royal Mail painted a postbox NHS blue in tribute and decorated it with a golden balloon.At precisely one second after 2.30pm the Army paid its tribute with a helicopter flypast compromising a Wildcat reconnaissance helicopter and an Apache attack helicopter flying in formation over his home. The  was invited on board to record the event from the air, flying in from RAF Benson in Oxfordshire.At the controls of the Wildcat were Staff Sergeant Retief Uys, whose wife is a care worker to the elderly and Captain Maddie Pizzoni, a trained nurse who switched careers five years ago to become a helicopter pilot. From one captain to another, a 30-year-old to a 100-year-old, Capt Pizzoni probably best summed up a nation’s true feelings. “He is just an absolute hero,” she said, “When it has all been negative news, he has been a real beacon for people to latch on to and support in a really miserable time for the world. Captain Tom is incredible.”More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"obese people can lose weight wearing weighted vests new study","story":"Obese people can lose almost 4lbs in under a month by wearing weighted vests, according to a new academic study in Sweden.Participants in the research lost 1.6kg (3.5lbs) in fat, while retaining their muscle mass, after three weeks of wearing specially-provided undergarments.Sixty-nine people with a body mass index (BMI) between 30 to 35, the range known as class 1 obesity, took part in the clinical study, published by Gothenburg University.They were told to wear a weighted vest eight hours a day for three weeks. All participants wore vests, but one group wore heavier versions weighing 11 kg while the others wore lighter ones at just 1 kg.By the end of the experiment those who wore the lighter vests had lost 0.3 kg, while those who wore heavier vests had lost up to 1.6 kg in weight.Experts said the weight loss of those wearing heavier vests exceeded what was observed after various exercise forms. Professor Claes Ohlsson, from Gothenburg University, said: We think it\u0027s very interesting that the treatment with the heavier weighted vests reduced fat mass while muscle mass simultaneously remained intact.The effect on fat mass we found, from this short experiment, exceeded what\u0027s usually observed after various forms of physical training.The research team suspect the weight loss happened because the heavy vests interfered with the body\u0027s system to keep body weight constant - dubbed the gravitostat.However, the team were not able to determine whether the type of fat lost was from under the skin, or from belly fat, which is the most dangerous kind of fat that has been linked to heart diseases and diabetes.The concept of the study emerged following previous research with animals in 2018, with experts claiming the results show similar built-in scales exist in humans too.Now the researchers want to investigate whether the weight reduction continues for the vest wearers over periods longer than three weeks, and whether the novel weight-loss method targets dangerous visceral fat.They also plan to delve deeper into how the vest works to see how it impacts energy expenditure, appetite and mobility.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"saving ken barlow elderly actors left tv dramas post lockdown","story":"Older actors will be excluded from television dramas until social distancing rules have eased, the head of ITV has said, joking that he doesn’t want Ken Barlow’s death on his hands.Kevin Lygo said drama production will resume after lockdown ends, but the over-70s will not be allowed on set.He used the example of Coronation Street, which has a number of older stars including William Roache, 87, who has played Ken Barlow since 1960. The character recently moved into a luxury retirement complex.“We won’t go back to shooting until we’re convinced it is safe on a number of levels. We don’t want to put any of the cast and crew at risk,” Lygo said.“Some people who are in a dangerous zone for age or health reasons - they won’t be there, I’m sure, for a time. I don’t want Ken Barlow to get sick on my watch, so we will be mindful.”Joanna Lumley, 73, has been commissioned to present a new travel show for the channel, as they can be filmed with a much smaller crew and no one else on screen. But it will be a UK-based series due to travel restrictions.The current UK policy is that the over-70s should stay at home to avoid catching the Covid-19 virus.But Boris Johnson’s Government should stop treating the elderly like a crazy old people\u0027s club and let them work out for themselves how to keep safe, former Government adviser Joan Bakewell has said.Baroness Bakewell - who advised the last Labour government on policies towards pensioners - tells today\u0027s Chopper\u0027s Politics podcast: “The idea of police rounding up oldies and penalising them for bad behaviour is laughable.I mean, older people know how to be sensible about these things. Also, they know how highly they are at risk, and they don\u0027t want to die young. They don\u0027t want to die before their time, which is the phrase that Boris Johnson used.Lady Bakewell, 87, said policy-makers in Whitehall “bunch everyone over 70 as though they’re all part of one crazy old people’s club and have the same characteristics, the same sort of lives. And of course they are as varied and interesting as the rest of the population.“If you start making absolute demands to people over 70. I\u0027m afraid they\u0027re going to shake their head and say, \u0027Now look here, youngster. It\u0027s all very well for you but we have a different way of looking at life\u0027.Lady Bakewell said Mr Johnson needed more older people in Cabinet to advise him. “I think there are plenty of wise old birds around who would be very stabilising for what I think is a rather rickety cabinet at the moment.”Older people will not be the only ones absent from the screen this year. Lygo told the Edinburgh TV Festival that this summer’s Love Island series, due to film in Majorca, is likely to be cancelled.He said: “What signal might it be sending if we’re doing a show where everyone is crammed together, slobbering all over each other, and the rest of the world is being told ‘don’t go near anyone in the park’? I’m uneasy about it.”With sporting events cancelled and new productions on hiatus, the schedules will soon be reliant on repeats, Lygo said. Asked if he could predict what people will be watching in nine months’ time, he replied: “Yes, they will be watching a repeat of Midsomer Murders.”More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"second coronavirus wave winter may worse first professor chris","story":"A second wave of coronavirus could be more severe than the first, especially if it arrives in winter, the country\u0027s chief medical officer has warned. Professor Chris Whitty said every country has now got an extremely difficult balancing act in deciding on the best course of action amid calls to ease lockdown measures. In a lecture to Gresham College, Prof Whitty said: We all need to be honest about the fact there are no easy solutions here. It is entirely plausible for a second wave to actually be more severe than the first if  it is not mitigated. Prof Whitty said health officials were attempting to assess what would happen if further waves of the virus coincided with normal winter pressures such as high levels of flu. He said that, like all respiratory viruses, Covid-19 was likely to be transmitted more during winter.If it is in circulation at a time when many people have other viruses causing coughs and colds, it could be far more difficult to manage and keep under control. At this point in the year, if someone\u0027s got something that looks like Covid there\u0027s a high chance it is Covid, he said. In the winter, that is less true.Prof Whitty said the NHS and all other health services were under more pressure during the winter months. The winter is always worse than the summer, spring and autumn for health services, so we need to think about this at this point and we need to think about this in terms of how we come out for the next phase, he added. More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"south korea announces no new daily cases vindication oftrace","story":"South Korea recorded zero new locally transmitted cases of coronavirus infections for the first time since February on Thursday, in a milestone providing another vindication of its much-praised “trace, test, treat” pandemic response strategy.The timing of the announcement – two weeks after the logistical feat of holding the country’s general elections during a pandemic – offered further evidence that South Korea has become a world leader in how to successfully defeat Covid-19.However, South Korea’s Centres for Disease Control did record four new Covid-19 infections in people arriving from abroad, highlighting the long-term challenge of stamping out the spread of the virus when international borders start to open up again.From being overwhelmed by hundreds of new cases a day in February, peaking at 909 on the 29th, daily infections have now slowed to a trickle, allowing life to resume a precious sense of normalcy. The national tally now stands at 10,765, with the death toll at 247.South Korea did not begin as a global success story. After reporting the first case on January 20, the government was initially blindsided in February by an explosion of cases that spread silently through Shincheonji, a secretive sect, and multiplied at an alarming rate through clusters that reached the capital, Seoul.Moon Jae-in, the South Korean president, immediately put the country on a war footing to fight the virus through an aggressive strategy of mass testing, intensive contact tracing and treatment that involved admitting only the most sick and elderly to hospitals, while isolating younger and asymptomatic patients in quarantine dormitories.Despite its slip-up in failing to prevent the Shincheonji cluster, South Korea had already been quick off the mark in January to develop rapid diagnostics to detect the virus.Within weeks of neighbouring China’s outbreak, the South began the mass production of newly-developed Covid-19 testing kits, which show results in just six hours. As of April 30, it has tested about 620,000 people.The examinations are free for those suspected of having the virus or of being in contact with carriers, and affordable for anyone who wants to take one as a precaution. Drive-thru facilities have made the process quick and easy.The country has the capability of rolling out 15,000-20,000 tests a day if necessary and has been exporting test kits around the world, with the primary destinations Brazil, the US and Italy.The sweeping extent of South Korea’s testing abilities has allowed the infected to self-isolate quickly and enabled the widespread contact tracing required to contain the virus.In the widest aspect of the tracing system, an emergency alert system transmits details of fresh Covid-19 cases to every mobile phone, to warn people they may need to get tested. Names are not disclosed but details can include age, and where the person lives or works.But the country also has a dedicated team of so-called “disease detectives” who use human intelligence and technology to track and quarantine the close contacts of confirmed cases.In one case study reported by the CDC this week, an unexpected cluster in a crowded call centre in a 19-storey building in downtown Seoul in March sparked a flurry of 16,628 text messages to people who had stayed more than five minutes near the building during the outbreak.The message recipients were tracked using cell phone location data and urged to avoid contact with others and to take a Covid-19 test.Throughout its national outbreak, South Korea has not seen the draconian lockdowns initially imposed in Chinese cities and now being experienced in Western countries.The country is now moving to a new phase, relaxing its social distancing measures even further. The wearing of face masks remains commonplace but people are preparing to start travelling domestically this weekend during a national holiday.If cases continue to plateau, the authorities plan to move on to what they have dubbed “everyday life quarantine” which means schools and workplaces will mostly return to their normal routines with minimally intrusive precautions in place.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"swedish university town dumps chicken poo deter student drinkers","story":"It\u0027s the biggest party in the student year, with tens of thousands flocking to city parks in the university towns of Lund and Uppsala for a full day of al-fresco drinking. And the city government in Lund feared that even fencing off its Stadsparken park might not be enough to stop students gathering for today\u0027s Valborg, or Walpurgis Night, celebrations.  So they came up with an ingenious solution: dumping a ton of chicken manure all over the grass.  To sit in a park that stinks of chicken manure... is not a pleasant experience, Lund\u0027s mayor, Philip Sandberg, wrote as he publicized the measure on Facebook.However, it is good for the lawns, as chicken manure contains a lot of phosphorus and nitrogen, so that we will get a really nice city park for the summer season.Gustav Lundblad, head of the city\u0027s environment committee, which gave the measure the green light on Tuesday, told the Daily  that all possible means were required to stop the celebrations. It\u0027s the biggest spontaneous party in Sweden, 30,000 people usually come more or less, and of course that would have been a disaster this year, he said.If there are thousands of people climbing over the fence, it\u0027s very hard to stop it even if they don\u0027t have the right to do it. It\u0027s a deadly virus and the municipality has to do everything it can to prevent that happening. Lars Brobeck, the park\u0027s superintendent, conceded as the manure arrived on Thursday morning that there was a definite risk that the whiff could leak out beyond the confines of the park. I\u0027m no expert on manure, he told the Sydsvenskan newspaper. But as far as I understand it will obviously smell a little outside the park as well. The idea is to keep people away from Stadsparken. But I can\u0027t guarantee that the rest of the city will be entirely odour-free.Last year, an estimated 25,000 people gathered for the festivities in Stadsparken, with the litter taking 120 people four hours to clean up. More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"ventilators bought china could have caused significant harm","story":"The UK purchased 250 unreliable ventilators from China that could have caused significant harm to patients, doctors said after the equipment had arrived.Their warning came soon after Michael Gove announced that the Government had secured the ventilators earlier this month.Nine days later, a five-page letter raising serious concerns about the equipment was sent to a senior NHS official by a senior anaesthesia and intensive care doctor at Sandwell and West Birmingham NHS Trust on behalf of a group of clinicians from the area.The revelation comes after The  reported that the Government was seeking a refund for millions of coronavirus antibody tests shipped in from China after they were found to be too unreliable for public use.We believe that if used, significant patient harm, including death, is likely, the clinicians\u0027 letter said, according to the US network NBC News, which saw it. We look forward to the withdrawal and replacement of these ventilators with devices better able to provide intensive care ventilation for our patients.The doctors warned that the ventilators\u0027 oxygen supply was variable and unreliable and said the build quality was basic. They added that the machines\u0027 fabric cases could not be cleaned properly and that they had a non-EU oxygen connection hose.In addition to these problems, the Shangrila 510 machines, manufactured by Beijing Aeonmed Co. Ltd, were designed for use in ambulances rather than hospitals.The Department of Health and Social Care, which oversees the purchase of NHS equipment from abroad, did not respond to a request for comment. However, it told NBC News that it was aware of the doctors\u0027 concerns and had raised them with the manufacturer. None of the ventilators are in use.The Shangrila 510model is thought to cost up to £2,300, meaning a batch of 300 was likely to have cost the taxpayer almost £700,000.Dr Ron Daniels, a senior ICU doctor in another NHS region covering Birmingham, said his trust had also been sent a small number of the same model.While he did not see them himself, he is aware of the concerns raised and told The : It\u0027s possible that this was a hasty purchase that prioritised numbers and public perception over and above need.It came at a time of unprecedented demand for ICU capacity. If their build quality was sufficient and they had the after-sales care, that would be different. But I understand there was not even an oxygen sensor, which would be absolutely below the acceptable standard.The decision making may well have been well meaning, but was ill judged.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/04/30/16/bitcoin-price-gold-2020.jpg","title":"bitcoin price gold oil 2020 best performing assets","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.World\u0027s most valuable cryptocurrency has nearly doubled in value since a flash crash in mid MarchA sudden surge in the price of bitcoin has made the cryptocurrency the top performing asset of 2020, outpacing gold, silver and crude oil.Over the past four months, the price of bitcoin has risen by almost a third despite a major crash in March that wiped more than $4,000 (£3,200) from its value.In the same time period, gold has only risen by around 13 per cent, while silver has fallen by 14 per cent and\u0026nbspcrude oil has dropped by more than 70 per cent in value.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesBitcoin’s recovery comes less than two weeks ahead of a rare event known as a halving, whereby the number of new bitcoins created will fall by 50 per cent.It is only the third time a halving\u0026nbsphas happened in bitcoin’s 11-year history and some market analysts believe it could push the cryptocurrency’s price to new all-time highs this year.Both bitcoin and gold have seen significant gains since around mid March, when countries around the world began to introduce lockdown measures in an effort to slow down the spread of the Covid-19 coronavirus outbreak.This resulted in a global economic slowdown and caused stock markets to crash, as investors looked to secure their holdings in safe haven assets.This has been why gold has traditionally performed well during times of economic uncertainty, however market data suggests that the finite supply of bitcoin means it is increasingly being viewed as a safe haven asset.“Bitcoin has been surging ahead of the May halving event, with investors eagerly anticipating the positive impact of a tightening in supply that comes once every four-years,”\u0026nbspJoshua\u0026nbspMahony, a senior market analyst at financial services firm IG, told\u0026nbspThe Independent.“As things stand we are in line to post a 182 per cent rise for bitcoin since the lows of December 2018, and the surge we are currently seeing paints a bullish picture for the months following this third halving.“From a wider perspective, the huge growth in central bank easing and government debt does highlight why many feel the need to store their wealth in alternative assets to avoid the apparent depreciation that could be on the cards.”Created with Sketch.Bitcoin\u0027s volatile history in pictures Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.18 Satoshi Nakamoto creates the first bitcoin block in 2009On 3 January, 2009, the genesis block of bitcoin appeared.

At the time, this was around 7 per cent of all bitcoins and the market inevitably crashed68 Would the real Satoshi Nakamoto please stand upIn 2015, Australian police raided the home of Craig Wright after the entrepreneur claimed he was Satoshi Nakamoto. He later rescinded the claimOn 1 August, 2017, an unresolvable dispute within the bitcoin community saw the network split. The fork of bitcoin\u0027s underlying blockchain technology spawned a new cryptocurrency: Bitcoin cashTowards the end of 2017, the price of bitcoin surged to almost $20,000. This represented a 1,300 per cent increase from its price at the start of the yearForecasting the price of bitcoin is notoriously difficult due to its volatility, though some analysts claim that similar gains can be expected for the 2020 event.“With 12 days to go until the halving there is a frenzy of activity among bullish investors and the price is already racing higher, having shot up more than 20 per cent in the last 36 hours,” Simon Peters, a cryptocurrency analyst at the online trading platform eToro, told\u0026nbspThe Independent.“The number of actual participants in the market is also hitting new highs amid the expectation that this halving event will play out like the last one and push the price up sharply. With these tailwinds in place, we think it is likely the price will go above $10,000 before the halving actually takes place.”The halving comes at a time of global economic uncertainty brought about by the coronavirus pandemic, which Mr Peters claimed will force investors to turn away from traditional assets and towards bitcoin.“Amid the deteriorating economic outlook for the US economy and the likelihood of an ever increasing monetary supply, which weakens the US dollar and stokes inflation fears, we believe bitcoin could easily test previous highs,” he said.Bitcoin price hit by dramatic fluctuations amid coronavirus panicOthers suggest that bitcoin could be hit in a similar way to traditional stocks, as investors seek to liquidate their portfolios.This appeared to be the case last month, when countries around the world were introducing containment measures to slow down the spread of the Covid-19 virus.During this time, the price of bitcoin fell to a 12-month low\u0026nbspof close to $4,000 following a series of flash crashes sparked by a major cryptocurrency sell-off.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

State officials in places such as Georgia have rushed to reopen for business, even though the number of new infections remains high. Tesla CEO Elon Musk tweeted late Tuesday:\u0026nbsp“FREE AMERICA NOW.”Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesMr Zuckerberg’s focus on the broader health crisis reflects his personal involvement in this issue: He and his physician wife run the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, a philanthropic effort focused on eliminating disease, and have personal ties to many public health leaders. Facebook and other tech giants were among the first companies to urge employees to work from home last month, even before the first shelter-in-place orders were announced.But for his business, Mr Zuckerberg sees opportunities to grow. On a call with analysts, he said he believes that times of economic downturn are a time to invest.Tracking the coronavirus outbreak around the world in maps and chartsWhen can we really expect coronavirus to end?Everything you need to know on supermarket delivery slotsThe dirty truth about washing your handsListen to the latest episode of The Independent Coronavirus Podcast“During a period like this, there are a lot of new things that need to get built,” he added. “I think it’s important that, rather than slamming on the brakes now, as a lot of companies may, it is important to keep building for the new needs people have and ... make up for the stuff that other companies will pull back.”He noted that Facebook had just launched a video group calling app, Messenger Rooms, that would be a competitor to Houseparty and Zoom. Mr Zuckerberg said that the company expects to lose profits in the year ahead but emphasised the social network’s strength at the current moment. Executives have announced that Facebook will hire 10,000 people this year, a potential strategic advantage to poach the best talent as smaller tech firms lay workers off.At a moment when other companies are facing huge layoffs and declining revenue due to the pandemic, Facebook’s revenue growth is notable and was cause for optimism on Wall Street.The company’s first-quarter revenue was $17.7bn (£14.2bn), up from $15.1bn the same quarter a year ago. That was slightly more than analyst expectations, presenting a rosier picture than many traditional companies gearing up for the prolonged crisis. The company’s profits doubled to $4.9bn (£3.9bn) compared to the previous year.Facebook’s stock price shot up 10 per cent in after-hours trading.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailHowever, Facebook is not immune to the current crisis. The company said that it expects profits to go down this year and that it was not making its usual second-quarter predictions due to the uncertainty.Though the company was not making specific predictions, executives noted that ad revenue was flat in April, a sign that the advertising industry would be significantly impacted. Those numbers will be captured during second-quarter earnings.“The effects of the pandemic didn’t hit most of the world until mid-March, and that was reflected in Facebook’s earnings report,” eMarketer principal analyst Debra Aho Williamson said in an emailed statement. But the flat April revenue indicates that the next quarter will be “much more challenging” than the current one.The company also said that prices for its ads have gone down because of lower demand and that it did not expect engagement with some of its services to remain at the same levels as it has during the lockdowns.“There is a strong evidence in the numbers that Facebook ad revenue aren’t receiving the big hits many expected from the Covid-19 shock,” said Haris Anwar, senior analyst at financial markets platform investing, who said that he thought the business would quickly recover from ad spending losses. Facebook’s “stock is well-positioned to outperform its peers”, he added.Many of Facebook 2.89 billion\u0026nbspusers have been quarantined at home around the world, and they are using the company’s services – which include Instagram and WhatsApp – more than ever. In Italy, a country to enter an early lockdown, viewership on the company’s streaming services Facebook and Instagram live doubled in a week, the company has said. Calling for Messenger and WhatsApp more than doubled year over year in many countries that instated lockdowns. Group video calling has increased more than 1,000 per cent since March.That’s welcome news for a company that has seen the number of new users plateau and a significant reduction in the amount of time those users spend engaging with the company’s services in recent years.In general, Facebook and its fellow tech giants are in a better position to withstand the coming recession. The company’s market capitalization is $553bn (£443bn), making it one of the most valuable and cash-rich companies in the world.Google parent company Alphabet’s stock was up nearly 10 per cent Wednesday following the company’s positive earnings report. But it warned that advertising experienced a significant decline starting in mid-March. Microsoft also beat analyst expectations as the coronavirus drove demand from businesses for its cloud infrastructure.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The Covid-19 spread has affected a lot of livelihood, a lot of people\u0027s lives. It has created a crisis, death in general. So I would like to ask not one single person, but all people worldwide, to converge and join the platform that this is something that nobody can fight inidually, said Mack.Dr Laura Bontempo, 50, an emergency medicine doctor wears her personal protective equipment she uses when she sees patients, while posing for a photograph after a nine-hour shift, outside the hospital. The hardest moments have actually been separating families from patients, there is a no-visitor policy now and taking people away from their loved ones is very challenging, Bontempo said. I\u0027m used to treating sick patients. I treat sick patients all the time. It\u0027s very different knowing that the patient you are treating, is actually a risk to you as well. That\u0027s the main difference here. No one who works in hospitals is afraid of treating sick people. Just want to keep staff safe and the patients safe at the same time.Ernest Capadngan, 29, a registered nurse who works at a biocontainment unit poses for a photograph after a 12-hour shift, outside the hospital. The hardest moment during the shift was just seeing Covid patients die helpless and without their family members beside them, Capadngan said.Martine Bell, 41, a nurse practitioner in an emergency department, poses for a photograph after a six-hour shift outside the hospital where she works. The hardest thing in all of this, has been taking care of fellow healthcare providers.

It\u0027s also hitting home that once healthcare providers start getting sick, who is going to be taking care of the public, Bell said. It\u0027s very stressful, everyone is on edge. We don\u0027t know who\u0027s coming in next, or how sick they\u0027re going to be, or if we are going to get a whole bunch of people or if we\u0027re not going to get no one. It\u0027s a really stressful and just a completely unusual time for all of us.Kaitlyn Martiniano, 25, a registered nurse who works at a biocontainment poses for a photograph after a 12.5-hour shift, outside the hospital. We have a lot of patients and they are pretty sick right now but we have not yet been hit as hard as New York or Seattle, so I feel like we are very lucky with that so far. Every day you have to just be optimistic. Said Martiniano. I think the reason that we are not being hit as hard right now is because so many things are closed, and because so many people are staying at home.Tracey Wilson, 53, a nurse practitioner in an intensive care unit (ICU), poses for a photograph after a 12-hour shift, outside the hospital where she works. I had a patient fall out of bed today and I had to call his wife and tell her and she couldn\u0027t come see him, even though she pleaded and begged to come see him, Wilson said.

I think the hardest moment has been the fear that lives within all of us. There is a lot of unknown right now. We fear what\u0027s going to happen tomorrow, how the emergency department will look next week when we come in. We have fears about our own colleagues, whether they will fall ill. We also fear that we could be asymptomatic carriers and bring this virus home to our families and our loved ones. There has been a lot of fear over our supplies and whether we\u0027ll run out. And then obviously there is the fear that we will see patients and not be able to do everything we normally can to help save patients\u0027 lives,  Sheehan said.Kimberly Bowers, 44, a nurse practitioner in an ICU, poses for a photograph after a 13-hour shift, outside the hospital. The hardest moment was a young woman who died and her family wasn\u0027t able to be here with her, Bowers said. I think right now, it\u0027s just frustrating and scary just not knowing what comes next.Tiffany Fare, 25, a registered nurse who works at a biocontainment unit poses for a photograph after a 13-hour shift, outside the hospital where she works. One of the hardest moments was having to see a family member of a Covid patient, say goodbye over an iPad, rooms away. That was a tough one, I can\u0027t imagine how hard it would be to be saying goodbye, you can\u0027t see your loved one and then they\u0027re gone, Fare said. My team has been really great to me. We\u0027ve worked really well together and we\u0027ve really come together in this crisis. We don\u0027t really know each other, we all come from different units within the same hospital, so for us to come together and work so well as a team, it\u0027s been a journey but I think that\u0027s what is giving me hope.Dr Kyle Fischer, 35, an emergency medicine doctor, poses for a photograph after a 12-hour shift, outside the hospital where he works.

So it\u0027s hard to second guess whether or not you are doing the right thing when you think you are but you never quite know, said Fischer.Julia Trainor, 23, a registered nurse at a surgical ICU, poses for a photograph after a 14-hour shift, outside the hospital. The hardest moment was having to put a breathing tube in my patient who could no longer breathe for herself and after the breathing tube went in, we called her family and the husband, of course, couldn\u0027t visit her because of visitor restrictions at the hospital. So I had to put him on the phone and hold the phone to her ear, as he told her that he loved her so much and then I had to wipe away her tears as she was crying, said Trainor. I\u0027m used to seeing very sick patients and I\u0027m used to patients dying but nothing quite like this. In the flip of a switch, without the support, they\u0027re completely isolated.

The hardest moment of my shift today, I was in charge, and we had a really sick patient that was in a really, really small room and usually, when we have sick crashing patients, we can have a ton of resources and a ton of staff go in and help with the nurse and the doctors that are taking care of that patient. But due to the patient being ruled out for the coronavirus, we could only have five or six people in the room at a time and putting on all the gowns and gloves and masks and face shields to protect us in case the patient does have coronavirus, it takes a while, so the nurse that was in there, ended up being in the room for you know 6, 7 hours with minimal breaks and it was hard being in charge and knowing that she was stuck in the room and really nothing I could do to help her, Hamil said.Cheryll Mack, 46, a registered nurse in the emergency department, poses for a photograph after a 12-hour shift outside the hospital where she works.

But due to the patient being ruled out for the coronavirus, we could only have five or six people in the room at a time and putting on all the gowns and gloves and masks and face shields to protect us in case the patient does have coronavirus, it takes a while, so the nurse that was in there, ended up being in the room for you know 6, 7 hours with minimal breaks and it was hard being in charge and knowing that she was stuck in the room and really nothing I could do to help her, Hamil said.We\u0027ve also had a large number of employees who don\u0027t even review content in their daily roles, volunteering to step forward and help make sure we did not see significant negative impacts on that queue, he said.But when pressed by the committee on whether Facebook had the same number of moderators working as before the pandemic, or fewer, Mr Earley said he was unable to answer because the situation was changing each day.Mr Hinds urged Facebook to respond in writing on the issue, while Mr Knight said it appeared that none of the witnesses had been supplied with genuine, hard information on how you are specifically going about tackling Covid disinformation.Andy Burrows, NSPCC associate head of child safety online policy said Facebook\u0027s admission was deeply troubling.Although no-one could have foreseen these circumstances, the reality is platforms for years have failed to protect children from abuse and harmful content, he said.Now those cracks are being exposed and exacerbating a perfect storm for child abuse.This goes to show the urgent need for the duty of care legislation which would force tech firms to protect children on their sites and tackle years of industry inaction head-on.Following a number of fractious exchanges between MPs on the committee and the tech firms\u0027 representatives, Mr Knight said he had not heard any facts from Facebook, while Twitter\u0027s Katy Minshall was accused of using pre-prepared remarks rather than attempting to answer questions.Following an exchange between Google\u0027s public policy and government relations manager, Alina Dimofte, and SNP MP John Nicolson on online gambling, Mr Knight expressed his frustration at the number of follow-up letters the committee would need to write because the three witnesses had been seemingly unable to answer quite basic questions.We will be writing to all the organisations and frankly we will be expressing our displeasure at the quality of the answers - well a lack of answers - that we\u0027ve received today and will be seeking further clarity, the committee chairman said.Additional reporting by Press AssociationBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The study details how these symptoms showed up as red or purple spots caused by bleeding under the skin and tended to be\u0026nbspasymmetrical in appearance.Lasting 12.7 days on average, these symptoms were usually aligned with milder forms of the virus and more commonly experienced\u0026nbspby younger patients.The study also found “vesicular eruptions” in nine per cent of cases these\u0026nbspsmall blisters, commonly itchy, were mostly found on the\u0026nbsptrunk of the body, filling with blood and dispersing across a wider area.These\u0026nbspwere experienced more so with\u0026nbspmiddle-aged patients who had suffered from the virus at an intermediate severity and they lasted\u0026nbsp10.4 days\u0026nbspon average.Thirdly, 19 per cent\u0026nbspof cases brought up\u0026nbsp“urticarial lesions”, which may be commonly interpreted as nettle rash – or wheals -\u0026nbsphas have pink or white raised areas of the skin and lasted\u0026nbspon average 6.8 days.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The phones gather a 3D scan of their owners\u0027 face and check by looking at the placement of key features such as the nose and mouth, meaning that any mask is likely to get in the way of the technology.Instead, the phone will bring up the passcode screen more quickly if it detects the person using it is also wearing a mask. That in practise means that Face ID will realise that it is likely to fail, and users can try the alternative route straight away rather than trying repeatedly to unlock with their face.iPhone text \u0027bomb\u0027 can crash iOS 13 with just a string of lettersUnder the old system, users could be left staring at their phone for a moment while the phone decided that the Face ID check was likely to fail and the the passcode entry screen should be opened instead.The full version of iOS 13.5 is likely to be released to users in the coming weeks, and will be available to download like any other iOS update.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

That raises anew the question of whether and to what extent the virus can be transmitted as an aerosol – although the evidence is far from conclusive and no such infections have been documented.The consensus so far is that the virus, although very contagious, spreads through respiratory droplets generated when people breathe, speak or cough and doesn’t infect people through particles that can linger in the air for hours, in the way that measles and some other viral diseases can.But the research is fuelling a scientific debate over one of the most basic questions about the novel coronavirus – how it spreads – and doing so at a time of high anxiety and rattled nerves. Outbreaks linked to crowded indoor environments such as prisons, meatpacking plants, a cramped call centre and a restaurant may serve as warnings about the perils of reopening.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe scientific literature is full of alarming questions: could ventilation systems spread the virus? Could removing clothing shake virus particles back into the air?Research has shown that the virus typically is transmitted from person to person through relatively large respiratory droplets that travel only a few feet before falling to the floor or ground. People can also become infected by touching contaminated objects – known among scientists as fomites – and then, for example, touching their face.Tracking the coronavirus outbreak around the world in maps and chartsWhen can we really expect coronavirus to end?Everything you need to know on supermarket delivery slotsThe dirty truth about washing your handsListen to the latest episode of The Independent Coronavirus Podcast“Airborne spread has not been reported for Covid-19 and it is not believed to be a major driver of transmission based on available evidence,” concluded a comprehensive report by researchers from China and the World Health Organisation published in February.But that report went on to say that some medical procedures in health-care facilities, such as intubating a patient, can generate virus aerosols. And research at the Rocky Mountain Laboratories, part of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, showed that virus particles aerosolised with laboratory equipment remained viable – still capable of growing in a cell culture – for up to three hours while suspended in the air.The Nature paper, authored by scientists at Wuhan University in China, reported that aerosolised traces of viral genetic material, called RNA, were found in two hospitals – particularly in poorly ventilated spaces. The highest concentration of the aerosol particles were found in a single-person mobile toilet that lacked ventilation. Viral RNA was also found in an area where hospital workers took off their protective gear.The report, however, did not establish whether the airborne coronavirus samples were viable – that is, capable of generating a new infection.“Although we have not established the infectivity of the virus detected in these hospital areas, we propose that Sars-Cov-2 may have the potential to be transmitted via aerosols,” the authors wrote. “Our results indicate that room ventilation, open space, sanitization of protective apparel, and proper use and disinfection of toilet areas can effectively limit the concentration of Sars-Cov-2 RNA in aerosols.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailThe public should view the new China airborne virus study with caution because the PCR test cannot distinguish viable virus from genetic fragments that aren’t infectious, said Andrew Noymer, an epidemiologist at the University of California at Irvine.“The test for viable virus is a much-more-painstaking cell culture test, which the present study did not perform,” Mr Noymer said.An alarming report from a restaurant in Guangzhou, China, showed that one infected person who had not yet developed symptoms infected nine other diners. Researchers suggested that an air-conditioning unit recirculating the air could have spread droplets, carrying the virus between tables.“This just demonstrates the terrible confusion that is created by the common misconception that there’s somehow a bright line between aerosols and respiratory droplets,” said Donald Milton, professor of environmental health at the University of Maryland School of Public Health. “First of all, they are all respiratory droplets – some are larger and some are smaller, all the way down to\u0026nbspmicrodroplets\u0026nbspless than a single micron in diameter. It is true that larger droplets will behave as aerosols as the velocity of air increases, countering the pull of gravity so that they don’t fall out.”A study from an 11th-floor South Korean call centre found that 94 people were infected in a single outbreak, most of them clustered in one half of the office. The authors wrote that the outbreak highlights that the virus is “exceptionally contagious in crowded office settings such as a call centre.”That does not necessarily mean aerosolised particles caused the infections.“I’m sceptical. To my knowledge we haven’t really seen evidence of transmission occurring that way,” said Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at the Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health. “The transmission studies from the call centre and restaurant suggest that regular airborne droplet transmission in enclosed or poorly ventilated spaces is itself a transmission risk without needing to worry about small particle aerosols, too.”To test whether aerosolised particles are spreading the virus, researchers will have to grow live virus from those samples and not simply recover viral RNA, which could just be residual genetic material not capable of seeding new infections.A report, not yet peer-reviewed, from the University of Nebraska Medical Centre found virus RNA on the surfaces of cellphones, toilets, bedside tables and exercise equipment used by 13 patients with confirmed cases of Covid-19. Samples from the hallway outside patient rooms were also positive for viral RNA, suggesting that aerosols could be spreading the virus, but again the research did not conclude that the hallway samples were infectious.Outside researchers remain sceptical of this fragmentary data.Can air conditioning spread the coronavirus?Vincent Munster, a virologist at the Rocky Mountain Laboratories who led the research on aerosolised coronavirus, said Wednesday it is possible aerosolised particles are capable of spreading the virus – but this could be a very minor element in the pandemic.“The question is, ‘What is currently driving the pandemic?’ If it’s mostly droplet transmission, and if we do have airborne or aerosol transmission, what is the relative role? These are all big questions that I still think need to be addressed,” Mr Munster said.Milton is planning studies with a contraption that measures the droplets expelled when infected people point their heads into a cone-like device called the Gesundheit Machine. Those studies could help definitively answer questions about whether fine aerosolised particles are routinely generated when people breathe or cough, and whether they are likely to spread disease.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The Covid-19 spread has affected a lot of livelihood, a lot of people\u0027s lives. It has created a crisis, death in general. So I would like to ask not one single person, but all people worldwide, to converge and join the platform that this is something that nobody can fight inidually, said Mack.Dr Laura Bontempo, 50, an emergency medicine doctor wears her personal protective equipment she uses when she sees patients, while posing for a photograph after a nine-hour shift, outside the hospital. The hardest moments have actually been separating families from patients, there is a no-visitor policy now and taking people away from their loved ones is very challenging, Bontempo said. I\u0027m used to treating sick patients. I treat sick patients all the time. It\u0027s very different knowing that the patient you are treating, is actually a risk to you as well. That\u0027s the main difference here. No one who works in hospitals is afraid of treating sick people. Just want to keep staff safe and the patients safe at the same time.Ernest Capadngan, 29, a registered nurse who works at a biocontainment unit poses for a photograph after a 12-hour shift, outside the hospital. The hardest moment during the shift was just seeing Covid patients die helpless and without their family members beside them, Capadngan said.Martine Bell, 41, a nurse practitioner in an emergency department, poses for a photograph after a six-hour shift outside the hospital where she works. The hardest thing in all of this, has been taking care of fellow healthcare providers. It really hits home and it\u0027s really scary when you see someone that could be you coming in and now you\u0027re taking care of them. It\u0027s also hitting home that once healthcare providers start getting sick, who is going to be taking care of the public, Bell said. It\u0027s very stressful, everyone is on edge. We don\u0027t know who\u0027s coming in next, or how sick they\u0027re going to be, or if we are going to get a whole bunch of people or if we\u0027re not going to get no one. It\u0027s a really stressful and just a completely unusual time for all of us.Kaitlyn Martiniano, 25, a registered nurse who works at a biocontainment poses for a photograph after a 12.5-hour shift, outside the hospital. We have a lot of patients and they are pretty sick right now but we have not yet been hit as hard as New York or Seattle, so I feel like we are very lucky with that so far. Every day you have to just be optimistic. Said Martiniano. I think the reason that we are not being hit as hard right now is because so many things are closed, and because so many people are staying at home.Tracey Wilson, 53, a nurse practitioner in an intensive care unit (ICU), poses for a photograph after a 12-hour shift, outside the hospital where she works. I had a patient fall out of bed today and I had to call his wife and tell her and she couldn\u0027t come see him, even though she pleaded and begged to come see him, Wilson said. There is a lot of unknowns and with that unknown is a lot of anxiety and stress that we\u0027re not used to dealing with.Meghan Sheehan, 27, a nurse practitioner in an emergency department, poses for a photograph after a 12-hour shift, outside the hospital where she works. I think the hardest moment has been the fear that lives within all of us. There is a lot of unknown right now. We fear what\u0027s going to happen tomorrow, how the emergency department will look next week when we come in. We have fears about our own colleagues, whether they will fall ill. We also fear that we could be asymptomatic carriers and bring this virus home to our families and our loved ones. There has been a lot of fear over our supplies and whether we\u0027ll run out. And then obviously there is the fear that we will see patients and not be able to do everything we normally can to help save patients\u0027 lives,  Sheehan said.Kimberly Bowers, 44, a nurse practitioner in an ICU, poses for a photograph after a 13-hour shift, outside the hospital. The hardest moment was a young woman who died and her family wasn\u0027t able to be here with her, Bowers said. I think right now, it\u0027s just frustrating and scary just not knowing what comes next.Tiffany Fare, 25, a registered nurse who works at a biocontainment unit poses for a photograph after a 13-hour shift, outside the hospital where she works. One of the hardest moments was having to see a family member of a Covid patient, say goodbye over an iPad, rooms away. That was a tough one, I can\u0027t imagine how hard it would be to be saying goodbye, you can\u0027t see your loved one and then they\u0027re gone, Fare said. My team has been really great to me. We\u0027ve worked really well together and we\u0027ve really come together in this crisis. We don\u0027t really know each other, we all come from different units within the same hospital, so for us to come together and work so well as a team, it\u0027s been a journey but I think that\u0027s what is giving me hope.Dr Kyle Fischer, 35, an emergency medicine doctor, poses for a photograph after a 12-hour shift, outside the hospital where he works. Since it\u0027s a new virus, we don\u0027t have any experience with it. For most diseases I am used to seeing it and taking care of it and this, I don\u0027t have any starting place. I know what I\u0027m hearing from New York, I\u0027ve read all of the papers it seems like, but no one knows what the correct answers are, so there\u0027s a huge amount of uncertainty and people are really, really sick. So it\u0027s hard to second guess whether or not you are doing the right thing when you think you are but you never quite know, said Fischer.Julia Trainor, 23, a registered nurse at a surgical ICU, poses for a photograph after a 14-hour shift, outside the hospital. The hardest moment was having to put a breathing tube in my patient who could no longer breathe for herself and after the breathing tube went in, we called her family and the husband, of course, couldn\u0027t visit her because of visitor restrictions at the hospital. So I had to put him on the phone and hold the phone to her ear, as he told her that he loved her so much and then I had to wipe away her tears as she was crying, said Trainor. I\u0027m used to seeing very sick patients and I\u0027m used to patients dying but nothing quite like this. In the flip of a switch, without the support, they\u0027re completely isolated. They\u0027re very sick. Some of them recover and some of them don\u0027t. But the hardest part, I would think, is them having to go through this feeling like they are alone.Lisa Mehring, 45, a registered nurse who works in a biocontainment unit with Covid-19 patients, poses for a photograph after a 12.5-hour shift, outside the hospital where she works in Maryland. Seeing these new moms have babies has been the hardest moment along with having do their pumping for the new moms and them not being able to be with their newborn children, it\u0027s hard to think of the family that they are missing, Mehring said.Jacqueline Hamil, 30, a registered nurse in an emergency department, poses for a photograph after a 12-hour shift outside the hospital. The hardest moment of my shift today, I was in charge, and we had a really sick patient that was in a really, really small room and usually, when we have sick crashing patients, we can have a ton of resources and a ton of staff go in and help with the nurse and the doctors that are taking care of that patient. But due to the patient being ruled out for the coronavirus, we could only have five or six people in the room at a time and putting on all the gowns and gloves and masks and face shields to protect us in case the patient does have coronavirus, it takes a while, so the nurse that was in there, ended up being in the room for you know 6, 7 hours with minimal breaks and it was hard being in charge and knowing that she was stuck in the room and really nothing I could do to help her, Hamil said.Cheryll Mack, 46, a registered nurse in the emergency department, poses for a photograph after a 12-hour shift outside the hospital where she works.

He added: “Of the many families already impacted by this, most weren’t even notified by the Child Maintenance Service (CMS), and only became aware when the maintenance payments did not arrive.“Without these payments, single-parent families will be hit with a ‘triple penalty’. Having already faced the threat of seeing their income slashed and as well as having to come up with the extra costs associated with looking after children not attending school, they are also losing out on money they rely on to put food on the table. Given almost half of children in single-parent families already live in poverty, the consequences of these penalties are unimaginable.“It is clear that Covid-19 will have a negative impact on both parents’ finances. However, taking money away from the households of families and children who are already struggling needn’t be an option — let alone a first resort. Gingerbread is calling on the government to step in during this period to immediately fill the shortfall for parents not receiving maintenance payments to ensure this doesn’t happen and children don’t suffer.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Missing out, or even waiting longer than usual, for vital and expected maintenance payments could be the final straw that pushes them into further poverty.”Tracking the coronavirus outbreak around the world in maps and chartsWhen can we really expect coronavirus to end?Everything you need to know on supermarket delivery slotsThe dirty truth about washing your handsListen to the latest episode of The Independent Coronavirus PodcastChris Longbottom, a family lawyer, said he had seen\u0026nbspa surge in parents stopping paying child maintenance overnight in the wake of the coronavirus emergency. They were taking such decisions without talking over ways to lessen\u0026nbsppayments or providing evidence of how their economic situation has changed, he said.Mr Longbottom, who works at national law firm Clarke Willmott, said: “This is a difficult time for everyone and we understand that orced spouses and separated partners or parents, who have perhaps had their hours cut or pay reduced, will be under more financial strain than usual, but there are ways to get help and simply cutting off maintenance payments is unconscionable.“Such action puts families and children at risk and creates a wave of knock-on impacts.

Indeed, they have become four times as frequent\u0026nbspin the past half-century.Since the 1970s, it is\u0026nbspestimated at least three dozen infectious diseases have emerged from human interference with animals, including Sars, Mers, Ebola, bird flu, swine flu and the Zika virus. As far back as 2007 the World Health Organisation warned that infectious diseases were emerging at a rate that had not been seen before.The spread of the viruses is put down to a deadly combination of wildlife trafficking and consumption, increasing human encroachment into wildlife habitats as more people live in densely populated areas – and air travel, which enables pathogens to take hold globally.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThree years ago, an article\u0026nbsppublished by the US National Centre for Biotechnology Information stated, presciently: “The Aids and influenza pandemics have claimed and will continue to claim millions of lives. The recent Sars and Ebola epidemics have threatened populations across borders. The emergence of Mers may well be warning signals of a nascent pandemic threat.”Zoonotic diseases are complex, and it’s sometimes impossible to say a virus has disappeared, because it might have many different strains, and might mutate and lie dormant. This is a timeline of the main zoonotic diseases to have hit us since the start of the 20th century:Wildlife trade continues in Asia amid calls for restrictions China tries to shut down wildlife trade but markets remain openBlack-market trade ‘may undermine Vietnam ban on disease-rife markets’Stray dogs eating bat meat ‘could have sparked coronavirus pandemic’The 1918 flu pandemic: This was the most severe pandemic in modern times, killing at least 50 million people in two years. It is widely believed that the virus originated in birds because it shared genetic mutations with the bird flu virus later found in Asia, and could have transferred to horses in the trenches of the first world war before spreading to humans. This is disputed, with one study suggesting it came from mammals.Asian flu, 1957:\u0026nbspIn February 1957, a new influenza virus, known as H2N2 emerged in east Asia, which spread into a pandemic. It originated from an avian influenza virus, causing an estimated 1.1 million deaths worldwide.HIV: First identified in 1981, the disease is thought to have been acquired by people in central Africa hunting chimpanzees and coming into contact with their infected blood. However, studies show that HIV may have jumped from apes to humans as far back as the late 1800s, and it has existed in the West since at least the mid to late 1970s. HIV has killed about 35 million people to date, according to the World Health Organisation.Sars:\u0026nbspSevere acute respiratory syndrome is another type of coronavirus, which killed at least 770 people globally in an epidemic in 2002-3. Most victims were in southern China, Vietnam and Singapore. Scientists are not certain of its origins but like Covid-19 it’s thought it could have come from bats and spread to other animals such as civet cats, which are commonly sold in squalid conditions in street markets. The epidemic resulted in more than 8,000 cases, in 26 countries. Of those, 774 died.Swine flu: In 2009-2010 a new strain of flu emerged in pigs in Mexico. The H1N1 virus killed nearly tens of thousands of people in a global pandemic that spread to 214 countries in less than a year. However, overall the outbreak was not as serious as originally predicted, largely because many older people were already immune to it. And the NHS says it now circulates each year and is considered a normal seasonal flu strain, which is covered by the annual seasonal flu vaccine. A study in 2013 suggested between 123,000 and 200,000 people globally may have died as a result of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic.Mers:\u0026nbspFirst identified in Saudi Arabia in 2012, Middle East respiratory syndrome is also a coronavirus whose symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath. With an estimated death rate of 35 per cent, the disease has killed 858 people, according to the WHO. Again, scientists think it spread to humans from bats, this time via camels.Ebola: A 2014–2016 outbreak in West Africa was the largest and most complex Ebola outbreak since the virus was first discovered in 1976, killing 11,300 people. Scientists say it began with a child in Guinea who came into contact with infected bats, but it has since been widely linked to the killing and butchering of bush meat, including monkeys, chimps, antelopes, fruit bats, porcupines and rats.Zika: First identified in Uganda in 1947 in monkeys, the mosquito-borne virus caused alarm in 2015, when it was thought to be the cause of thousands of cases of microcephaly – a shorter-than-normal head – in babies in Brazil. Outbreaks soon appeared throughout the Americas, Africa and other regions. It was thought to have killed 29 babies.Bird flu: Avian influenza, also called avian flu or bird flu, has many different strains but one of those, H7N9, has caused 1,568 cases in humans and 616 deaths worldwide since 2013, according to the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations.Another strain of the virus, H5N1, first identified in 1997, spread across east and southeast Asia, killing six people in Hong Kong and leading to vast swathes of chickens and turkeys – from Hong Kong to Britain – having to be culled early after contracting the disease. To date 861 cases of human H5N1 infection and 455 deaths have been reported.\u0026nbspThe highest number of infections and deaths were in Indonesia, Vietnam and Thailand. The H5N1 virus, which has a 60 per cent mortality rate among infected humans, according to WHO, has not gone away, but is thought to have mutated.Bird flu has been linked to rapid intensification of the poultry industry, with thousands of birds crowded together indoors and with compromised immune systems.The Independent is campaigning against the wildlife trade at the core of the Covid-19 pandemic.\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It is a charity that has adapted with incredible speed to the crisis to help the most vulnerable in our community. In just five weeks, they have responded to the increased demand for food by quadrupling their output. We hope that our donation, coupled with the campaigning power of The Independent, will help the project grow and reach as many as possible of the one in five Londoners at risk of food poverty.”Another substantial contribution came in yesterday from the Julia and Hans Rausing Trust, which has assigned £16.5m\u0026nbspto charities at the forefront of the coronavirus pandemic and has donated £50,000 to our appeal.How to support our campaignJulia and Hans Rausing,\u0026nbspheirs of food packing giant Tetra Pak, said: “We have been impressed not only by the speed of The Felix Project’s response to the crisis, but the way in which they have managed to get a number of organisations working together to help people across the capital. Efforts like this support communities across London at this time of need, and we are glad to support their inspiring work.”We launched our appeal, in association with the Evening Standard, on Friday 27 March\u0026nbspand have reached £3m\u0026nbspthanks to the generous backing of dozens of London foundations, philanthropists and corporations, including Garfield Weston Foundation, Lansdowne Partners, the Westminster Foundation, Sir Peter Blake, Burberry, Eranda Rothschild Foundation, Citibank and investment holding company Temasek.More than 1,170 members of the public have contributed, donating £103,837 on our Virgin Money Giving page.But there is a sense that we are still in the foothills of the economic crisis, with experts warning the government that food poverty is about to get far worse. The Food Foundation has reported that eight million people in Britain face food insecurity and that three million have been missing meals since lockdown. The Institute for Social and Economic Research at University of Essex estimates that 6.5 million jobs could be lost in the coming months, causing a huge rise in demand for free food.As the biggest supplier of free food in London, The Felix Project has been operating 12 hours a day, six days a week, distributing surplus food to giant community hubs, including Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in Haringey, as well as to 80 charities and schools across the capital.The Independent\u0026nbspis encouraging readers to help groups that are trying to feed the hungry across the country – find out how you can help\u0026nbsphere.

A nurse said meals cooked with fresh Felix produce made her feel “that little bit stronger”.All told of their relief\u0026nbspat being able to access healthy food, thanks to The Felix Project, one of the biggest food redistributors in the country, which has quadrupled daily deliveries to 40 tons since the outbreak of the virus.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesYesterday, in a sign of further upward spiralling demand, The Felix Project broke its own record, ferrying an extraordinary 44 tons to 73 schools and charities, with the heftiest deliveries going to 11 community super-hubs set up by councils as part of a pan-London effort to tackle food poverty in the wake of Covid-19.Felix, on its own, is now supplying more than 100,000 meals a day, up from 20,000 at the start of the outbreak. This is what some of the beneficiaries, volunteers and charities had to say.How to support our campaignFamily at high riskKaren Barnes suffers from type 1 diabetes, an underactive thyroid and chronic back pain, and is a carer for her son, Aidan, six, who has health issues that affect his immune system“We receive two boxes of Felix-supplied food a week, from Enfield Children and Young Persons Services, as my son and I are both categorised as high risk. We felt a bit hopeless about being in isolation. I don’t have much family and you don’t want to be a burden on other people. So these boxes are a lifeline. It’s exciting when they come as we’re on our own. The person who delivers them leaves them on my doorstep and we chat. It’s a nice interaction.Kim Pallas is a nurse working 12-hour shifts at Barnet Hospital. She picks up dozens of cooked meals to give to her colleagues, made each day by BreadnButter, a social enterprise supplied by The Felix Project.\u0026nbspPrior to the pandemic, BreadnButter taught cooking skills to community groups. It has adapted to the crisis by getting between 300 and 600 food parcels and cooked meals out each day to NHS staff and people in the borough having to self-isolate.“All the patients in our hospital ward are coronavirus patients so it’s been difficult – very emotional and overwhelming at times. You’re just so grateful when fresh, healthy food is put in front of you and you don’t have to think about doing all the cooking,”\u0026nbspsaid Ms Pallas.“The support of the food charities is making a massive difference to people like us. To know people care enough about you to do this makes you feel that little bit stronger to cope with all that’s going on during the crisis. It makes you feel valued.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

She struggles to make ends meet and has claimed universal credit since her husband died suddenly from lung cancer five months ago.“I collect food parcels from my children’s school in Enfield once a week. We are in a very hard situation. When my husband died, my life was turned upside down. I was alone but had to look after my 11-year-old son David and six-year-old daughter Ola. I work so I’m lucky, but life is expensive. Felix is a huge help and – now that we are in isolation – so important. We leave the house once a week to collect our parcel so it’s the best part of our week.”Justine, 38, is a mother-of-four who escaped an abusive relationship and lives in temporary housing, claiming universal credit.“I first heard about The Felix Project through my six-year-old son’s school and have been picking up weekly packages since the end of last year.“At the moment, we are in isolation and things are tough, but Felix is a lifeline. I have used food banks in the past but they do not provide fresh food. There are luxury items in my Felix boxes that I could never afford, like Innocent Smoothies and mozzarella cheese. Picking up our box from the school is a weekly highlight. I don’t know what we would do without it.”James Quayle is manager of North Paddington Food Bank: “Before coronavirus we were feeding 100 households per week but now we are supporting more than 600 families. We used to be open one day a week with The Felix Project delivering a single truckload of fresh produce, but since Covid we are open six days a week.We have increased our volunteers from a couple of dozen to almost 300 and I am working 14-hour days. The only other comparable thing was the start of the Syrian refugee crisis when I was on Lesbos and witnessed people coming off boats. Similarly, this feels like a tidal wave.”James Smart, 36, is a volunteer at Made up Kitchen. The Hackney-based project had been bringing various groups together for regular “community feasts”. It stepped up to the crisis by delivering around 500 nutritious meals each week to people in the area who are struggling financially, thanks to 12 crates of surplus food given by The Felix Project each week.Mr Smart – a chef and market trader who had been working at a cheese stall before it had to close – is now giving two days a week as one of half a dozen volunteers cooking and coordinating deliveries with Made up Kitchen.“Like a lot of people my own situation feels uncertain,” he said. “This crisis has hit almost everyone in one way or another, which is quite scary. But it’s great that so many people have been getting out and doing something that matters for their community. We’re doing as much as we can right now, but there’s a lot of people who will need help.”He added: “The Felix Project has been such a massive help. It’s so important they can operate on such a big scale across London because it makes so much of the work of smaller groups possible.”The Independent\u0026nbspis encouraging readers to help groups that are trying to feed the hungry across the country – find out how you can help\u0026nbsphere.

It is who is being tested – and where, and why?And to explain that, say the fiercest critics of the testing saga, we have to go back to a decision taken, almost without being noticed, seven weeks ago.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesIt was barely mentioned at the time, failing to hit any headlines as the terrible crisis unfolded, but it is a twist crucial to understanding the troubled tale of testing for coronavirus that followed.Created with Sketch.How coronavirus lockdowns changed the world\u0027s most polluted cities Show all 6Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.On 12 March, a sombre Boris Johnson rose to warn the nation that Covid-19 was taking grip, that “many more” families would lose loved ones and people with symptoms should stay at home for seven days.The UK was still almost two weeks away from lockdown, but it was the day that efforts to “contain” the spread of the disease were abandoned – in favour of “delay” – which meant community testing and the tracing of the contacts of positive cases was stopped.Evidence coronavirus can spread through air found in Wuhan hospitalsTwo men hospitalised after drinking disinfectants to prevent Covid-19UK ‘may well’ have worst death toll in Europe, minister admitsGreece’s handling of outbreak is a success story, so far“If we hadn’t stopped it on 12 March, our epidemic would have been much less. They effectively allowed it to spread,” says Anthony Costello, a professor of global health at University College London.Over the next two weeks, the death toll for the UK would rise sharply – it now stands at third\u0026nbsphighest in the world – and, amid a storm of criticism that the government was failing badly, Hancock made his pledge of 100,000 daily tests on 2 April.At the time, just 10,000 people a day were being tested and staff absence levels in the NHS were soaring as medics with symptoms were forced to stay home, when they were badly needed on emergency wards.The government had set a target of 25,000 daily tests by mid-April – which it was to miss by a mile – and Johnson had once pledged the wildly implausible 250,000 a day, with no deadline attached.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive updates on politics every morning by emailFrom the moment he spoke on 2 April, it seemed clear the health secretary was winging it, as observers were left scratching their heads about exactly what he was promising.Would the tests be to establish who has the virus now, or an antibody test\u0026nbspto establish who had previously had Covid-19?\u0026nbspThe health secretary had also promised home “fingerprick” tests and “immunity certificates” for people given the all-clear to return to normal life.Hancock was unclear. He also announced a “five pillar” plan with one measure, creating a German-style mass diagnostic industry from scratch – during a pandemic – seemingly plucked from thin air in desperation to reach the magic tally of five.Before too long, hopes of fingerprick tests had evaporated, as they were found to be inaccurate, whereupon ministers – thanks to The Independent – had to publicly commit to 100,000 daily virus tests.From that moment, Hancock’s fate was sealed, not least because sick NHS and care workers, and care residents, were expected to drive for hours to distant testing centres\u0026nbspin order to establish whether they had Covid-19.\u0026nbspThose centres stood idle as a consequence.There are still only 16 mobile testing labs, with the remaining 80 that were promised not set to be up-and-running until the weekend at the earliest.As a result, more than two weeks after everyone in a care home with symptoms was promised a test, many are still missing out – even as deaths in those homes rise\u0026nbspsharply.Nevertheless, Hancock can claim some successes. There is now capacity for 73,400 tests and 52,249 were carried out on Wednesday – although on only around 33,000 people, after retests – which meant he could offer them to millions of other key workers, although the online booking system immediately crashed.He has now expanded the offer to all over-65s and workers who need to leave their homes with symptoms, and their household members. By the end of the week, 25,000 a day could be carrying out home tests.It is striking that the man credited with Germany’s testing miracle – a virology expert named Christian Drosten – said this week that the UK was “really gaining momentum” and now “coordinating testing efforts better than Germany”.But\u0026nbsp… it is the gap between testing capacity (73,400) and actual tests (only 52,249) that exposes where the UK misfired.If everyone agrees testing is critical – and spare test kits are literally lying around – why are they not being put to use?The answer is that Hancock has been testing only NHS and care workers and their families (now other key workers), because community testing was stopped on 12 March.He finally switched tack on 23 April, announcing that an 18,000-strong army would be recruited to trace and potentially isolate the contacts of suspected cases who would now, finally, all be tested – admitting it was the key to conquering the virus and easing the lockdown.But the mass programme came a full five weeks after the World Health Organisation urged all nations to “test, test, test” – a plea explicitly rejected by the UK at the time. And, crucially, it will not begin until mid-May, at the earliest.Now, ministers have been criticised for using the phrase “following the science” as a shield for ducking hard decisions, but on this occasion they had a ready defence.Jenny Harries, the deputy chief medical officer, on 26 March, explained\u0026nbspthe decision to halt community work: “There comes a point in a pandemic where that is not an appropriate intervention. And that is the point where we moved into ‘delay’. And, although we still do some contact tracing and testing, for example in high-risk areas like prisons and care homes, that is not an appropriate mechanism as we go forward.”Ministers have justified last week’s U-turn on the grounds that community testing and tracing can only be successful after infections drop sharply, which was news to nations such as South Korea, Germany, Singapore and Vietnam, where it never stopped.Perhaps worse, the evidence was growing that the experts at this were sitting around twiddling their thumbs when they could at least have been recruited for when testing restarted.There are round 5,000 local council environmental health workers – and thousands more in the private sector, now furloughed in the shutdown – with years of tracing the victims of salmonella, Legionnaires’ disease and even norovirus.But Public Health England\u0026nbsphad made no effort to deploy them, a “missed opportunity” said Gary McFarlane, of the Chartered Institute of Environmental Health.Earlier deployment would have boosted testing numbers towards the magic 100,000 figure.\u0026nbspMoreover, scientific opinion – in contrast to Ms Harries’s cast-iron certainty – is split down the middle on the wisdom of halting community testing in the first place.McFarlane said it was too early to pass judgment, telling The Independent: “Now is not the time to have that autopsy, it would be a distraction. We are where we are.”But he added: “Testing and contact tracing are fundamentally linked and we cannot start to relax the lockdown until we have a robust system of tracing the cases really fast and isolating them.“If we don’t do that we will end up exactly where we were a week ago. The virus hasn’t gone away, it’s still out there and we haven’t got a vaccine yet.”But Allyson Pollock, professor of public health at Newcastle University, is scathing, blaming the way disease control services have been “decimated” over the decade of austerity.She said, even now, local councils were being denied information on the number of new infections in their areas, which could have allowed testing and tracing to be under way already.Hancock had, the professor said, also been distracted by his dream of a smartphone app to guide tracing, which even its developer has warned it requires a daunting 60 per cent take-up to be successful.“We have announcements that they are going to track and trace, but we don’t yet know how,” Ms Pollock said.“I cannot understand why contact tracing – which is the key guidance of the World Health Organisation – is not being followed and why the UK appeared to be making it up as it goes along, rather than using the standard international advice that has been followed in every other country which has managed to deal with this virus well.”The Independent has put these criticisms to the Department of Health and Social Care but has not received a response.Hancock will hit his 100,000 target, albeit late, but that scarcely matters by itself. The “who, where and why” are so much more crucial.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The nature of the pandemic means doctors need to apply new treatments “with rigour but also with unprecedented speed”, said Dr Vishal Rao, who is leading India’s phase-one trial at Victoria Hospital in Bengaluru (formerly Bangalore), Karnataka.Dr Rao told The Independent that he already has several donors and expects the first patients in the trial to start receiving transfusions by the end of this week.Simultaneous phase-one trials are being conducted by the University of Chicago and Semmelweis University in Hungary. Using a small number of patients in a controlled environment, their job is to establish the safety of the procedure so that larger phase-two trials, with hundreds of patients, can then begin.After media coverage of apparently successful plasma therapy treatments in compassionate use cases in several Indian states, Dr Rao said the authorities had\u0026nbspreceiving “thousands” of requests from hospitals across the country to start using the experimental technique.The Indian health ministry joint secretary Lav Agarwal was forced to issue a statement this week\u0026nbspstressing that “currently there are no approved therapies for Covid-19, including plasma therapy”, and that “while plasma therapy is one of the treatments that is currently being experimented with, there is, however, no evidence to support it as a treatment”.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But he also supports its use on compassionate grounds “if somebody is willing to take the risk”.“We don’t have the liberty of time to look at a very large, statistically significant number and then debate all of these issues. This is something that the global community is trying to answer in a very quick fashion… We will really have to push science to the limit of its utility.”The Indian Council for Medical Research has already approved plans for a phase-two trial involving more than 450 patients that, if the\u0026nbspKarnataka\u0026nbsptrial goes well, will take up to six months.The US gave the green light for a similar phase-two trial, also randomised and controlled and also involving 450 test subjects, a week ago. And American researchers are also following the progress of more than 600 patients who have received compassionate plasma therapy. Doctors say such cases, though not carried out in the rigorous setting of a medical trial, could provide useful insights.The first paper describing the apparently positive results from experimental plasma therapy in 10 severely ill coronavirus patients was published as a “preprint” –\u0026nbspbefore going through a peer-review process –\u0026nbspby a Chinese team in Wuhan on 16 March.A second study, involving five critical patients in Shenzhen, China, was again issued as a preprint in the Journal of the American Medical Association on 27 March.Five people who had been in hospital in Shenzhen for at least 10 days were started on transfusions, the paper says, and within three days body temperature had normalised in four out of the five patients. At the conclusion of the observations, three had been discharged from hospital and two were in a stable condition.German authorities approved the country’s first plasma therapies on 7 April, while France started giving\u0026nbsptreatments to 60 patients across Paris hospitals around the same time.The UK has only just approved a trial which officials say could eventually lead to treatment of up to 5,000 patients a week, but has yet to get off the ground. England’s deputy chief medical officer Jonathan Van Tam said Britain was “leading the world’s largest trials to find a treatment for Covid-19, with over 7,000 people so far involved testing a range of medicines”, adding:\u0026nbsp”We hope to add convalescent plasma to this list shortly.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Is raising taxes the wrong approach or the Governments only option One surprise of this crisis has been how easily Britons have accepted the lockdown . Some people seem to positively enjoy it.To some it brings back the spirit of the Blitz a feeling of solidarity. To others fewer cars and planes are an indication of the more green lestyle we ought to be living.Its good that people have managed to cope with these restrictions. But when polls indicate that many people would be prepared to put up with a y extension of the lockdown I begin to worry.An economic interruption of this kind carries massive costs and can only be borne for a limited period. Any extension will become extremely dficult for the economy to bear.The OBR, the Governments independent forecaster, floated the possibility of a fall in output of the economy of  per cent for the period April to June.That is beyond anything that has previously been imagined. It wasn’t a definite forecast butit happened the effects on jobs and living standards would be more than devastating.Some describe this economic crisis as the worst in modern times. It may be the worst ever. That doesn’t mean we cant recover. We can and we certainly will.But its important to be patient. Commentators talk about the economy bouncing back, a so called V shaped recovery.This seems unlikely The economy may bounce back but only up to a certain point not necessarily the same point as before. Some firms will have gone out of business, others will have run up debts, some have missed orders that aren’t repeated.How long all these problems last depends on the lockdown. The longer the lockdown, the deeper the downturn. So it is vitally urgent that the Government relax the lockdown as soon as the scientists feel that the peak of the epidemic has been flattened and that it is appropriate.This isn’t about choosing the economy or lives. A flattened economy costs lives too. Even when we relax the lockdown many will still be nervous and may not want to go out to spend money.The continuing need for social distancing will pose problems for hospitality and other businesses and hold back a full recovery. Rishi Sunak, the Chancellor has been bold, promising to do “whatever it takes” to steer the economy through these perilous waters.His scheme for furloughing jobs with the Government paying up to £ a month of peoples wages has helped to prevent firms getting rid of people that they could not afford But it is eye wateringly expensive with costs estimated at up to £billion.Clearly it cannot continue indefinitely. Ironically the generosity of the scheme may have anaesthetised the public to the scale of the crisis we are facing.Butthe Government lts some of the restrictions soon and the economy starts to recover , what should the Chancellor do in his Budget in November  Of course we don’t know exactly what the figures will look like and we must wait to see before final judgements.Almost certainly he will be confronting a massively reduced economy, groaning under skyscraping debt, higher unemployment and only a gradual recovery.Horric as the borrowing figures will be it would be a mistake to move quickly to reduce the debt before the recovery is firmly established.He should let borrowing take the strain in the short term. Any measures to rein in the deficit should be for later. In order to boost jobs he might cut National Insurance or make a temporary cut in VAT designed to bring forward spending.Keir Starmer gave a menacing hint of his approach when he said there would have to be “a day of reckoning” and hinted at tax increases on the better off as though they were to blame.That would be precisely the wrong approach. As the economy gets back to maybe  per cent of where it was before the Chancellor needs to do all he can to support business.He has recently given some generous help to new high tech start ups. Well and good, but it will be important to continue to support existing businesses.It should never be forgotten that firms that have failed in this crisis have not failed though any fault of their own. This down turn is not a normal recession caused by market forces, a rise in interest rates or overheating.No this recession and the bankruptcies have been caused by the Government’s measures rightly introduced to contain the virus. So the Government should not feel embarrassed about continuing some of their schemes to support inidual businesses and indeed they have a duty to do so.The Chancellor sets the framework but ultimately growth does not come from Governments, it comes from iniduals and firms. The way to growth and recovery is to give them the freedom and the incentives and the rest will follow.But while they are helping save lives, who is there to help them The Sun has launched an appeal to raise £MILLION for NHS workers. The Who Cares Wins Appeal aims to get vital support to staff in their hour of need.We have teamed up with NHS Charities Together in their urgent Covid- Appeal to ensure the money gets to exactly who needs it.The Sun is donating £, and we would like YOU to help us raise a million pounds, to help THEM. No matter how little you can spare, please donate today here: www.thesun whocareswinsappeal.Raising taxes in the current climate is not something the Government is likely to want to do.But the scale of the economic crisis now gripping the UK means they may end up feeling they have little option.So far the Chancellor has done what he had to do to protect businesses and workers from enforced shutdowns. The cost will have to come from somewhere.It is estimated the furloughing scheme alone will cost at least £billion. At the same time, tax receipts have noseed as earnings have decreased and fewer people are spending in the shops.As a result, the Office for Budget Responsibility estimates that public- sector borrowing will increase by an eye-watering £billion above the earlier forecast.The black hole in the country’s finances left by Covid- means that at some point, the Chancellor is going to have to face the uncomfortable issue of whether taxes will go up.Any rises must be set against the need to ensure nothing chokes the ­economic recovery, which will be vital.We must also guard against hitting the most hard-up in society. And ­crucially, we need to ensure we don’t make it unprofitable for dynamic small companies to operate.One option for the Chancellor is to target the big multi-nationals and billionaires who use tax havens to avoid paying their fair share.Yet we will also need to have big business on our side as we try to recover, so it is a delicate balancing act.Our priority right now still has to be protecting the vulnerable and health workers from another Covid- outbreak.Get Britains best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day - find out more.But it is time too for the Government to think seriously about how to restart the economy as quickly as possible.Two days ago came news that Jaguar and Aston Martin will restart production in May. The Chancellor needs to help other companies follow suit.The more successful he is, the likelier he will be able to limit the number of extra taxes he has to raise in the months ahead.We are backing a proposal by Lord Ashcroft to honour our health heroes with the gallantry gong given for acts of bravery that did not take place in battle.A No spokesman said: “The NHS is doing a fantastic job and the nation will want to find a way to say thank you when we have defeated this virus.” SAS hero Andy McNab added: “The award of a George Cross would show an emotional appreciation.”We are asking our readers to please sign the petition below.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It has taken pressure off the NHS. The “sombrero” curve has been flattened.Crucially, we now have spare hospital capacity and, despite a shortage of protective equipment, our NHS frontline has avoided meltdown.Yet we continue to hear the dismal dirge, “Stay home, protect the NHS, save lives”, to the muffled drums of the BBC and its throat-slitting Thought For The Day.While some are breaking those rules, many more — especially the over-s — are too terried to poke their nose outdoors evenit’s safe.So non-Covid hospital wards are empty and countless worried patients are missing le-saving treatment for cancer, kidney or heart disease.Others in lockdown are prone to mental health problems, suicide and fast-rising domestic brutality.

Dirt-poor families in Africa and Asia — reliant on cash sent home by migrant children — are seeing those lelines severed overnight.In America, where Depression-style unemployment is close to million, the revolt against lockdown is already under way.Lockdown is prolonging the worldwide agony. This email from Cambridge post office manager and Sun reader Rob Swt sums up the view of many baffled Sun readers. Rob says: “We allow customers in to match the number serving and everyone has PPE.“At no point has anybody had symptoms or gone absent through coronavirus. We use our common sense then go home to our families before doing it all again the next day.“Along with supermarkets, building sites and some small shops, we have been open throughout and at no point have cases risen to the extent we have had to close down.”If lockdown continues for too long, many of those one- in-four firms which have already stopped trading will not reopen. High streets will look like a row of rotten teeth. Some school children will never catch up.On his first day back at work on Monday, the Prime Minister faces a tough challenge.An earlyto work will provoke left-wing charges that money means more than lives to the Tories.

No matter how little you can spare, please donate today here: www.thesun whocareswinsappeal.Only a fortnight ago, elections were held for the country’s National Assembly, won overwhelmingly by the ruling Democratic Party.This week, restrictions on churches and gyms will be relaxed.From early May the South Korean football and baseball leagues will resume, though at first in empty venues.So how has South Korea avoided the kind of crisis that has gripped so many western countries, including our own What is the secret of its success  The answer can be found in a national strategy that combines social responsibility with organisational efficiency, governmental foresight, and sophisticated technology.At heart, South Korea has been better prepared than most.That is largely because the nation was badly shaken by the outbreaks of the respiratory syndromes SARS and MERS earlier in the century.Criticism of the Government’s mismanagement was especially strong after MERS in , which left  people dead.In the wake of this condemnation, testing capacity for a pandemic was drastically expanded, supplies of personal protective equipmentwere strengthened, hospitals were equipped with infection control units, and plans for nationwide information campaigns were put in place.So when the first Covid- deaths occurred in China in January, the South Korea state was ready to swing into action, guided by the principles of “test, trace and contain.”Immediately, a Coronavirus taskforce ordered the swt development of a practical diagnostic test that could identy people who had been infected.The job was completed with amazing efficiency.Within just a week, a reliable testing kit had been approved and put into production.There followed a huge programme of testing, often at the rate of , a day, carried out through a vast network  centres and  drive-through facilities.By March , while Britain was still struggling, South Korea had tested over , people.From the start, screening was also applied to all arrivals at Korean airports, including national citizens, something our own Government has never attempted until now.This testing regime was backed up by a huge effort both to trace all the contacts of those who test positive for Covid  and to alert the public to the presence of disease carriers.In this drive, South Korea has the advantage that its population has embraced online and mobile technology so eagerly.This is, after all, the land of mobile telecoms giant Samsung and computer colossus LG.Thanks to such sophistication, the movements of the infected can therefore be uncovered through phone records, GPS tracking, financial statements and CCTV images.This data enables the Korean Centre for Disease Control and Prevention to send text messages, in real time, to mobile users, telling them of any cases in their vicinity.The information also means that the contacts of carriers can be advised to take extra precautions or go into self-isolation.It is an ultra-modern approach that reflects South Korea’s culture.“Koreans are super-good at making things convenient for people. We don’t have any patience. South Korea is one of the most wired countries in the world, where everybody uses cell-phones for just about everything and the Government is able to use all our phones not only to track but to send warnings,” said Kee Park, a lecturer in public health at Hard in the USA.Some might argue all this hi-tech testing and tracing represents a worrying descent into the authoritarian world of Big Brother.But the level of intrusion should not be exaggerated.These text alerts do not reveal any inidual’s name and address, only their gender and age category.Moreover, “track and trace” technology is far less draconian that the European lockdowns.Nor is it correct to pretend that South Koreans are more submissive than westerners.In reality, the country has been a stable, pluralist democracy since .The public’s willingness to challenge the Government was graphically highlighted by huge mass protests held from October  to March  against President Park Geun-Hye over allegations of corruption.More than .million people took to the streets, eventually bringing about her impeachment and downfall.Far from being some downtrodden state, South Korea is more advanced than many parts of the west and this has further helped in the fight against the virus.Its health service is so well managed that it was ranked the best in the world in a  global study by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development .There was never any danger of it being overwhelmed, as our own Government feared might happen to the NHS.Again, in contrast to the centralised bureaucracy of the NHS, the South Korean model is privately run, with  per cent of the population covered by compulsory national health insurance.The same spirit of efficiency can be seen right across the Korean infrastructure.Trains, buses and urban metro systems are renowned for their punctuality.Incheon airport, the country’s largest, was ranked the best in the world for  consecutive years from .A dynamic economy, with high levels of exports, ensures that the South Korean population is affluent and well-educated, with more than  per cent of young people going to university.But this prosperity is accompanied by widespread social responsibility, reflected in the strong work ethic and a lower crime rate than most industrialised nations.Respect for others is also shown in the universal willingness to wear face masks, not so much as a barrier against infection but as a means of preventing the spread of disease.A refusal to don one is seen as a social offence, just as Koreans use hand sanitisers everywhere and do not object to the heat sensors that exist in many office buildings to read their temperatures.It is not unusual for citizens to have their temperatures checked a dozen times a day.The climate of solidarity has helped South Korea come through the worst.Its experience provides a lesson to the rest of the world.As Jerome Kim, the Director of the International Vaccine Institute in Seoul puts, it, South Korean contained the virus “through decisive, transparent leadership based on data, not emotion.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

For every Peter Kay, who you want to see, there are three members of The Mash Report team, who you really don’t. There are also corporate sponsors to satisfy and a surprise appearance from Prince William, in a Blackadder spin-off sketch, with Stephen Fry, asking: “Have you seen anything good on TV ” .On the face of it then, it looked impossible to separate the wheat from all that celebrity chaff.In reality, though, it was surprisingly easy, because lockdown TV has already taught us song and dance can still work, even on Skype,the artists are as good as Dave Grohl and the others, who collaborated on Times Like These, or as talented and attractive as the Strictly professionals.Just as obviously, we’ve learned to rely on the internet for laughs this past month, because television comedy isn’t anywhere near funny enough to see us through a crisis. Thursday night wasn’t ever going to change that opinion, but it did highlight a ide.Eventhey were phoning in the performances, there were a group of comedians some viewers will have been excited to see, like Coogan, Brydon, Dawn French, Little Britain etc, who all had careers before . And there were a group of comedians who’ve been forced on us, since then, who aren’t comedians at all. At best, they’re pub-funny show-offs — at worst they’re political propagandists trying to bend us to their will.Get Britains best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day - find out more.The contrast could not have been better illustrated by the segment where modern Mash Report types and old-school stand-ups were given about ten seconds to make us laugh and the only one who could nail it was Tim Vine, who appeared with a placard reading “Bad” and a punchline: “That’s not a good sign is it.”An actual punchline! On the BBC! It’s one of the many things that’s been missing from the network, for years, though I was glad long-suffering viewers didn’t punish TBNI for past failures. Thursday was hardly the time for mass recriminations.At some point in the future, though, someone has to try to explain to the BBC that we prefer comedians who make us laugh rather than tell us off, andthere was a reason why The Big Night In seemed less wearying and slightly more uplting than the usual Comic Relief slog then, beyond the extraordinary circumstances, it was a very obvious one.It only lasted three hours. Less is more, guys.TV astrologer Russell Grant made this uncanny  prediction, for those of us born in the star sign Cancer, late last year, in the Mirror.“Travel is on the cards in the spring and as much as you enjoy your home le, you will appreciate this change of scene.”Yeah, the Sainsbury’s queue was a blast, thanks Russ.“It’s not just The Big Night In, April  is, of course . . .”A St George’s Day B Shakespeare’s birthday C Darren Huckerby’s birthday It was D “The start of Ramadan.”The clue being in the letters BBC, of course.THE Dave channel has been attempting to ease the nation’s ever-present mental health worries via the gt of laughter.A noble cause and a good idea.Unfortunately, they’ve given the all-important job to some of the worst comedians in Britain.Last week, it was the turn of Nish Kumar, Suzi Ruffell, Seann Walsh and Darren Harriott, whose attempts to end Britain’s silent suffering were ided into two separate and contrasting segments.In the first, backstage, they discussed their own experiences of mental health issues, which sounded more like a lot of really bad hangovers, egotism and self-pity, while making the usual heartfelt pleas for tolerance, understanding and a constructive dialogue.’Cos, you know, they’re alive to the fact they’re meant to care.Then Kumar and Ruffell went out on stage and spewed vile, angry foul-mouthed hatred about Boris, Trump, Top Gear, Richard Hammond , fellow comedians and anyone who’s got what Ruffell calls “lazy opinions”.That is to say, anyone who has the temerity to hold a dferent political opinion to her own.Not a single word of it was funny, let alone healing.Darren Harriott, the least worst of them, though, did at least have the decency to provide the necessary cue.“I struggle to give people all of me ’cos I’m always worried they’re going to go, they’re going to disappear and . . .”Click.He’s got a point, hasn’t he.Paul Merson: “Bournemouth seem to keep coming up without answers.”Micah Richards: “The way he carried his body language was outstanding.”Matt Le Tissier: “Spurs are never going to win the league in a million years.

He’s not the only one on that show, either. There’s strong competition to be the biggest one from Bluto-ish oaf Tony Bellew, the former world cruiserweight boxing champion, who’s got an even shorter fuse than Fashanu.Both have already been called in for fairly urgent “questioning” by the SAS instructors who always hold the whip hand during these interrogations as, at the first hint of vanity, derangement, pretension or self-delusion, Ant Middleton can shout “GUARD!” and Billy bundles them off with a hood over their head.If it was just a hardman staring contest, of course, the show wouldn’t work.

It is a colossal assault on the body.You are physically put through the wringer so the recovery process, depending on your age and fitness level, is going to be a slow process.Patients will suffer from fatigue, in the same way that somebody runs over the marathon line, then collapses and their legs turn to jelly, and they may need help learning how to walk again.After she and husband Tom Hanks recovered from the virus, Rita Wilson admitted she was suffering from brain fog and memory loss, and a muddled brain has also been flagged as a symptom to watch out for, along with headaches.Your brain is unlikely to be starved of oxygen while on a ventilator and, when struggling to breathe, the body prioritises oxygen to the brain, shutting down other organs first, so its unlikely to suffer permanent damage.But Dr Bharat Pankhania, an expert in infectious diseases who has advised on previous SARS and Ebola pandemics, says nerve damage could affect your brain .It is well known that the coronavirus can harm or affect the kidneys, but it may also have an effect on the central nervous system, he says.Its important to watch out for new signs and symptoms which are unusual, such as headaches, dizziness, vertigo and tingling.Although being on a ventilator means your brain wont have been starved of oxygen, it is very important to watch out for what we call ‘deficit’ - meaning memory loss, the brain working a little bit slower than before, impaired speech or any other signs that the central nervous system has been affected.You should consult a doctorany of these occur.As the virus affects the lungs, and leads to viral pneumonia, there could be permanent damage to the lung tissue.This means shortness of breath will continue for weeks after leaving hospital.Theof time it takes to recover from a severe bout of Covid- will depend on the patient, Dr Gill says.As a -year-old triathlete,I ended up in ICU, I would hope to recover in terms of straightforward mobility within three to six weeksBut lets take Mrs. Bloggs, who is  and doesnt have a particularly active lestyle. I would expect it to take a lot longer - months more than weeks.In survivors of SARS, which also caused breathing dficulties,  to  per cent were still reporting reduced exercise tolerance and X-rays showed evidence of lung changes,  months after the infection.What we have seen of Covid- so far, even people whove had mild to moderate symptoms are still finding they are short of breath three to four weeks later, Dr Gill adds.Colleagues who had mild symptoms told me it took two weeks before they could walk up three or four steps without stopping for breath. And these are fit young people.But everything about this virus is unpredictable. We had a patient at the surgery who has a lot of respiratory problems and was in hospital for other things when she contracted coronavirus.I would have bet money we would lose that patient but, thankfully, she wasn’t badly affected at all.She had a bit of a cough and has gone home now. I was absolutely astonished.We are asking our readers to please sign the petition below.While people will all recover at dferent rates, going back to work or starting to exercise too early could seriously hamper progress, says Dr Pankhania.The virus causes inflammation in the lungs and the air sacs become very inflamed, red, raw and wounded, he explains.Recovery starts when the patient is able to breathe properly by themselves and when the inflammation is subdued.But for the repair process to work, the patient has to allow the body to recuperate, and that means rest and sleep.Dr Pankhania says it would be unwise for somebody who has had a viral pneumonia to get back to full activities straight away, especiallyit entails strenuous work, because youre not allowing the healing process to take time.How long that process takes is very inidual. For some people, its very rapid, inside two weeks, but for some it might go on for six to eight weeks.Whatever your fitness level, I would suggest at least three months rest from strenuous exercise because this inflammatory process can be simmering away.If you ran k before the illness, pace yourself and build up very gently. First do a mile, then two and so on.As well as the physical effects of the coronavirus, many patients will suffer mentally in recovery.Being close to death, and often delirious in intensive care, can be the most traumatic experience of a survivors le  and can lead to depression, anxiety, post traumatic stress disorder and other mental health issues.A  study of nearly , UK ICU survivors found that over half had developed at least one of these conditions a year after they leaving hospital.If you have had a tube down your throat to help you breathe, its not unusual for that to have a signicant psychological impact, Dr Gill explains.Even patients who have had the moderate coronavirus have told me they wake at night in a panic, terried because theyve been dreaming they cant breathe.Theres been a huge amount of funding and support and everybody has stood up and said, ‘we need to treat people who are sick with Covid-’. Yes, without a shadow of a doubt that was the right thing to do.But my worry is whether the nutritionists, the physiotherapists and the psychologists will have the funding to help these people afterwards.Rest, sleep and a healthy diet are the key to a full recovery, says Dr Pankhania, and he advises survivors not to rush back to work.People ought not to feel pressurised toto work when they are still feeling unwell or theyre exhibiting signs and symptoms of illness, he says.It is a well-known fact that good nutrition is very important to the recovery process, as is sleep.Smoking will impede the repair process and so will too much exercise.It is also important to avoid secondary infections in the lungs, which can have a severe consequences, so keeping up to date with flu jabs and pneumococcal vaccines, for those who are at risk, is essential.For the majority of Covid- sufferers, there is unlikely to be any long term damage, but Dr Pankhania says they should be on the lookout for anything unusual.Looking at other severe infections, I would expect most patients to make a full recovery with no after effects, he says.But it is still important to be watchful for signs and symptoms, because with any signicant infection, sometimes people are left with a long term deficits.”However, there may be some complications that are unpredictable.This is a new virus and we had no concept this even existed in October last year, so a lot of research is being done very, very quickly by the wonderful lab technicians, microbiologists and the scientists, to scale up testing and help us combat this, says Dr Gill.We are learning about Covid as we go along and it’s safe to say it would not be surprisingsome patients had a long term effects as a result of the virus.

communist despot Kim Jong-un spends his blood-soaked billions on while his North Korean citizens live in destitution and fear.Rumours are currently swirling about the brutal dictators health after he disappeared from public le three weeks ago, with some even suggesting that hes died.US officials speculate that hes actually taken his private luxury train to shelter from the coronavirus in the resort town of Wonsan.But as always, the shadowy communist state has kept the countrys citizens and the world in the dark about Kim Jong-uns private le.Thats been the autocrats MO since becoming Supreme Leader of North Korea in , ruthlessly protecting his own interests by executing members of his own family and allowing over  million people to starve.What the state hasnt been able to hide, however, is Kims extraordinarily excessive lestyle.Hes estimated to be worth at least billionand likes to splurge it like most billionaires — on fleets of luxury vehicles, a sprawling property portfolio and the best culinary delights money can illegally import.Thats in stark contrast to the estimated  per cent of North Koreas million citizens who currently live below the poverty line, struggling to survive.From his string of palaces to his multimillion-dollar watch collection, heres the inside story of Kim Jong-uns lavish lestyle.While its not clear where Kim is right now, he has a breath-taking number of hideaways to choose from.He reportedly owns  palaces dotted around North Korea, including one with its own m airstrip in Wonsan where hes currently suspected to be sheltering.But his main residence, Central Luxury Mansion, is in the countrys capital, Pyongyang.The nuclear attack-proof palace is protected by multiple military units along with a high-voltage electric fence and even minefields.It even has its own train station underneath and has tunnels connecting it to some of his other properties.But when he wants to cut loose, Kim also boasts the same billionaire must-have that Richard Branson is known for — his own private party island.NBA legend Dennis Rodman, who has an unlikely friendship with Kim, told The Sun about a hedonistic week-long bender on the island in .Kim’s island is amazing, Rodman said.It’s like going to Hawaii or Ibiza — but he’s the only one that lives there.“Hes got  to  people around him all the time — just normal people, drinking cocktails and laughing the whole time.If you drink a bottle of tequila, its the best tequila.Everything you want, he has the best.Rodman also got a rare glimpse inside Kims luxury yacht.He described the ft vessel as a cross between a ferry and a Disney boat.His ship is thought to be a British-designed Princess MY worth around million, boasting staterooms, a wide deck, and a dining room for up to ten people.But when hes not on his yacht, he can be found jetting around the country aboard Air Force Un — a luxury Russian IL- jetliner worth millions.Kims even said to enjoy having a go at the controls of the plane, despite not having any known flying qualications.North Korean leaders before him were known to favour travelling by armoured train.Kims father, Kim Jong-il, even died aboard his luxury train, which was said to have  carriages featuring bedrooms and conference rooms kitted out in high-end foreign-made furniture.Kims own train has many of the same trimmings and is also known to carry his Mercedes-Maybach Pullman Guard armoured limousine, worth around million.Thats just one of his -strong fleet of predominantly European luxury cars.His train is also believed to be staffed by lady conductors picked from his Pleasure Squad or Gippeumjo.This group of , or so women are medically certied as virgins and are paid to entertain Kim and other high-ranking officials, primarily through sex.His secret harem is itself another source of Kims staggering splurges.In  alone, he splashed out £.m on fancy lingerie — including racy corsets and suspenders — imported from China.International sanctions are supposed to stop Kim importing luxury goods, but he spent at least £million in  on a whole host of illegal imports including musical instruments, booze, and a seaplane.His personal collection of wristwatches is estimated to be worth over million.Kim was pictured wearing a £, IWC Portofino Automatic Swiss watch during a nuclear missile test last year as his nation starved.But the tyrant never goes hungry himself.Hes known to favour decadent dishes like foie gras, lobster and caviar and he takes a team of his own chefs with him on international trips.They spend up to an hour tasting each of his meals before serving them to him to make sure they havent been poisoned.And when it comes to Kim picking his own poison, he ships in thousands of bottles of whiskey from all over the world for his personal enjoyment every year.Hes believed to fork out £million a year on swanky booze like Hennessey, which can cost £, a bottle.Kim even accompanies his tipples with French designer cigarettes made by Yves Saint Laurent, costing £ a pack.And his wild spending also extends to his pastimes.Kim has been known to be a huge fan of basketball, with posters of Michael Jordan and the Chicago Bulls adorning his bedroom walls as a schoolboy studying in Switzerland.Three members of the Harlem Globetrotters even travelled to North Korea to put on a bizarre exhibition game in , which is how he cemented his friendship with Dennis Rodman.But Kim is also known to love and own a number of thoroughbred horses.Hes spent at least , on  purebred horses between  and , according to Russian customs data.Many propaganda images show Kim trekking up snowy mountains on a white stallion, which he believes instil confidence in his regime.And hes also using the countrys mountains to build a string of luxury ski resorts, with the latest opening its slopes in February this year.Kim pumped some £million into the nations biggest resort,

No matter how little you can spare, please donate today here: www.thesun whocareswinsappeal.Dr Daniel Koch, head of the infectious diseases unit at the Federal Office of Public Health, told reporters in Berne that the under- tens with no symptoms could freely hug their grandparents again.He added: “Children are very rarely infected and do not pass on the virus. That is why small children pose no risk to high-risk patients or grandparents.”The research followed a French study which showed a nine-year-old British boy who caught the virus while skiing had not passed it on despite contact with  others.Hopes rose further when Education Secretary Gavin Williamson told MPs he was looking at plans for children in Years ,  and  toto school first.But doubts were quickly cast on the Swiss research by British medics.Prof Russell Viner, president of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, said: “We don’t think that it would be a good idea for children to hug their grandparents in the UK without more data.“We think that children probably transmit Covid- less than adults.“But we need to be sure — and we would need to have a lot more data, particularly because grandparents are in the vulnerable group.”That caution has been echoed by the US-Chinese study looking at , close contacts of  people infected in the province of Shenzhen.Of those, seven per cent of young children caught the virus — the same proportion as in adults and older children. But most children displayed no symptoms.Prof Simon Clarke, of the University of Reading, told The Times: “This is an important paper. It means we should be extremely careful.“Reopening schools could expose parents, grandparents and teachers to infection and anyone they might come into contact with, risking a second wave.”Tom Wingfield, of the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine, said: “We should definitely consider children as a pool for infection.“In terms of what it means for transmission rates though, the honest answer is, we still don’t know definitively.“Given they are less symptomatic, we can at least suspect they are not spraying out as much with coughing and sneezing.”Last night, the German study of , patients also found no signicant dference between young and old. It concluded: “Based on these results, we have to caution against an unlimited re-opening of schools and kindergartens at present.”But Dr Ebere Okereke, of Public Health England, added to confusion by saying younger children were less likely to be affected and — unlike with the flu — less likely to be transmitters.She added: “Traditionally, we associate children as people transmitting respiratory infections. This doesn’t seem to be the case here. And why is this dferent  We don’t know.”THESE reports do not alter the debate about whether or not children shouldto school.It is a balance of risks. Keeping pupils at home will damage their education, cause mental health problems, language problems and increase the gap between the rich and the poor.Yet, allowing pupils to go back risks a second pandemic waveit is not done carefully.What we need to do is get as many children as possible back into education.We could split year groups into mornings or afternoons only or they could do one week on and one week off to cut down social contact.When the Government does relax the lockdown, probably the safest group to be out there is children. So ministers should plan for the reopening of schools to start early in the exit.The swine flu outbreak of  dropped like a stone when the schools broke up for summer. Then, within a few weeks of the schools going back, we had a second wave of the disease.It is important to say there is a lot of conflicting evidence. The Swiss government, for example, took evidence from scientists and concluded children under ten do not transmit the virus.But the truth is we do not yet know enough about this virus.

Make it with orange juice and a g serving of fruit jelly sees you tick off  per cent of your recommended daily intake of vitamin C.It is also a rich source of folate, which you need for healthy nerves.Not only that, oranges and orange juice give us the super-nutrient hesperitin, which can help with your bone health and immune system.Scientists in Italy say it can also help to lower bad cholesterol, while boosting good cholesterol, reduce inflammation and bring down blood pressure.These provide a sixth of your daily recommended fibre and more than a quarter of your vitamin C, which is vital for immunity and good skin.A g serving has  calories, less than a portion of fries.A store cupboard staple, rice pudding is a rich source of copper and iodine, for healthy skin and metabolism, and bone-building calcium.A g portion has g of protein, g of fat and just  calories.You don’t need it to be Christmas for an excuse to get out the cheeseboard. And there’s even more reason to now that stilton is a superfood.The bacteria Penicillium roqueforti, which creates the blue veins and characteristic flavour, produces metabolites that boost your health, according to scientists.Lab tests revealed the compound andrastin produces anti-tumor molecules and mycophenolic acid, which is an anti-fungal super-nutrient.But watch your serving size as it is high in fat and calories.Stick with a sensible g wedge and you will have just  calories and .g fat.Beanz meanz . . . high in protein. A g serving – half a shop-bought can – has around g, about the same as you would find in an egg.And just three heaped tablespoons of beans makes up one of your five-a-day.They are also high in fibre, giving you a third of your g recommended daily intake, much of which is soluble, meaning it attracts water and makes you feel fuller for longer. So less temptation to snack between meals.Baked beans are packed with iron, with g giving you more than a oz grilled steak.Another benefit is they are super cheap.These are simply hard-boiled eggs that have been preserved in distilled vinegar once cooled.The white of each pickled egg contains g of protein, just half of what a ml serving of milk contains.Not only are they filling, the eggs are rich in vitamin D, needed to absorb calcium for strong bones, B for healthy nerves, iodine for a good metabolism and selenium for immunity.All this goodness is packed into less than  calories per egg.Chop up a bunch of cabbage, onion and carrot and combine with low-fat mayonnaise for a coleslaw full of antioxidant ­carotenes and sulphur-based super nutrients.Eat g for one of your five-a-day.Filling ravioli in a tomato sauce is rich in antioxidant lycopene, linked to a reduced risk of heart disease.It boasts iron and has just  calories in a g serving, with g fat and g protein. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The support organisation helps parents facing all sorts of challenges, from isolation to health problems, poverty and more. Home visits are out of the question at the minute, but her volunteer is dropping off bits of shopping when she can and offering support over the phone. That help has never been more vital than it is right now.Read more about our  Give Me Five campaignStaceyaposs parents died within a year of each other when Stacey was just  and while Mattaposs parents live nearby, theyaposve yet to meet Logan in the flesh - only seeing him on a video call. Understandably itaposs taken its toll on her mental health and sheaposs gone from not being on any medication, to taking anti-anxiety tablets three times a day. It hasnapost helped that I had to give birth without Matt there as he needed to be with Frankie, so I had my cousin with me, said Stacey. At two weeks old Logan needed emergency surgery for a hernia as well so I was so worried about that. We almost lost him. I struggle to even talk about it. Their daily trip out is either a walk around the block, or more typically a -minute walk to their nearest Tesco Extra. But once there, the shopping trip is far from easy. I know everyone has to queue but sometimes it can take that long. Logan will start screaming, Frankie will be crying because heaposs crying and then Iaposm trying to breastfeed in the queue. The security are starting to recognise me now and one of them offered me a seat near the toilets, but on one trip I was asked to leave my buggy at the door with both children inside. I refused and said they must be madthey thought I would leave them there.  It can be hard to even get what you need. Sometimes the right size nappies will be out of stock, or I canapost get hold of baby wipes. Itaposs so dficult. When she sees other people still mixing and hearing parties and barbecues happening near her home, Stacey feels others arenapost taking the lockdown seriously enough. The -year-old said: Iaposve seen people in groups and can hear them having parties and I just think why am I making this sacrice and being stuck in here when nobody seems to be taking this seriously  Iaposm not sitting here for the fun of it. If people had stuck to the rules in the first place then it might not be going on for as long as it is. Sheaposs been asking Rochdale Borough Housing for a bigger property since before she had her first child but says she is now desperate to get out.  She was told to keep a record of problems from noise and drug-taking nearby but only recently discovered the case had been closed without her knowledge. I know Iaposve now been given higher priority but it will might take another year to get out of here, said Stacey. I just feel as though thereaposs no support for people like me and I feel like such a bad mother because my children are living like this. Home-Start says there are many parents like Stacey who are in need of support and the organisation is expecting that number to grow as the full impact of the pandemic comes comes to light. Donna Arden-McKenna, CEO of Home-Start Rochdale and Bury, said: “Our worry for families is two-fold. We are extremely worried for those families who were already in crisis before covid- took hold, be that through poverty, poor mental health, or fleeing domestic abuse, but we are also worried about families who were already isolated and are now increasingly isolated. We must remember that in , not every family has a family support network nearby, we support many families where this is the case.

That is the R number or R , which measures a diseases ability to spread. When R is  every infected person infects one other person - spreading the coronavirus. If R is below  then every infected person is passing it on to less than one person and the spread of the infection slowly but surely sinks. For weeks Downing Street and the Governmentaposs economic advisers have been clear - R must drop below one and stay there for the lockdown to be eased. At the peak of the spread of Covid- in March R was , meaning for every one person infected they were passing it on to three more people. Today Sir Patrick Vallance, the UK’s chief scientic adviser, said scientists think the R rate -- is currently between . and . in the UK. He noted however that it may be higher and lower than that range in dferent parts of the country. Sir Patrick said there has been a decrease in the number of cases, as well as a decrease in the number of deaths from Covid-. He said: The number of new cases is down, thataposs turning into fewer admissions, fewer people in hospital, fewer people in intensive care and weaposre beginning to see that decrease in deaths. Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty said that while the progress was good there was no answer about what the number should remain at for lockdown measures to end. He said: There isnapost a perfect answer to what the R should be, but the wrong answer is anything above one.It came as Boris Johnson said the UK is past the peak of the coronavirus outbreak - and that he will reveal a comprehensive plan on coming out of the lockdown next week. At the Prime Ministeraposs first appearance at the daily coronavirus briefing for more than a month he declared that the UK was officially past the peak of Covid- infections.At no stage has our NHS been overwhelmed, no patient went without a ventilator, no patient was deprived of intensive care, we have five of the seven projected Nightingale wards, he said. It is thanks to that massive collective effort to shield the NHS that we avoided an uncontrollable and catastrophic epidemic where the reasonable worst-case scenario was , deaths. I can confirm today that for the first time we are past the peak of this disease. We are past the peak and on the downward slope.

But the Prime Minister still faces calls to at least spell outhowheaposll decide when itaposs time to give the public a break. Labour call it light at the end of the tunnel.So how will scientists and ministers decide when to relax the lockdown Well, for weeks now theyaposve had five tests: the NHS is able to cope a sustained fall in deaths and new infections adequate testing and PPE and no risk of second peak that overwhelms the NHS. But the problem those tests are hard to measure. For example, not even the first peak overwhelmed the NHS - but it still killed more than , people and counting, and required a nationwide lockdown. So tonight the Prime Minister is expected to set out a little more of his thinking - and his spokesman says it all boils down to the crucial aposRapos number. R is the number of people who are infected, on average, by each person carrying Covid-. At the start of the outbreak without any controls in place, reports suggest it was between  and .  That meant the virus spread exponentially and terryingly, doubling in the community every few days. Lockdown measures mean the R number is now below , because hardly anyone is mixing with anyone . So when they get sick, the virus bounces around their home then dies out. The PMaposs spokesman said: We don’t want to relax the social distancing measures which could lead to the virus - which the British public have done so much to suppress - being able to spread in an exponential way again. That will guide our approach as we move forward.  The key to easing lockdown will be to work out changes that are enough to open up society, but not enough to push that crucial R number back above . The PMaposs official spokesman said: The dference between an R rate above  and below  is that it reflects the number of people who an infected person is passing the disease onto. Soit is below one it means you are having success in suppressing the spread of the disease. If it’s above  it means every person who has the virus is passing it on to others. So why is this such a big focus  Well, because it is key to every one of those five tests. The NHS will only be able to copethe R number is low enough. There will only be a sustained fall in new deaths, and new infections,the R number remains low. Adequate testing and quick isolation of infected people will help keep the R number lower. And of course,the R number is lower, it will help avoid a second peak that overwhelms the NHS. Thataposs why government ministers are planning for a partial easing of lockdown - where it could be relaxed in some ways and tightened in others.

To mark International Workers’ Day this May Day, the TUC is launching its #ThankAWorker campaign. People are being urged to praise frontline staff – such as an NHS worker, carer, bus driver or postie – through things such as posting a thank you video on social media. TUC general secretary Frances O’Grady believes the workers are not just worthy of gratitude, they should also get more money. She said: “Everyone who’s kept Britain going through this pandemic deserves a pay rise.” At least  NHS staff and  in social care have died of the coronavirus. The TUC says workers putting their lives at risk should be rewarded with fair pay and conditions. An analysis by the union organisation found that once inflation is taken into account average public sector pay is £ lower than it was in  when the Tories took power. The figures show nurses and community nurses on NHS band five are over £, worse off, some residential care workers are £, down and ambulance drivers £,. In social care, seven in  staff earn less than £ an hour. One in four workers in adult social care is on a zero-hour contract. Nurses in the UK earn an average of £. an hour.  It’s £. in Germany, £. in Australia and £. in Italy. Our hospital support staff such as porters, cleaners and healthcare assistants earn around £, a year on average. The TUC is calling for the minimum wage to be increased from £. an hour to £, a ban on zero-hours contracts, an increase in sick pay, and for outsourced workers to be brought back into the public sector. Ms O’Grady said: “Frontline workers are putting their health on the line to look after the rest of us. They’re caring for the sick and vulnerable, getting us to work, keeping shelves stocked and vital services running. “Now it’s time for ministers to give key workers a proper thank you. And that means getting money into their pockets now. “The Government must give all key workers the pay, conditions and respect they deserve.” The call is being backed by almost all the major unions. USDAW general secretary Paddy Lillis said: “Millions of low-paid workers in supermarkets, distribution warehouses, food processing sites and home delivery operations have provided essential services... through this crisis.  “There must be lasting changes to the way society views low-paid key workers. It can’t be right that key workers in supermarkets, who are keeping communities fed, visit foodbanks to feed their own families.” Unite chief Len McCluskey said: “It’s time they receive their fair share of the wealth they create – decent pay alongside safe and secure work.” He said Unite “together with our sister unions the GMB and CWU” want a “new deal for all working people”. He added: “There can be no going back to business as usual.” Unison general secretary Dave Prentis said: “The pandemic has made everyone recognise the debt we owe key workers.  “When this is over, their extraordinary efforts must be properly rewarded. “A complete overhaul of the way society values its care workers is a priority.” The Mirror celebrates key workers The Daily Mirroraposs columnists have shared their personal stories of valued key workers who have made a dference in their lives as they stay home during the pandemic. Paul Routledge - aposWheels keep turningapos Andy the driver of the Number  hopper bus past my door has been doing a grand job. It goes from Skipton to Airedale General Hospital four times a day, via hill villages with no other public transport. He and the rest of the North Yorkshire Council driving team have kept this service on the road throughout the lockdown, even when there were no passengers. Thanks Andy, Steve and all the others taking turns behind the wheel.  Polly Hudson - aposPostie goes extra mileapos Let’s hear it for the shelf-stackers and till operators. Key workers such as Venetia in the Tesco where I buy food for me, my pregnant daughter and her shielding hubby. Smiley and helpful, the supermarket grafter’s calm demeanour is reassuring during the coronavirus plague. Britain’s army of retail workers are horribly exposed in this health emergency, yet are often under-paid and under-appreciated. But we’d starve without these quiet heroes. Kevin Maguire - aposToiling in the aislesapos Like many families in lockdown, we don’t get out much. But when we do get out of our apartment building, I’ve noticed the communal areas, the lts, doors and floors have remained clean and disinfected. This is all down to the wonderful cleaners, who since the start of Covid- have showed up and played their part in keeping us safe. Our cleaners are unsung heroes on the front line who deserve a pay rise for all their efforts. Eva Simpson  - aposThey keep us all safeapos My postman, Gary, has always been great. Our local collection office closed, and the new one’s miles away, so he’ll only leave a card as a very last resort. He lugs parcels back and forth, trying several times to deliver them – he’s just thoughtful like that.

He added the NHS could be put under severe strain akin to the height of the crisis within a matter of days. Ensuring the NHS is not overwhelmed has been the chief aim of the government in handling this crisis.This week, Boris Johnson said they had been successful in achieving this so far.But Prof Willett reportedly said: We did ride that first wave with some spare capacity, but boy was it tight in some parts of the country, and you know that.

Every country seeking to ease lockdown measures now must negotiate an extremely dficult balancing act to keep the pandemic under control, Professor Chris Whitty said in an online Gresham College lecture. In particular, the virus reproduction R number must be kept below one - meaning each infected person could expect to pass it to fewer than one other person on average. Prof Whitty said: We need to make sure that R does not go back above one. Becausenot we will go back to a second wave. It is entirely plausible for a second wave to actually be more severe than the firstit is not mitigated. Every country has got an extremely dficult balancing act, and we all need to be honest about the fact there are no easy solutions here. Covid- is a very long way from finished and eradication is technically impossible for this disease.Outlining several key unknowns about coronavirus, Prof Whitty highlighted seasonality, saying: There may be a seasonal element to this, we donapost know, itaposs too early with this virus. He went on: Itaposs not just in Game Of Thrones that winter is always coming - it is also true in every health service. It may be that thereaposs a seasonal element andso, for most respiratory viruses, they are more likely to be transmitted, there is a higher likelihood of transmission, in the winter. The winter is always worse than summer, spring and autumn for health services, and we need to think about this in terms of how we come out for the next phase. However, he added social distancing measures are likely to reduce rates of flu and other respiratory illnesses when winter arrives. Other key unknowns about Covid- highlighted by Prof Whitty were:The proportion of the population which is infected without symptoms, although it is currently thought to be actually quite low. How long immunity to the virus lasts. Whether blood tests correlate with immunity. How much children contribute to spreading the virus. Why people deteriorate after a week and why men are signicantly more likely to die than women. Speaking at the daily coronavirus briefing Boris Johnson said the ‘R’ number will be the crucial factor in deciding how far to ease the lockdown.This number is the number of people each Covid- carrier infects around them.  It has dferent rates in dferent cities or working environments - but the government is focusing on the national rate. At the start of the pandemic it was said to be between  and . Chief Scientic Advisor Patrick Vallance revealed the national R number is now between . and . - while in London it is . to ..

Frantic Diane Houghtonaposs worst fears came true when -year-old Abbie Houghton was rushed to hospital struggling to breathe and placed on a ventilator. The -year-old would call the Royal Stoke University Hospital every few hours for updates on Abbieaposs condition. After Abbie was flipped onto her front and placed on a nebuliser her symptoms started to improve, Stoke on Trent Live reports. Now beautician Abbie - who lost two stone during the gruelling illness - is continuing her recovery at home following a two-week stay in hospital. Mum-of-two Diane said Abbieaposs battle against the virus started when she developed a sudden temperature on Wednesday, March . She added: Normally sheaposs fine with no health issues but the illness progressed as the week went on. She started to get out of breath. I rang two ambulances on the following Wednesday but the paramedics thought at that point she would be better off managing the illness at home. Our doctor rang the next day and said he wanted her to go in for an X-ray and she never came home. It showed she had developed pneumonia. In the middle of the night they rang to say her condition had deteriorated and she was put on a ventilator in the early hours. It was that evening on Monday, April  that she was transferred to Royal Stoke as they had better equipment to look after her. The fear was that she would continue to get worse and they wouldnapost have been able to do anything for her.

But his patronage ended last year, before he stepped back from royal le and set up his new website.As well as Harry still listing it among  charities he supports, he remained on Map Action’s website until last month. A palace insider said: “It’ll be worrying for others hoping the Sussexes will not abandon their charities.”  Other causes are said to have sought assurances Harry is still committed.  In January, he told charity Sentebale, which he co-founded, how quitting The Firm would hit his position. He said: “We’re not walking away. Our hope was to continue serving the Queen and Commonwealth without public funding. That wasn’t possible.” A spokesman for Harry could not be reached.

The RAF veteran has become the nationaposs hero in the past three weeks, raising £m for the NHS by walking  s of his garden and becoming the oldest person to get to Number  in the charts.His th birthday was celebrated up and down the country, with an RAF flypast involving a Spitfire and a Hurricane, a message from the Prime Minister, and Michael Ball leading a special rendition of Happy Birthday. The Queen also promoted him to colonel in honour of his record-breaking fundraising and for lting the nationaposs spirits during the coronavirus pandemic.Like all new centenarians Captain Tom received a card from the Queen, but his contained a message from the Monarch congratulating him on what heaposs achieved. She asked her official representative for Captain Tomaposs village, the Lord Lieutenant of Bedfordshire, to personally deliver the card. It read: I am so pleased to know that you are celebrating your one hundredth birthday on th April, .  I was also most interested to hear of your recent fundraising efforts for NHS Charities Together at this dficult time. I send my congratulations and best wishes to you on such a special occasion. The card is hand signed Elizabeth R.  Prince William and Camilla have also sent messages of congratulations to Captain Tom. Praising his efforts earlier this month, the Duke said: Itaposs incredible, itaposs amazing. What I love is he is a -year-old war veteran who has been around a long time knows everything. And everyone has been inspired by his story and determination.  He is a one man fundraising machine, good on him. I hope he keeps going. Three weeks ago, Captain Tom started walking in his garden with the aim of raising £, for the NHS. But his challenge soon went viral, and his dedication and selflessness has inspired people from all walks of le. Speaking on BBC Breakfast, she said: Never ever three weeks ago did I ever think I would get anything like this. Itaposs dficult to put into words.  In a birthday message he told the nation: To have such kind people who have made such an effort - thank you all. It hardly feels any dferent to yesterday. I donapost know what it feels like, Iaposve never been  before. But I must say Iaposm absolutely delighted with all the people who have come to wish me a happy birthday and who have been so kind, thank you very much.

Often people might look for a aposfixer upperapos, where they can redecorate the entire house in order to give it a new fresh look. Others might have to compromise on price or location in order to find a new home.  But this perfectly normal looking four-bedroom house has left house-hunters scratching their head after looking inside. The highly unique home in upmarket resort Lytham St Anneaposs, Lancashire, promises ownership of the beach outside the home, huge bedrooms and two garages. It could be the perfect house for families desperate for more space as the huge property includes a sun room, dining room and living room.  But the strange decor has put off many potential house-buyers with one person dubbing it somewhere youaposd be murdered by a aposs cult leader.The unusual styling came to light when author Debora Robertson shared the Rightmove link to the property sold by agents Unique Estate Agency - sarcastically adding: I have questions. Quite a few questions. And as photos of the home move from the standard exterior, to the extravagantly decorated living room, and odd set up in the kitchen, Deboraaposs questions become apparent. Every room in the house is full of personality, but they all seem at odds with each other. One room with glass walls includes a giraffe statue wearing a hat, a clown statue , and a piano.  In the kitchen, an armchair has been set up next to an Aga, with a TV perched nearby, in what seems to be a healthy disregard for fire safety. And one of the bedrooms includes a long dressing table with seats for five people, in case you want to invite your mates around after lockdown to get ready for a night out together. Thereaposs also two clocks next together so you can be sure that youaposll be ready on time. And thereaposs a bed next to a car in one of the garages - which definitely seems to be a terrible idea.  The jawdropping decor has left many people with questions,such as why  or what  or when can I move in  One person wrote: aposDAMN YOU DEBORAH I SHALL NOT SLEEP NOW. Obsessed. The armchairs by and facing the Aga. aposWhether thataposs a bed in the garage or a car in the bedroom. THE BATHROOM.  Author Debora succinctly replied: The chairs lined up against the dressing table, the giraffe, the clown, the absolute certainty that a murder has happened on the premises. Another person quipped: It absolutely is the perfect location for a murder drama. The row of dressing table chairs is utterly baffling. To which Debora replied: I think it was lived in by a family of clowns and that is where they all sat to do their makeup. Historian Lucy Inglis added: Iaposd like to see what a UV light and the apossplatterapos experts turn up there. Meaning in no way would I ever like to see that.

Football players-turned presenters Gary Lineker and Chris Kamara, along with Leicester captain Wes Morgan, Liverpool star Andy Robertson and cricketer Monty Panesar feature in a Show Racism the Red Card video launched on Friday. It follows stories of frontline NHS staff as they recount their experience of racial discrimination at work. With the NHS already experiencing staff shortages before the coronavirus pandemic, the project hopes to highlight how racism within the NHS remains a big issue - despite its survival dependent on its black and minority ethnicworkforce. Lineker, , said: “It’s easy to target and blame immigrants for the problems of this country, when we all know they’ve contributed a hell of a lot. “Would the NHS survive without immigrants filling some of those jobs  Would we have enough nurses or doctors  No.” Of those reported to have experienced racism whilst at work in the NHS, % said the racism was frequent or regular, whilst % said it occurred weekly or even daily. And almost one in  of those who answered the UNISON survey left their jobs as a consequence of the racism they experienced. Yvonne Coghill, a director at NHS England’s Workforce Race Equality Standard, said: “Since its inception in  the NHS has been dependent on its BME workforce to deliver care and services to the population of this country. “We are proud that the NHS is one of the most erse organisations in the country, with one in five of the workforce being from a background other than white British. “The contribution that this group of people makes to enable our NHS to be the best healthcare organisation in the world cannot be underestimated, never more than now during the Covid- crisis. “It is incumbent on all of us, whoever we are and whatever background we are from to stand up to and call out any kind of discrimination or racism in our service.”She highlighted how it tended to be white people in the higher NHS positions, stating that only  BME nurses out of around , are employed at a senior level. Last year Health Secretary Matt Hancock penned a letter to NHS staff stating any patients wishing to be treated by a white doctor ‘must be told no’, and that management ‘must and will always back you up.’ But ITV News revealed that recorded verbal and physical racist attacks directed at NHS staff had soared by % in November . The UNISON survey found % of those who did not report the racist behaviour they experienced felt nothing would be done. Ged Grebby, Chief Executive at Show Racism the Red Card, said: “SRtRC is dedicated to tackling racism and promoting change in society through education. “With this short film, we’re hoping we can again contribute to a discussion around combating re racism in society – this time in the NHS. “With BAME communities forming part of the backbone of our Health Service, and with the Health Service being integral to our society, we felt compelled to raise awareness around the discrimination suffered here.” "},{"url":null,"title":"stunning images show uks waters","story":"NewsStunning images show UKs waters turn crystal clear due to lack of pollutionDrone images taken off the coast of Portsmouth, Hampshire, show how the sea was transformed into a tropical shade of blue as people kept off the beaches due to the lockdownShareCommentsByNeil Murphy:,  APR Updated:,  APR Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news world-news video ocean-ecosystems-changing-due-sht-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,appNexusVideoPrebidEnabled:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,evergreenArticle:,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,appNexusVideoPrebidEnabled:true,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news uk-news stunning-images-show-uks-waters-\"\" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - The Coronavirus BriefingSubscribeWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Many families have struggled to get a supermarket delivery slot despite many of the big names increasing their capacity. Tesco has already limited customers to an  item shop to prevent food shortages and free up more space in delivery vans for more orders. They have also increased the number of online orders every week from , in the first week of the crisis to more than one million this week. This will be increased to . million slots in the next two weeks. But now the supermarket has limited peopleaposs accounts to one order a week in another measure to help increase the number of delivery slots available. The new rule applies to all Tesco customers including those on the vulnerable list and with a Delivery Saver account. Tesco confirmed the move when replying to customers on Twitter. They said: Thanks for getting in touch. Your account will be limited to one order per week. Weaposve introduced a limit of one order per week, to help more customers secure a delivery slot. One slot a week applies to all Tesco Customers, not just those with a Delivery Saver Plan. Tesco CEO Dave Lewis thanked customers for their patience and support in an email yesterday. He said that online grocery shopping is still one clear area of concern and frustration and admitted we know we need to do more. For those who do go to Tesco stores, a number of rules have been put in place, including: * Staff directing customers where to park their cars to help limit the number of people in-store * Customers may be asked to wait in their cars before going inside, particularly in bad weather, with staff telling them when itâ€™s their turn * Floor markings outside entrances to help queuing shoppers stay m a part "},{"url":null,"title":"the kindness volunteers stitching country","story":"NewsThe kindness of volunteers is stitching our country back togetherThe Daily Mirror has partnered with the Red Cross throughout the coronavirus crisis, helping sign up over , volunteers and raising funds to support initiativesShareCommentsByRos Wynne JonesReal Britain columnist:,  APR NewsRed Cross worker Carolina Luna, , outside a centre in Dalston, London \" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - The Coronavirus BriefingSubscribeWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

She has been trying to get hold of her cancer drugs for the last two weeks, and now has only two days’ supply left. Chris Beck, a veteran of ­overseas emergencies with  years’ experience, quickly ­escalates the call to a Red Cross team who can help.The British Red Cross helpline is a response to the fear that people may be “falling through the cracks” during the coronavirus crisis.In the past, the support line has been activated to help during UK terror attacks, the Grenfell Tower fire and the infected blood inquiry. Now, it is open for anyone affected by the pandemic. Follow our blog for live updates about coronavirus Volunteers such as Chris not only help with food parcels and drug ­deliveries, but – as members of the psychosocial and mental health team – also provide emotional support. The charity warns that without the right support, some people are at risk of “a secondary impact of the virus”, which could affect health and ­wellbeing in other ways lasting long beyond the outbreak. The British Red Cross has developed a Covid- Vulnerability Index to identy people in need, using information from local authorities and other sources to build up a map that takes into account health, wellbeing, financial vulnerability and social isolation. They particularly want to reach people who may be isolating but have no family nearby, can’t get online for help, or have health conditions.  People may be facing other issues, including loneliness, mental health issues, worries about benefits or homelessness. “We’re especially worried about those who may not be in contact with organisations or support networks, who could ‘fall through the cracks’,” says Norman McKinley, the British Red Cross executive director of UK operations. The Daily Mirror has partnered with the Red Cross throughout the coronavirus crisis, helping sign up over , volunteers and raising funds to support initiatives like the helpline. Chris, , is just one of an army of volunteers we have been celebrating during the weeks of lockdown. In the past she’s responded to the Tunisian beach attack and the London bombings.  Now she is herself isolating at home to protect her husband – but is still able to volunteer for six shts a week on the Red Cross ­coronavirus support line. “Normally I would have been going out and doing something, but I can’t,” Chris says. “The fact that I’m able to be part of this response from home is uplting.” Chris says a lot of calls are from people who need urgent shopping. “Maybe a neighbour has been getting them some milk and bread, but they haven’t had a proper shop for quite a while,” she says. “We’re getting calls because people are running out of ­medicines or need specialist cancer drugs picking up. Some are very vulnerable, while others are ringing for a chat.” Meanwhile, in Darlington, Shams Abdou-Mussa, , is volunteering too. Because he is an asylum seeker, originally from Niger, he isn’t allowed to work, and the coronavirus has made his own situation with the Home Office more complicated. But he is turning his frustration into action. “Asylum seekers have got many problems, starting with how to get out and do our shopping,” Shams says.  “We are given a card with less than £ per day for shopping by the Government, but this card can only be used in the shops, it can’t be used online and some people can’t withdraw cash from it, so what can people dothey are self-isolating  “Many people don’t know anyone who can help to get the shopping. We only receive money on Mondays by which time there is nothing on the shelves. The card has less than £ per day – what about women who need to buy sanitary towels  We have to help.” In Bristol, Dan Hunt, a -year-old postman for Royal Mail, also recently joined the British Red Cross as an emergency volunteer. Alongside his vital day job he has been delivering food parcels. “On my rounds I spoke to a lady with learning disabilities who was self-isolating,” he says.  “Her sister’s birthday was coming up and she was in bits because she couldn’t get to the shop to buy her a card. It was causing her a lot of stress. “It may seem like a small thing but wishing her a happy birthday was the most important thing in the world to her. I called her from the shop and described a few of the cards they had on the shelves. She settled on one she liked, and I brought it back for her to sign. I posted it and took a picture, so she knew it was safely on its way.” "},{"url":null,"title":"two ambulance colleagues same trust","story":"NewsTwo ambulance colleagues at same trust die within three days from coronavirusThe deaths are the latest frontline healthcare workers to die during the Covid- pandemic but it is not known where they contracted the deadly bugShareCommentsByTom DavidsonSenior Reporter:,  APR Updated:,  APR NewsThe two staff members, who have not been named, were married and had families\" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - The Coronavirus BriefingSubscribeWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

The worst-hit states by the virus have been New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Maryland, Florida, Illinois, Calornia, Michigan and Pennsylvania. Of those only Florida is expected to relax measures in the coming days. Calornia may strengthen them after beaches were seen packed at the weekend. White House guidelines for social distancing expire today and states have been grappling with when and how to revive their economies while keeping residents safe. Some states planned to ease restrictions without the Opening Up America Again safeguards that the White House itself had recommended, including declines in the infection rate and expanded virus testing. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and a White House task force member, warned states not to move too fast, a refrain of many publichealth officials since states, led by Georgia, started easing restrictions.You canapost just leap over things to a situation where youaposre really temptingto rebound.

Indiana, Massachusetts, Ohio and Pennsylvania reported record daily death tolls on Wednesday. The sense of urgency for states looking to reopen was highlighted today by Labor Department data showing that . million people filed claims for unemployment benefits in the week ended April . That lted the number of people who sought unemployment benefits to around  million since March . That represents roughly .% of the working age population.  Florida on Wednesday became the latest state, and one of the largest, to announce steps to ease restrictions that crippled business activity.There is a light at the end of the tunnel, Governor Ron DeSantis said as he unveiled his phase-one plan due to start on Monday to relax mandatory workplace closures and stay-at-home orders imposed four weeks ago. Earlier in the week his Texas counterpart, Greg Abbott, another governor closely aligned with their fellow Republican, President Donald Trump, announced a similar reopening strategy due to take effect this Friday.In Calornia, however, Governor Gavin Newsom was expected to announce the closure of all beaches and parks in the state after crowds jammed beaches last weekend. A Democrat, Newsom has said that curbside retail, manufacturing and other lower-risk workplaces should reopen in Calornia within weeks as testing and contact-tracing improve. In Michigan, Democratic Governor Gretchen Whitmer requested an extension to a state of emergency due to expire on Thursday. Republican lawmakers in Michigan oppose the extension.

The US space agency is planning to crash a rocket into an asteroid to deflect it away from the planet. They will test the plan next year, launching the Double Asteroid Redirection Testspacecraft aboard a SpaceX Falcon  rocket from Vandenberg Air Force Base in Calornia. It will approach the Didymos asteroid, made up of a rock  metres wide and a smaller “moonlet” about  metres wide. The Dart will hit it at about ,mph, when its electric propulsion system will change its orbit slightly. The collision is expected to take place when the asteroid gets within . million miles of Earth. The moon is , miles away and the sun is  million miles away. A NASA spokesman said preparations for Dart have moved into a critical phase in which the spacecraft’s components and systems are “integrated”. Jonathan McDowell, an astronomer at the Hard-Smithsonian Centre for Astrophysics, said: “The reason they are picking that as a target is that it’s a lot easier to measure than, say, the orbit of an asteroid around the sun, which may take several years.”  Although the system is often said to deflect the asteroid’s course, the aim is usually to speed it up or slow it down. He added: “It’s better to hit it along the trajectory of its motion. If you hit it sideways it doesn’t make much dference.” "},{"url":null,"title":"burger king giving away free","story":"NewsBurger King is giving away free Whoppers - heres how to get oneBurger King are giving away free burgers to people who share their worst coronavirus lockdown foodie failsShareCommentsByPaige HollandShowbiz Audience Writer:,  APR Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news video burger-king-reopen-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,appNexusVideoPrebidEnabled:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,evergreenArticle:,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,appNexusVideoPrebidEnabled:true,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news weird-news burger-king-giving-away-free-\"\" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - daily newsSubscribeWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

The four-bedroom home in Louisiana, US, was built in the s and has gained a spooky reputation, meaning no one has dared to move in despite not having to spend a penny to make it theirs. One former resident claims the home is haunted by her great grandmother, who is aposwell knownapos to stir cooking left unattended in the kitchen and move the pots around.Sylvia McLain, a co-owner of McLain Investments, took to Facebook to share snaps of the home in a bid to convince someone to move and restore the home so they could build new property on the land.However, it appears potential suitors were put off by a flood of comments below from ex-residents and visitors who reported the creepy goings-on they claim to have experienced. Sylvia admitted sheaposs heard aposall the storiesapos about it being haunted by an old woman and said former owners had even had ghost hunters in to banish her. But she remains hopeful the aposhistory of the homeapos can be saved, and itaposs free for anyone to take on to aposmove to another location for restorationapos. Former resident Dawn Vallot DeClout claims the house is occupied by the spirit of her great grandmother Adele, a ft in woman who lived until about  and was known for meddling in the kitchen. Dawnaposs family owned the -acre plot the house was built on from , and her great grandmother died in the front room in .  Dawn, whose family moved out in the s, said: We believe [Adele] is the ghost, but sheaposs not menacing at all. She was probably like ft in and weighed about lb. She lived to be almost  and she was always digging in the pots, like when you have something on the stove and someone goes and looks in the pot and stirs it around. She was well-known for that, and so when we lived there, we used to hear her all the time jangling the pots when we had something on the stove. You could hear somebody picking up the lid but there was nobody in the kitchen.  Sylvia said there is a lot of rumours surrounding the house, with apossome really cute stories about it being hauntedapos. One suitor had offered to take the home, but had a change of heart when they discovered it would cost about £, to move and reassemble. Sylvia believesthe two-storey, , square foot property was kept close by, it would only cost about half of that. However, locals comparing it to a notorious house in Amityville, where a man shot and killed six members of his family, isnapost making it any easier.  The post on Facebook got hundreds of responses with one writing: Yes it is [haunted]. I experienced three things there that could not be explained and my friend that lived there had more than that. We actually experienced one together and we still talk about it. Another replied: Most likely the haunting will stay attached to the land and whoever lives in the new home they build will deal with it. A third said they visited the home and reported aposa lot of weird noises in the ceilings and wallsapos. Sylvia is worried she may not be able to find someone to take on the project due to the costs after any interest following the Facebook post quickly fell away.

The research, carried out on  patients in Spain, aimed to build a picture of how the disease might manest in skin symptoms. Through the Spanish Academy of Dermatology, all Spanish dermatologists were asked to help identy patients who had an unexplained skin eruption in the last two weeks and who had suspected or confirmed Covid-. A standardised questionnaire was used and photos taken of skin conditions to detect patterns of the virusaposs potential effect on the skin. Authors of the study, published in the British Journal of Dermatology, said that in some cases it was hard to tellskin conditions were directly caused by coronavirus or indicated complications. As a result, the public is being urged not to try to self-diagnose Covid- based on skin symptoms, because rashes and lesions are common and hard to dferentiate without medical expertise. Chilblain-like symptoms The study found that in % of its cases chilblain-like symptoms were identied. Described as acral areas of erythema-edema with some vesicles or pustules, these lesions affect the hands and feet and may resemble the small, itchy swellings of chilblains. They are small red or purple spots caused by bleeding under the skin and usually asymmetrical in appearance, the study said. The symptoms were associated with younger patients, lasted for an average of . days, appeared later in the course of Covid- and were associated with less severe cases of the disease. Vesicular eruptions In % of cases, dermatologists identied vesicular eruptions, described as outbreaks of small blisters, commonly itchy, that appeared on the trunk of the body. These could also affect peopleaposs limbs, may be filled with blood, and could become larger or more spread out. They were associated with middle-aged patients, lasted on average . days, appeared more commonly before other symptoms and were associated with intermediate severity of the disease. Urticarial lesions A third condition, identied in % of cases, was named as urticarial lesions, which consist of pink or white raised areas of skin resembling a nettle rash. Known as wheals, these are usually itchy and can be spread across the body, including in a few cases on the palms of hands.  Maculopapules Among % of cases other maculopapules were identied - small, flat and raised red bumps. In some cases these were distributed round hair follicles and had ying degrees of scaling. The study said the appearance was likened to pityriasis rosea, a common skin condition. Blood spots under the skin might also be present, either as spots or dots or on larger areas. Urticarial lesions were found to last an average of . days, while a maculopapular condition lasted on average . days. They usually appeared at the same time as other Covid- symptoms, were associated with more severe Covid- cases, and itching was very common.  Researchers noted that maculopapules and urticarial lesions are common and can have many causes, meaning they may not be a helpful aide for diagnosing Covid-. Livedo or necrosis A fth category of conditions, Livedo or necrosis, was identied by dermatologists in % of cases. Livedo occurs where circulation in the blood vessels of the skin is impaired, causing it to take on a blotchy red or blue appearance with a net-like pattern. Necrosis describes the premature death of skin tissue.

The dictators prolonged absence from the public has only fueled the reports that he is either seriously ill or dead. There have been conflicting reports that Kim is in a vegetative state after heart surgery and others have claimed he has died. North Korean media has not reported on Kimaposs whereabouts since he presided over a meeting on April . Daily NK claims to have spoken to a source based in the North Hamgyong Province.They said: “All sorts of rumors are spreading. “But even though the government is aware of all this, there has been no centralized response to it, either in the form of lectures or otherwise. That’s really strange.” In the past rumours about the North Korean leader or his family would have provoked a rapid response from authorities.  But days on Kim has still not been seen in public. The source said that the population is frightened about even hearing rumors that Kim has died so everyone pretends not to know, but everyone knows. The source added: There are even people who say they saw the video claiming Kim had died, but most people are trying their best to stay unnoticed because the authorities are hunting down whoever brought the video over the border.

John-Paul Drike, the director of Drakes Supermarkets in Adelaide, Australia, says he responded simply by giving the alleged hoarder the middle finger. In a stunning YouTube video, the supermarket boss has vented his anger at those who have taken advantage of the desperate rush for basic household supplies amid the coronavirus pandemic. He claimed that one unidentied customer had been audacious enough to purchase  -roll packets of loo roll and  units of one-litre sanitiser from his shop - and then later ask for a refund. Follow the latest coronavirus updates here “I had my first customer yesterday who said he wanted to get a refund on  packets of -pack toilet paper and  units of one-litre sanitiser, Mr Drake says in his video on April . Flipping his middle finger at the screen, he added: “I told him that.  Branding those who have been panic-buying supplies such as toilet paper absolutely ridiculous, he continued: That is the sort of person that is causing the problem in the whole country. Speaking to News, he said the man wanted to get rid of the items because he was no longer able to sell them on eBay after his site was shut down. He claimed that he had as many as  people working with him to buy up the highly-sought after commodities. Australiaaposs Home Affairs Minister, Peter Dutton, has said that the government will come down like a ton of bricks on supermarket hoarders who have been clearing shelves of basic supplies. Speaking last month, he said that that anyone caught profiteering from buying up essential groceries such as food and toilet paper will be prosecuted. In the UK, police officers have taken to standing guard at supermarkets to halt coronavirus panic-buying and enforce the Governmentaposs social distancing orders.

Despite the campaign finishing nine matches short, we are delighted to announce the   Tele Sport Player of the Year for Dundee.The votes have been cast, averages for players having started  games vied up and there are no worries about emails turning up or not.The   Tele Sport Player of the Year is Paul McGowan for the second year running.After a very strong start, the midfielder’s influence grew throughout the season as the team got to grips with the Championship challenge. As ever, McGowan rarely fell below a seven out of  rating, finishing the season off with an eight after a wonderful assist for Kane Hemmings against Ayr, as well as key displays against Partick and an earlier showing against the Honest Men. After six years at the club, ‘Gowser’ is still going strong in dark blue.Fans favourite, Hemmings, ran McGowan very close with a strong run of form since the middle of December, breaking the -goal barrier in the final match against Ayr. Impressive showings in wins over Dunfermline and Partick in December stand out but his top display came back in October at a chilly Alloa, where the only disappointment was when he fluffed a chance to seal a hat-trick late on.The -year-old was a real star for manager James McPake after he gave him a regular run in the first team at the beginning of the campaign. Such a steady and unflustered player in the middle of the park, Robertson allowed the more experienced players to shine alongside him. That’s not stopped the teenager picking up regular good grades, in particular a fine showing against Dundee United at Tannadice in December.The first signing of the season, former Partick and Ayr winger, McDaid, showed dferent sides to his game last term. When the team struggled to create goalscoring opportunities early on, McDaid was still a regular threat and he’s shown his defensive capabilities more recently as a wing-back. His tackling in the area in derbies may need some work but McDaid will be determined that the best is yet to come from him in dark blue.Undoubtedly a class act in the middle of the park, Scotland international Dorrans showed glimpses of his best form throughout the campaign as he worked himself back to full fitness following y injury issues. The ex-Rangers man grabbed a vital goal at Tannadice in the - derby draw in December and was a driving force throughout.It seems defenders didn’t fare too well in   but make up almost the rest of the top .Honourable mentions go to Jordan McGhee ., Jordon Forster ., Jack Hamilton ., Shaun Byrne . and Jordan Marshall .."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/05/2.53517208-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/05/2.53517208-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/05/2.53517208-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/05/2.53517208-240x180.jpg 300w sizes=(max-width: 940px) 940w, 620w, 300w ","title":"dundee united kids light up premiership gordon forrest","story":"Gordon Forrest has backed Dundee United’s young stars to shine in the Premiership.The Tangerines assistant boss has been hugely impressed with the quality of United’s academy prospects this season.Several have played their part in the Tannadice club’s Championship title-winning campaign.Louis Appere has been the headliner, with Scotland Under- recognition his reward for a stunning debut campaign.Others have made their presence felt in Robbie Neilson’s first team too.But Forrest expects United’s kids to move even further to the fore once United get started in the top flight.He said: “The owners have invested heavily in the academy and the focus will stay on bringing young players through.“We have a few who broke through last season, Louis Appere springs to mind # he had a very good season and got a Scotland U call up.“Declan Glass went out on loan in the first half of the season then played his part when he came back.“And Chris Mochrie too, he’s only sixteen but he got minutes and has a good future ahead of him.“There are others bubbling away in the background too, in that  or -year-old age group, that we think a lot of.“We certainly have a few players who will be there or thereabouts.”When United’s youngsters will get their chance to impress remains to be seen.With no decision yet made on how to conclude the current Premiership season, it’s a waiting game for the Tangerines.Players and staff alike have been placed on furlough leave, with only a few senior workers left in post to run the club through lockdown.It all adds up to a strange way to celebrate winning promotion after four years in the Championship.It’s mission accomplished for United, yet without the certainty of knowing when next season will begin, everything feels strangely unfinished.But as desperate as everyone at Tannadice is to know what’s going to happen next, Forrest insists safety is paramount for players, staff and fans ahead of anyto action.“You could see the way it was heading over the last few weeks,” said the United number two.“There were a lot of s and buts regarding the season starting again and we had a few plans in place depending on what happened.“But once we went on furlough that brings a lot to a halt and you’re looking at the media, the government and the health services.“I think that’s when we realised how distant things were getting – and that was before the vote took place.“We don’t look like we’ll be back training as a group any time soon and the talk now is about fans being able to come to games.“So it’s about the safety aspect now, that’s what’s going to be behind football starting up again.“All we can do is wait for the authorities to make a decision and then plan from there.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/05/2.53517208-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/05/2.53517208-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/05/2.53517208-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/05/2.53517208-240x180.jpg 300w sizes=(max-width: 940px) 940w, 620w, 300w ","title":"george cran dundee fc email another stalemate","story":"I have a sneaking suspicion Scottish football is heading for another stalemate in the next couple of weeks over reconstruction.We’re all only just getting over the last one, induced by a combination of an over-active email spam folder, John Nelms doing his best Machiavellian impression and some shoddy governance.I have to admit, I’ve never envied the job Neil Doncaster has to do as chief executive of the SPFL – trying to corral  dferent voices into making a sensible decision while acting as a punchbag for all the critics to lay into the dys of our game.I’m not saying he’s blameless but his job does seem to me to consist of taking the blame for everything, whether he has anything to do with it or not.Now Ann Budge of Hearts and Les Gray of Hamilton seem to be enjoying that role as chairs of the reconstruction ‘task force’.Already dissenters are amassing and they’ve not even laid out what possible plans there might be to choose from.I’ve been very much in favour of league reconstruction for a long time now. In my ideal world we’d have at least a -team top flight. I’ve already given up hope of the Premiership clubs agreeing to another other than , however. Sorry, Dundee.My thinking is Nelms’ play over the vote saga was to force reconstruction into happening – I don’t think it’s going to benefit the Dark Blues in the immediate future, however.Next season they should be big favourites in the second tier, though. And a bigger top flight makes it easier to stay up the following season, too.Dundee United, on the other hand, can sit back safe in the knowledge they are a Premiership club no matter what – as long as it’s not a reduced ision, they’ll be happy.A stalemate, though, is brewing, I reckon.Already Budge and Gray have talked up dferent approaches – Hearts want a temporary change while Accies want permanent.Temporary seems pretty pointless to me – that only benefits a handful of clubs, one of them being Hearts. The rest will no doubt shout that down.Now, though, the League Two teams are ganging up on the rest.I have to admire the bolshiness of that, to be honest.They want a -- set-up or nothing. I quite like that idea.Bigger leagues make things more interesting and improve our football.Already, though, clubs higher up the food chain are taking potshots at them.I can’t help but think these are only opening salvos in another departure from sanity from Scottish football.Dundee United are talking of aiming high – that’s exactly what they should be doing.Managing director Mal Brannigan says the club should be targeting the top six and, beyond that,Normally I’d think the manager of a newly-promoted club whose top director had mentioned Europe and trophies would be thinking: #Thanks very much for making my job harder.#However, Robbie Neilson has the same targets at Tannadice and spoke about European football months ago.I like a club to be ambitious and United have enough about them as a club to be a top-six power again.That’s where they were when I moved to Dundee and it didn’t seem like they were punching above their weight.Right now, though, they are far from that level.Fans will like the big talk and they should definitely be allowed to dream.Backing up those words is the hard part, though. I sincerely hope the top dogs at United can do just that –they do, it’ll be some ride at Tannadice.ARSENAL have begun training again and the English Premier League have launched ‘Project Restart’.With England – and particularly London – hit worse by the coronavirus than we are up here, I find it strange to see clubs and leagues ing back into things so quickly.I desperately want to see football back as soon as possible but there needs to be awareness that it looks like one rule for rich footballers and another for the rest of us.FIFA are talking about allowing five subs per team to ease congestion when the game kicks off again. Fair enough but I don’t want to see that as the norm going forward. We’ll be using rolling subs before we know it."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/05/2.53517208-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/05/2.53517208-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/05/2.53517208-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/05/2.53517208-240x180.jpg 300w sizes=(max-width: 940px) 940w, 620w, 300w ","title":"the feelgood feed stories to lift your day","story":"Things are tough right now — but the power of community has never been more important or more obvious.In every walk of le, people are coming together to ensure that no one is left to fight coronavirus alone.

He says he wants to work there when he’s older.“When we explained to him the farm might have to close he was really upset and decided he would do something to help.“Around the same time, the school sent out an email encouraging the kids to walk a marathon during the month to keep active and we thought it would be a good idea to combine the two.”Jodie added: “Although Mac is quite active, his autism affects his social skills so it is a challenge to get him outside.“Marley has hip dysplasia so it is going to be dficult for him too but they are up to the challenge.“They have a really special bond.

Included in this is the Isle of Jura.This is as shockingly reckless as it is offensive.The Isle of Jura is not a #bolthole# as the Daily Mail has chosen to state but a very beautul island steeped in culture and rich history.On both Jura and Islay we, like so many rural areas, are struggling to deal with all of the challenges related to the Corona virus out break. Our local health services have very limited resources as it is, along side a population that has many elderly residents who are more at risk to the virus.We have seen a local uptick in people traveling to Islay in camper vans and this is happening at a time when the UK government is advising against non essential travel.Those who are choosing to travel to our islands of Islay, Jura and the many other islands in Argyll and Bute in order to avoid the coronavirus may end up inadvertently spreading it to islands who arenot as much affected in the same way as so many built up urban areas are. Such actions are as reckless as they are selfish and I would implore people who do not need to travel to our rural constituency to avoid doing so until this global pandemic has passed.Jura, Islay and the rest of Argyll are some of the most beautul places you will ever visit and you won#t find an area where the people are more hospitable and friendly but while this crisis is ongoing I would ask everyone who is not currently living here to avoid traveling here for the time being.Councillor Alastair Redman # Kintyre and Islands ward.To the Scottish public,During this time of unprecedented uncertainty, we are all concerned about the safety and wellbeing of our families, friends and colleagues.Our hearts go out to those who have been affected personally by the outbreak of coronavirus , as well as the many communities around the world that are facing extreme measures in an attempt to slow its spread.We appreciate and are mindful of the challenges iniduals are currently facing as well as the impact this pandemic has had on our vital emergency services as well as the grocery retail sector, supply chain and producers.Like our retail partners, we want to take this opportunity to assure you that Scottish farmers, auctioneers, hauliers, processors and butchers are doing everything they can to maintain the ongoing availability of fresh, locally sourced Scotch Beef PGI, Scotch Lamb PGI and Specially Selected Pork.We would like to thank all those who work in the Scottish red meat industry and their families for their ongoing and unwavering efforts to keep our supermarket shelves and butcher shops stocked, fuelling Scotland with top-quality red meat during this challenging time.As bodies supporting the Scottish agricultural and red meat industry, we are constantly reviewing the developing situation and are doing all we can to support everyone involved in putting nutritious food on your plates.Alan Clarke, chief executive, Quality Meat ScotlandMartin Morgan, executive manager, Scottish Association of Meat Wholesalers Duncan Todd, secretary, Scottish Beef Association Jen Craig, president, National Sheep Association Scotland Penny Montgomerie, chief executive, Scottish Association of Young Farmers Clubs and Gordon King, executive manager, Scottish Craft Butchers.What on earth is going on  It was banal enough when Ben Goldsmith # English financier and environmentalist # tweeted that #overgrazing# by upland sheep farmers, was responsible for the devastating floods in South Wales, rather than record-breaking torrential rainfall.Unbelievably we now have a government official, Dr Tim Leunig, suggesting the whole of the UK does not need farming, and his comparison of the UK to Singapore in this context is absolutely ludicrous. You truly have to wonderthere is something in the water that he is drinking – could it be flood contamination Surely, every person having a full and ing set of neurons and synapses, the complete opposite is the truth, as we dearly need our hard working farming community.The UK Government should be fully supporting the farming industry and indeed, good land management. The Welsh Assembly has totally lost its way with its mindless policy of devastating Welsh forests with thousands and thousands # an understatement # of trees being felled for wind farms, and compounding the felony by covering acres of land with very limited electricity generating solar parks # Wales is not the Sahara and the sun disappears at night! Solar  will generate about  per cent of their maximum capacity in the UK.Returning to farming perhaps some kind person should tell Dr Tim Leunig that the answer lies in the soil and then lead him to a darkened and quiet room so he can lie down and contemplate the truth # wise men recognise that truth is the daughter of time, not of authority.Dave Haskell, Cardigan."},{"url":null,"title":"the voyages of the fulmar part 10","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWhat a night! All of us were agreed that never had we experienced anywhere a worse one and we were glad we had been in Loch Aline on Sunday night not in Tobermory as intended as, from what we heard, that night had been similar but twice as bad.It was a wild night lashing with rain and a big swell was rolling in from the north-east causing us to pitch and roll horribly. Everything banged and rattled and the ropes, despite their lashings, slapped on the mast, the chain rugged continuously on the bobstay, and there was one most annoying thump that kept everyone awake .We could not trace its origin until in desperation the Pilot donned oilskins, sou’wester and seaboots, and went on deck and found it was the tiller end bumping on the bulwarks. The Pilot had a very justiable grouse about this as he had suggested lashing the tiller, but the Skipper had said that he did not think it necessary and that we would lie easierit was allowed to go free.About six we heard Murdoch in Venture hailing us and the Skipper and Pilot hurried on deck. The yachts in the harbour were all lying higgledy-piggledy owing to the swell, to there being little or not wind, to the strong surface current from the swollen river, and to it being about the turn of the tide.Venture and Fulmar were lying stern to stern and what had aroused Murdoch was that the Venture had got her mizzen boom over our main boom and as we pitched we had lted it up crutch and all – how nothing was broken was a miracle. She had then swung round and her now free boom had knocked the cap off our jackstay. As the Skipper came on deck Venture again surged towards us and started pitching and her counter came down with a terric slam not six inches from our bulwarks. We put our helm over and swung clear.Murdoch and Barclay were both in their dog-house and the Pilot and Skipper stayed in ours until the new tide took charge and the boats began to swing in normal fashion and all were able to retire once more to their bunks. Luckily the rain had cleared off shortly before this episode took place.At a quarter to eight we heard the usual poor forecast but for the first time since the cruise began there was not a gale warning for any area. The glass had risen well during the night. What wind there was was from the north-west.The Skipper went ashore for the milk and rolls. The dinghy had a lot of water in it and owing to the rolling it was impossible to get into it and balance on the thwarts till it was baled so the Skipper got his feet thoroughly soaked – the simple remedy of wearing seaboots had never occurred to him. Again the rolls were sold out and again he had to take porter biscuits.On board the Pilot lit the fire then started in to get our breakfast of bacon and egg. After our meal the sky cleared and it became a beautul sunny day, and everything we had was up on deck drying off or airing. The owner of Rose came alongside and for a good time tried to get us to persuade him to go north against his better judgement, but when we heard he had the lady member of his crew of three sick in her bunk our advice was that he go south and that immediately and reluctantly he was forced to agree and half an hour later he sailed. Hervor also went out about the same time and she turned north and we were to meet her later in Iona."},{"url":null,"title":"worldwide ceilidh community sign up for tunes in the hoose","story":"Fiona ScottUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsCapercaillie founder Martin MacLeod, originally from Oban, and his son, also Martin, have came up with an innovative way to connect musicians from all over the world and allow them to play together for the enjoyment of others.#Tunes in the Hoose# was inspired by Scottish musician, and family friend of the MacLeods, Peter Wood, who was posting videos of himself playing tunes in his home during self-isolation.Having saw the footage Martin senior, called his filmmaker son to askhe had the technology and know-how to put a video together of him playing along to Peter’s video.#I run my own production company based out of Glasgow, so it’s relatively straight forward work for me ,# said Martin Junior.#From that first successful attempt, our new idea was to create an online community for all Scottish musicians to help them connect and continue to play together during these uncertain times.#Housed in Facebook, Tunes in the Hoose amassed over  followers last week with ,+ views worldwide.

From his throne he dispensed news, advice and anecdotes – albeit not always historically accurate. His inimitable irony, perfectly-timed humour and the occasional reprimand to a wayward customer were all fuelled by a generous glass.As former president of the Scottish Licensed Trade Association and Keeper of the Quaich, Donald knew the intricacies of the business intimately from personal experience. His taste was eclectic and his appetite substantial, extending from Dom Perignon and Saint-Émilion Grand Cru to Tennent’s lager and Glen Dronach single malt. On a hot day he’d have an icy Martini or a gin and tonic, proportionately scaled up in a pint glass. Being askedhe had time for a quick ‘small one’, he would reply: #I’ll decide the size for myself,you don’t mind.#The records suggest that his frequent claim to be Scottish Slimmer of the Year, after getting his weight down from  stone to  stone, was fancul.Big D, as he was often called, was fastidious about standards in the little public bar, training his regulars to clear tables of empty glasses and plates promptly, and to keep the log fire stoked on winter evenings.If one of his regulars turned up untypically well-dressed, Donald would raise an eyebrow in mild surprise:  #What’s the occasion for the suit   A funeral   Your latest marriage   Or has your court case come up #In summer, an erratic stream of foreign tourists would have their first encounter with a Scottish pub, standing in the doorway bewildered as to what happens next – sit or stand  Fight their way to the mobbed bar or go to a table and wait for the non-existent waitress  Donald would call them over to his corner and was soon plying them with drinks, food and conversation, not infrequently paying the entire bill for his astonished guests.When a tourist asked him about the quaint red GPO telephone box in Church Square, he told them: #We have the fastest modern communications here – telephone, teletext and tell Donald.#Donald was a Francophile and loved his summers in Collioure, where #Le Grand Ecossais# was almost as well-known as in Argyll. A fixture of the local bars and restaurants, and frequently crossing the border to patronise Spanish hostelries, he revelled in the region’s seafood, wine and culture.His hobbies included cooking, opera, reading and lively conversation on a sweeping range of topics from local history to civil engineering. His knowledge was genuinely wide, but when occasionally encountering someone with a superior command of the topic in question, he would quickly change the subject and admonish: “Och, you’re showing off now.”Donald Clark was born on  July , in Rotten Row hospital, Glasgow. He was the youngest child of Donald Clark and Elizabeth Inglis, following by nine years his only sibling, Fiona.His early years were spent in Inveraray where family le revolved around his parents’ hotel in the little white-washed town.He was schooled at Inveraray Primary and Larchfield in Helensburgh, then Strathallan from  to  where he acquired his love of sports. Contrary to what his dimensions in later le would suggest, he was athletic when young, excelling at rugby and playing for his school and West of Scotland First XV and the old boys’ As.Donald also enjoyed curling, motor boating, snow skiing and water-skiing, where his party piece was to mono-ski down Loch Fyne while drinking a pint of beer.Although not a shinty player, he used his sports experience to coach the Inveraray team in the s and like his father chaired the club.

We have three dogs and three cats in foster that were in place before the lockdown. We are trying to support them as much as possible.\"Unfortunately, the lockdown means that we cannot re-home any animals at this time. We had people lined up to come and meet two of the dogs on the week that the country went into lockdown and had to cancel their appointments due to this.\"Also, Pal, who has been waiting for over a year for a new home, was due to go away to his new home that week which has had to be put on hold. And we have no idea when he can finally go to his new home.\"And the centre isnt just coping with the stress of caring for the animals during a crisis, theyre also facing potential financial strain as the weeks progress.\"Our centre relies heavily on income generated from our four shops,\" added Lee-Ann. \"Seventy per cent of our annual income is generated via the shops so loss of income is a real concern.\"We have had to cancel fundraising events during the key fundraising period of spring summer. This includes our Annual Dog Show in May which is one our biggest fundraising events.\"We are hopeful that not all staff go down with virus at same time.\"We are managing the situation to the best of our ability and [despite] that our weekly income has reduced very signicantly, and we need people to donate to help keep our centre operational whilst our shops are closed.\"All our animals are still being looked after and cared for by our excellent and committed staff.\"Sonia Graham from Borders Greyhound Rescue added: \"Were trying to make the best of the situation.\"We have  dogs at the moment because we cant get dogs in or out. Its dficult.\"Weve had some under fostering, but unless they are greyhound people they wont be going to foster.\"Its frustrating because for people who want dogs, youd think this was the perfect time to have one as theres time for one-on-one training.\"And a lack of volunteers is a key factor in the dficulties facing the Greyhound Rescue now, with the charity normally taking in up to  regular helpers to care for  dogs.\"Without volunteers, its been a real struggle,\" said Sonia. \"Were family-run and we have a farm too, so were just trying to fill the gaps left by volunteers.\"Another problem which has reared its head for Sonia and her family is the knock-on effect of this lockdown.Sonia explained: \"People who may have lost jobs or their business, they wont be thinking of taking on an animal.\"People cant afford to pay vet bills. I can see this being a dficult year.\"If anything, we may see animals being handed in. People will misjudge and panic about the situation. And it wont just be dogs being brought to rescues but being dumped.\"It will be interesting to see how this all works out.\"And to help ease the strain on the rescue, Sonia has created an Amazon wishlist for donations to help keep the dogs fed.The wishlist gives donors the option to either donate physical items, such as a bag of food, or they can gt a cash amount straight into the Greyhound Rescues account to spent on vital products.On the other hand, the Arthurshiel Rescue Centre, in St Boswells, hasnt seen an increase in their four-legged residents, with the charity manager Shona Middlemass saying: \"Were managing fine\".She added: \"Weve not had an influx of animals, any strays that get raised with us we share over Facebook.\"Fingers crossed everything keeps going smoothly, weve not had any problems.\"We dont have any cash coming in.

The school has an approximate  percent drop-out rate as the young men learn more of what God is calling them to do, and as they face the sometimes hard-to-accept vows which they must take.\"Every guy is dferent,\" said Bobby. \"To be honest, Im not  percent sure  percent is the rate of drop out Ive experienced over the past few years Ive been there. Theres only been two or three guys out of - whove left.\"Me, personally, my first year was probably my toughest year. It was a big adjustment from that freedom I had, and having gone from earning quite a healthy wage working at sea, then going to seminary in a foreign country ndash it was quite a challenge.\"There was a period where I did have to really, seriously, pray about it and think about what I was being called to do.\"I think everybody goes through it, and I think its a good thing that everybody goes through because ultimately thats what seminary is about.,params: .push\"Seven years isnt a number plucked out of mid-air, its a period where youre doing a lot of study but youre also doing a lot of work to understand what it is youre being called to do, andits being called to priesthood because its not a light undertaking, its quite a serious undertaking ndash but a good one, and a positive one.\"And the problems facing Bobby and his fellow seminarians have only grown since the COVID- lockdown.He added: \"From about six weeks ago being in Rome and studying in the university with my class of about  other guys, Im now sitting in a dining room in a Catholic church house in Galashiels studying on my own.\"So things have changed quite a bit.

into it.I found a little information about it.It was located in Dam Brae and was said to contain water with special qualities that helped make a perfect pot of tea.There is little explanation as to what exactly these qualities were, but it seems to have been widely believed and accepted in the past.Tea, of course, became popular in Scotland, and by the th century it had become an important accompaniment to the often mundane diet of working class people, providing a refreshing non-alcoholic alternative to beer.For the poor, tea drinking wasnrsquot linked to formal social rituals as it was with the upper classes.Tea was the drink of the working class as they worked.So, a well in the heart of the town which was believed to supply good tea making water will have been a busy and popular place.Many people, likely mostly women, would have congregated around the well.In the OS name book from the s, it was clearly recorded that the well was listed as the ldquoVickerrsquos Well, but then goes on to state that ldquono person in the locality knows it by that name.Everyone called it ldquothe bickers well.Perhaps this was a result of local dialect changing the name over time.But Paul Bennet, in his interesting website ldquoThe Northern Antiquarian says ldquothere is the obvious possibility that the ldquobickers ndash as in chit-chat and gossip ndash related to it being where local folk simply met and chatted.Perhaps the reputation of the wellrsquos water for making quality tea also meant people from further afield considered it worthwhile to detour here, in order to make that extra special ldquoBickerrsquos Brew.One account says it was once surrounded by old trees.All of this conjures an image of an important social meeting place, with people meeting under the shade of old trees, exchanging views and information and having a good blether while they wait their turn to draw water from the celebrated well.Was the belief in the goodness of the water rooted in some older tradition Perhaps it was a revered holy well, as some have suggested It seems to have been associated with the vicarage of St Michaels nearby, which roots the well in Musselburghrsquos ancient past, and gives a reason for the name Vicarrsquos Well.The well was replaced by a pump sometime in the nineteenth century, and then was blocked up, and became forgotten.When Irsquod discovered all this I set out to find the location of the well to seethere was still any evidence of it.Dam Brae is now named Kilwinning Place and I studied a nineteenth century map which marked the exact location of the well, then compared it to a modern one and set out on my quest.I found the location. Irsquom sure of it, and took a photo.But there wasnrsquot really anything of much interest to see other than a slab on the ground where I believe the well once stood.It seemed so forgotten, and put me in a melancholy mood for a moment.I reflected on the way something that had been a tradition for so long, and such a part of many peoplersquos lives can just vanish, and be utterly forgotten.I know it was just a well and so might not seem important.But it was a meeting place for ordinary people for generations.The simple shared routines and places in our lives are often the ones we remember with nostalgia.We donrsquot think of them as history or worthy of recording until all memory has gone, and itrsquos too late.I thought about this as we were going on our local family walk this week.I suppose we all know we are living through a time that will be recorded by history.But when all this is over, and things are back to ldquonormal what simple things will you, and your family, remember from this time and what will you want remembered For me, this includes seeing the Greenhills carpeted with wildflowers for the first time that I can remember, watching children cycle on empty streets and deserted car parks, and queuing in shops, keeping our physical distance while also trying to stay social.For sure the toilet roll panic will be part of history.But all of us will have special moments and places that connect to the emotions of this time.There will be stories of peoplersquos wonderful community spirit, what it felt like to be confined in the house for weeks, and how we entertained ourselves.We are all historians of our own time, and we should find ways to record and remember the simple, but important, things we have felt and encountered during this time of crisis.Because memory fades, and as the fate of the Bickers Well shows,memories are not recorded or stories of them not told, they will be forgotten.And so this was why I decided to re-visit the story of the Bickers Well for my column this week.It may have originally seemed there was not much to tell about it.Yet once there was.But the memories and the stories connected to it seemed so simple and obvious at the time that nobody really thought them important enough to record or keep treasured.Now all that remains of those stories is a slab on the pavement.The technology we have makes it easier now to share and record our lives.So letrsquos use it to consciously be historians and storytellers of this dficult time to capture images and feelings, the happenings that may today seem too simple and commonplace to record, but in future will be a fascinating insight to our lives in this historic event.For me, that is the lesson of the Bickers Well."},{"url":null,"title":"winton-brewery-takes-countys-micropub","story":"Steve Holligan and David Mackinnon, from Winton Brewery, stepped behind the bar at Dunbarrsquos Station Yard Micropub at the beginning of the month.Currently, the duo are only allowed to sell off-sales, due to the coronavirus lockdown preventing customers from entering the pub, but they were looking forward to once again welcoming people inside as soon as possible.Steve said: ldquoWersquove been looking for a while to find something like this.ldquoThe Station Yard is unbelievable.ldquoWe looked in Haddington, we looked in Gullane and we wanted to stay in East Lothian, where we are from and where the brewery is based.ldquoIt was one of those things where you were scrolling through Facebook and this popped up.ldquoIt was too good an opportunity and we got in touch with Gerard McPhillips [who had created the pub alongside his late business partner David McGee] and had a really good meeting with him.

Donrsquot be afraid to substitute any ingredients. Its important to cut the creaminess of the cheese with acidity form the orange.

Instead, the site suggests mixing it with green tea as a natural toner.Should you be missing the skin-smoothing effect of an eye-watering beauty salon chemical peel, you may want to follow the online sitersquos alternative: granulated sugar, mixed with olive oil then a right good rub.For those who can spare some beer, its yeast content will help fight excessive sebum production and the bacteria that causes acne.Mix with egg whites and mashed strawberries then use as a face pack ndash or just pretend itrsquos a beery kind of meringue and eat it.While the websitersquos store cupboard treatments may seem a shade desperate, according to Claire Gray of Glasgow-based skincare specialist Ermana, there is real merit in seeking out a more natural approach to our skincare regimes.ldquoAt the moment, most of us are focused on shopping for essentials such as food and medicine, and skincare is often viewed as a luxury product, she says.ldquoBut all this time indoors and washing our hands is having an impact on our skin.For eyes strained from peering too long at Tiger King on Netflix, she has an age-old remedy: ldquoThe tannins in tea can help reduce puffiness and get rid of dark circles. Simply soak a tea bag in warm water and place on your eyes for  minutes.ldquoFor an astringent or toner, wipe a teabag over your face to tighten skin and then blot with a towel.With coffee shops closed and our espresso fix now confined to home, there is a use for all those spent coffee grounds. ldquoSimply add some coffee grounds to coconut oil to make your own at-home scrub, she says.ldquoThe coffee grains help remove dirt and dead skin cells and promote overall skin health, and the scrubbing action stimulates blood flow and can help to reduce cellulite.ldquoThe caffeine in coffee grounds has potent antioxidant properties that can help protect the skin from sun damage.While honeyrsquos antibacterial, anti-fungal and antiseptic properties mean it makes a handy face mask, so too do the fats, minerals and vitamins in mashed avocado.Pineapple is almost a skincare superfood: vitamin C, bromelain and antioxidants can help prevent and treat acne, fine lines, sun damage and uneven tone. Rub it on, leave for a few minutes and rinse off.Gray suggests therersquos even a skincare use for that bottle of apple cider vinegar lurking at the back of the cupboard. ldquoThe main ingredient in apple cider vinegar is acetic acid but it also contains lots of other natural alpha-hydroxy acids, she says.ldquoThese work together to gently exfoliate the skin by dissolving dead skin cells. Applying apple cider vinegar to the skin also delivers beneficial enzymes, proteins and good bacteria.With hand-washing a national hobby, she suggests taking particular care when choosing which soaps to buy.ldquoHandwashes contain water and any product with water has preservatives to stop it degrading. Andit says lsquoparfumrsquo on the bottle, itrsquoll have a multitude of sins.ldquoItrsquos much better to choose a natural soap, such as one made with olive oil.Helen Atherton of Edinburgh-based soap specialist, Dook, agrees that while washing hands with soap is a proven virus-killer, many harsh supermarket soaps will also wreck our hands.ldquoThe dference between a bar of handmade soap and a manufactured one is huge, she says. ldquoIn handmade soaps, the natural glycerine thatrsquos squeezed out in the industrial process is retained. So handmade soap is much kinder but will still destroy viruses.She uses coconut oil, shea butter, essential oils and Himalayan salt to make her organic soap, but strongly advises against attempting to break out the saucepans to rustle up your own bar.ldquoIf yoursquore not careful, homemade soap can go a bit rubbish ndash therersquos chemistry involved, caustic soda.

Itrsquos not enough for Scottish art and big institutions like Kelvingrove to be limited to the most popular names like the Glasgow Boys, Jack Vettriano or Charles Rennie Mackintosh.ldquoPeople are very familiar with the work of the Glasgow Boys. But Glasgow has other painters. Therersquos a Glasgow Girl. Shersquos not even Scottish but came here and fell in love with the city to such an extent that she painted it throughout her short le. Eardley is a hugely important British artist and she should have a major exhibition in a British institution of note, like the Tate.Eardley was born on May , , on a dairy farm in Warnham, Sussex. Her family later moved to London and then, in , amid the growing threat of war, to Bearsden.The following year, she began her studies at Glasgow School of Art and proved fearless in her pursuit of subjects to paint. Her wanderings brought her to impoverished Townhead in the northeast of the city, where she established a studio. The paintings Eardley did there ndash particularly her famous portraits of the Samson children ndash are considered landmarks of th-century art.For her niece Anne Morrison, a Bearsden-based ceramicist, Eardleyrsquos relationship with an urban district which was facing the demolition ball is an example of just how daring and exceptional she was.ldquoTownhead was just not the area that you would go to ndash I was kept well away from it, she said. ldquoEven my brother, who was a couple of years older, said he had never been up there either. It was not the place to be. It was just the poverty and seeing what that part of Glasgow looked like. Middle-class kids just did not get taken there.ldquoShe actually caught something that was disappearing at the time, as the buildings were getting knocked down and people were getting moved where. It captured something of the city and the children there. Itrsquos not glorying it but itrsquos capturing it in a very human way.Morrison suggested that the lack of a major event to mark the centenary of Eardleyrsquos birth could have something to do with the Scottishness of her work.ldquoIt does seem right to have a celebration of her work but it does not seem to be happening, she added. ldquoHer name gets forgotten. She has not had the recognition at a UK level that she should. Thatrsquos the trouble. Shersquos a Scottish artist and she gets put aside because her subjects were Scottish as well.Laura Cumming, art critic for The Observer, described Eardley as ldquoone of the deepest landscape artists who ever lived, and among the most humanitarian painters of men, women and especially children.She added: ldquoEvery opportunity to see her work is precious ndash anywhere at all.ldquoThere have been shows in Scotland, the last that I remember was in . She deserves many more, and so the ideal would be a touring show that took in London, presenting her work throughout the United Kingdom to a new generation. Next year must not be allowed to slip by without a full-scale retrospective of her powerfully stirring and beautul work.Arts journalist Jan Patience said: ldquoThe National Galleries of Scotland in Edinburgh has done a power of work to cement her reputation with two major shows in the last  years, but there has been no major Eardley show for years in Glasgow, the city she called home. I believe the last one was in what was then called The Third Eye Centre in the s.ldquoAn Eardley show in Glasgow would attract visitors in their thousands and a no-show in her centenary year shows a real lack of vision.Local authorities in Scotlandrsquos largest cities said events were being organised or considered to mark the anniversary.A spokeswoman for Glasgow Le said: ldquoAs one of Scotlandrsquos most popular th-century artists we anticipate a small programme of events to mark Joan Eardleyrsquos centenary.ldquoWe are pleased to have a small number of her drawings and paintings in our collection, which includes the much-loved oil Glasgow Kids, a Saturday Matineacutee Picture Queue, on show in Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum. However, we do not hold the breadth of works required to stage a standalone exhibition.An Aberdeen City Council spokeswoman said: ldquoEardleyrsquos work is showcased as one of the Our Collection highlights in Gallery  ndash Collecting Art and her work can be seen throughout the collections galleries. A number of the oils we own are on display, including a powerful seascape painted at Catterline.ldquoThe  centenary of Joan Eardleyrsquos birth presents a welcome opportunity for us to celebrate the artistrsquos strong connection with the northeast of Scotland in a number of ways.A spokesman for Leisure and Culture Dundee, which runs the McManus Gallery and Museum, said: ldquoWe have no current plans to mark the Joan Eardley centenary next year.A spokesman for the National Galleries of Scotland said: ldquoThe National Galleries celebrated the le and work of Joan Eardley in a comprehensive exhibition just three years ago, and the exhibitionrsquos curator Patrick Elliott, a leading expert on Eardley, is writing a book on Eardley and Catterline as part of the centenary celebrations. All future plans, including publication of this book and our exhibition schedule, are subject to review due to the ongoing health crisis. However, we do intend on marking Eardleyrsquos centenary next summer, in one form or another.The Tate galleries declined to comment."},{"url":null,"title":"Marianne Taylor  The lockdown exit plan is ageist  Over-70s can decide what   s best for their health","story":"They are a mixture of the married, orced and widowed.

They live in dferent parts of the country, come from dferent socio-economic backgrounds, have dferent desires and goals.So why are they being treated as one homogenous, vulnerable group, and condemned to an indefinite lockdown While it looks like those of us aged  and under may soon be allowed to restart our lives as part of the lockdown exit plan ndash albeit cautiously and while following social distancing measures ndash it seems the over-s may be told by the Scottish and UK governments to keep self-isolating for up to  months. Maybe longer.Such a blanket policy surely has ageism at its core, regardless of how well-intentioned. How  do you explain the assumption that everyone over the age of  is weak and incapable of making decisions about their own health and wellbeing The evidence from UK Covid- wards suggests the average age of a critically ill patient is . Nine out of  have underlying conditions such as high blood pressure, obesity or type  diabetes. We also know, of course, this cruel illness can afflict, sometimes kill, young and fit people.Until a vaccine is widely available ndash an endeavour scientists believe may take  months or more ndash many people with underlying health conditions of every age group will obviously want to take maximum care and precautions to prevent exposing themselves to danger. They accept, hard as it may be, that they wonrsquot be able to leave home. Others wonrsquot have the mental capacity to make these decisions for themselves.But what about over-s that are fitter, healthier and more active than their younger relatives and friends  And what about older people who do suffer from underlying health problems but would rather take a dferent approach once restrictions start to be lted They may decide it is worth leaving home, spending time with grandchildren and friends, going shopping, evenit means an increased chance of catching the virus. They may be willing to accept the associated risks and consequences.Whatrsquos so galling is the idea that no-one over  can or should decide for themselves what risks they are willing to take with their own health and wellbeing.One of most interesting aspects of this crisis has been the way it has forced all of us to examine and question what makes le worth living. Many of us, myself included, will have come to the conclusion that social contact, time spent with other human beings, is the most precious thing in our lives.This is certainly the case for most of the older folk I speak tonow, especially those who have lost their partner and or live alone. Spending time with children, grandchildren, siblings and pals is what keeps them going. It doesnrsquot take a PhD in psychology to work out that Skype and Zoom will only suffice for so long.I was walking in an empty Glasgow city centre recently and the saddest thing of all was the absence of the cheery bands of elderly ladies and gents that usually frequent Sauchiehall Street on week days, comparing prices and purchases, enjoying a cuppa and a scone, or a pint. The thought of them home alone indefinitely, stoic as they may be, is heartbreaking. For some in care homes, extended isolation will be torturous.Itrsquos one thing ordering people to live without friends and family for a few weeks. Itrsquos something  entirely telling them to do so for months, maybe years. Even for their own good. Some, especially those in the autumn of their lives, may understandably decide it is a sacrice they are not willing to make.There has been much talk recently about treating people like adults. This must include the over-s, who, letrsquos face it, have been grown up for longer than anybody .To be clear, I am not advocating reckless breaking of current lockdown rules. Irsquom saying we need a sensible approach to what comes next, one that doesnrsquot discriminate against the elderly. One that ensures le is still worth living.All columnists are free to express their opinions.

Presumably itrsquos so householders know, at half a milersquos distance, that the person staggering up the street laden with parcels is not a random stranger intending to shower them with unwanted muesli or medication.Since my involvement entails nothing more than a bit of light shopping for a few folk, most of whom live within yards of my front door, therersquos no need for anything official or officious. To don a sherbet lemon jacket when dropping off asparagus or cornflakes would be to turn into Captain Mainwaring, with clipboard and pointer under arm.

Mine was designed with a burly bloke in mind, and seems to have seen a bit of the world already. All the better, in this hand-me-down era, where spanking new is frowned upon as frivolous. In the sht towards thrt, baggy and shabby earn extra Brownie points.From clachans to city centres, big-hearted armies across the entire country are organising rotas, filling in spreadsheets, and helping out to make sure those in greatest need or isolation do not feel abandoned or helpless. The spirit of kindness this pandemic has stirred is humbling. Wersquove always liked to think of ourselves as a caring nation ndash not always with reason ndash but seeing the range of ways in which theory is being put into practice is eye-opening. This will have far-reaching consequences, some of which, I suspect, will reverberate long after lockdown. Not the least of these is discovering how many are eager to be pressed into service, and what they can achieve when marshalled.None of us knows how long more vulnerable members of society will be asked to stay home. What is increasingly clear, though, is that while the sort of helpful domestic support going on now will be finite ndash even , for some, the necessity of relying on others makes it feel never-ending ndash informal community involvement on several fronts will continue to be important, and perhaps even essential, in the coming years.Long before the present situation, a crack squad of citizen gardeners had taken it upon themselves to turn our nearest town into an outpost of Kew gardens. Others put up Christmas decorations, or tend the tubs and raised beds at the train station, keeping plants on the concourse thriving across the seasons. There are iniduals, meanwhile, who go out in all weathers with litter pickers and refuse bags. They clear the verges and river banks of crisp-packets, plastic bottles, cans, takeaway cartons and all the detritus ditched by those who shouldknow better. Thanks to them, wildle and livestock are safer, burns cleaner, the undergrowth no longer unsightly and depressing.Irsquove always been intrigued by those who donrsquot feel their patch ends where their property meets the pavement. For such folk, the mental map of where their obligation or responsibility lies stretches far beyond the obvious bounds of self-interest. Most of us like to keep our own house in order, but those who are outward-looking are protective of a much wider area. The same goes for helping others. For some, the family circle is as far as their antennae reach. Others respond to those in need whom theyrsquove never met, or ndash through charitable giving especially ndash whose names theyrsquoll never know.Who can say what state the economy will be in when this virus goes into retreat, nor how long it will take to recover. None of the predictions makes cheerful reading, so it seems reasonable to assume that, for a period at least, there will not be an abundance of cash in council coffers. They were hardly overflowing a year ago but with the likelihood of a serious fiscal downturn, shoestring budgets will grow even more threadbare.Around these parts, people are stepping up, not just to collect refuse or plant bulbs by the roadside, but to mow communal areas of grass, strim embankments and de-litter waterways and bridlepaths. You could say that most of this is the councilrsquos responsibility, and yoursquod be right. At a certain point, however, it becomes a pernicious and self-defeating outlook always to expect others to get things done when you could simply get up and do it yourself.So, while this is not intended to suggest letting local government off the hook, whenever essential services come under threat ndash rural buses and post offices, libraries, care packages ndash those of us with time, imagination and inclination can surely help plug the gap, evenonly in the short-term.Thanks to the current volunteer force, I foresee a future when, with the memory of Covid  fading, initiatives intended to get us through this emergency will live on and help communities flourish.

Downing Street was filled with the sound of bawling and for once it wasnrsquot Alastair Campbell having a quiet word with one of Her Majestyrsquos Press.Baby Johnsonrsquos safe arrival is a rare instance of good news in grim times. You do not have to look far for the other kind of news. It is everywhere, from the rising death toll in care homes in the UK, to the rapidly escalating tragedy in the US.Since the beginning of this crisis I have found myself moving, like many others, through Elisabeth Kubler-Rossrsquos stages of grief: denial, anger, bargaining, depression and acceptance. Sometimes it happens over the course of a week. Other times I can notch up all five responses in a single day. Of late, I have struggled to get past the anger phase, particularly after watching Panorama last Monday.Richard Biltonrsquos film posed a straightforward question: had the Government failed the NHS  To date, more than  health and social care staff have died with Covid-, and there is a long, hard road ahead until a vaccine hopefully arrives.What a case for the prosecution Bilton assembled. He discovered that paper towels, among other things, had been counted as part of the billions of items of Personal Protective Equipmentthe Government said it had delivered. A pair of gloves was marked down as two items.The stockpile that the Government held did not include the gowns, masks and eye protection stipulated as essential by world health bodies. When shortages emerged, offers of help from British firms were ignored. Staff in some hospitals resorted to wearing DIY kits of bin bag aprons and swimming goggles.: Coronavirus in ScotlandFinally, when it became obvious that the Government was breaking its own rules on protecting staff it changed the guidelines. Covid- was taken off the list of ldquohighly consequential infectious diseases for which full kit was required.It was a classic case of fail to prepare, prepare to fail. So yes, governments across the UK have failed the NHS. For it is not just in England that there have been warnings about lack of PPE. Complaints have arisen across the UK, including Scotland.Some of the NHS staff who appeared on Panorama were justiably angry. They know how much the public appreciates what they are doing. They have been enormously touched by the weekly clap for carers. But as one intensive care nurse told Bilton: ldquoCalling us heroes just makes it okay when we die.No-one should be expected to put themselves in harmrsquos way without the protection they need. No Minister would enter premises where the virus lurks wearing bin bags and goggles. Yet every day doctors, nurses, carers, cleaners and other key workers are being placed in that position. After looking after other peoplersquos loved ones they then go home to their own, not knowing what they might be bringing with them. It is scandalous. Infuriating.How did Englandrsquos Health Secretary Matt Hancock respond to the Panorama claims at the Downing Street daily press conference  He was ldquonot sure the programme had been ldquoa fair and objective journalistic assessment of the situation. Mr Hancock ndash the ministerial equivalent of bin bags standing in for protective gowns: useless.Mr Johnson could have been asked about the problem with PPE shortages at Prime Ministerrsquos Questions yesterday, but baby events intervened and his place was taken, as last week, by Dominic Raab, First Secretary and Foreign Secretary.Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer was underpowered compared to last Wednesday. One can see already that his approach of ldquoconstructive opposition has its limits. The lawyerly fencing with Mr Raab, the more in sorrow than in anger tone, is ageing quickly.: Concerns raised over transportHe did eventually settle and took the First Secretary to task over PPE, citing a study by the Royal College of Physicians in which a third of doctors working with covid patients said they still did not have adequate gear.Mr Raabrsquos response was only too familiar. Global supply shortage. Not just Britain. Every effort being made, and so on.No-one disputes the scale of the task before governments. The issue is how well or otherwise they were prepared, and how quickly and competently they move to fix the problems. As one doctor told Panorama, this crisis is unprecedented, that word Ministers and others keep using ad tedium, but it was not unexpected.The very least NHS and care staff are owed is an apology. A proper admission from governments that they should have done better.This is crucial as the country moves towards the eventual lting of the lockdown. People must have trust in their governments. So far they have had confusion , misdirection and muddle.Little wonder that a YouGov survey for The Times this week found % of those polled did not want restrictions eased eventhe UK Governmentrsquos five tests have been met.Does that speak to a fear of the virus, a lack of trust in governments, or both When he stood in Downing Street on Monday, newly ed to work, the Prime Minister promised that any decisions on easing the lockdown would be taken with ldquomaximum possible transparency.Let us see that promise fulfilled. Talk to the public like the grown ups we are. Involve us in the discussion. If that does not happen then governments are preparing to fail with the lting of the lockdown as surely as they have on the supply of protective equipment.The World Health Organisation said the way out of this pandemic was to test, test, test.

Conventional coronavirus tests can give the wrong result  to  per cent of the time, and are especially prone to error when a person is asymptomatic.: We still dont know how many Covid deaths are linked to poverty and obesityHowever, concerns are such that the World Health Organisation issued a statement last Friday cautioning countriesagainst plans for an lsquoimmunity passportrsquo certying that an inidual is safe to travel orto work having already had the virus.ldquoThere is currently no evidence that people who have recovered from Covid- and have antibodies are protected from a second infection, stated the WHO, adding that studies show some of those who have beaten the infection ldquohave very low levels of neutralising antibodies in their blood, suggesting that cellular immunity may also be critical for recovery.Cellular immunity refers to an immune response where the body manufactures a type of white blood cell known as a T cell which is capable of recognising and destroying other cells infected with the virus ndash not just the viral pathogen itself.This was the point Prof Pennington was alluding to when he warned MSPs that a vaccine may prove ineffective.He said: ldquoMany people donrsquot really develop very much in the way of antibodies but they recover from the infection, which might suggest that traditional vaccines are not going to be particularly effective.ldquoI think probably the best thing we can hope for is a vaccine or a set of vaccines which will be partially protective, and they may not work as well in the elderly because most vaccines donrsquot.It is also possible that by the time a vaccine is ready for late-stage clinical trials there will no longer be enough virus circulating to actually test it against.: Poverty, lockdown or missed Covid cases - what is behind Scotlands mystery spike in deaths No SARS vaccine made it beyond phase I safety trials before the disease vanished in , while researchers testing a possible Ebola vaccine in  ran out of participants as the outbreak slowed.SARS, the closest relative of this new coronavirus, spread to  countries and caused  deaths. But vast surveillance testing, including thermal checks at airports, prompt isolation of patients, and strict quarantine for all known contacts, succeeded in interrupting human-to-human transmission to such an extent that the disease was effectively eradicated. There have been no known cases since.This may not work for Covid-, however. SARS patients were most infectious when they were already visibly ill with respiratory symptoms. There was no known transmission of the disease from asymptomatic or mildly sick patients.Covid-, on the other hand, seems to sp easily and transmits even before symptoms emerge. By the time patients become seriously ill, isolation will often come too late.Other hopes rest with antivirals, which have transformed HIV treatment.However, that too is proving elusive with the Lancet reporting today that the first randomised control trial of Ebola drug remdesivir found that it did not speed recovery in critically ill Covid patients, or reduce deaths, compared to a placebo.However, the scientists also note that their study ndash based on  patients in Wuhan, China ndash had to stop early after the steep decline in cases in China meant they ran out of patients to recruit.Ironically, the success of social distancing itself may hamper our quest for a cure."},{"url":null,"title":"letters-grateful-strong-shoulders-union-lean","story":"By being part of the UK, Scotland has benefited from a massive Covid- support package amounting to pound. billion ndash and still rising.

With tough times ahead, it would therefore be catastrophic economically for Scotland to go it alone by cutting itself adrt from the UK, which is the sixth-largest economy in the world.Even before the current Covid- crisis, the -page Growth Commission, led by economist and former SNP MSP Andrew Wilson, predicted, in , that independence would cause years of austerity for Scotland.While therefore the SNP remain entitled to make an emotional case for independence, even its most diehard supporters must now concede that they have lost the economic argument.The Covid- crisis reinforces the point that independence remains an SNP pipedream which Scotland simply cannot afford.Tim Jackson, Gullane.HOW very sad that we are in a position where the UK cannot speak as one during the coronavirus crisis and factions have opened up ndash all leading to confusion and exacerbating our already-fractured society.We should have one source of advice from the Sovereign Government and forget about petty political point-scoring.Douglas Cowe, Newmachar.HOW sad to see the pandemic stats from other countries similar to our own and realise that their death toll is a fraction of what we have here.If only we had been a bit braver at the referendum, how many lives could have been saved.Robert Drummond, Glasgow G.IT is disappointing that a politician of the stature of former Labour MP for Maryhill, Maria Fyfe, should seize upon the distortion by some sections of the press, who took out of context Nicola Sturgeons reply to a question about whether she would consider closing the border between Scotland and England Ms Sturgeon replied \"I dont have the power to close borders, but these are discussions of course we want to continue to have with the UK government\", referring to the UKs international borders .It is understandable that Ms Fyfe and Labour in Scotland should feel sore at the SNP Ms Fyfes former seat is now represented by an SNP MP, as indeed is every constituency in Glasgow, and Labour holds but one seat in Scotland however it only has itself to blame for the mortying mess in which it finds itself. As for Ms Fyfes suggestion of a Scottish version of The Thick Of It, may I suggest that given its showing in recent opinion polls in Scotland, there could well be a Labour version in the making of And Then There Were None.Ruth Marr, Stirling.EAST Lothian MP Kenny MacAskill speaks of \"dark forcesrsquorsquo being behind Alex Salmondrsquos trial .

Universities donrsquot just deliver teaching and research. They are major drivers of the economy ndash with the University of Glasgow alone contributing over pound.bn in economic output.:Coronavirus: Fears universities could be mergedthey dont embrace new normalUniversities are far from being immune to the financial impacts of the crisis. Indeed, there is every chance, as the Office for Budget Responsibilityrsquos figures show, that Higher Education could be one of the sectors which suffers most. Analysis by Universities UK suggests that the sector should be braced for revenue losses of several billion pounds, and that there is a signicant risk that some institutions across the UK will not survive at all.It is clear then thatwe are to see our universities play the role we know they are capable of in the national economic recovery, there will need to be an increase in public investment. It is deeply heartening that the First Minister has confirmed that all additional money delivered by the UK Treasury through the Barnett formula - stemming from extra investment in the sector south of the border - would be earmarked for higher education. Indeed, there is widespread recognition from the UK Government of the need for signicant support for the sector.The quest for the lsquonew normalrsquo must extend to universities too. For universities as with every other sector, there is no longer a status quo ndash and any calls for additional public funding need to make a virtue of this fact. We require new investment not to maintain old standards but to react and reform in the face of global change.We need to demonstrate a willingness to change in order to ensure we are best able to make a success of the new situation we are going to find ourselves in, and align ourselves even more closely with societal need. But we also need to be clear that the new success we seek isnrsquot just for our own sector ndash it is for Scotland, and our universities are only part of that.:Opinion: Iain Macwhirter: Our universities will learn that theyrsquore not too big to failThis of course wonrsquot entail doing everything dferently. In many cases, it will simply mean building on existing success. For example, our progress on Widening Participation in recent years has been extraordinary , with .% of Scottish domiciled entrants now coming from SIMD backgrounds ndash but it must go further, ensuring every young person in Scotland is ensured of the opportunity of a university education regardless of their economic background.But we should also help society confront new challenges. Universities UK have called for an additional investment in research. This could be tied to research themes our post-Covid society needs. A Covid economic downturn which risks rivalling the Great Depression will also scar the labour market, as previous deep recessions such as the early s have done. As our young people enter what is going to be a precarious labour market, Universities could do more in partnership with government. Part of the investment to support the sector could extend to funding postgraduate education for home students who would otherwise face a dficult labour market. If anything, our role in providing opportunity and equipping our young people with the skills they need to succeed is only going to be more important in a fragile economy and increasingly uncertain labour market. Such investment would help reduce inequality from the Covid economic shock. But it is also important for the national effort to come that graduates are equipped with the higher levelskills they need to succeed ndash and in the key sectors which can deliver maximum benefit to Scotland.Anything that would stand in the way of allowing universities to provide this social good ndash such as a reduction in funding ndash should be resisted. Equally, anything that would raise new barriers to young people in Scotland taking advantage of their right to higher education ndash such as a reimposition of tuition fees ndash should be dismissed with equal vigour. The arguments of austerity will not workwe want to see a genuine recovery that works for all.The economic contribution made by our sector is already huge ndash higher education is genuinely one of Scotlandrsquos success stories. It is also one of Scotlandrsquos top export sectors. It willto being that force in international education provision after the post-Covid crisis, especiallywe can preserve our relative strength and reputation internationally - with four of our institutions in the top  in the world.But we can and should do more. Last year I published a report for the Scottish Government on how universities can best harness and maximise their economic impact for the good of all and the current crisis offers an opportunity to re-examine some of the assumptions about how our sector operates. Our towns and cities are brimming with potential ndash and our universities can be the catalyst to turn this potential into tangible economic results. From the Quantum Technologies and Precision Medicine agenda in Glasgow to Big Data and Robotics in Edinburgh, and Le Sciences across Scotland, there are so many high potential areas for Scotland in which our universities are leading the way.I firmly believe thatwe take the right decisions, Scotlandrsquos universities can and will play a central role in our economic recovery. This will require investment and compromise on the part of both government and the higher education sector: but with both parties working together in the national interest, there is no reason why our universities in Scotland cannot continue to thrive, and to enhance our social, economic and cultural contribution to our national le.Professor Sir Anton Muscatelli is Principal of the University of Glasgow."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/11317162.jpg?type=article-full","title":"coronavirus-15-countries-no-reported-cases-covid-19","story":"There are over  million cases so far with over , deaths so far as a result of the pandemic.:Coronavirus: Why a Covid vaccine might prove impossible - especiallysocial distancing worksWhile the disease, which started in Asia may have passed its peak in the area, the number of cases and deaths are increasing across a number of countries.All countries in North America and the Middle East have had at least one COVID- case and in total there is believed to have been a death from Covid- in at least  countries across the world.These are the  countries without a case of Covid- reported.However, it is worth stressing that these are reported cases and does not mean that the disease has not spread there.

In challenging circumstances, however, they are not helped by supply chains that are simply not operating fairly or equitably.“During a recent conference call with the cabinet secretary and islands minister, I raised concerns about the behaviour of some suppliers towards our island communities. It was a call echoed by MSP and MP colleagues from across the parties.“Unfortunately, two weeks on and shop owners and local wholesalers, who also supply our care homes and hospital, tell me little has changed. If anything, the situation is getting more serious.“I welcome Fergus Ewing’s recognition of the problem and the action he has taken in writing to  of the main suppliers. However, these efforts must now be redoubled as we need to see a dference on the ground.The Orkney MSP added: “At a time of crisis, getting access to food and essential items should not be a postcode lottery. Supply chains should be working in the interests of the entire population, and suppliers should be treating island wholesalers with fairness”.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Folk can do this by picking a m stretch of road or path, or by walking through a local greenspace and counting the number of instances of dog fouling in that area.

The academic suggested that the next stages of coronavirus containment could be developed earlier in the islands # but onlya comprehensive testing strategy was in place.Orkney and Shetland’s parliamentarians, Liam McArthur MSP, Alistair Carmichael MP and Beatrice Wishart MSP have called on the Scottish Government to provide assurances that they will engage meaningfully with Professor Pennington’s proposals and be open to considering how they might be implemented safely.Mr McArthur said: “Public safety must be paramount as decisions are taken about how and when the current restrictions might be lted.“In that context, however, Professor Pennington’s suggestions, which have already attracted a great deal of interest in Orkney and other island communities, deserve serious and urgent consideration.“If the Scottish Government genuinely want to treat the Scottish public ‘as grown ups’ then suggestions like these need to be dealt with in a transparent manner.“I have already written to both the Health Secretary and the First Minister to make this point, and to seek clarity on what consideration is being given to a more localised approach for the islands.  It is important that all options to tackling the coronavirus remain on the table during this unprecedented time.”Mr Carmichael added: “I hope that the Scottish Government will engage with these proposals seriously. That engagement must, however, also include close cooperation and discussion with local communities to ensure public confidence in safety.“This is not a plan that can be run centrally. Local input and know-how is key and islanders should be at the heart of how we translate these proposals into action.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Until late last year, a suitable vessel proved dficult to source, said the council.It then became known that the Nordic Sea, which operated on a number of passenger routes in the far north of Norway, had become available.Following visits and sea trials involving Orkney Marine Services and Orkney Ferries staff, the vessel was considered as a suitable replacement for the Golden Mariana.As the Nordic Sea was operating under a Norwegian Passenger Certicate, it was known that a number of requirements would have to be met before she was considered ready for a UK passenger certicate.With surveys now completed and a works list developed, the decision to complete the purchase was made and the vessel departed Bergen for Orkney yesterday morning, Thursday.On arrival, the vessel was handed over to Orkney Islands Council, but due to Covid- restrictions and the need for some works to be carried out to bring her up to the full UK Classication and Certication, it will be a while yet before the residents of Papa Westray are able to benefit from their new passenger ferry.The purchase of the new vessel was part funded by the Scottish Government and Transport Scotland.More details in The Orcadian Marine Scene section next week.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Considering his past record as a caring inidual, including his efforts to help the homeless, that was not really surprising.But apart from manager Daniel Stendl, who waived his salary, others at the Edinburgh club appeared reluctant to follow Naismith’s example. Reports later suggested that no other Hearts player would be asked to take more than a  per cent reduction.Also last week it was claimed that Scotland manager Steve Clarke had accepted a  per cent cut, simply meaning his salary would go down from £, to £,.In England the men’s and women’s international bosses Gareth Southgate and Phil Neville apparently agreed to take  per cent less. In the former’s case he would still be pocketing £. million while Neville would get £,.At club level south of the border the situation is very inconsistent. Some managers, such as David Moyes, Eddie Howe and Graham Potter have volunteered to take a cut while Pep Guardiola donated a million euros to help fight the outbreak in Spain. There was a terrible poignancy to Guardiola’s generosity a few days later when it was reported that his -year-old mother had died as a result of the virus in Barcelona.But while most Premiership clubs have placed most non-playing staff on some kind of temporary leave, some receiving  per cent of their salary through the government’s job retention scheme, the situation with the majority of players is still unclear.This is a dficult situation and UK health minister Matt Hancock ruffled some feathers when he suggested that well-off footballers should consider doing more to help.Some journalists have even criticised Hancock, saying he was completely out of touch with what was actually happening. That was unfair. The minister was not speaking about the game in general, where players at lower-level clubs are paid a pittance compared with those at the top. He was merely highlighting the fact that many could easily survive with no pay at all for the foreseeable future.To put this in perspective, most players at Premiership level are earning several million a year, an increase of roughly two and a half times what they took home six years ago. A high proportion are on more than £, a week.At the top of the tree are Manchester United goalkeeper David De Gea and Man City midfielder Kevin De Bruyne, who are on over £ million and £ million respectively.Even a player I confess to never having heard of, Tanguy Ndombele of Tottenham Hotspur, is reportedly bagging £. million a year.In the Championship the average annual pay is considerably less, around £, a year or £, a week. And in the lower League Two it drops to £ or £ weekly, not all that much above the national average.During the current situation all these figures need to be taken into consideration. We should have no issue with lower-paid players still getting  per cent of their wages for doing nothing. They, like everyone , still have bills to pay.But for the multi-millionaires to grumble about being hit is about as hard to take as the coronavirus pandemic itself.: : : : : : : :No decision has yet been made about whether the football leagues in the UK will be completed, whenever the action begins again.In Scotland it has been proposed in some quarters that the title should just be handed to Celtic, as the Glasgow side had an almost unassailable lead when play stopped.Now a director of the other half of the Old Firm has suggested thatthat happened, their rivals would only be able to claim “eight and a half” in a rowthey were crowned champions.Personally I feel that this season’s scheduled fixtures should be played out, however long it takes. Only then should the - action start, evenit means a shortened campaign.: : : : : : : :There are currently eight premier ision football clubs in Shetland, all of which have been in existence for dferent s of time.Scalloway are the oldest, dating back to , with Lerwick sides Celtic and Thistle being able to trace their beginnings back to the early part of the th century.Spurs and Ness United both emerged during the s, with Whitedale, Whalsay and Delting joining the senior league more recently.Someone suggested to me that a best XI from each could be selected, to give players and supporters something to ponder over during the current period of uncertainty.There will no doubt be controversy over this, but that’s what opinion is all about. If anyone would like to submit their thoughts, or their own ideas of what their respective best sides would be, feel free to send them in.Next time I will give you the line-ups, in alphabetical order, from the past  years.

However I have no idea how I can add my contribution. Ryan can you help me out here and publish the link in the Shetland Times mailto:NTIMailbox@ofgem.gov.ukIt is not unreliablestored. This technology exists. If we simply used the electricity to generate hydrogen, and store it just like the old city gas, we can run all our power needs through hydrogen fuel cells. Simple, cheap and clean. Or we could let global heating destroy our children#s future because nobody wants to see a big windmill near their property. I#m old enough not to care.To give a hand to each.#To leave the oyster-bed.#The sun#s shining here and like the old oyster, I can#t be bothered, either, John. Have a nice evening, do.Love it, thanks JT 🙂No real need for fuel cells. Hydrogen was % of coal gas, can be stored in gasometers and burnt in gas fires and used to power piston engines, gas turbines and most conventional heating systems. A hell of a lot cleaner than burning wood chip. Now forget the windfarms, obsolete technology, use tidal generation and mini modular nuclear.That way we will have a living planet worth saving, not a mass of concrete, steel and fibreglass.I#m not sure windfarms are quite obsolete yet# with the technology that is available at scale onshore wind is the cheapest source of new electricity. Perhaps not on peat bogs though. That#s not to say we can#t do better with other renewables.PS circa Dads Army, I am not that old!!!At  dollars a barrel so called renewables will need to reduce costs by a huge margin to compete with oil. At the current oil price of less that  dollars a barrel wind, tidal and solar no hope.Renewable energy is not produced in barrels. Where did you hear that We continue to burn oil and gas because the infrastructure is there and the investment has been made. But when it comes to investing in new electricity generation, onshore wind is the cheapest. Also # I am not sure how such a low price is beneficial to the oil industry what with their high fixed costs As a patriotic Brit I am all for us standing on our own two feet and generating cheap and reliable energy. Shetland aside, as a nation we are net importers of oil and gas. Why rely on the likes of Russia or our Middle Eastern friends when we can spend that money at home and have jobs for Brits producing clean and plentul energy  Let#s stop living in the s. Let#s have clean, reliable British energy instead.I tend to lean in the direction indicated by John Thomas.For reasons of cheapness , safety and reliability I can’t see why wind and tidal forces should not be the primary options for energy generation. Winds are unlikely to stop blowing and sea tides are unlikely to dry up , so how can they not be major considerations Nuclear power is also in the running provided that the associated risks can be accepted. No matter what the no doubt wellintended may suggest, there ARE risks which do not raise their ugly heads with wind and water. Reliable , sustainable , and non polluting. What more could one ask for in this struggling , changed 🌎 world we occupy for a short time. Now Thorium nuclear is clean, no long half-le isotopes produced and no danger of meltdown.They are also neither cheap or reliable. Back up will also be requiredfor when the sun doesn#t shine or the wind isn#t suitable at more expense. More renewables will inevitably contribute to increased fuel poverty.Michael Moore # Planet of the Humans # a documentaryon the renewable energy scam that the left want banned # who would have thought !The more you look into the problem of energy supply against saving the environment, the more contradictory conclusion one gains. Wind and Solar maybe cleaner, but how much land and natural habitat being destroyedwould be required to power a city of several million##.and this is just  city     What energy source would be required alsothere are days of no sun or no wind. What backup technology would be in place, and would this also be clean energy  It seems ironically disturbing that cleaner energy through wind and solar, would also have a negative impact on the environmentyou take into consideration the polluting processes involved in the manufacturing of such devices.as well as the huge amount of land required , which would also be expanding as the population grows. I would assess cleaner energy via wind and solar would have a larger impact on the natural eco-systems and the environment and would still be reliant on fossil fuels.

Photo: Dave DonaldsonThe letter was backed by  MPs including former cabinet ministers and shadow ministers and highlighted the importance of local press in communicating trustworthy information and the financial strain faced by local journalists in light of the coronavirus.Mr Carmichael said: “Local press are some of the most trusted sources of news for our communities and we must support them in this challenging time.“They are vital to our efforts to respond and recover from the coronavirus and yet they are facing signicant financial dficulties.“This letter is about getting a fair share of government advertising spend for local and independent press, to reflect both their importance in our communities and their financial needs.“The secretary of state for health has an important role in deciding where these advertising funds go.“If the government takes seriously the need to get valuable and timely information about coronavirus to people in every part of the country then they should get behind this campaign, which is backed by MPs from all sides of parliament.”Among the  signatories were Tory MPs David Mundell, Greg Clark and Michael Fabricant, Labour members Hilary Benn, John McDonnell and Margaret Hodge, Lib Dem MPs Christine Jardine and Tim Farron and SNP members Tommy Sheppard and Philippa Whitford.Good. Yes. But let#s see Alastair also advocate thoroughly for zero hours workers, for parents living in temporary accommodation, for children who are feed from food banks, for people who are now, and who will shortly be living beyond their means,and for the increasing number of people who cannot meet their basic needs. A Universal Basic Income is fundamentally a liberal idea, in as much as people have entitlemment to be spared unreasonable harm. Sowe were to use existing systems to support iniduals, in a responsive and responsible way, possibly at a lower cost than the support now being offered for businesses, we would secure immediate economic stimulus, prevent unreasonable hardship, rebalance the playing field and limit damage to future generations. A heap of thinking has gone into the idea of what rights we each ought to enjoy, the things we should freely have, like affordable transport, and the things we should have the freedom to escape, like hunger. Now is a useful time to be considering such issues, the better for all.An interesting idea, Peter, and one which it may surprise you to learn was looked atseveral years ago by WIr Shetland as a possible policy option for Shetland autonomy.At the time, no country in the world had adopted it however FInland was planning to run a pilot project which it was decided to monitor. I am no longer involved and cannot comment on the current WS situation or policy.After a short, two year trial, the Finnish government decided to end the scheme last year and was reportedly considering alternatives such as a universal credit scheme, similar to that of the UK .Pleased that our MP was pressing the Chancellor on this within  minutes!Always good to see fellow Liberals backing liberal ideas.It is going to be really important to sustain a discussion on the basic rights and freedoms everyone should be able to access now. People should be free from depending on food banks. People should be able to travel freely to access skills training and broad educational opportunities.The UBI can help stop people falling through the cracks, but other ideas are neededall are to be able to live fulfilling lives of their choosing.This is because the cost of being to be able to exercise basic freedoms ies both across the country and from household to household as people#s inidual circumstances so dfer.The Universal Basic Income would help to kick start the economy and would do do fairly, , as Alistair, suggested, the tax system was used to claw the cash back from those who did not need it. Of course that would involve taxing the rich.Little wonder that the Chancellor dismissed the idea out of hand.Permanent State Fund Dividend of Alaska, the same idea. Not bad for a Trump-voting Republican state. Somewhat predates the liberal idea. Just another Red-Necked, Republican, USA idea.In response to John Tulloch#s feelgood posturing on Wir Shetlandhaving #looked at# a Universal Basic Income, lets remember this: plenty comparably despicable groups have flirted with all sorts of policies the better to draw folk in.It makes the basic instinct informing Wir Shetlandand John Tulloch#s general political outlook no less reptilian.John derided Great Thunberg at the same time as a global alt-right campaign was launched against her. He is informed by some really unpleasant ideas.He has recently focused on China to distract attention away from the awful mess that has been Boris#s response to Covid .John Tulloch might want to whitewash his objectionable politics by aligning himself to a Universal Basic Income, but his whitewash reeks of hogwash because it is..."},{"url":null,"title":"isles fiddlers pitch in on version of wild mountain thyme ","story":"Catriona Macdonald, Chris Stout, Kevin Henderson, Ross Couper and Margaret Robertson are all part of the recording and video, which will be released by Edinburgh Tradfest on st May, the day the festival would have begun this year.Laura-Beth Salter and Shetlander Kevin Henderson are two of those taking part in the recording.

I tried keeping them in all day but I ended up with an ear infection.I tried noise-reduction headphones – very expensive – but anything to keep out that incessant -decibel shrieking.I even tried wearing them whilst gardening and playing an early Queen album at full volume: “Sheer Heart Attack” – that should drown it out,it doesn’t give me one …What next I was so sensitive, or to give it its psychological name – “sensitised” – that I could even pick out the faintest suggestion of a chaffinch on a TV programme.It might be while watching the golf or some Jane Austen adaptation with a scene near some trees – and that blooming chaffinch was there in the background. Why doesn’t anybody  notice it What next  What next to do  Chop all the trees down around the house, down to ground level – that’s what next to do.And so I take an axe and like a deranged lumberjack, I fell every Sitka spruce within earshot.I cut down the white fuchsia to within feet of the ground, and the sessile oak and the sycamores and the rowan and the Swedish whitebeam – the lot, all down to within a few feet of the ground.That should do it. Just tell everyone it’s to give the deciduous trees more space, and the coppicing of what’s left will make them grow all the stronger.And then, next spring – all potential perching sites cleared from near the house….but the traffic!You open the door and there is a car stopped, looking at us and we look out of the window and there is a car stopped looking back at us….What a state to be in!Quick – replant some mature trees to provide an instant screen. The Christmas trees from past years with root balls still intact – they should do it and that escallonia and the New Zealand holly – evergreens to block the view of the road.This is madness. One month I am cutting down all the trees the next month I’m desperate to put them back!There is humour here.Someone calls when the trees have disappeared only to find that when next they visit, just months later, the trees are back again – some fully grown.Complete amazement: “Things don’t half grow fast here!”Thankfully, it’s an episode from the distant past.Time is a great healer I gradually managed to rewire my brain circuits and become habituated to the noise of the chaffinch.I can laugh at it now, but it shows how fragile and vulnerable the human mind can be.And so to the news that’s on everyone’s mind – coronavirus.As someone over , I am trying to minimise the risk of catching it and passing it on. Self-isolating is a daunting prospect and who knows how long this lockdown will last and what the future will bring I am reminded of that classic story from : “The Monkey’s Paw” by WW Jacobs. “Without, the night was cold and wet … ‘Hark at the wind … Path’s a bog and the road’s a torrent.”Gosh! This is far too close to home.The tale has been adapted many times for radio, television, film and theatre, and the full short-story text is available on the Internet.In the present circumstances it would be in poor taste to dwell on the details.Suffice it to say, the message is a salutary one, beginning with the anonymous quote: “Be careful what you wish for, you may receive it.”As I sit here in this eerie quietness – no more tourist traffic rumbling by and stopping outside our gateway – I cannot escape the jarring irony.The West Highland Free Press online shop is taking no new orders until st May .Sorry for any inconvenience this may cause."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/ben-ak-wind-farm.jpg","title":"renewables firm launches support fund for north west skye","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineHouseholds in North West Skye will be able to access grants of up to £ to help them through the coronavirus crisis thanks to a new major pledge from a renewable energy firm.has announced a fund for the communities around its windfarms to help alleviate the impact of the Covid- outbreak.The company is donating £, to be shared between the community benefit trusts which administer funds from its  wind farms in Scotland, England and Wales.Jason Bold, Chair of Dunvegan Community Trust who administer the funding from Ben Aketil Wind Farm, said: “Whilst we navigate these challenging circumstances in our rural community, Falck Renewables Covid- grant has offered us much needed funds to collaborate with local groups.#Dunvegan Community Council has been very responsive and progressive to set up a Community Fund, which we are proud to back with Falck’s kind support.”The Trust has joined forces with Dunvegan and District Community Council to establish a community fund offering financial support to anyone in the community council area experiencing financial hardship due to the Covid  virus.Grants will be generally given to support immediate needs and be limited to £ per household.The community fund will be facilitated and regulated by Skye and Lochalsh Citizens Advice Bureau.John Laing, chair of Dunvegan and District Community Council, said: “The Dunvegan Community Council are aware of the dficulties many iniduals and families are experiencing during these exceptional times.#We have launched the Dunvegan Community Fund to assist those in our community who are in need of assistance as a result of the Covid  virus and are delighted to have generous support of The Dunvegan Trust and Falck Renewables whose generous support have made our fund possible”Managing Director of Falck Renewables UK, Richard Dibley, said: “We have a close relationship with the communities around our wind farms and their response to the current challenging situation has been as proactive and heartwarming as we would have expected.#They are already involved in helping the people and organisations in their area who need it most and we were keen to support them.”Dunvegan Community Trust has also made a £, donation to the Skye and Lochalsh Community Food Bank.Food bank chair Davina McCluskie said: “We are very grateful for the grant from the Dunvegan Community Trust which will go a long way in helping those in need.  We have seen an increase in users at the foodbank and I fear we will see many more in the coming weeks.#We have no paid members on the food bank committee #

And that’s actually the better thing to do.”Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeClose FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappHe referenced a report by Ulster University captured at the height of the pandemic using thermal imaging cameras in offices, which showed that many people are still not washing their hands.Dr Ackerley said: “There have been some research papers that indicate coronavirus can be shed in faeces so it’s even more important that people wash their hands after going to the toilet as well as all the other key times.She said there needed to be a change in public attitudes when lockdown measures eased in the future.“One of the things we need to change in our opinions is that it’s not just about protecting ourselves from other people but it’s about protecting other people from ourselves.”With food packing, the risk is low but there are steps you can take to put your mind at ease, she said.“It could be contaminated but the contamination isn’t necessarily going to be in the food factory or even in the shop or from the people running the shop. “But a lot of people are going to be touching the packaging in the course of the day when the food is on sale.“If the food is something that has got a long shelf le - like a tin or a bottle of squash - you could just leave it for three days by which time we know that the amount of viable virus will have reduced substantially.“If you have milk or something perishable that needs to go in the fridge or freezer and it concerns you, it isn’t that much effort to disinfect the outside surface of the food packaging.“The most important thing is to go straight to the wash basin and wash your hands for  seconds and that really does help to remove any virus you might have picked up.

By Margaret CanningApril   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailTop business groups in the UK and Ireland have called for the Taoiseach and First and deputy First Ministers to co-operate to protect public health and restore prosperity following Covid-.The CBI in the UK and the Republic#s Ibec have today written a joint letter to Taoiseach Leo Varadkar, and to First Minister Arlene Foster and deputy First Minister Michelle O#Neill.They are urging co-operation and co-ordination across the UK and Ireland to provide the best chance of protecting public health and restoring people#s prosperity.A memorandum of understanding for North-South co-operation on public health was signed by the departments of health in Northern Ireland and the Republic earlier this month. But today#s letter calls for economic co-operation to help the recovery.Ibec and the CBI said that it was in everyone#s interests for experts on both sides of the border to be in regular communication about each other#s plans for economic revival, including for all-island business and cross-border employment. They also suggest that parallel conversations should take place between the UK and Republic, suggesting the North South Ministerial Council and British-Irish Council as the framework for talks.And talks on co-ordination could also be held through meetings of the Tanaiste, First and deputy First Minister and the Northern Ireland Secretary of State, it suggests.The letter is signed by the CBI director general Carolyn Fairbairn and Ibec chief executive Danny McCoy.It states that both organisations have been working through one of the most challenging periods for business that we can recall.It stresses existing and historic economic and political links between the UK and Ireland, including through the Good Friday Agreement and the Common Travel Area.It adds: As the coming weeks unfold, we all hope to make great progress with efforts to both suppress the virus and start planning for that much needed economic reboot. The business community is acutely aware of the deep economic impact on business and livelihoods that the measures to contain Covid- have had across these islands.It said that integrated supply chains for essential goods like medicines and pharmaceuticals were of immediate concern, and accounted for substantial trade between Ireland and the UK.The agri-food market across Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland is at the forefront of all island business and indeed across the two islands agri-food products trade seamlessly - with Ireland being the UK#s second largest source of food imports and one of its largest markets for retail related exports. To support these supply chains and ensure that the measures taken in the recovery phase help to sustain the wide range of business activity between the two jurisdictions, we will need the highest level of co-operation, co-ordination and joined-up thinking.Ato daily movement of workers and goods between Northern Ireland and Irelandwill depend on the easing of current restrictions and alignment with medical advice. To support and re-energise the strong economic linkages, Ibec and CBI believe it is important and in everyone#s economic interests to have the experts on both sides of the island of Ireland regularly communicating on their respective economic restart plans.Belfast ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Now, Finnebrogue hosts a series of social and cultural events throughout the year, boosting funds for charity and keeping the estate at the heart of the community. I asked Noel, chairman of the Hope for Youth charity, how Covid- has impacted le at Finnebrogue.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseNoel Lamb in the library at Finnebrogue House FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappNoel Lamb in the library at Finnebrogue HouseUnfortunately, the current lockdown has caused several cancellations, he says.We have a iety of events here at Finnebrogue, but one of the most successful is where I offer to host a dinner in the main dining room as an auction lot. One of the guests at the auction, either an inidual or a corporate, makes a bid, with the highest winning the auction lot.On the whole, I#ve no doubt that the situation will have an impact on all historic homes. Those depending on revenue from tours, events and gardens will suffer this year Noel LambThe most disappointing cancellation so far is a charity dinner due in May. Originally, this had been bid for at the Hope for Youth lunch at the Culloden Hotel with Roddy Doyle. It is a black tie event and the saloon, library and dining room would all have been used during the evening. Hopefully we can rearrange it for a later date, depending on social distancing guidelines.Last November, Hope for Youth also bid for a charity dinner at the House of Lords versus House of Commons swim. It was due to take place in November but I think we#ll have to make a decision in July. On the whole, I#ve no doubt that the situation will have an impact on all historic homes. Those depending on revenue from tours, events and gardens will suffer this year. As for Finnebrogue, most of the events are charity-related, so the charities will struggle as donations dry up.Whatever the changes at Finnebrogue, coronavirus has given Noel a new perspective on le.I was in London in mid-March when I suffered a sharp abdominal pain, he tells me. It took four trips to AE before a CT scan revealed a kidney stone. I was admitted to hospital for two days and during that time they tested me for coronavirus. I had none of the listed symptoms, so when it came back positive it was a bit of a shock.For two of those days in hospital I was placed in a Covid- ward where most people were on ventilators and suffering other ailments. I was unlucky to get ill but very fortunate not to have symptoms of the virus. I#ve been feeling fine ever since, but I came out of it with a rather dferent perspective. Now, I just enjoy every day, spending time in spring sunshine, appreciating the beautul gardens.Covid-#s greatest sting is the lack of contact between friends and family.Yes, I am missing the social interaction from friends and family, Noel says. I find not seeing people during the day very strange but fortunately there#s WhatsApp calls and other means of communication. Now, whenever I think of friends far away or those I haven#t seen in a while, I make a point of calling them. So far I have resisted Zoom! But when we get back to normality we#ll appreciate meeting people all the more.What is he looking forward to most when le s to normal I think, at the end of the day, there will have to be re-evaluations. We#ll all get a clearer image of what is really important and have more awareness of others. I#m looking forward to brighter days. Just sitting with friends, around the kitchen table, enjoying a salad or a bowl of pasta - such joy!‘We have so much sympathy for those couples who have had to postpone their wedding plans, but we have found everyone so cooperative’Coronavirus has brought an unprecedented challenge to Richard and Rosalind Mulholland of Ballyscullion Park, an estate which sits on the shores of Lough Beg in Co Londonderry, but it#s not the first the couple have faced.In , Ballyscullion was operating as a dairy farm until TB was detected among the herd and the couple were forced to start again. Making the most of their historic legacy - the Park dates back to  while the house was built in  - they ventured down the hospitality and tourism route, becoming one of Northern Ireland#s top event and wedding destinations.Now, even in light of the pandemic, Rosalind remains upbeat.We#re so fortunate to have the gardens, she says. They keep us busy and give us plenty to do. We took the opportunity of having no weddings to do some repairs on the lawns - levelling and reseeding - but it needs the rain to get it growing again! It#s lovely having three of our children at home and although Cordelia is in lockdown in Italy where she lives with her husband, rugby player Ian McKinley, we keep in touch via the internet.The advantage of a private venue like Ballyscullion Park is that the only people around the estate on the day are those connected to the wedding. We hope that will work in our favour as lockdown eases Rosalind MulhollandOur daughter Oliviais here, also working from home. She is project managing for University College London Hospital Trust, having regular meetings with her team in London. Her husband Kieran is also working from here although at the moment he#s quarantined in one of our cottages because he was in London till last Friday.

Initially, we didn#t think anything was wrong with him. He even passed his seven month hearing test. We took him everywhere, first to a Harley Street doctor then to Manchester University Hospital for further tests. Later we took him to Holland to a school for the deaf in St Michelgestel. He was five when we discovered he had autism. That was another shock but it also helped us make sense of the way he was. You know, people sometimes say #poor you#. My answer to that is, it#s not poor us - it#s poor James, he#s the one who has to cope. But he has done brilliantly and has thrived at Parkanaur College, near Dungannon, working in the gardening centre, the upholstery workshop and he loves cooking. I think he#s coping well with the lockdown.How did she explain the situation to James I told him the whole world is sick and we have to stay at home. I crossed out all the exciting things on his calendar - weddings, family parties, holidays. He has taken it well and is quite a happy chap.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseJames Mulholland FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappJames MulhollandHow has the lockdown affected business It has been a real challenge, and we have so much sympathy for the couples who have had to re-think their wedding plans, but everyone has been so cooperative, she says. All weddings to the end of June have been postponed, and even some July dates have reserved a back-up slot just in case. The advantage of a private venue like Ballyscullion Park is that the only people around the estate on the day are those connected to the wedding. We hope that will work in our favour as lockdown eases. We are inviting couples who can#t get married on their chosen date to come for a picnic in the garden, once restrictions have eased. They will be able to enjoy the garden without anyone  around, so they can still make some happy memories for their day.What about tour groups All cancelled and I can#t see them starting up till much later in the year, Rosalind remarks. It is really hard for the hospitality industry. Mid Ulster Council has been fantastic and has organized regular Zoom presentations from key people in tourism, legal and financial experts and marketing gurus. Ironically,  was to be the year when so many businesses took off!‘Our BB is closed, weddings and events are cancelled ... we’re looking at ways to ersy’Just a few miles from Bushmills, Ballylough estate has been in the Traill family since . Down through the centuries, the beautul Georgian property has housed many distinguished residents, including Colonel William Traill, pioneer of the first commercially run hydro-electro powered tram system that once operated between Portrush and the Giant#s Causeway. In more recent times, current owners June and David Traill have put the historic property on the hospitality map, including running their house as a bed and breakfast.There is no farming here, so for us to make the property #wash its face# and bring in an income, we#ve had to come up with new business ideas, June explains.In keeping with our charity, Ballylough Living History Trust, we ran the popular event known as Battle of the Boar. I#m also interested in social prescription projects including taking therapies such as counselling outdoors. Now, everything is on hold.We have taken a mortgage holiday thanks to the support of our mortgage supplier, but other loans and costs still have to be paid June TraillOn March , my mother had a hip operation and when she came out of hospital three days later lockdown was just beginning. She needed three carers a day, so it was a no-brainer that I move in with her. I#ve been locked down at mum#s house ever since, while David looks after the house.June#s mum, Christine Wright, a well-known artist, isn#t the only one needing the Traills# help. We have some students from the charity staying at our house, she explains. They couldn#t get home as they live in remote Islands, as far away as Martinique. We all get on well and it#s great that they can keep in touch with their families via Skype and suchlike. We also have two of our sons at home. Henryand his brother Brucehave finished university but with the current situation I don#t know what#ll happen about finding jobs.

But now the BB is shut, which means our income is zero. We reinvested every penny into the business, so we had no profits. Weddings have been cancelled, which means refunding deposits that have already been used to upgrade the site. We have taken a mortgage holiday thanks to the support of our mortgage supplier, but other loans and costs still have to be paid.Sadly many, like those in the tourism sector who rely on a very short income period will be badly affected or, indeed, go under.June, however, maintains a glimmer of hope. I#m busy thinking of ways to ersy, she explains. We#ve had time to finish a little free publication about the heritage of the Ballylough area. We#ll be able to hand it out to visitors, guests and the local community. We#re also working on preserving and recreating some of the historical costumes on site, although no idea how we#ll eventually be able to showcase them. Meantime, we#re finishing all those little jobs that have waited for years to be done. The garden, in particular, is getting a lot more attention, so we have been planting plenty of veg and flowers.Belfast ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

A news release on the departmental website and Twitter are not sufficient.There are gaps in the data and daily time series have been lost since the statistics began to be issued through DoH news releases. These gaps and losses need to be addressed.Data and statistics should be accompanied with clear information on data sources, definitions and explanations. Users should be provided with appropriate context and explanation, particularly now, where dferent statistics from dferent data sources are being produced and used in relation to COVID-.Communication to users of the statistics should be improved so they know in advance about any changes and where and when they can find the changed statistics.Mr Humpherson concluded his letter by stating: The advice of the Senior Statistician within the Department should always be sought in matters relating to statistics and data, and they should have sole authority for deciding the methods, standards and procedures and the content and timing of the release of official statistics.I know there is serious public concern about the changes that have been made to the COVID- statistics and I look forward to your reply. I would be happy to discuss.Belfast ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Adele Heaney has been working in the Covid- centre at the Mater Hospital in Belfast after being redeployed from the Royal Victoria Hospital to combat the outbreak. The Dungiven native recently featured in a BBC documentary called ‘First Time Doctors’ that revealed the realities of le as a recent graduate on a busy hospital ward. “The purpose of the show was to get an insight to what it’s like being a doctor for the first time and the trials and tribulations of le inside and outside of work,” she told the County Derry Post. googletag.cmd.push “So many people just see the doctor and that side of things, so the show was quite nice as it showed a bit of le outside work. “Everyone has had that experience of being the ‘newbie’ in the job and having to learn how to do things in a fast-moving environment. “It was daunting having cameras following you around but the thing that we wanted to show was what it is like for us as doctors.” Coming the end of her second year as a doctor, Adele has found herself thrust onto the frontline of the worst pandemic since the  Spanish Flu which killed an estimated  million people. googletag.cmd.push Adele has pleaded with the public not to become complacent and praised the vocal support that has come from the #ClapForCarers campaign on Thursday nights. “The first week they did that I was very emotional, to be honest,” said Adele. “When you’re in the hospital and you’re doing a dficult job, having tough conversations and seeing people pass away, it’s nice to see people appreciate the sacrices you are making. “The public have been trying to do their best to go by what the guidelines have been telling us – social distancing and staying indoors. We have to keep going with what we’ve been told. “Everybody in the community has their part to play. Your part might just be staying in the house but that is so, so important to flatten the curve and for us to beat this together. “We’ve seen the news reports from Wuhan and Italy, and we’ve seen how devastating the disease can be, so it’s important that we protect ourselves to protect other people.” While tackling the pandemic represents a ‘steep learning curve’ Adele points out that all healthcare staff are coming from a similar position. She said: “Lots of my senior colleagues who have been in the profession for over  years have never experienced anything like this. “I don’t think there is anything in training that really can prepare you. We’ve had to adapt quite quickly to a new style of working. “Coming into work and wearing a mask all the time has been dficult, but we have some amazing senior colleagues who we’ve been able to learn from. “It’s been dficult whenever we’ve had to make phone calls to families about their relatives who are really unwell, you’re not able to have those face-to-face reactions like you normally would. “Learning on the job has been hard, but it’s very humbling to be part of that and to be there for their family members when they aren’t able to be.” Born and bred at the foot of Benbradagh, Adele has already set her sights on a speedywhen the coronavirus threat finally eases. “To be honest, the thing I’m looking forward to the most is being able to come back home to Dungiven and be able to see my family and my boyfriend again,” she said. “It is very dficult when you’re doing this when you are so far from home. We have this persona of doctor but when we come home from work, we like the same things as everyone . “People have made sacrices of moving out of their family homes and not seeing their children or husbands or wives, so people are looking forward to being reunited with their families. “That contact with people is probably the thing I’m looking forward to most, as I’m sure most people are.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Claire McMullan of Dental  in Magherafelt is currently volunteering at one of five Emergency Dental Treatment Hubs across Northern Ireland. The hubs were set up when a shortage in PPE made it impossible to supply every dental practice with the necessary equipment to carry out procedures safely. She told the County Derry Post: “From mid-March, we began postponing non urgent appointments. “This was to ease the number of patients coming through the practice as social distancing measures were introduced. By the end of that week we were treating emergency cases only. googletag.cmd.push “As dentists, dental hygienists and dental nurses work in such close proximity to our patients while carrying out these procedures, we are at very high risk of personal exposure. “In order to protect our teams, patients and the wider community it is vital that we have the correct PPE and decontamination protocol to keep the risk to an absolute minimum. “At present there is a drastic shortage in the required PPE for Aerosol Generating Procedures .” Almost every procedure in dentistry creates an aerosol when the use of a drill, ultrasonic scaler, water or compressed air propels droplets of saliva into the air. googletag.cmd.push In order to prevent transmission of Covid- through these droplets, the Health and Social Care Board ceased all AGPs and all consultations are now carried out by telephone. “All patients requiring advice or emergency treatment are asked to phone the practice so the dentist can triage their call,” Claire explains. “If they require a simple dressing or extraction, we may be able to offer this in practicethe patient is not isolating, experiencing Covid- symptoms or been in contact with anyone experiencing symptoms.” “We will offer advice or prescription where possible. If the patient requires an AGP, for example, to begin root canal treatment, they will be referred to the Urgent Dental Centre . After an initial request for  volunteers, over  dentists came forward to staff the emergency hubs, but many are yet to reach operational capacity. This is due to the time it takes to process such a big number of volunteers and fit them with the appropriate PPE. Claire said: “Some volunteers are still waiting to be fitted for their FFP masks. Every dentist must be specially fitted for an FFP mask to safely carry out AGP. “Any patient who requires an emergency AGP is referred to the hub where dentists work in pairs wearing full PPE plastic gown, FFP mask, cap, full face visor, apron and gloves. “With the current lovely weather, working in all the PPE, in a surgery with no air conditioning or open windows has been a challenge!” Given the usual high standard of cross infection control in dentistry, there are concerns for practices when the Covid- pandemic eventually begins to recede. Ato normal within dentistry will require the correct standard of PPE, and Claire says there are concerns in sourcing and fitting the equipment, as well as how it will be funded. She said: “Our main concern is the urgent need for PPE so we can carry out normal dental treatment. “I think treatments will be reintroduced gradually to general dental practice. The Hubs will continue towhile the reintroduction is happening and there is a demand. “We will have to organise our diaries and treatments dferently to limit exposure, allow for more efficient use of PPE and leave time between appointments for settling and cleaning. “We are acutely aware of the effect Covid- limitations have on the population. Necessary treatment is being postponed and dental conditions are potentially worsening as a result. “It is vital that we get appropriate guidance, PPE and financial support to start caring for the population’s dental health as safely and quickly as possible.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Ronan McIlvenny has been living in Wellington with his partner Oonagh Morley for almost two years and says the response to the pandemic has been well-received. “They announced a four-stage system when everything started,” said the Limavady native. “Stage  was just trying to control things. Stage  was people starting to work from home and stopping gatherings. Stage  was all non-essential businesses closed and Stage  was lockdown. “We were in full lockdown for four weeks. It was slightly stricter than at home, there were no takeaways or anything like that open, just the supermarkets and hospitals. googletag.cmd.push Initially, the country was toto Stage  on Friday, but the government made the decision to delay the move until after the Anzac Day bank holiday celebrations. From today, cafes will be able to offer takeaway and non-essential businesses such as physio practices can open, but schools will remain shut, with restriction remaining on movement. Ronan believes the country’s response to the pandemic has greatly reduced its effect on the country. He said: “People here are being very strict. You’re still not allowed to meet anybody who’s not in your house, but people are supportive because the number of cases has stayed so low. googletag.cmd.push “All the lockdown restrictions came in here around the same time as at home, but because we were a few weeks behind in terms of cases, it never got out of control. “They completely closed the borders and didn’t let any tourists into the country. If we left the country, we wouldn’t get back in because we’re not New Zealand citizens. “We know two people who got stranded in Ireland, who were home for a holiday. They are probably still paying rent and they have to get someone to send their stuff home.”  Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has been widely praised for her response to the pandemic but has also achieved respect for how she dealt with the Christchurch shooting last March. “I don’t know how popular she is in terms of day-to-day policies, but she is really well liked as a leader,” said Ronan. “She handled the Christchurch massacre really well last year and she is handling this well. Everyone is happy to believe what she says – it’s the opposite of Boris Johnson in the UK. Experiencing lockdown on the other side of the globe has had a sobering effect on the -year-old secondary school teacher. “It’s the first time I’ve really felt like I don’t live in Ireland anymore,” he said. “We came here planning to live here for a year and although we’ve stayed a bit longer, it still felt like an extended holiday that we could end when we wanted. Now we can’t leave. “A friend’s brother died of a cardiac arrest at the weekend and he couldn’t get home. That’s the worst-case scenario.” Like many of us, Ronan is turning to nostalgia to fill the monotonous days under lockdown and reaching for the glory days that remind him of home. “I watched Derry’s ’ All-Ireland win on YouTube the other day again, so that was a good use of a few hours!”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Long-running plans for a medical school at Ulster University’s Magee campus have been plagued with set-backs. The revised timeline was for enrolment to commence in . The Derry News asked the department whether it expects the medical school to be approved and for medical students to enrol at Magee next year. In response, a Department of Health spokesperson said: “The establishment of a Graduate Entry Medical School is one of the priorities of the restored Executive in New Decade, New Approach. googletag.cmd.push “The Department of Health has been clear that there are two separate business case processes in relation to the development of a Graduate Entry Medical School. “The first process, which has been under way since , has involved signicant assistance from departmental officials on the development of Ulster University’s own business case. “Ulster University has been grateful for this assistance, which has ensured that their business case meets the standards within government financial guidance.” He added: “The second process is the development of the Department of Health’s own business case which will outline the need to be addressed by any expansion of medical education. googletag.cmd.push “That business case will be formally submitted to the Minister very shortly. It will be appreciated that the department’s immediate and overriding priority has been the local response to the Coronavirus pandemic. “The Department of Health must ensure that any proposal represents value for money for health and social care. It is for the Executive to collectively decide on the best approach for Northern Ireland as a whole.” There was renewed optimism in January of this year when a deal was agreed by Northern Ireland’s political parties to restore devolved government three years after it collapsed. The New Decade, New Approach document contains firm commitments to a Magee Medical School from both the British and Irish governments. It states: “The Executive will expand university provision at Magee in line with commitments made by the previous Executive, including through the establishment of a Graduate Entry Medical School.” Furthermore, under the section outlining the UK government’s financial and economic commitments to Northern Ireland it says: “Capital and resource funding for the Medical School in Derry subject to the Northern Ireland Executive’s approval of the project.” While the Irish government adds that it is ‘willing in principle to contribute to capital investment to support expanded provision at Ulster University Magee Campus, alongside the commitment made as part of this agreement by the UK Government.’ COMMITMENTS The commitment referred to above by the previous Executive was for , full-time students at Magee. In   there were , full-time students enrolled at Magee – , overall. Five years previous,  , there were , full-time enrolments – , overall. Shortly after the ‘New Approach’ document was published it emerged that the exact financial package on the table was unknown. When revealed it was described as ‘woefully inadequate’ by Sinn Feacutein finance minister Conor Murphy. At the end of January, the Department for the Economysaid it was committed to delivering expansion of Ulster University’s Belfast campus and would provide UU with a poundm bailout to complete the build. In February, DfE was asked what funding the UK and Irish Governments have committed towards realising , undergraduate places at the Magee campus. DUP economy minister Diane Dodds said: “No funding has, as yet, been formally committed by the UK or Irish Governments towards increasing undergraduate places at the Magee Campus as outlined in New Decade, New Approach. “The Department of Finance remains in discussions with Her Majesty’s Treasuryon the UK Government financial package associated with the priorities in New Decade, New Approach.” For the past month all government departments have understandably been focused on their response to the coronavirus pandemic. The Department of Finance and the Economy were both asked for comment but did not provide any at the time of publishing.

There was no substitute for the excitement. It lit a flame that still burns to this day. He squeezed every drop from a playing career that also saw him play three seasons in England and bank a letime of memories. His knees eventually told him enough was enough and when Crusaders changed their mind on an operation, it was time to take stock.“It was too much money and I was over . They were not going to take a chance and you couldnt really blame them,” Jim recalls.His football career was far from finished. Like when Stoke chose not to renew his contract, Jim McGroarty was at a footballing crossroads. But he was far from finished.He would later manage Limavady United. Before that, the Lettershandoney native steered Dungiven Celtic to nine trophies during the clubs golden era.When Patsy McGowan signed McGroarty, for Sligo Rovers on hisfrom Stoke, he would play in the League of Ireland on a Sunday, after managing Dungiven - where he now lived - on a Saturday.It was a hectic time. They trained on Tuesday and Thursday nights, opposite Sligos Wednesday and Friday schedule.He managed the Ballyguddin side for best part of  years. The only blip came during his time playing in the Irish League, when mixing both, under the same governing body, wasnt permitted and the Dungiven reins were passed on to Brian Ward.Ward was one of three Briansto score in the clubs - win over Derry City to land the NW Intermediate Cup in  – their first trophy in intermediate football. “The boys must have drank for a week,” McGroarty remembers. The club had made the ambitious move to elevate themselves to intermediate football in . McGroarty is very grateful to them for putting him through his coaching badges. He holds an A licence, achieved over a year with visits to assess his progress.During the s, Dungiven lost three Intermediate Cup finals, but enjoyed two runs in the Irish Cup that included a - defeat at Crusaders.As a player, McGroarty lost an Irish Cup final with Glenavon, to a late Glentoran penalty in  and was on the Sligo Rovers team that fell - to Dundalk in the  FAI Cup Final in front of , fans.He tapped into this experience during Dungivens cup runs.“If we had a home tie. I would get boys in at nine oclock on a Saturday morning and go through all the set pieces,” he outlines.The players would then have breakfast together, all paid from their own pocket, before relaxing and ing to Ballyguddin for the game later in the day, with everything fresh in their mind.“It worked,” McGroarty feels. “You were playing the top teams from the amateur league in Belfast or the intermediate leagues in Ballymena.“A lot of the games were tight, the score was - and one of the set pieces you worked on that morning...you could get it in the last five minutes and somebody stuck the ball in the back of the net. You are trying to add a bit of professionalism.”On away days, the Dungiven players were asked to wear a collar and tie. It was about turning up at senior clubs, well-dressed. It was a statement of intent. googletag.cmd.push *** When you quiz Jim McGroarty on the secret to Dungiven Celtics success at the start of the millennium, the word modesty perfectly describes the unspoken narrative coming down the line. He plays down his role in the success that was to follow. In addition, he is not one for name-checking. Hed have to mention about  men. There is a genuine respect he has for the collective force the players delivered. They are not just words. The tone in his voice reinforces pride this era brought him. He is a football man through and through,After knocking on the door, silverware was a regular visitor to Dungiven during the s. Four intermediate leagues and cups were won under his watch.The breakthrough came with the   league title. The following season, they secured the double in a year to remember that saw the reserves and thirds win their respective leagues. McGroarty also remembers the generation before.“There were a hell of a lot of players over the years, who were really good footballers. They never won a league and some of them didnt even win a trophy,” he said.It was followed by a core of young players, who fused into a winning formula as the attitude began to change.“First of all, they wanted to play football. Second of all, they wanted to do well and thirdly, they wanted to play for Dungiven Celtic. When you put that together, you dont have a lot to do as a manager or a coach.” googletag.cmd.push  Jim managed Dungiven to their first Intermediate League title in   Even snow wasnt an obstacle in preparations. On one occasion, two balls were sent to a shop up the town to get sprayed and ed Massey Ferguson red, McGroarty recalls.“It allowed us to train away in the snow, thats the sort of commitment we had. We had a good bunch of lads, it took a few years and we built the team up and, apart from a couple, the rest of the players were from around the town.”Another important ingredient in Jims cocktail for success was having players battling for places. With  to  players jockeying for  jerseys, the manager had the players in the palm of his hand.“If you have a boy who plays for you on a Saturday, without caring how he plays because he knows he will be on the following weekend – thats never going to work.”“Even Seamus Harkin - who is now Chairman - and the younger boys at the time. They didnt want to go and play for the reserves. They wanted to be on the bench for the seniors and get a few minutes. Thats the type of young boys you had at the time.”Getting into the first team was all that mattered. And McGroarty was beginning to get a kick out of management, as the trophies began to roll in.“You train hard on a Tuesday night, you set your stall out on a Thursday night how you are going to play on a Saturday andyou see it all coming together in front of you, thats what being a coach and manager is all about.”With nine trophies to his name, he jokes about ato the club. “Maybe, Ill take it into double figures,” he laughs.Jim McGroartys enthusiasm, even now, is infectious. *** Jim is the oldest of a family of four. Growing up, as a avid Manchester United supporter, he was infatuated with George Best. He donned the same boots and jersey, as he played around the fields of Slaughtmanus. “It couldve ended up -a-side,” McGroarty jokes. “If you werent quick or strong, you maybe touched the ball once. Parents were out at dark to get you into bed, for school the next morning.”He mixed soccer and Gaelic football for much of his career. One of the earliest memories was of winning a league, championship and nine carnival cups - all in one year - with the now defunct St Marys Mullaghbuoy.The newly formed St Marys Slaughtmanus won the  intermediate championship. Jim was on the team and managed them to the  final, a one-point defeat by Castledawson.He remembers coming on as a sub for Derry minors at Omagh in a - to - defeat to Armagh. McGroarty bagged - in a tempestuous encounter that saw him end up in hospital with a suspected broke nose. He wasnt on his own.“Harry Joe McWilliams was buried up against a post and Frankie Trainer had a broken nose, he was hit from behind.” Jim adds.When Derry won their second Ulster U title in , Jim was on the squad that included Joe Irwin, Gerry McElhinney, Colm McGuigan and Alfie Dallas.By then, his soccer career was beginning to develop.He first played competitively with Tamnaherin Youth Club in the Saturday morning league. At that time, he also played for Foyle Harps in the Summer Cups, which was growing in popularity with prizes up to pound, for the winning team.After impressing a - win over Buncrana in the final, at Maginn Park, he was spotted by Finn Harps and signed for the first of three times by Patsy McGowan.At the age of , Jims talents also attracted Glasgow Celtics scouts, but his -day trial was cut short by injury after a week.“I caught a boys studs and with a swollen foot, that was end of that trial. It was a great experience too...I played at Parkhead and at Ibrox.”At that time, the squad wouldve trained behind the goals at Parkhead.“There used to be a five-a-side,” McGroarty remembers. “Kenny Dalglish, Danny McGrain and Paul McStay were there. I got to play five-a-side with them, which was good.”By the time Stoke came calling, he was in a better place. The experience and lessons from Celtic were invaluable. He knew the level that was required. *** When McGroarty signed for Finn Harps, it was at the end of the  season. He got a handful of games, but he was stronger the following year and became a regular. At the end of the season, he played in an exhibition game for the Harps against an invitational select.”“I couldnt believe it...I was on the same pitch as Frank Stapleton, Liam Brady and Johnny Giles. I was nearly a full international team, but I didnt know that Stoke City were at the game and they asked me over for the trial.” This time he impressed and signed a one-year deal in October . Going over to unknown territory didnt come into the decision-making process. Jims decision was easy.“I wouldve swam over and I wouldve played for nothing. I always wanted to be a footballer.” McGroarty said, with an enthusiasm that hasnt dwindled over the years.“George Eastham was the Stoke manager and he scored the winner in the  League Cup final - over Cha...a lovely man.”McGroarty made his first team debut away to Oldham. At the team meeting in the hotel before the game, Eastham gave their new signing the responsibility to marshal the defence on any Oldham free kicks outside the box.“Can you line the wall ” the manager asked.“I can boss, I used to be a bricklayer,” was Jims instinctive answer, and he remembers the rest of the team killing themselves in laughter.When McGroarty later went to apologise, Eastham was having none of it.“You dont need to apologise. I like boys with a bit of character,” he said.Playing professional football was a dream, but a step up in class.“When you go to training every day, you cant be taking your foot off the pedal or looking over your shoulder,” Jim explains.“You have to knuckle down, the boy beside you is looking for your jersey and up the line, you are looking for somebodys jersey.”During McGroartys time at Stoke, there was a change of manager, as Eastham was replaced by Alan Durban. He brought Howard Kendall in as player coach.“Kendall was the best player I played alongside,” states McGroarty, of the man who would lead Everton to First Division , FA Cup and European Cup Winners Cup honoursJims contract was renewed every season for three years, before he was given the bad news that his time at the club was over.“When the last contract was up, they didnt resign me. There was not a lot of security in it. It is a rat race, you have to accept it and not rest on your laurels - you have to get on with it,” he said.“I wasnt back in Ireland two days until Patsywas on the phone and signed me at Sligo Rovers and I would then move back to Ballybofey when he later joined Finn Harps.”By the mid-s, Derry City moved from the Irish League to join the League of Ireland. The Candystripes expressed an interest in snapping up McGroarty, be he declined.“I didnt go back to the League of Ireland. I was scundered with the travelling. Youd have to go Derry for training and even when I was with Finn Harps, it was like an away game.“If you went to Waterford or Cork, it was an overnight stay in those days, but you had  players packed into a -seater minibus. If you were lucky, you got a seat andnot, you are lying on top of the kit-bags.”It was time for a change. His three years at Glenavon saw him come close to winning a cup, but they lostto Glentoran. Defender Andy Russell clawed a ball off the line with his hand and Jim Cleary dispatched his spot-kick to the top corner of the net.“I missed a sitter in that game,” McGroarty recalls. After Glenavon, he moved to Crusaders for the final leg of his career. Eventually, the knocks caught up with him and injury forced his hand.It was time to plough all his energy into Dungiven Celtic. Once a competitor, always a competitor. And the players bought into his philosophy of management. His experience, coupled with his desire for success, was the catalyst for what was to follow. With nine titles to his name in his time as manager with Dungiven Celtic, would heto make it the perfect  “Never say never,” he concluded.

He was just outside his own half, but distance was no obstacle It was All-Ireland semi-final day, but Derrys  year-old secret weapon played with expression. Termed by some as a pop star footballer, three months younger than Bjoumlrn Borg, McElhinney was inspired by the Swedes headband. It wasnt a spice-boy image without substance. Derrys sorcerer could also walk the walk. He was a boxing champion in his youth and his soccer career, as a centre-half, took him to Northern Irelands -  European qualier win over West Germany. googletag.cmd.push “It was the fastest  minutes, it just went past in a flash. It was just a game...all I wanted to do was play football,” McElhinney said of that night in Hamburg. He held captain Karl-Heinz Rummenigge scoreless and on the periphery. McElhinneys shuddering tackle put down a marker early in the game. For all the stages he performed on, he was as modest as he was magical. No airs or graces, just fanatical about playing. Growing up, playing two games every Saturday and Sunday was the grounding that made him. The  All-Ireland semi-final was just an extension and commentator Michael OHehirs exhilarating tones announced Gerry McElhinney to the nation. He took one solo before thundering through a Dublin midfield who were clutching at straws. An explosion of power careered past four Dublin players. Nobody could get a hand on him. He was electrying. He kept the ball under perfect control, while in full flow. As goalkeeper Paddy Cullen came into view, Gerry squeezed a shot through two helpless defenders before it went over the bar. It wasnt enough to prise Sam Maguire away from the Dubs, but unbeknownst to him, it was another reason for the all-stars to select him in his debut season. “I was fit and I just went out and enjoyed myself,” McElhinney said, from his home in Draycott – between Nottingham and Derby - where he has lived with his second we Val for the last  years. “I was training about six nights a week. When I say it was easy...it just came to me. I learned a lot from experienced men around me, about what to do and where to go. I was no longer a baby, I was coming .” He teased opponents as much as he did the Derry fans, who had to be satisfied with four seasons at senior level. As his soccer career tapered to a conclusion, Fr Sean Hegarty recalled him for the  Ulster championship. He was sent on as a sub to try and save a lost cause in the semi-final with a rampant Donegal. With his head stitched up from colliding into a goalpost, he drove away from Clones that day, heading for Dublin to catch a boat. He was Peterborough bound, where he played his last years under manager Mark Lawrenson. “He was a big loss to Derry, he was talented and as tough as they come. He was a great player, even from a young age – a man before his time,” remembers former Derry manager Paddy Crozier, who played with McElhinney on the  Derry minor team beaten by Cavan in the Ulster final. Another Derry all-star, Johnny McGurk, was inspired by him and mesmerised by his dummy, calling it the McElhinney tip – one Owen Mulligan would later tease defences with. Gerry would win his only club championship in the colours of Craigbane. Their  winning goalkeeper Gerard McLaughlin, who would have been directing kick-outs to him, made the comparison to Anthony Tohill. “He was the most complete player I remember, he had everything...until big Tohill came along.” Much water would pass under the bridge first. *** The late Mickey and Annie McElhinney raised their family in the townland of Dreen, outside Park, under the shadow of Sawel Mountain. Gerry is the oldest of , with five brothers , Colm, Kieran and five sisters . “We always played football in the field,” he recalls of his childhood. “The girls were the goalkeepers and the boys were playing out the field. We got neighbours over to play and it was always great craic.”  The family home outside Park Gerry would walk half a mile across the fields to attend Moneyhaughan Primary School, a typical country school with limited facilities, an outside toilet and no football pitch. “There was an old field beside it, but you wouldnt have put cows in it, never mind play football on it.” His early footballing days stem back to his time at secondary school in St Patricks and St Brigids Claudy. “Gerry Burns was the PE teacher and there was a guy Hugh Doherty,” McElhinney states. “He was a teacher, but most of the time he spent playing football in the gym.” Doherty pointed him in the direction of Dungiven Celtic, which started his soccer career. Eddie also mentions his former French teacher Seamus Mullan, who was also a local GAA reporter. “Sometimes he wrote good things about me and sometimes he wrote bad things about me,” Gerry laughs. “Seamus wrote about me because I think he wanted me to stay and play for Derry until the day I died. “Hughiewould take us to the hall. Wed play football and basketball there after school. My mother thought I was never coming home, I was never home to about six oclock at night.” There was no electric at home until Gerrys early teens. The first game he remembers watching on television was the replay of the  FA Cup Final. Having received a full blue kit as a present, he began to support Cha and after drawing with Leeds in the final, the replay at Old Trafford went to extra time. David Webb headed in at the far post from Ian Hutchinsons throw-in to win the cup for the blues. It lit a fire in McElhinney. “I thought I want to play at Wembley and I fulfilled my dreams,” he said, having later played at the famous stadium in Northern Irelands - defeat to England. He could have turned his hand to any sport. A natural, but his Gaelic football career would come first. *** Every Saturday morning in his teenage years, Gerry McElhinney would play for Derry City, before turning out for Dungiven Celtic in the afternoon. He played for Banagher on Sunday and hed squeeze in a game for Dungivens Sunday league team in the morning. “Banagher came first, butI could I would playin the morning. In the evening, we would maybe even have went off somewhere to a carnival and play a seven-a-side game,” McElhinney explains. “That was our weekend and during the week we trained. A lot of players did that. Mickey Lynch and Laurence OKane would have played for Derry City after they left the Irish League.” On the GAA front, Banagher knocked on the door of county finals, but never managed to squeeze into the winners enclosure. McElhinney had signed for Bolton by the time their  defeat to Ballinderry came around and an ankle injury in a soccer game the week before the  decider hampered his progress.  The Banagher squad pictured before the  Derry SFC Final.Gerry is fth from the left in the back row. “I ended up playing corner-back,” he remembers of the decision to start him, in the hope he would run it off. “I borrowed big Liam Hinpheys boots. He wore the rugby boots and I thought it would give my ankle some support.” He didnt last the game and Ballinderry edged home. In McElhinneys opinion, their best chance was against Magherafelt in the  final. “I remember both finals, it pissed down with rain. The Magherafelt game was in Swatragh and we definitely shouldve won that one. “We had three county players – Mickey Lynch, Fintan McCloskey and myself.Seamus Hasson had just retired from playing for Derry. SeamusStevenson was a dual player and played for Derry, so basically Banagher had five county players.” By the time his next championship run came around, he had crossed the county border. His first we hailed from Gortin and he played with the club for four seasons, during his time with Bolton. He wasnt the only newcomer. Liam Reilly – who also played in the  final - also moved to Tyrone and joined Gortin. Gortin reached the senior final in  against Augher, who had brothers Eugene and Dessie McKenna in their ranks and were champions three years earlier. It was Gortins first decider and McElhinneys absence was colossal. He had been known for getting the ball at midfield and rampaging all the way forward before hammering to the net. “I was with Bolton at the time and our pre-season had started, so I couldnt get over,” he said of their five-point defeat. It was time to head back to his roots and his brothers who had joined the emerging Craigbane. In  they beat Loup to win the first of seven intermediate titles, the record in the county. In , they were back in the final. This time it was against neighbours Claudy and Gerry McElhinney was in the team. “I was playing soccer and in the summer, at that time, I came home to visit my family and would stay for six or seven weeks. I played during championship time and won a few Dr Kerlin Cups,” he remembers. Craigbane were seven points down with seven minutes remaining and missed a first half penalty. The title was slipping away, but Conrad McGuigan found the net before player coach Paul Dixon hit a second goal to salvage a draw, - to -. “Tommy White and Charlie Kerrigan were playing, Claudy had a good side,” McElhinney explains.  Craigbanes winning team of . Gerry has his head bowed on the back row Dixon trained them like dogs for the two weeks before the replay. Six or seven sessions were combined with a challenge game with Donemana to sharpen their attacking game. The replay was a dferent story, with Craigbane in control, winning - to -. Gerry scored a point in the game. He later pulled his hamstring, but played on and later went to full-forward, as he picked up his only club championship medal. *** When Derry came knocking in the early s, McElhinney was in his prime. On top of an already bulging schedule, he boxed off and on for two years with Draperstown, under Jim Noonan. He holds a Mid Ulster title and was balancing the spinning plates. He had a spell in Glasgow Celtics reserves while playing at home with Derry minor footballers. Celtic was fitted in around his work, on a semi-professional deal. He failed to break into the first team, but would come for the weekend to play for the reserves. While Noonan urged him to keep his weight down, Jock Stein wanted him to bulk up. “My diet, every other night, was four pints of Guinness in the hotel,” McElhinney recalls of his time in Glasgow. “I was only  stone  and boxing welterweight, by the time I came back from Celtic to play for Derry, I was  stone ...I went from welterweight to middleweight.” In , his first year out of minor, Frankie Kearney called him up to a Derry senior team gearing up for one of of the most successful eras in the countys history. “My Dad lted me at the airport on my way back from Celtic and took me straight to Magherafelt for a McKenna Cup game with Antrim and Gerry Armstrong was playing for them.” The season snowballed into a march to Croke Park. In Ulster, Derry needed a replay to see off Monaghan in the semi-final. They were staring defeat in the face when Eugene Laverty won a penalty that Peter Stevenson scored to give the Oakleafers a second chance. Five McElhinney points and his influence at midfield tamed the Farney men in the replay. In the final with Down, Gerrys early goal set Derry on their way to the first of their back to back titles. Man of the match was his Banagher teammate Mickey Lynch with - to his name. The Dubs ended their All-Ireland dreams, but the following year they retained the Ulster title and were humbled in the All-Ireland semi-final by the Kerry team at the beginning of their golden years. Mickey ODwyer rated Derry as the best team never to have won an All-Ireland. Did McElhinney think they were serious contenders  “We knew we were close when we ran Dublin to a point in the  league final. If we had won that  national league, we wouldve given the All-Ireland a run for it,” he remembers. “It is hard to pick it up after being beat by a point, especially in Croke Park on their home patch. “We had some great players on that team. Anthony McGurk was an all-star by that time. Sean OConnell and Seamus Lagan, sadly not with us anymore, they were all big guns then. “Tom McGuinness, Johnny OLeary and Mickey Lynch...Mickey was my team mate and we travelled everywhere together.” Eight points from Brendan Kelly and a man of the match performance from Anthony McGurk helped Derry to an extra time win over Cavan in the  Ulster final. Derry led by four points after  minutes of the All-Ireland semi-final final, with McElhinney in fine fettle at midfield, against Jack OShea. The Ulster champions led Kerry until early in the second half when super sub Seanie Walsh found the net. The wheels fell off the wagon as the Munster men rattled - in the second half. *** Wins over Tyrone and Donegal took Derry back to an Ulster final in . On the cusp of a third Ulster title and with the Connacht champions to come in the All-Ireland semi-final, they would avoid the Dubs and Kerry until the final. Armagh had other ideas. “Paddy Moriarty destroyed us and we just ran out of steam...that was a bad result.” said McElhinney of their - to - drubbing. He wouldfor the  season. Barring his late cameo in , he bowed away from the county scene. All too early, but his soccer career came calling. Also at that time, Mickey John Forbes ran charity football weekends and players from all over Ulster would play. “They came up from Kerry. It was a couple of times a year and you were getting as many at it, as youd get any many club finals. “There was a hooley after with singers like Susan McCann, Eileen Keane and Philomena Begley. All the top names turned out, it was almost like two all-star selects.” McElhinneys passport was well-stamped and he has been to USA over a dozen times during his career. “If Derry were ever knocked out of anything, I used to just go to America to play Gaelic. I played in New York for Sligo. A Banagher man, Martin Murphy, was manager there and he put me up. “They would fly me over for the weekend to play in Gaelic Park. I always remember the trains going past every ten minutes, alongside the pitch almost. “I played with Cavan in Philadelphia after Armagh beat us. Tom Farrelly was heavily involved in the GAA out there and I worked for him as a landscape gardener. “Tyrone were a big team out there most years with Frankie McGuigan and boys like Brendan Donnelly and Dominic Daly. We played against each other, but all met up and were the best of friends.” The summer of  was his last footballing foray across the Atlantic. “We won the championship in Chicago for Connemara Gaels. I worked out there and played out there. “There wasnt much training involved. They got you work on building sites and there were plenty of contractors out there, Irish guys who were trying to make a buck. “I remember having a car, it only cost me . I parked it up in the car park at OHare Airport and home I went.” Is the wagon still here, I ponder  “It might be,” McElhinney says with a laugh. With the s around the corner, it was soccer time. In part two, McElhinney rolls the clock back on Billy Bingham handing him his debut against the Germans and the trials and tribulations of transferring to the English leagues.

We got neighbours over to play and it was always great craic.”  The family home outside Park Gerry would walk half a mile across the fields to attend Moneyhaughan Primary School, a typical country school with limited facilities, an outside toilet and no football pitch. “There was an old field beside it, but you wouldnt have put cows in it, never mind play football on it.” His early footballing days stem back to his time at secondary school in St Patricks and St Brigids Claudy. “Gerry Burns was the PE teacher and there was a guy Hugh Doherty,” McElhinney states. “He was a teacher, but most of the time he spent playing football in the gym.” Doherty pointed him in the direction of Dungiven Celtic, which started his soccer career. Eddie also mentions his former French teacher Seamus Mullan, who was also a local GAA reporter. “Sometimes he wrote good things about me and sometimes he wrote bad things about me,” Gerry laughs. “Seamus wrote about me because I think he wanted me to stay and play for Derry until the day I died. “Hughiewould take us to the hall. Wed play football and basketball there after school. My mother thought I was never coming home, I was never home to about six oclock at night.” There was no electric at home until Gerrys early teens. The first game he remembers watching on television was the replay of the  FA Cup Final. Having received a full blue kit as a present, he began to support Cha and after drawing with Leeds in the final, the replay at Old Trafford went to extra time. David Webb headed in at the far post from Ian Hutchinsons throw-in to win the cup for the blues. It lit a fire in McElhinney. “I thought I want to play at Wembley and I fulfilled my dreams,” he said, having later played at the famous stadium in Northern Irelands - defeat to England. He could have turned his hand to any sport. A natural, but his Gaelic football career would come first. *** Every Saturday morning in his teenage years, Gerry McElhinney would play for Derry City, before turning out for Dungiven Celtic in the afternoon. He played for Banagher on Sunday and hed squeeze in a game for Dungivens Sunday league team in the morning. “Banagher came first, butI could I would playin the morning. In the evening, we would maybe even have went off somewhere to a carnival and play a seven-a-side game,” McElhinney explains. “That was our weekend and during the week we trained. A lot of players did that. Mickey Lynch and Laurence OKane would have played for Derry City after they left the Irish League.” On the GAA front, Banagher knocked on the door of county finals, but never managed to squeeze into the winners enclosure. McElhinney had signed for Bolton by the time their  defeat to Ballinderry came around and an ankle injury in a soccer game the week before the  decider hampered his progress.  The Banagher squad pictured before the  Derry SFC Final.Gerry is fth from the left in the back row. “I ended up playing corner-back,” he remembers of the decision to start him, in the hope he would run it off. “I borrowed big Liam Hinpheys boots. He wore the rugby boots and I thought it would give my ankle some support.” He didnt last the game and Ballinderry edged home. In McElhinneys opinion, their best chance was against Magherafelt in the  final. “I remember both finals, it pissed down with rain. The Magherafelt game was in Swatragh and we definitely shouldve won that one. “We had three county players – Mickey Lynch, Fintan McCloskey and myself.Seamus Hasson had just retired from playing for Derry. SeamusStevenson was a dual player and played for Derry, so basically Banagher had five county players.” By the time his next championship run came around, he had crossed the county border. His first we hailed from Gortin and he played with the club for four seasons, during his time with Bolton. He wasnt the only newcomer. Liam Reilly – who also played in the  final - also moved to Tyrone and joined Gortin. Gortin reached the senior final in  against Augher, who had brothers Eugene and Dessie McKenna in their ranks and were champions three years earlier. It was Gortins first decider and McElhinneys absence was colossal. He had been known for getting the ball at midfield and rampaging all the way forward before hammering to the net. “I was with Bolton at the time and our pre-season had started, so I couldnt get over,” he said of their five-point defeat. It was time to head back to his roots and his brothers who had joined the emerging Craigbane. In  they beat Loup to win the first of seven intermediate titles, the record in the county. In , they were back in the final. This time it was against neighbours Claudy and Gerry McElhinney was in the team. “I was playing soccer and in the summer, at that time, I came home to visit my family and would stay for six or seven weeks. I played during championship time and won a few Dr Kerlin Cups,” he remembers. Craigbane were seven points down with seven minutes remaining and missed a first half penalty. The title was slipping away, but Conrad McGuigan found the net before player coach Paul Dixon hit a second goal to salvage a draw, - to -. “Tommy White and Charlie Kerrigan were playing, Claudy had a good side,” McElhinney explains.  Craigbanes winning team of . Gerry has his head bowed on the back row Dixon trained them like dogs for the two weeks before the replay. Six or seven sessions were combined with a challenge game with Donemana to sharpen their attacking game. The replay was a dferent story, with Craigbane in control, winning - to -. Gerry scored a point in the game. He later pulled his hamstring, but played on and later went to full-forward, as he picked up his only club championship medal. *** When Derry came knocking in the early s, McElhinney was in his prime. On top of an already bulging schedule, he boxed off and on for two years with Draperstown, under Jim Noonan. He holds a Mid Ulster title and was balancing the spinning plates. He had a spell in Glasgow Celtics reserves while playing at home with Derry minor footballers. Celtic was fitted in around his work, on a semi-professional deal. He failed to break into the first team, but would come for the weekend to play for the reserves. While Noonan urged him to keep his weight down, Jock Stein wanted him to bulk up. “My diet, every other night, was four pints of Guinness in the hotel,” McElhinney recalls of his time in Glasgow. “I was only  stone  and boxing welterweight, by the time I came back from Celtic to play for Derry, I was  stone ...I went from welterweight to middleweight.” In , his first year out of minor, Frankie Kearney called him up to a Derry senior team gearing up for one of of the most successful eras in the countys history. “My Dad lted me at the airport on my way back from Celtic and took me straight to Magherafelt for a McKenna Cup game with Antrim and Gerry Armstrong was playing for them.” The season snowballed into a march to Croke Park. In Ulster, Derry needed a replay to see off Monaghan in the semi-final. They were staring defeat in the face when Eugene Laverty won a penalty that Peter Stevenson scored to give the Oakleafers a second chance. Five McElhinney points and his influence at midfield tamed the Farney men in the replay. In the final with Down, Gerrys early goal set Derry on their way to the first of their back to back titles. Man of the match was his Banagher teammate Mickey Lynch with - to his name. The Dubs ended their All-Ireland dreams, but the following year they retained the Ulster title and were humbled in the All-Ireland semi-final by the Kerry team at the beginning of their golden years. Mickey ODwyer rated Derry as the best team never to have won an All-Ireland. Did McElhinney think they were serious contenders  “We knew we were close when we ran Dublin to a point in the  league final. If we had won that  national league, we wouldve given the All-Ireland a run for it,” he remembers. “It is hard to pick it up after being beat by a point, especially in Croke Park on their home patch. “We had some great players on that team. Anthony McGurk was an all-star by that time. Sean OConnell and Seamus Lagan, sadly not with us anymore, they were all big guns then. “Tom McGuinness, Johnny OLeary and Mickey Lynch...Mickey was my team mate and we travelled everywhere together.” Eight points from Brendan Kelly and a man of the match performance from Anthony McGurk helped Derry to an extra time win over Cavan in the  Ulster final. Derry led by four points after  minutes of the All-Ireland semi-final final, with McElhinney in fine fettle at midfield, against Jack OShea. The Ulster champions led Kerry until early in the second half when super sub Seanie Walsh found the net. The wheels fell off the wagon as the Munster men rattled - in the second half. *** Wins over Tyrone and Donegal took Derry back to an Ulster final in . On the cusp of a third Ulster title and with the Connacht champions to come in the All-Ireland semi-final, they would avoid the Dubs and Kerry until the final. Armagh had other ideas. “Paddy Moriarty destroyed us and we just ran out of steam...that was a bad result.” said McElhinney of their - to - drubbing. He wouldfor the  season. Barring his late cameo in , he bowed away from the county scene. All too early, but his soccer career came calling. Also at that time, Mickey John Forbes ran charity football weekends and players from all over Ulster would play. “They came up from Kerry. It was a couple of times a year and you were getting as many at it, as youd get any many club finals. “There was a hooley after with singers like Susan McCann, Eileen Keane and Philomena Begley. All the top names turned out, it was almost like two all-star selects.” McElhinneys passport was well-stamped and he has been to USA over a dozen times during his career. “If Derry were ever knocked out of anything, I used to just go to America to play Gaelic. I played in New York for Sligo. A Banagher man, Martin Murphy, was manager there and he put me up. “They would fly me over for the weekend to play in Gaelic Park. I always remember the trains going past every ten minutes, alongside the pitch almost. “I played with Cavan in Philadelphia after Armagh beat us. Tom Farrelly was heavily involved in the GAA out there and I worked for him as a landscape gardener. “Tyrone were a big team out there most years with Frankie McGuigan and boys like Brendan Donnelly and Dominic Daly. We played against each other, but all met up and were the best of friends.” The summer of  was his last footballing foray across the Atlantic. “We won the championship in Chicago for Connemara Gaels. I worked out there and played out there. “There wasnt much training involved. They got you work on building sites and there were plenty of contractors out there, Irish guys who were trying to make a buck. “I remember having a car, it only cost me . I parked it up in the car park at OHare Airport and home I went.” Is the wagon still here, I ponder  “It might be,” McElhinney says with a laugh. With the s around the corner, it was soccer time. In part two, McElhinney rolls the clock back on Billy Bingham handing him his debut against the Germans and the trials and tribulations of transferring to the English leagues.

The smiling photograph of the little girl in a First Communion dress was taken by former Derry Journal photographerLarry Doherty in the s. It lay uncollected in a box for many years until Larrys daughter, Moira Doherty, discovered it recently and posted it on Facebook in the hope of reuniting it with its owner. Tracy Morroi, who is a teacher at St Patricks Primary School in Pennyburn, was contacted by a friend who noticed the striking resemblance to her, but at first she thought it was just a coincidence. googletag.cmd.push I said Im not old enough to be in a black and white photograph, said Mrs Morroi. As time went on more and more people contacted her who suggested it was her mum, Maura Wade nee Doherty, who passed away almost seven years ago. At first Mrs Morroiwas unsureit wasdefinitely her, and she didnt want to collect the picture in case it belonged to another family. However, she was inundated with calls and messages from people who remembered her mother as a young girl and confirmed it was indeed her in the picture. Maura Dohertywas born in  the front room of her grandparentshome in  Bishops Street, which is now the Oakgrove Bar. googletag.cmd.push Her parents Maureen and George Doherty then moved to  Long Tower STreet where she grew up and attended the Wee Nuns school. My mammy worked in all the factories so everybody knew her, explained Mrs Morroi. She was a really bubbly person and would have chatted to anyone. Its been really nice to hear from people who remember her. I picked up the picture and it really made day. It was so emotional. Its so special to get it because I only have two other pictures of my mother as a child.  Mrs Morroisaid the whole experience has been very emotional. I had been doing a redding out the house this week and I had come across a lot of my mothers things so I was just having wavesof emotion anyway and this happened. Ive just been crying my eyes out.

Staff at Translink had originally planned to take a convoy of vehicles to Altnagelvin Hospital this evening to show their support for those leading the fight against coronavirus. The convoy was scheduled to coincide with the weekly outdoor clap in support of frontline workers. However, the convoy had to be called off due to safety concerns. Instead, a fleet of buses gathered this afternoon in the car park of Templemore Sports Complex in the city. There, the buses were organised in the shape of a heart.

Our players are keen to support the efforts of the FAI and the NLEC to examine ato football in a manner that is safe for all involved be they players, match officials or club staff. “The FIFPRO document is a high-level recommendation and the FAI have put together the fine details of what playing behind closed doors looks like for all concerned. This is very much a work in progress with all stakeholders working together towards the best solution possible for our game in the event of a closed doors recommendation from the HSE and Government.” The FAI and the NLEC remain committed to looking at alternative income streams for SSE Airtricity League clubs in the event of ato National League football behind closed doors, with live streaming opportunities under discussion. Interim Deputy CEO of the FAI, Niall Quinn said: “The working document presented to the clubs today offers a real  for debate about ato football when we get the go-ahead from Government and health officials. They will of course have the final say on when weand under what circumstances, but it is imperative on us as a working group to present the best options available to our clubs. “This document offers the clubs an insight into best practice for staging games behind closed doors. The Association also remains committed to exploring the best financial proposition available to our clubs and players at this time. Analysis of the financial impact of playing behind doors is well underway with our clubs and we are examining potential revenue streams from live streaming and other sources. This is a united effort and we look forward to further engagement with the NLEC, the PFAI, the referees and the clubs themselves.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The response to the classes has been brilliant and I have kept it on, even though I am teaching PE full-time in Assumption Grammar in Ballynahinch.ldquoObviously with COVID- I am off work now and with no GAA or fitness classes I have more time on my hands.ldquoI put out the idea on social media on Friday morning and then spent the weekend putting together the first class to upload Monday morning.ldquoI honestly didnrsquot know what to expect really. I was thinking maybeI managed to pull in a hundred people at pound each, pound would be a reasonable target.But I have really been overwhelmed by the response.Members of her usual weekly classes in Pilates for Paula responded immediately, but her school quickly weighed in behind the effort and her many acquaintances in GAA and camogie.Despite her organisation of the fundraiser, in her words being ldquoa bit last minute, her target was realised eight-fold and she presented a cheque for pound, last week.ldquoI couldnrsquot believe it really. When I saw Instagram stories of Sophie Colgan in New York taking part, Eiliacutes Niacute Chaiside [the Slaughtneil camog], who has been in New Zealand for the past year, signing up, and Sarah Donnelly, the Tyrone footballer in Australia, it just shows you that the people you meet through the GAA will always support each other.Paula last year captained Clonduff to the All-Ireland club title and she has played for Down and Ulster over many years, while her husband Darren is the Down football captain.ldquoThe GAA camogie community is absolutely fabulous. They rallied around my family after Christmas and provided a lot of comfort and again the response has been phenomenal.ldquoCOVID- has challenged the family once more. Clodaghrsquos parents, my brother Darren and his we Carol, live in Coleraine and it has been very dficult for us as a family to support them. What has happened over Easter week has given us all a huge lt and we are very thankful for all that support from our GAA family.ldquoI have got a lot of messages since the last class on Friday and everyone seems to have enjoyed them. A lot had never done exercise like that and now want me to provide more classes online and keep it going for as long as we are all prevented from going back to work.ldquoI think plenty of people are finding the lockdown very tough mentally and I got that back in the messages too, about how they felt a lot more positive after doing the exercise, a lot fresher and ready to face the day.She added: ldquoThe people who supported the fundraiser have helped themselves, helped Leukaemia  Lymphoma NI Research and really supported the Gribben family.You can still contribute to Leukaemia Lymphonania Research by searching for Carol and Darren Gribbenrsquos fundraiser in aid of Leukaemia  Lymphoma NI on Facebook or follow this link https:www.facebook donate  .prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29th April 2020 Delamont.jpg","title":"Delamont remains closed in lockdown  ","story":"DELAMONT Country Park outside Killyleagh is to remain closed to visitors.Newry, Mourne and Down Council has confirmed that the gates to the stunning park on the shores of Strangford Lough will not reopen, despite last weekrsquos decision by Stormont agriculture minister Edwin Poots to reopen Tollymore and Castlewellan forest parks.The decision not to allow visitors into Delamont was taken by the leaders of the local councilrsquos main parties during a meeting held via Skype last week and has been welcomed by local councillors Billy Walker and Dermot Curran.Cllr Walker said all the party leaders agreed that is it too soon to reopen Delamont, confirming that the closure decision will be reviewed next month.ldquoThere are real concerns that allowing the public to access the country park could lead to a major surge in visitors which is not what anyone wants at this particular time. The last thing we need is for family picnics and hundreds of other visitors arriving at a time when coronavirus remains a very real and present danger, continued the Rowallane councillor.Cllr Walker described the decision to reopen forest parks as ldquopremature and said Newry, Mourne and Down Council deserved praise for keeping all its country parks closed for the time being.He added: ldquoThe closure decision is being kept under review and I believe that there is still some way to go before council-owned parks will be open to the public.ldquoThere will be people upset that Delamont remains closed, but we all have to adhere to the public advice we have been given in relation to social distancing and, where possible, to stay at home, protect the NHS and save lives.Cllr Curran said he supports the decision to keep Delamont closed and praised what he described as the local authorityrsquos ldquocourageous decision.He argued that the big danger with warmer weather and clearer evenings now here is that reopening the country park could lead to a major influx of visitors and that enforcing social distancing measures would be particularly dficult,not impossible.ldquoThere was perhaps a temptation to reopen Delamont given the decision to allow people to access Tollymore and Castlewellan forest parks, but the local council has stood firm, putting the safety of people front and centre and is to be applauded for doing so, said Cllr Curran.ldquoErring on the side of caution is the right thing to do at this time. It would be an awful situation to reopen the park and for someone to contract coronavirus as a result. The park will reopen at some stage, but not just now. Peoplersquos health and safety must come first.A Newry, Mourne and Down Council spokesman said despite the decision by Mr Poots to reopen parks managed by the Forest Service all those that the local authority is responsible for, including Delamont, will remain closed.Council officials say that the decision to close Delamont taken on March  remains in place for the time being, but will be reviewed as public health advice guidance develops.ldquoMembers decided that it was too soon to consider reopening parks at this time, said a council spokesman.In addition, he said it was felt that reopening local authority-owned country park would encourageresidents from outside the district to make a non-essential journey to these facilities for exercise, thus increasing the volume of traffic and congestion at these locations and increasing the risk of further spread of COVID- across the district.ldquoThe focus of the council at this time must be the safety of our citizens and implementing measures to reduce the spread of the virus, said the spokesman.ldquoThe council continues to advise our citizens that the single most important action they can take is to stay at home in order to protect the NHS and save lives..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29th April 2020 Doreen.jpg","title":"Doreen to step down after 20 years as leader at Leitrim playgroup  ","story":"A LEITRIM woman, who has been the driving force behind a local playgroup for almost  years, is stepping down.Doreen Shahmohammadi is a familiar face around the village, especially to young people as the leader of Leitrim Community Playgroup.Doreen, her Iranian husband, Reza, and twin sons, Michael and Colm, settled in Leitrim a few years before she began the playgroup in January . She soon experienced a strong sense of community and friendship that has kept them there ever since.She started the playgroup with the support of the local GAA club, Liatroim Fontenoys, which offered her use of their premises to begin with.ldquoIn the first year we went from having five children to  children, she said. ldquoWe had no funding in the first year, but the Fontenoys were very good to us by covering the cost of heating and telephone charges.ldquoBy the second year funding was made available by the Southern Education and Library Board for  pre-school places and it wasnrsquot long before we secured funding to build a purpose-built playgroup which sits within the boundary of the Fontenoys club.ldquoWithin a few years and thanks to additional funding enrolment rose to  places. Depending on the birth rate it has usually remains around the same number each year.Doreen loves to have children around her. In fact, Reza reminds her all the time that she is a magnet in attracting them wherever she goes.Doreen is a very proud mother. Her sons, now , graduated as doctors five years ago and both are working on the frontline during the COVID- pandemic. Colm is working in intensive care, while Michael works between cardiology and intensive care.ldquoOver the years, I have loved, cared for and educated every child that has come to the playgroup as though they were my own children, he says.ldquoI am going to miss them all very much, more than you can ever imagine. I hope Irsquom not to be a stranger to the playgroup after my retirement.Doreen says the current playgroup team, made up of deputy leader Michelle McCabe and temporary assistant, Danielle Clarke, have worked well together over the past few years. Other long term members of staff were Janet King, Tina Owens and Diane Baxter.ldquoThe playgroup has been my le and I have enjoyed welcoming hundreds of children to their pre-school year experience. It is a lovely learning environment to be part of, she continued.ldquoWe are blessed with the children and their families in the community who have entered our setting and I would like to take this opportunity to thank the staff and committees past and present, children, grandparents, childminders and, of course, the wider community who have supported me and who have been so generous over the years.ldquoMost of all, I would like to thank the trustees who have supported me for all these years and provided me with the opportunity to establish an excellent learning environment for pre-school children, not forgetting my sincere thanks to the Fontenoys for all their support and encouragement.She added: ldquoI wish my successor every success and I hope they will enjoy and appreciate every single minute they spend with the children as I have done..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29th April 2020 Life.jpg","title":"Ex Drumaness man praises Kiwis as country comes out of lockdown  ","story":"A FORMER Drumaness man who has been living in New Zealand for the past  years has this week revealed what le in lockdown has been like Down Under.Barry Brennanrsquos adopted homeland has been praised for its response to the coronavirus pandemic, with the country this week emerging from a strict five-week quarantine which included the strictest constraints paced on New Zealanders in modern history.The countryrsquos prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, hailed New Zealanders for their incredible work to ldquobreak the virusrsquos chain of transmission which has allowed the country to downgrade its highest alert level from four to three, with amendedrestrictions expected to be in place for around two more weeks.The move means that many shops have reopened while public gatherings of  people are now permissible for weddings and funerals, with schools also set to reopen. In addition, Kiwis can now fish, hunt, surf, swim and play golf.New Zealand has suffered only , confirmed coronavirus cases and  deaths after moving quickly to impose a lockdown last month, with the easing of quarantine measures paving the way for around , people toto work under a more relaxed regime.Barry mdash who specialises in home renovations and employs several people mdash has not ed to work yet, but is more than happy in the idyllic rural setting of Mangawhai in the North Island just five minutes from the beach, where he lives with his we, Sian, and children Sean, Danny and Liam.The New Zealand government is still asking citizens to stay at home and to practise social distancing, with Barry hoping that it wonrsquot be long before the country again enjoys some sense of normality.And he has the praised prime minister for her approach to COVID-, with Arden arguing that a drastic short-term action would benefit the countryrsquos economy in the long run.On Monday, it was confirmed that there is no widespread underlying community transmission in New Zealand, with Ms Arden warning that the country was not yet out of the woods.ldquoWhen you look at what happened where in the world in relation to coronavirus, the prime minister did a good job, said Barry, who headed to New Zealand with his friend Barry Armstrong in .ldquoI was a qualied carpenter and Barry, who lived just up the road from me, was a bricklayer who had a contact in New Zealand so we headed off on a -month visa to Auckland. Barry stayed for  months before heading home but I am still here, married with three boys.ldquoThe coronavirus has had a worldwide impact and while many people were wondering what would happen in New Zealand, I always had a feeling that the prime minister would go at the pandemic hard and fast and that is exactly what she did.Barry revealed that New Zealanders were told to prepare for lockdown on March  and that two days later a series of strict measures were introduced.ldquoClearly the prime minister had a look at what was happening in other parts of the world before the virus got a hold here and she moved to minimise its impact. I think that she has done an amazing job to be quite honest.ldquoFour and a half weeks after the lockdown measures were implemented, there was only one confirmed coronavirus case in New Zealand at the start of this week. Indeed, the government knows exactly where every case is in the country.Barry said anyone arriving in the country and is suspected of having the virus is quarantined and believes thatthere was ever to be another pandemic in the future, countries would do well to take a close look at what New Zealand did to halt its deadly spread.ldquoEverything really happened so fast here and we did not have that much time to think about what was going in, he continued.ldquoI played golf with the principal of the school my youngest boy attends and he said he did not think NewZealand would go into lockdown. Forty eight hours later we were told it was happening.Barry said the country rightly decided that it wasnrsquot taking any chances and locked everything down, apart from supermarkets, with strict social distancing rules in place.ldquoWe have gone from a level four alert to level three but I am still not back at work as there a lot of iables that I need to consider, explained the former Drumaness man. ldquoIn my line of work I would be close to homeowners so I will just wait until the restrictions ease a bit more.Barry relocated from Auckland to Mangawhai six years ago and home is now a three and a half acre plot where he built a shooting gallery and what he describes as a ldquobit of a golf course. He also looks after a few animals.With no immediateto work on the horizon, Barry is keeping busy mowing lawns and feeding his animals, with a little help from his sons.With his parents, Sean and Mary, still living at the family home at the Cumber Road in Drumaness, Barry says he is in regular contact with them. He said his dad is good with Whatsapp and regularly tells him that New Zealand lamb is cheaper in Ireland than down under.ldquoWe have lots of contact with my parents and are in touch once or twice a week. I also have an older brother, Seamus who lives in Auckland. We both played for Loughinisland GAC. I also keep up-to-date with what is going there via social media and stuff, he continued.ldquoMy brother, Mark, is a former Loughinisland club chairman who was involved in the plans for building the new clubhouse. I also keep tabs on Down GAArsquos fortunes.As Barry waits for the right time toto work, he said that during the lockdown, New Zealanders mostly did what they were told.He added: ldquoThey were sensible and the approach has worked as things are slowly ing to normal, but we know that we have a little way to go yet..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29th April 2020 C Diary.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C April 29%2C 1980  ","story":"NEWCASTLE ndash A new library for Newcastle is to be given priority soon by the South Eastern Education Board, it was claimed this week.The claim came from Castlewellan councillor, Mrs Ethel Smyth, a Board member, who said she believed that Board members realised they had made a bad mistake and are now prepared to reverse their attitude.Mrs Smyth, addressing a meeting of Down councillors on Monday, explained that she had recently asked the Board for an undertaking that the Newcastle Library project would be given a priority rating for new capital schemes.ldquoI think the whole Board realised they made a bad mistake and they are quite willing to go ahead and get something done quickly, said Mrs Smyth.Mrs Smyth made her surprise announcement after Newcastle councillor Mr Paddy OrsquoDonoghue attacked the Boardrsquos attitude over a new library for the seaside town.Mr OrsquoDonoghue claimed that an original Board decision to put Newcastle on a low priority rating was taken without consulting the Boardrsquos chief librarian who was in favour of early attention for Newcastle.He called the lack of consultation and criticised the Board for not responding fully to points raised by a council deputation several months ago.BALLYNAHINCH ndash Ballynahinch Chamber of Commerce is beginning to draw up plans for another trade week ndash and such was the success of the last venture that itrsquos been decided to extend this yearrsquos event to ten days.The dates being set aside for the trade week are Thursday, June th to Saturday, June st, and it is hoped that the townrsquos traders will offer many bargains to help attract business.Last yearrsquos trade week was a major success and most businesses in the town have reaped the benefit since. New customers were attracted to the town and quality goods and competitive prices have encouraged many toon a regular basis.The growing stature of the town as a shopping centre has been helped by the introduction of new shops, particularly in the Dromore Street area, and by the good car parking facilities on offer.Market Day every Thursday brings hundreds of people from the surrounding district flooding into the town ndash and with two Market Days cropping up in the new extended trade week this year, the Chamber is hopeful that shopping will hit a new peak in June.QUOILE ndash A concerted effort is being made by the Northern Ireland Tourist Board and Down District Council to make the -mile stretch of the Quoile River into a fishing paradise.Regarded as one of the best fishing waters in the province, the Quoile is hardly known nationally, and itrsquos the aim of the Tourist Board and the council to make it as popular as the Fermanagh Lakelands, the current number one fishing haven.The joint effort to put the Quoile on the fishing map is being spearheaded by Ian Heaps, the former inidual world champion angler and current member of the English international team, who has been carrying out a survey over the past ten days.And his report could influence the Tourist Board to pump more money into publicising the Quoile to world-wide anglers.Already Heaps has spent ten days fishing the Quoile and its ancillary waters ndash and his expert opinion is that itrsquos one of the best that Northern Ireland has to offer.KILLYLEAGH ndash The Vikings ed to invade Killyleagh this week ndash but this time it was a more peaceful visit.The invaders, instead of arriving by longship to pillage and plunder, came to look over youth provision in the area and they left totally impressed by the friendly reception they received.The unlikely invaders were a group of youth workers from Norway and Spain, who visited the area as part of a five-day study of youth work and facilities in the province.Local stops were at the Seaboard Sailing Centre in Killyleagh, Ardnabannon Outdoor Pursuits Centre in Castlewellan and Downpatrick Folk Club.Tuesday afternoon and night was spent in the area, with the first stop for the Norwegians being at the Seaboard centre.STRANGFORD ndash The recently formed Strangford Village Improvement Committee is to seek public support to have an order enforcing the one-way system in the village revoked.The committee discussed the system at their monthly meeting on Thursday and, after hearing of the failure of a meeting between the Department of Environment officials, traffic police and RUC representatives to have something done about it, they decided that the support of the public is needed.The committee chairman told members that the top level meeting had fallen on deaf ears and that nothing could be done about the situation.They had discussed the possibility of altering the system, the ious proposals which the committee had made as alternatives to it, and the fact that the majority of residents did not want the system.Unfortunately the Department rejected all the committeersquos proposals and insisted that the system, in its present form, would have to remain, said the chairman.The chairman had askedthe one-way system would not be made permanent until all attempts to accommodate the residentrsquos wishes had been made but the Department replied that the systemis already permanentand had been made so by Government order.

The online sales are set to continue as marts across the province begin to reopen.Cllr Lewis said the marts have a crucial role to play, allowing farmers to buy and sell livestock, at what is a traditionally a busy time of the year for them. Crucially, he said reopening marts will help with their respective incomes.He said there was ldquosignicant concern when the marts closed last month, with farmers expressing concern that they could find themselves overstocked with animals, particularly store cattle and ped calves.ldquoNews of the gradual reopening of local marts is an important development and will be widely welcomed across the agricultural sector at this time, said Cllr Lewis.The Slieve Croob councillor said DAERA was to be applauded for its decision, particularly given the key role farmers play in supplying the local food chain.ldquoIt is essential that in these uncertain times that farm production continues and that the local supply chain of quality food products can be available to the public, he continued.ldquoAt this time of year, many farmers are seeking to purchase stock for the grazing season and obviously others are selling their stock through the marts. Dairy farms will also find themselves overstocked with dropped calves that they would normally be selling.Cllr Lewis said there were farmers wishing to sell and buy livestock and it was ldquovital in these uncertain times that farm production continues and that the local supply chain of quality food products can be available to the public.A DAERA spokesman said farmers were key workers and were continuing to provide food for everyone in ldquovery challenging circumstances with part of the food supply chain the ability to trade and sell animals.ldquoStaff within the department have maintained regular contact with livestock mart operators over recent weeks and have been reassured that robust operational protocols, developed by the marts in conjunction with other stakeholders, will enable them to conduct business in a manner that is safe for staff, farmers and buyers and adheres to social distancing requirements, he continued.ldquoFarmers, like all businesses, are facing financial dficulties as a result of COVID-.

In many ways, itrsquos strange to think that by staying home I can save a le.My sister, Martina, loved le, but she was only  when she passed away in . Seasonal flu was the culprit which overwhelmed her body. COVID- is a frightening virus for the world to contend with. But it is especially frightening for people like me.Martina and I were born with spinal muscular atrophy , a genetic muscle wasting condition which robs people of the ability to walk, eat and breathe.I now live an active, productive le, thanks to many interventions that started in my childhood. I had a tube ed into my stomach to ensure that I could get the nutrients I could no longer eat as half of the muscles I use to swallow became paralysed. I also began using a non-invasive ventilator.COVID- has been on our radar since the beginning of January. I could do little but watch and wait. The plans would not be much dferent than my usual flu-time plans which ensure that I am in protective bubble, which allows my family to do everything it can to maintain an infection-free environment around me.Sure enough, almost  days ago, it was time to take action, with the Hollywood lockdown coming almost two weeks before it was implemented for everyone . And within a few days of the official lockdown beginning, I was also furloughed from work at a leading charity for people with conditions like mine.This has been one of the most emotionally and mentally dficult parts of the pandemic for me personally. Since I was  I have been working with and for this charity to improve lives. But within a few short days my le had drastically changed.Last September, I took eight flights in three weeks as I was selected for an Emerging Leaders programme by the US State Department for my work with disabled people and for a national conference for people with conditions like mine in London.Now, I have to stay within the bounds of my driveway. I can only go outside because my neighbours are all so far away. A small mercy.It quickly became obvious that getting food and other essential supplies was not going to be easy. Large supermarkets only started offering registration to extremely vulnerable customers a few weeks in to the lockdown.Before lockdown began few,any supermarkets offered a dedicated shopping time to extremely vulnerable customers, making getting food dficult during a time when it was flying off the shelves in panic buying.Crossgarrsquos SuperValu store got us through those first few weeks as it was able to deliver some essentials, while Gordons Pharmacy in Downpatrick has been delivering to us for some time now. But the pharmacyrsquos willingness to collect our preions has been a huge weight off our shoulders.I have now been able to register the family with Sainsburyrsquos for deliveries of other items we need to keep us ticking over, while Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos food delivery package service has been much more successful than those in other parts of the UK.The one that we have received included food that I could eat ndash something many of my friends in the rest of the UK are not so lucky with. The parcel is one small, yet very important part of the support our government is offering that it has got right, even though it has only been in place for us for three weeks.It took us several weeks to set up everything we needed, but I know that many others are still trying and are having to take drastic, le-endangering measures to keep it going.However, COVID- is not just a negative in the lives of disabled people.Virtual concerts, musicals on YouTube for all and even online quiz nights have become the new normal of socialising.Many jobs and educational institutions have moved staff to work from home and online, something that some disabled people were often refused when they asked for it. Even the community spirit and volunteering has left us feeling overwhelmed with offers of help.It is my hope that we can use this opportunity to see what our future can be.A more accepting and inclusive society, where disabled people can fully take part. Creative thinking mdash both economic and social mdash have taken a cannonball to the social infrastructure that was a climbing wall and turned it into an accessible lt.I want us all to realise how positive this can be for society and act upon it, even when the pandemic is over..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29th April 2020 Laura.jpg","title":"Laura takes chair  ","story":"CASTLEWELLAN woman Laura Devlin is to become the districtrsquos new first citizen.The Mournes SDLP councillor is set to take over at the helm of Newry, Mourne and Down Council when the local authority holds its annual meeting next month.Cllr Devlin will replace Sinn Feinrsquos Charlie Casey in the council hot seat, while two Ulster Unionist councillors mdash Robert Burgess and Harold McKee mdash are in the running for the councilrsquos deputy position.She was chosen as her partyrsquos nomination for the top council post last week, with the councilrsquos Ulster Unionist members set to confirm shortly their preferred choice for the vice-chairmanrsquos position.Cllr Devlin has been a member of the SDLP since  and is a highly respected politician who was co-opted to replace Eamonn OrsquoNeill on the former Down Council in .With her position as the new council chairman confirmed, all eyes are on the UUP to see which councillor the party will pick to be her deputy.Slieve Croob councillor Alan Lewis and Slieve Gullionrsquos David Taylor have ruled themselves out of the running for the post due to work commitments, leaving it a straight fight between Cllr Burgess and Cllr McKee, two of the UUPrsquos most experienced councillors.Cllr Burgess is a former Down Council chairman and is also the current chairman of the Ulster Farmersrsquo Unionrsquos Co Down Branch, while Cllr McKee was a former South Down MLA and member of Newry and Mourne Council.The annual meeting is traditionally held in the debating chamber at the local authorityrsquos Downshire Civic Centre in Downpatrick, but alternative venues are currently being examined to comply with social distancing guidelines in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic.The council debating chamber is not large enough to ensure that the districtrsquos  councillors, council staff and the media can safely stay two metres apart.The Recorder understands that several options are being explored on the way forward, with a formal announcement expected shortly.Down Leisure Centre, which is currently closed to the public, has been touted as a possible base for the annual meeting, with proceedings taking place in the expansive four court sports hall on the first floor.It is being suggested that the large area would allow councillors, officers and the media to comfortably comply with social distancing legislation.An alternative suggestion which some councillors believe could be a potential runner is an annual meeting attended by just the leaders of the councilrsquos main parties and the leader of the Independent members.Ahead of the AGM, the main parties have already selected which councillors will be appointed to the local authorityrsquos ious statutory committees and who will fill the top two positions on each.And, in keeping with public health advice to maintain social distancing, it is understood that the formal ceremony to present the new chairman with the chain of office will also not take place.

Unfortunately after all of the hard work of labour, I had to have a C-section and James Patrick was born at .pm on Tuesday. Ryan was allowed into the recovery room with me for two hours, but after that he didnrsquot see me or the baby until Thursday afternoon when we were allowed home.Prospective parents have been told that only one birth partner is currently allowed into the delivery ward, but onlythey are well and show no signs of coronavirus.Mrs Lawlor said: ldquoApart from the labour and the C-section, it was a positive experience. I think I was more anxious in the days coming up to the birth as I didnrsquot know what the restrictions would mean. In hindsight, it wasnrsquot that bad and it was probably worse for Ryan sitting at home. He rang his sister who has four children and asked when she thought he could do and she said clean the house.Baby James Patrick was only one day overdue, but Mrs Lawlor was delighted that he decided to make an appearance when he did. A clue to his birth weight may be due to his mother being ft  inches tall, while dad Ryanis ft  inches.While Mrs Lawlor did not have to wear a face mask during her labour, but the midwives who attended her afterwards were masked.She said: ldquoI suppose as this was an all-new experience for both Ryan and I we have nothing to compare it to.ldquoI remember waking up the next day, not that I slept that much in the night, and thought, lsquoOh no, I have a whole day by myself in here with this brand new babyrsquo. But the nurses and midwives are coming that often to do a iety of checks that the days went quite fast.ldquoHowever, I remember that I felt the second night in hospital was awfully long and I really struggled with dealing with James. Normally,you have a bit of help during the day and night, you can manage better to get a bit of sleep.ldquoThe strangest thing was seeing quite a few of the staff with masks and visors on. While they were all lovely, you lost a bit of the personal touch and connection with them because of the masks. Sometimesthey were maintaining social distancing and werenrsquot close to you, you couldnrsquot actually see who it was. The staff were all wonderful but you didnrsquot know what they looked like.As a sportswoman, who used to play for Loughinisland GACrsquos senior ladies and at county level, Mrs Lawlor is recovering well after the birth. Her husband is also well-known in local sporting circles as hersquos on the executive committee of Loughinisland GAC.They are becoming accustomed to the lsquonewrsquo normal at home of being first-time parents amid the lockdown.Mrs Lawlor said: ldquoWe have had visitors to the house looking through the window at the baby. Itrsquos still hard for everyone as my sister is itching to get a wee cuddle and all our family members want to hold him. That canrsquot happen for very good reasons and I donrsquot know when that will change. Thatrsquos one of the strange things about having a baby in the lockdown.ldquoHowever, the simplicity of le today is quite nice. I think itrsquos possibly the best time to have a baby. We have plenty to keep ourselves busy with James Patrick in the lockdown and therersquos nothing  to distract us. Ryan is a self-employed plumber andit wasnrsquot for the lockdown, he probably would have been ing to work sooner so itrsquos good for us to have this time together..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29th April 2020 Go Digital.jpg","title":"Paddy Mo’s greatest Down side of all time  ","story":"p.pp.pspan.s Paddy Doherty was a key member of the historic Down All-Ireland-winning team of . In a glittering playing career, the Ballykinlar man went on to win two more All-Ireland medals and established himself as one of the legends of the Gaelic football. Here, he selects his greatest Down team of all timeHIS name alone is enough to rekindle treasured memories of a time when Down football reigned supreme.Paddy lsquoMorsquo Doherty had the deadliest left foot in Ireland and he used it to maximum effect as Down swept all before them.Incredibly, itrsquos  years ago that Down took the sporting world by storm when they defeated Kerry to win the All-Ireland senior football title for the first time. It was also the first time that a team north of the border had won the Sam Maguire Cup.To reinforce their emergence as a new power in Gaelic football, Down retained their title the following year with Paddy as captain of the side which defeated Offaly and he was also a member of the Down team which won a third All-Ireland for the county in , Kerry again falling victim to the Red and Black machine in the final.As well as his three All-Ireland medals, Paddy won seven Ulster Championship, seven Railway Cup and three National League medals. He was the leading scorer in Ulster for eight seasons and in Ireland for three years.Now in his s, hersquos followed Downrsquos fluctuating fortunes ever since, relishing in theof the glory days in the early s, sharing in the disappointment of the barren times and casting a critical eye from the sidelines, though always with the optimistic outlook of the true fan.So what does he believe is the greatest Down team of all time Not surprisingly, given their accomplishments, hersquos largely selected his choice from his team-mates from the Sixties mdash though with typical modesty, he has not picked himself for the starting .ldquoYou have to remember that the Down team of s was the first to bring the Sam Maguire over the border, he says.ldquoThat was a really big achievement and we had beaten Kerry in the final. We had shown we were the best team in Ireland and we proved that again the following year in the final against Offaly after beating Kerry in the semi-final. We also beat Kerry in the  final, which meant that we had beaten them three times.ldquoKerry have always been the benchmark. If we had not beaten them, they would have won another three All-Irelands.Asked how his Down team would fare against present day sides ldquoItrsquos a dferent game now, what with the blanket defence and other things, but the Down teams of the s would have won in any era. Well, thatrsquos what I think, though Irsquom sure there are many people who would disagree. Eddie McKay Eddie won two All-Ireland medals with me in  and . He was a very good goalkeeper believe me, always safe, dependable and brave. He was an excellent shot stopper and made many excellent saves. I also played against him many times when Ballykinlar took on Dundrum. These were local parish derbies and everyone was trying to kill each other, but somehow Dundrum never managed to beat us. George Lavery George also won two All-Irelands in  and . He was the quiet man on the team, but there were few better man markers in the game and he would have been a star in any era. He had played a match of two for Antrim, but Maurice Hayes, who was secretary of the Down county board, persuaded him to sign for Down. He played as sweeper and was a good, tight marker. Leo Murphy Leo was a terric full back, tough and reliable. Not too many players could get past him and he could kick the ball a long distance. He also won two All-Irelands in  and . Pat Rice There was no one better than Pat Rice at catching a ball. His high fielding was magnicent and he was quick at clearing the ball. He gave away few chances and often kicked the ball out for Eddie McKay. He missed little and he wasnrsquot a dirty player at all. Dan McCartan One of only three Down players to win three All-Ireland senior medals along with Sean OrsquoNeill, Joe Lennon and myself, Dan is one of the all-time greats of Down football. He had outstanding ability, tackled hard and always looked for the quick clearance up to the front men. He could play anywhere as he showed when he moved to full back in the  final. Joe Lennon He was our captain in , though he did not play in the second after getting injured. He was a great captain and a terric leader. Joe placed a great emphasis on fitness and pioneered new coaching practices. He thought greatly about the game and was possibly ahead of his time. He was a very talented player. Tom OrsquoHare Tom played in the  team, but was good enough to get his place on any team. He was probably one of our best players that year. He was always steady and was great at delivering a ground ball. Jarlath Carey Jarlath won two All-Irelands in  and . He was a tireless worker, who was at home either in midfield or in attack. He was always forcing his way into the forward line and would wag his finger at me to go back into midfield to cover for him. I didnrsquot mind one bit, because he was good enough and I was fit enough to do what he asked. Colm McAlarney They called Colm lsquoThe Mighty Arklersquo after the famous racehorse because of his long strides up the field. Colm and Tom OrsquoHare were our two outstanding players in  and Colm was definitely one of the best midfielders in Ireland at that time, or any other time. Tony Hadden Tony won two All-Irelands in  and . He could fist the ball further than many players could kick it and he could also move into midfieldthings were going bad. He was tall and well built and could score a point as well as anyone. James McCartan A very strong player. Down would not have won anything without him because he took a lot of the abuse which would otherwise have been directed at me or Sean OrsquoNeill. He played a critical role in the  final against Offaly. We were two goals down in the first half and getting beaten. I crossed the ball to James who turned in mid air and put into the back of the net. Two more goals from Sean OrsquoNeill and Breen Morgan had us a goal up at half time, but it was his goal that turned things around. Sean OrsquoNeill You would have to say that Sean was the greatest Down footballer of them all. He was named in the GAA Team of the Century which says it all. We played well together, wherever I kicked the ball, Sean was there to get it. He had a wonderful sidestep and took a lot of abuse, but he never retaliated. He went on to become a successful manager and won the Sigerson Cup with Queenrsquos University. Mickey Linden Mickey was a flying machine and one of Downrsquos best ever forwards. He could blow defences away with his pace and score with either foot. He was also very versatile. You could play him anywhere and he would still be a threat. Perhaps his only failing was that he was too nice a player. He rarely made a foul. Won two All-Irelands in  and . Patsy OrsquoHagan Full forward and winner of two All-Irelands in  and . He could have played full forward, full back, or just about anywhere . He was that good. One of his best performances was Wembley Stadium during one of the Wembley Cup tournaments when he scored four goals against Galway. Breen Morgan They made them tough in Annaclone and for his size Breen was one of the hardest men on the field. He had broken his jaw before the  All-Ireland final, but went to the field without the protector which was made specially for him. He just threw it on to a chair. He was marked by Offalyrsquos Paddy McCormick, who was made of iron, but Breen was afraid of no one.Paddyrsquos substitutesDanny Kelly , Greg Blaney , Barry Breen , James Milligan , Ross Carr , Paddy OrsquoRourke , DJ Kane , Dan Gordon , Benny Coulter , Paddy Doherty ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29th April 2020 Ciara.jpg","title":"Portaferry athlete takes lockdown in her stride  ","story":"CIARA Mageeanrsquos Olympic ambitions may have been put on hold owing to coronavirus, but shersquos taking the lockdown in her stride mdash almost.The  year-old Portaferry runner, who is currently holed up in Manchester, says the current restrictions arenrsquot that far removed from her normal training regime.Even so, she says there are days when she does not want to run and she also misses her family and friends back at home.ldquoWersquore all struggling mdash therersquos days I donrsquot even want to go out and run now, and that the thing I have to do and the thingI always look forward to, she said.ldquoTherersquos days Irsquove cried and been like, lsquoWhat the hell is this rsquo Irsquove chatted to my team-mates about that and you justhave to find little methods ad mechanisms to try and help yourself.Last Thursday, Ciara was one of a number of leading sportsmen and women at the virtual launch of Sport NIrsquos Wellbeing Hub in response to the COVID- challengeThe hub provides instant access to helpful information, guidance and screening that is tailored specically to help care for wellbeing needs.It offers a range of innovative tools and resources, including guided self-assessment via lsquoChatbotrsquo, self-help programmes and digital intervention tools, a searchable five ways to wellbeingrsquo map and a wellbeing information library.Ciara said: ldquoOur mental health is so vital and right now is a challenging time for all of us.A full-time athlete and a member of Team New Balance, Ciara lives in Manchester in the same house with fellow athletes Jip Vastenburg and Adam Craig.

Irsquom not quite sure when Irsquoll get to see him next as Irsquom in Manchester and he is in Dublin so itrsquos a nice way to start my day and always puts a smile on my face.Q Whatrsquos your favourite exercise A Oh I feel like I should say running, as I am an athlete, butI was to think of my favourite it would probably be a few things. I do miss playing a team sport so probably camogie, I absolutely loved dodge ball in school sothat was an option Irsquod pick that, and I do enjoy my gym workouts getting to lt weights.Q Is there one particular skill you practice every day A Running, every day! Running is a gross motor sport so fine skills arenrsquot really a part of my daily training, but I do work on dferent areas of my fitness every day. I have to work on things such as flexibility and fine muscle control every day to keep myself injury free. In the athlete house though we have been honing dferent skills while on lockdown, trying out dferent Tik Tok dances, press ups, and trying to get our eye in with the sling shot in the back garden!Q Netflix and chill or a nice evening jog A Both, usually we have an evening run, easy four miles... then we chill and watch a movie after dinner. We have had to mix training up a bit with the changes but in an ideal world we get both in.Q Name one book you want to read.A Irsquom making my way through a few Malcolm Gladwell books. I love coming away with new information and enjoy a book that challenges my thought process. Then when I need to flake out Irsquod pick something like A Man Called Ove. Soanyone could recommend books like this to me theyrsquod be on my ldquowant to read list.Q On a scale of  to , how good are your DIY skills A Ohhhh, Irsquom going to give myself an . -  here. My daddy is a joiner so I spent my le watching him make and fix things, and soon learned the names of tools and how to use them. I do know my limits though so I stay away from the plumbing... luckily in Portaferry my dad has a lot of friends who are alsotradesmen so they all help each other out.Q Have you a favourite pre-training meal to help you through a tough session A We usually train in the morning so I tend to eat an OTE DuoBar, the vanilla flavour in my favourite, and a cup of tea. When it come to racing in the evening, something easy to digest is usually what I go for... rice is always a winner.Q Name one movie you want to watch.A , I was planning on watching it in the cinema before the lockdown.Q Whatrsquos the best way to stave off boredom A Oh as a full-time athlete I feel Irsquove been preparing for lockdown for years. My le is basically train, eat, sleep. For me therersquos a few things I enjoy. I love chatting with my family, Irsquom usually on WhatsApp most of the day chatting or messaging and keeping in touch. I also love arts and crafts, Irsquoll be making postcards to post to my boyfriend and siblings to make them laugh, and currently my little cousin is teaching me the guitar via WhatsApp. She is a tough taskmaster, I have a lesson every Thursday and Monday and homework in between so that keeps me busy Q Have you any tips for training at home A Set yourself some goals that you can realistically achieve from home. We are allowed out for our daily exercise so you can get some cardio in outside, find a route that works for you and follow the guidelines. When it comes to working out inside, have fun. Find new alternatives, there are so many exercises we can do with body weight, or with stuff we have about the house so be creative and have a bit of craic. If you need any ideas check out social media, so many people are sharing home workouts. Give yourself a plan or schedule and try to stick to it. Being home means we can fall into the habit of sitting about and it can be hard to feel motivated. At the beginning of each week set out your plan for the week, what day, what time, and what exercise. Write it down and stick it somewhere you can see. Creating a routineduring these strange times means we can take back a little control.Q Name one documentary you want to see.A Anything with David Attenborough, I absolutely love animals and nature, and could listen to his voice all day.Q Have you discovered any new music or podcasts A My music taste is so ied but my wee sis and cousin Tara introduced me to Beoga and I absolutely love it. A lad from my hometown, Ryan McMullan also features in some of their songs, always a nice surprise hearing a weePortaferry accent as Irsquom listening.Q Is there one piece of housework you can no longer avoid A My own room!

Two of the carriage doors were open.The carriage is normally used as a buffet car at Inch Abbey and for serving afternoon teas.Dismayed railway officials are hoping CCTV footage might lead to the culprits being caught.Railway chairman Robert Gardiner said: ldquoIrsquove asked another one of our volunteers to download the CCTV, which we will be providing to the police.

This would be known as Serious Condition Criteria.While widely welcomed, what was not made clear was Departmental staff have discretion around who meets criteria and can overrule a claimantrsquos medical evidence.A number of enquiries were submitted to the Department under a Freedom of Information request.The responses are concerning.The Department stated legislation does not refer to serious conditions but rather whether there is a relevant change of circumstances. The decision not to reassess those with severe, lelong disabilities or health conditions who are unlikely to ever move into work: ldquoTook effect from  September , but did not result in legislative change.The Department was asked about the right of appealing a decision rejecting a claimant for Serious Conditions Criteria, who responded: ldquoThere is no automatic right of appeal against a determination which is embodied in or necessary to a decision. , a claimant has a right of appeal against an outcome decision rather than a determination, which is merely a component of the outcome decision.This was complicated for non-legally trained or represented claimants, so questions were put around full compliance with the Disability Discrimination and Human Rights.The Department responded stating it: ldquoDoes not hold any information relating to this hellip.may have been undertaken by DWP.A copy of the risk-assessment template used by the Department in instances of considering Serious Condition Criteria, was requested, but: ldquoNo template existsInstead, the response referred to assessment procedures where Departmental Healthcare Professionals advise on the re-referral period, and consider whether a claimantrsquos condition meets: ldquoThe new severe conditions criteria andno further assessments are required.However, the claimantrsquos own medical professionalrsquos opinion around Serious Condition Criteria could be over-ruled, with this decided by: ldquoAn Administrative Officer appointed by the Department.In respect of providing the legislation or guidance which permits the Department to overrule clinical opinion provided by a claimant seeking consideration under the Serious Condition Criteria, the response referred to ESA Regulations , which: ldquoProvides for the redetermination of whether someone has limited capability for work. The time period in relation to this is not set down in the legislation but is largely at the Department Decision Makers discretion ndash usually based on available medical evidence including medical reports from ATOS hellip The decision not to reassess those with severe, lelong disabilities or health conditions who would be unlikely to ever move into work, took effect from  September  but did not result in legislative change.As the Freedom of Information request was answerd prior to the restoration of devolution, the Department was asked with a Minister now in post, to comment on current processes around Serious Condition Criteria decision-making and in particular, how it can by discretion supersede a medical diagnosis by a claimantrsquos clinician. It was also askedprocedures are under review andthere is intention to bring forward legislation to allow for scrutiny or challenge.A spokesperson said: ldquo Anyone claiming ESA will be automatically assessed for the Severe Conditions criteria at their Work Capability Assessment by a Healthcare Professional. If the personrsquos condition or its al effects meet the criteria, the Department will be advised that no further assessments are required.In response to the overruling of clinical decisions, the spokesperson said: ldquoThe Work Capability Assessment looks at the al effects of a personrsquos condition, rather than the diagnosis itself. It is not a supersession of the opinion of their clinician.This dfered to the response provided prior to the Minister taking office, which appeared to show the Department was permitted to over-rule the evidence of claimantrsquos clinician.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The reality is we will look at the medical evidence. The Northern Ireland Executive will have its own flexibility and we may see across the country some iations we saw some iations going into lockdown as well. Itrsquoll be a decision that all four nations take together based on the evidence, he said.Mr. Lewis said he was aware of the complexities of Northern Irelandrsquos Border with the Republic of Ireland amid the pandemic, explaining that he has been meeting with First Minister Arlene Foster, Deputy First Minister Michelle OrsquoNeill and Taacutenaiste Simon Coveney.ldquoEven where there are dferences in the approach between the Republic and the North,there are,we know that we can make sure we are clear with residents why those dferences are there.ldquoThe challenge of having iations within Northern Ireland is how we manage that.An investigation in The Sunday Times at the weekend featured a Whitehall source claiming the government ldquomissed the boat on testing and PPEand ldquojust watched as the death toll mounted in Wuhan, China.The report also claimed that Prime Minister Boris Johnson missed five crucial COBRA meetings in the Cabinet Office in London.When asked to respond to these serious allegations, Mr. Lewis said: ldquoI didnrsquot recognise some of what I saw in the Times.ldquoI was in the Cobra meetings in January and February COBRA meetings are chaired by the Secretary of State in the Cabinet Office Briefing Rooms. Itrsquos a place, not a thing.ldquoWe were making decisions the scientists and medical experts were making decisions at that time and planning was going on. This is the point to judge it now when we have two months more evidence is dangerous and a misleading thing to do.Turning to PPE which has been an issue in Fermanagh, Mr. Lewis used his own constituency of Great Yarmouth as an example of where there has been ldquono problems with accessing equipment.He added: ldquoWersquove had gowns sent over to the UK, OrsquoNeills [sportswear] converted to gowns, there is gin distillery in your part of the world producing sanitisers.ldquoWersquore shting five and a half million pieces of PPE across to Northern Ireland. Wersquove been able to supply that itrsquos in good order. I am talking to the first minster every day that.Mr. Lewis said the priority of the United Kingdom government is to make sure ldquowe donrsquot hit the second peak of the virus.ldquoOne of the most damaging things economically would be, as well as health wise, to start coming out of lockdown ndash restaurants, pubs, whatever start opening again ndash and suddenly you have to close down again and thatrsquos not viable.ldquoI think itrsquos right to be cautious about this wersquoll make that decision in a few weeks.ldquoThe science is shting on this the experience is changing. I am cautious about predicting what will be in a few weeksrsquo time.He believes the government could ldquoflatten the curve of Covid-people continue to stay at home, adding: ldquoWe want to see past the peak, you donrsquot want to see a downward trend and ease up as all you do is let it shoot back up again.ldquoIf you think back to the beginning there were some quite scary numbers being put about by some experts about what the deaths might be. Now any death is too many and we have sadly lost people, friends and family who have gone through tragic experiences recently, and the figures are nowhere near those numbers we saw at the beginning.ldquoThatrsquos because the public across Northern Ireland and the UK have done a good job generally of following the guidelines which means we can flatten that curve, he said.Mr. Lewis explained that he had personal experience of people close to him who had been diagnosed with Covid-, including his parliamentary private secretary.ldquoSomeone I know lost a member of their family this week, I have a few people in family who had the disease.

There is a transition period where you are not really the Archbishop of Armagh but you want to be as helpful as you can and you are also I suppose trying to work out what and how you are going to approach the task.The Archbishop-Elect explained the three facets to the roleHe said there was the appointment of Bishop of the Diocese of Armagh, which has a larger population with a great number of large towns in it than Clogher Diocese.In addition, there is the role of Primacy of All Ireland, considered lsquoFirst among equalsrsquo acknowledging there is another Primate in the southern province but to some degree to be an ambassador for the Church of Ireland.He added: ldquoThe third element is your place within the wider Anglican Communion which I have relatively little experience of. You become a member of the Primatersquos Meeting which is one of the instruments of communion within Anglicanism. There are a number of ways we hold ourselves together, the Lambeth Conference, the office of the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Anglican Consultative Council and more recently, the Primatersquos Meeting.So what type of church do you see under your leadership ldquoItrsquos dficult to speak for the church as the Church of Ireland General Synod is the body which has that authority. There is a saying that the Church of Ireland is synodically governed and episcopally led. What the Archbishop of Armagh can do is to speak to the Church and suggest can concern itself with. It sets a bit of a tone as well. Itrsquos about its spiritual le and its own governance and the need to acknowledge that like probably all institutions and all bodies some bits of it do well and some do not do well some bits are growing and some bits are shrinking some bitsvery well and some bitsnot so well and to maybe try to discover that the bits that do not do well could do a bit better, in terms of spiritual le and acknowledging there is a huge ersity within Anglicanism and to remember that thatrsquos all part of the Anglican heritage.ldquoThere are obviously particularly challenges at the moment, what the church says to society and what it does for the society in which it is placed. You cannot pretend it doesnrsquot live in a political context. Politics is not something that just happens in Parliament. Democracies are places where political discussion or dialogue are about what we can do together or decisions which are deeply embedded. There are institutions which are recognisable bodies in civil society such as the business community, trade unions, voluntary sector and churches are one of those. I think they have their particular things to say and its perfectly legitimate for them to say it.ldquoThe big imponderable at the moment is coronavirus and we have no idea how deeply that will affect the patterns of society. We could come out the other side of that challenge a changed society, with maybe small changes and maybe some very profound changes. Of course the other big external issue is Brexit which involves the relationships between the dferent regions within Ireland and the United Kingdom.ldquoI could be in both parts of that jurisdiction in one day praying for good governance for both of them and for their leaders, he said.In terms of reaching out to people in the Church of Ireland, the Archbishop-Elect recalled how a Northern Ireland Le and Times survey revealed around  per cent of people in Northern Ireland attend church at some point. He said the heyday for attending church was in the period from the late th Century to the period to the middle of the s. But he thinks current attendance is ldquoback to the old norm with fewer people committed to regular churchgoing.He rightly points out that churches are among the very few inter-generational bodies with people of dferent ages attending.The Archdeacon-Elect says people in very small rural parishes are committed to their churches in the sense that they are contributing to their community who feel it is being enriched with their presence. He said the church finds its place in the community.ldquoThe second challenge is what we are for ourselves as a group, as a faith community, how we build up the church, which canrsquot live in isolation but we have our particular family traditions - how we contribute to the ersity of Ireland, how we build up the church to be confident communities of faith and not hesitant or fearful or invisible communities of faith.He said for the Church of Ireland, there was tremendous heritage from Anglicanism.ldquoThe Church of Ireland has a particular way of doing things, liturgically. Liturgy is both the expression and source of our belief. Our vocation may be to hold together what on the face of it appear to be contradictory things is maybe one of our roles in religious and spiritual le. I have no ideait is the best way to be a Christian but it is our way and it seems to contribute something to the catholic church, the wider church.ldquoHarry McAdoo, a well-known Archbishop of Dublin and a great scholar, once said, lsquoIf I hadnrsquot been born an Anglican, I would have had to become one.rsquoThe Archbishop-Elect leaves Clogher Diocese after forging and maintaining good relations with other denominations.He said: ldquoI think the vast majority of committed Christian people see more in common with other Christian traditions than separating us. There is a very long history of ecumenism in the diocese of Armagh as well. There is a long association and friendship with Archbishop Eamon Martin and I hope we can continue to build relationships and friendships.The Archbishop-Elect trained for Church of Ireland ministry after a career in industry in which he held a senior role in Shorts and was for a time, Assistant Director of the CBI in Northern Ireland.ldquoThat probably give me some skills in organisation and about leadership. Irsquove been very lucky here. Irsquom not very fond of the word lsquoleaderrsquo in the ecclesiastical world but one of the things a leader does is to build a team around him. It is almost a contradiction in terms to be involved in a leadership role in Christianity, to do it on your own.ldquoThere are certain things as a bishop that end with you. There are plenty of lonely moments in that sense where you have to make decisions. But by and large business acclimatised me to working with all sorts of dferent people from all sorts of dferent backgrounds in dferent ways and to experience what every parishioner experiences, normal working le with those pressures.As Bishop of Clogher the new Archbishop-Elect held a number of positions nationally and internationally representing the Church.He was the Church of Ireland contact person to the Churches of the Porvoo Communion which represents the Scandanavian and Baltic Lutherans as well as the Spanish and Portuguese Anglicans and other Anglican churches and provinces from these islands making contact at senior level travelling with them.He has also held senior roles on the Irish Council of Churches, the national ecumenical instrument and also the Irish Inter-Church meeting, the latter which includes the Roman Catholic church.He said those bodies were important especially as ecumenism was becoming bland and it was important to keep going and keep talking.These inter-church bodies contribute to providing resources for churches around Brexit, homelessness, welfare reform and subjects churches would be expected to have a voice in.ldquoI enjoyed that hugely, I am coming to the end of that, six years in total two years as vice-President, two years as President and two years as outgoing Vice President. I will be involved again as a member of the Church Leadersrsquo Meeting.The Archbishop-Elect says of his time in Clogher Diocese ldquoItrsquos always been an aim of mine wherever I have worked to try to create a family atmosphere where there are degrees of mutual respect and degrees of mutual accountability. I remember saying that the diocese of Clogher is big enough to do thingswe all pull together in the same direction and small enough for everybody to be necessary for that to happen and to be accountable for what the contribution is. If you treat people with respect, then relationships are easier.ldquoBy and large I felt people were for me rather than against me. It helpsyou are reasonably interested in people and their families and what they do and acknowledge that as an important factor in their faith. Whoever the next Bishop of Clogher is theyshould allow him or her to be his or her own bishop of Clogher and not that they should be like me, Brian Hannon or Michael Jackson or like St. Macartan.The Archbishop-Elect says he enjoys reading history and poetry and in terms of music, takes particular pleasure in the tradition of Anglican anthems . He does admit to particularly enjoying the Psalms which are poetry.The Archbishop-Elect acknowledges that his mother who had a profound influence on his le, reciting the Daily Office at home and was happily committed to God and His Church and would have sung the Te Deum while washing the dishes. One of her favourite biblical phrases was from the Gospel of St. John, Chapter  ldquoI come that you would have le and that you might have it more abundantly.Relaxation for the Archdeacon-Elect is visiting one of his favourite places, the Ulster Museum to see the collection of Irish Art and reading.ldquoThe thing I am looking to reading most is I took possession of the third volume of Hilary Mantelrsquos Wolf Hall trilogy about Thomas Cromwell, lsquoThe Mirror and Light,rsquo an historical novel, he adds.The Archbishop-Electrsquos we Mary teaches in Enniskillen Royal Grammar School and his daughter, Dorothy, is at the University of Oxford.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

But it acknowledged that councils have suffered signicant losses of revenue from the paying public, for example at leisure centres.Then on Wednesday night Minister for Communities Deirdre Hargey said she will not support the actions of councilsthey do not respect worker’s rights, adding that councils should exhaust all options to protect workers. “Of course I share Councils’ concerns about their ongoing financial sustainability,” she said. “But this a time for careful consideration of all the options before taking action.”On Thursday afternoon the council welcomed her statement, adding that it needs “urgent clarity” on the furlough scheme from her. It added: “Given the Minister’s statement, we will temporarily defer the Council’s proposal to release  short service staff. However, until clarity is received, the Council will continue to plan for the urgent action it may need to take in order to ensure that we can continue to provide essential services. The Council will have no choice but to consider the position again in two weeks’ time should the matter not be resolved.”The spokesman said it had already requested that Employment Agencies it uses furlough its casual workers.He added that the council is forecasting an “unprecedented shortfall” in rates income but has a legal responsibility to avoid insolvency.NIPSA official Natalie Sheil welcomed the developments. “However we are very disappointed that the council did not look into these options before making such ruthless decisions about people’s livelihoods,” she said.Trade unions NIPSA, the GMB and Unite had been advising the council that furlough options were available for all  workers, she said, claiming that it was only when Minister Hargey said the same thing in a statement that the council began to listen.“Now they are in a position where we are hoping for a reversal of this initial decision. Other councils have been actively seeking information on furloughing for quite some time.”A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Irsquove grown up on the beach.ldquoI normally take landscape pictures because I love the water and some of the sunsets here are incredible, especially in the winter.Rochelle wrote her Instagram handle on the parcels, so that people who found them could send her a message.ldquoIt was just to make someone smile, and Irsquove had some lovely comments from people who got back to me on Instagram, she said.ldquoThey said they were going to put it up in their room and frame it.ldquoSome people were feeling a bit down and didnrsquot expect to find anything, so it cheered them up.ldquoMy job was done ndash the main purpose was to make people smile and it did - it made me smile too.ldquoI think itrsquos very important to say hello, especiallypeople are living by themselves orthey havenrsquot got their family around.ldquoWhen Irsquom normally walking the dog I say hello and have a chat, but itrsquos quite hard to do that now because everyone is quite wary.ldquoI donrsquot have to have that physical contact with someone to brighten up their day.ldquoArt is just a dferent  to communicate with.

He was also a big figure in all our lives and I would like to extend a special welcome to Tony’s we Mary, to his sons Stephen and Conor, to his daughters Cathy and Laura.“Tony’s death was not unexpected but even so there are just no easy words we can say to take away the pain.“It is a time of heartache, a time of tears. All we can do today is be whatever comfort we can to you at this dficult time.“Anyone who knew Tony ‘Archie’ Moore will know that he loved the social event of a big Wake and attended many a funeral in his day and yet here we are with just his family and a few friends here in this church.“It seems so surreal but as you all know we are living in strange times due to the restrictions imposed on us by the Coronavirus pandemic.“If these were normal times, this church would be overflowing such was Tony’s popularity.“He was first and foremost a giant of the community and the irony is, as much as he would have loved a big send off, he would have wanted us to do our best to respect the guidelines, to keep people safe and healthy at this unusual time.“Thanks to the wonders of technology, many of you in the community are watching online.”He also welcome members of Tony’s family from Australia who are also watching online.“We were all deeply saddened that Tony has left us and it is dficult to let go of the man we came to know and love.“We are privileged to be able to gather together as his family and friends here and online to pray for him.“Someone once said everyone gets to preach at their own funeral by the way they lived their le.“Well knowing Tony as I did, the man he was I believe he will preach very well.”He refered to the Gospel which was on the Beatitudes and said Tony was ‘keenly aware’ of all the blessings.“Those quality Jesus mentions became a lived reality for him.“He was keenly aware of all of the blessings God had given him and he was proud to share them with everyone he knew.“Today we mourn the death of Tony but we also celebrate a le well lived.“Tony was a man who loved le. His family was incredibly important to him and was one of the things that distinguished him and helped define who he was as a man. He loved his we Mary, his children and his grandchildren. There is nothing he wouldn’t do for them. The pain upon us is real but so is the joy.“Each one of you here and each one of you watching online have a story to tell about Tony. “We can look back at the times when Tony was so kind to so many, brightened and enriched lives.“We can see in him love through his love for others. We can see in him compassion, honesty, integrity and courtesy and how everyone was special to him.

He cared about people all his le.“He was born in Shankill in Lurgan whre he grew up but he would spend most of his le living in Craigavon.“He started his working career with Farrens then went to work in the Goodyear factory when it opened in  til its closure.“He was one of the founding members of the Goodyear Sports and Social Club and he will be remembered by many as the ‘Captain of the Ship’ at the Goodyear SSC where he facilitated s that raised thousands of pounds for charities.“He loved and enjoyed the craic and banter with all the people who came through the door over the years.“Tony had a great love for young people and when he was younger he worked as a volunteer youth leader for many years.“He was also a keen supporter of Armagh, Clan na Gael and Eire Og. He loved the GAA. He was a true Gael.“Tony Moore was truly special and that came from something within. And that something was his faith. Tony was a man of immense faith. He embraced his Catholic faith. His whole le was founded on a deep unshakeable faith.“I had the privilege of knowing Tony. He was a great friend to me and I can pay him no greater compliment when I say he was one of the best people you’d ever meet and it was a pleasure knowing him. He was one of le’s true gents. Quite simply, he was a legend who warmed our hearts and we were all privileged to have our lives touched by him.“Tony should have got a real good send off and I know the whole of Craigavon will come to a standstill as he gave everything to the people of Craigavon and beyond.
