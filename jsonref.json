As the train snakes its way into the city centre, a trio of fine brick chimneys is revealed at a bend in the river, each styled after a different Italian renaissance tower. One mimics Giotto’s Campanile in Florence, another echoes the Torre dei Lamberti in Verona, while a third recalls a Tuscan towerhouse in San Gimignano. It was the ornate fantasy of Victorian industrialist Colonel Thomas Harding, who hired architect William Bakewell to conjure the most beautiful ventilation shafts that a Yorkshire pin factory had ever seen.In recent years, this sophisticated scene has been overshadowed by towers of a different kind. First came the ranks of tacky waterside apartments, each topped with a jaunty curved roof, adding a touch of service station chic. Then came Bridgewater Place, the tallest building in Yorkshire, which squats like a bulky grey Dalek on the skyline. Its malevolence extends beyond its looks alone: the wind created by this “killer tower” at street level swept a lorry on to the pavement, crushing a man to death, and has injured others.Now all of this is to be trumped by the most audacious shaft that God’s Own Country has ever seen. Rising to 46 storeys, Two Springwell Gardens is planned to be the new tallest building in Yorkshire, a 142-metre glass monolith rising from the industrial sheds of Holbeck. In a Ballardian flourish, it promises to house glamorous “sky gardens”, where spiral staircases wind their way through luscious hanging plants. Cocooned inside these sealed vertical patios, residents will experience “an enhanced sense of community” as they look down on the surrounding landscape of builders’ depots and tyre shops.The building “has a bold visual identity, thanks to a distinctive sail-like facade”, says Antony Georgallis, director of local developer Citylife, which was founded five years ago and has yet to realise a completed building. “By being brave with our design, if planning is granted, we will contribute towards a new skyline for the city.”Sadly, for the future residents of the high-rise, it seems like both developer and architect, Nick Brown, have been so focused on the skyline that they forgot to think enough about the inside. When the building’s floor plans were first revealed on social media, architects and planners were aghast. “Inhumane, incompetent, inexcusable,” was the verdict of housing expert Claire Bennie, former development director of the Peabody housing association. “Abomination!” added another.Cramming 16 apartments per floor around a single access core, with just one escape staircase, the plan looks like some contorted Space Invaders monster with a fire-hazard death-wish. Some flats have been so shoehorned into the corners that they necessitate having 12-metre-long windowless corridors to reach them. The mirrored pairs of crooked passages extend from the lift core like great fallopian tubes, pregnant with the promise of an endless journey from the front door to the living room through a one-metre wide tunnel. Some flats seem to be one-third corridor. As one commenter put it: “The apartments are basically just corridors of varying width, from depressing to furniture-containing.” The “affordable” flats, meanwhile, have been tucked into the armpits of the H-shaped plan, recessed in the shadow of their neighbours.Architect Nick Brown is sanguine: “Our approach is to work to the technical regulations and take it to the limit of what is acceptable within those boundaries,” he says. He also thinks the long windowless corridors could be a positive feature. “Residents could actually turn those corridors into a gallery or something,” he says. “It’s part of the arrival sequence, building up to the amazing views you’ll get when you reach the apartment.”The Leeds Civic Trust is not convinced. “This is a scheme that’s trying to do far too much with the space available,” says the trust’s director, Martin Hamilton. “Some of the flats will get very little natural light, and there’s no private amenity space for the residents. It looks like a pokey arrangement for coming and going, and the single escape stair is a real safety concern for a building of this height.”Brown responds: ‘We’ve been working with fire consultants and we are satisfied that it is safe and it meets the requirements. Every apartment is sprinklered, and the core is the required size for the building, with compartmentalisation and two-hour fire protection. We are aware of the sensitivities of tall buildings and we continue to challenge ourselves.’The scheme would fail to meet the London housing standards on multiple fronts. Sixteen flats is twice the number permitted to be accessed from a single core for safety reasons, while daylight and natural ventilation are also required for communal corridors. The lack of personal outdoor space for each flat wouldn’t meet the standard either. “We originally had balconies, connected by a green wall,” says Brown. “But we had to get rid of the green wall due to fire regulations. Then the balconies became too exposed and windy to use.” He says residents will be able to use the courtyard of their neighbouring scheme, One Springwell Gardens, an (unbuilt) lower-rise block that received planning permission in 2017. The civic trust has pointed out that the tower would cast this space, and the building itself, in shadow for much of the day.For those who have been watching the Leeds development scene over the years, this tower may be the tallest, but it represents a new low. “It’s appalling,” says architectural historian Ken Powell, who has been involved with Leeds since the 1970s, working with Save Britain’s Heritage and castigating the so-called “Leeds Look” – a kind of joyless postmodernism featuring red bricks, grey slate roofs – that emerged in the 1980s and 90s. “It’s just another large object stuck in space, without any concern for its context. The city needs some kind of vision, which they simply do not have. These tall buildings have sprung up in a very unplanned way, just dumped along the fringes of the city centre in a meaningless jumble.”Like Powell, he sees it as a symptom of the lack of an overarching vision for the city. “Leeds is really two cities,” he says. “It’s got the really good stuff in the centre – very urban and quite cosmopolitan – then this no man’s land pretty much all the way around it, that’s been messed up by highways and demolitions and the loss of industry. Then all this new stuff is being scattered around in a random fashion. When you’re there, it feels like there’s no urban structure.”Two Springwell Gardens is the latest of a rash of tall buildings in the city, many of which have sprung up around the Leeds Arena to the north, forming a notional “cluster”. “From a distance, it looks quite impressive now,” says Jones. “Then when you actually reach them, the quality is terrible.”The chief offender of the bunch is the Opal 3 Tower, a 25-storey cliff face of student flats punctured by tiny square windows and topped with an inexplicable red triangular crown, like some bloated rooster. The work of Derby-based Morrison Design, it was the tallest building in the area until the arrival of the Sky Plaza tower, a 37-storey silo of 557 student flats designed by Leeds stalwarts Carey Jones. It was clad, until recently, in the same kind of flammable aluminium composite panels that clothed Grenfell Tower. There are several more similar towers on the way nearby, including another pair of tombstones for Unite, rising to 27 storeys, and Altus House, a lacklustre 38-storey doppelganger of its neighbours. Sharing the same palette of whitish cladding, this north end of Leeds is starting to look like a depot of discarded fridges.“There is a recent tendency for the council to say, ‘Well, we’ve approved something that looks like this in this area, so we want something similar,’” says Hamilton. “Sure, it may be policy-compliant, but something that offers a contrast would be more welcome. Our concern is that you end up with a rather monotonous blancmange, rather than something more interesting.”A spokesperson for Leeds City Council said: “The Council determines all planning applications on their inidual merits, including applications for ‘tall buildings’, in accordance with national and local planning policy guidance and legislation.”Like many cities, Leeds has always had a fairly permissive approach to tall buildings, sitting back and seeing what developers offer, rather than proactively masterplanning in advance. Tower locations seem to be justified after the event, any notional “strategy” playing catch-up with the market. The council issued a new draft Tall Buildings Design Guide for consultation last year, but it still lacks teeth, full of vague principles that seem intentionally open to interpretation. The council says responses to the consultation are still being considered to help prepare any second future version, prior to any formal adoption. For developers, the flexibility is a boon.“The planning system in Leeds tends to be reactive,” says Brown, who is also a co-director of the Citylife development company. “For us, that leaves the window open to propose things and come forward with our own thoughts on what the skyline should be.” So is this city-fringe area of warehouses, woodyards and kerb-crawlers really the right place for Yorkshire’s tallest tower?“Normally, the tallest building arrives last, as the crowning glory of a regenerated area,” says Brown. “We’re doing it back to front. It’s a real stake in the ground for Holbeck.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/76d4126c555b93bc3d9ccec48abe26a01e2f8bda/0_0_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=96e9c0e911cc241f7188718c9e0211d9","title":"living off grid slab city california matt stuart in pictures","story":"Situated on a former military base in the Sonoran desert, just north of the Mexican border in California, Matt Stuart found this DIY community boasts skate parks, hot springs – and dismembered dolls"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c20b7b04b7c5fd1e5108b20aeaae6364e7780b1e/0_416_6240_3744/master/6240.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=75a56a118ca1bc6baf66d4fd4d6df61d","title":"australia offers five year extension hong kong visa holders extradition treaty","story":"Prime minister Scott Morrison cancels extradition treaty citing the new national security law as ‘a fundamental change of circumstances’China has accused Australia of “gross interference” after Scott Morrison granted a range of visa holders from Hong Kong a five-year extension and suspended an extradition treaty with the city.The prime minister announced on Thursday that Australia would allow a range of visa holders to stay in the country for longer and then offer them a pathway to permanent residency – but has stopped short of creating a special humanitarian intake for Hongkongers fearing persecution under the new national security law.The government said almost 10,000 temporary skilled, graduate and student visa holders in Australia would be eligible for the special arrangements, along with a further 2,500 outside Australia and 1,250 applications on hand. There are also opportunities for future applicants and attempts to attract entrepreneurs.Morrison said Australia would also suspend its extradition treaty with Hong Kong – following a similar move by Canada – because it believed the national security law “constitutes a fundamental change of circumstances”.The Chinese embassy in Canberra responded furiously to the moves, saying China “strongly deplores and opposes the groundless accusations and measures announced by the Australian government”.“The Australian side has been clanking that they oppose ‘foreign interference’,” a spokesperson for the embassy said in a statement.“However they have blatantly interfered in China’s internal affairs by making irresponsible remarks on Hong Kong related issues. Its hypocrisy and double standard is exposed in full.”The embassy spokesperson called on Australia “to immediately stop meddling in Hong Kong affairs and China’s internal affairs under any pretext or in any way, otherwise it will lead to nothing but lifting a rock only to hit its own feet”.Amid increasing tensions in the relationship between Australia and China, Morrison said the government would “adjust the policy settings” to ensure that skilled and graduate visa holders would have a five-year extension, followed by a pathway to permanent residency.Current and future students would be able to stay in Australia for five years after they graduate.“If you’re a temporary graduate or skilled visa holder, your visa will be extended to provide an additional five years from today, in addition to the time you’ve already been in Australia, with a pathway to permanent residency at the end of that period,” Morrison told reporters in Canberra.“And we will also provide a five-year visa with a pathway to permanent residency for future Hong Kong applicants for temporary skilled visas, subject to meeting an updated skills list and appropriate labour marking testing.”To encourage applicants to study and work in regional areas, Australia would offer express pathways to permanent residency after three years.The government would also seek to attract export-orientated Hong Kong-based businesses to move to Australia, particularly where they had a strong potential for future growth and employment of Australians.The acting immigration minister, Alan Tudge, said Australia wanted to attract global talent and businesses from Hong Kong at a time when “many iniduals now might be looking elsewhere, because they do want to be in a freer country, they want to be in a democratic country”.Human rights groups had been calling on the government to announce a special humanitarian intake, similar to the Abbott government initiative in 2015 for people displaced by the conflicts in Syria and Iraq.The Australia director of Human Rights Watch, Elaine Pearson, told  Australia earlier this week the pathway to help people likely to be targeted by Beijing “should be on top of existing humanitarian quotas, so that protection for Hong Kong people is not at the expense of others fleeing persecution in places like Syria or Afghanistan”.But Morrison said the existing “refugee and humanitarian stream remains available for those seeking to apply through that channel – and that is available to people all around the world”.The Australian government updated its travel advice for Hong Kong just hours before the announcement to warn that Australians “may be at increased risk of detention on vaguely defined national security grounds”.“If you’re concerned about the new law, reconsider your need to remain in Hong Kong,” the travel advice said. Officials have had more time to assess the impact of the national security law since last week’s update, which warned the law could be interpreted broadly and people may unintentionally break it. The travel advice for mainland China has also been updated to say Australians may be at risk of arbitrary detention – a change the  understands was influenced by the case of two Canadians detained on the basis of espionage allegations.On Thursday, New Zealand also announced it was reviewing its relationship with Hong Kong, including extradition arrangements and travel advice. Foreign affairs minister Winston Peters said the national security law “fundamentally changed the environment for international engagement”.Morrison revealed last week that he was planning to follow the lead of his British counterpart, Boris Johnson, in offering help to Hong Kong residents. Johnson has said he would honour a promise to offer nearly 3 million residents of the former British colony, those with British national overseas status, the right to settle in the UK.But on Thursday Morrison cautioned against drawing parallels with Johnson’s offer, noting that the UK had “a very special relationship with Hong Kong” and that Australia was not talking about such large numbers.“We’re not talking about tens of thousands, or anything of that nature,” Morrison said. Tudge said the numbers were likely to be “in the hundreds or low thousands”.Labor’s foreign affairs spokesperson, Penny Wong, backed Morrison’s announcements but called for clarity on family reunions. “As usual what he has delivered falls far short of what he has promised.”A day before the announcement, Morrison attempted to send a message to China that Australia’s visa program was a matter for Australian domestic politics. “They’re Australian sovereign issues,” he said.Asked on Thursday whether he expected any countermeasures from China that might make it difficult for people in Hong Kong to leave to take up the offer, Morrison said: “I don’t. But if that were to occur that would be very disappointing.”Chinese authorities argued last week that the UK had no right to grant residency to Hongkongers and vowed to take “corresponding measures” to stop such a move."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1be99cdf416a619a80d785b9f14a0e80c9c84651/6_0_3488_2094/master/3488.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fd9d6af09297bfa83216b9ecdfa9ab84","title":"energy watchdog unveils 25bn uk green investment drive","story":"Ofgem to upgrade infrastructure and cut consumer bills by £20 a year Household energy bills will drop by £20 a year after the UK energy watchdog unveiled a £25bn green investment plan meant to improve Britain’s energy infrastructure.Ofgem said the five-year investment programme will cover repair and maintenance costs for existing gas and electricity networks and support the growth of green energy. The regulator said it would also aim to keep costs low for consumers, by cutting the amount of money usually pocketed by utilities and their shareholders.The watchdog said it would also cut more than £8bn from company spending plans by setting more ambitious efficiency targets and blocking costs that it said firms have not justified as delivering value for consumers. “It is now up to the companies to come back and provide more robust evidence on why this expenditure is needed,” Ofgem said.The package is meant to save £3.3bn in company expenditure from being passed on to customers between 2021 and 2026. Energy bills are expected to drop by £20 a household in 2021, though the long-term reduction in bills could drop to £10 a year depending on how much is spent on additional green energy projects over the next five years.Ofgem’s chief executive, Jonathan Brearley, said: “We are striking a fair deal for consumers, cutting returns to the network companies to an unprecedented low level while making room for around £25bn of investment needed to drive a clean, green and resilient recovery.“Now more than ever, we need to make sure that every pound on consumers’ bills goes further. Less of your money will go towards company shareholders, and more into improving the network to power the economy and to fight climate change.”About £3bn of the £25bn in upfront funding will be used to connect green electricity sources and upgrade the transmission grid, to make sure the network can cope with rising levels of renewable energy as part of the energy mix.Ofgem said it could also make another £10bn available for emissions free energy and and infrastructure upgrades that aim to reduce carbon emissions and bring the UK closer to net zero carbon targets. That is on top of a £630m fund meant to drive research and development into “crucial” green energy projects.“Ofgem will scrutinise every investment and only give the green light to measures that deliver decarbonisation at the lowest cost to consumers,” the regulator said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e30131b0f876693024fec5fcc9b458191e7c3459/0_233_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b5ea749ad13453cac164ee29011a2a00","title":"john lewis closes eight stores with expected loss of 1300 jobs","story":"Closures include outlets in Birmingham and Watford and its four At Home shopsJohn Lewis is permanently closing eight of its 50 department stores, including big outlets in Birmingham and Watford, with the likely loss of 1,300 jobs.All four of the group’s smaller At Home stores, in Croydon, Newbury, Swindon and Tamworth, are to close, as well as two outlets in travel hubs at Heathrow and St Pancras station in London.The coronavirus lockdown has prompted some of the UK’s most prominent companies to announce large-scale job losses.

The UK job cuts will be at all levels, including managing directors, and across all parts of the business.Harrods – 700 jobs The department store group is cutting one in seven of its 4,800 employees due to the “ongoing impacts” of the pandemic. The Harrods chief executive, Michael Ward, blamed the cuts on social distancing and a lack of tourists.Airbus – 1,700 jobsThe European planemaker announced plans this week to cut 1,700 jobs in the UK as it warned the coronavirus pandemic had triggered the “gravest crisis” in its history.The job losses come after the announcement of nearly 9,000 high street job cuts last week, after a swathe of redundancies at retailers ranging from Harrods to the Topshop owner Arcadia group and SSP, the company behind hundreds of railway and airport eateries. A further 2,000 are at risk at Poundstretcher, which has said it could close half its estate if landlords do not agree to rent cuts.Department stores have faced particular difficulties in recent years as their large sites with long leases have been tricky to adapt to changing shopping habits.John Lewis’s rivals Debenhams, House of Fraser and Beales have all gone into administration. Beales has closed down completely and Debenhams and House of Fraser have shut numerous stores. House of Fraser’s Grimsby store closed this week and its outlet in Dundrum, near Dublin, is expected to close permanently later this month.Sharon White, the chairman of the department stores’ parent group the John Lewis Partnership, which is owned by its staff, known as partners, said: “Closing a shop is always incredibly difficult and today’s announcement will come as very sad news to customers and partners.“However, we believe closures are necessary to help us secure the sustainability of the partnership and continue to meet the needs of our customers, however and wherever they want to shop. Redundancies are always an absolute last resort and we will do everything we can to keep as many partners as possible within our business.“There are many reasons to be optimistic about the partnership’s future. Waitrose and John Lewis are two of the UK’s most loved and trusted brands and we have adapted to the challenges of the pandemic by responding to the new needs of customers. We will soon announce the output of our strategic review which will ensure our brands stay relevant for future generations of customers.”The company said it would seek to find alternative jobs for those who had been working in the permanently closed stores, including at nearby outlets of its sister chain, Waitrose. It will also contribute up to £3,000 towards retraining via a recognised qualification or course for up to two years for any partner with two years’ service or more.On Thursday, John Lewis also confirmed that nine shops that had closed because of the coronavirus lockdown would reopen on 30 July. They are: Aberdeen, Ashford, Brent Cross, Chichester, Oxford, Peterborough, Reading, Sheffield and White City Westfield. Leicester will also reopen when the local lockdown is lifted, taking the number of reopened John Lewis shops to 42."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/db278a9fb39ba558aa30c586fa4a109b7df07713/0_0_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f0695718c14125b038a14c7347702d5e","title":"us unemployment weekly numbers coronavirus reopenings","story":"Number of new filings decreased since April peak but remained above a million each week since forced shutdowns beganAs new Covid-19 cases continue to surge in states throughout the US, another 1.3 million people filed for unemployment last week, highlighting the grim reality that any type of economic recovery may be far off.While the number of new unemployment filings has decreased significantly since it peaked in April at 6 million people filing in one week, it has remained above a million each week since forced shutdowns began.Last week, nearly 100,000 less people filed for unemployment compared to the week before, continuing a 15-week decrease in the number of new filings.But over the last few weeks, a number of states have shown an alarming uptick in new cases. The US reached 130,000 deaths due to the virus this week, the highest of any country. Dr Anthony Fauci, the director of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said earlier this week that states and cities reopened too quickly, causing a record-breaking number of new cases.In response to the rapid increase of infections, states like Florida, California and Texas have had to reverse reopening measures, once again shutting down businesses, especially bars and restaurants. Economists say the effects of these reversals will likely show in the coming weeks.And even though some jobs have come back, millions more are still indefinitely out of work. States have been working through their backlog of unemployment claims, trying to update systems working at overcapacity to handle the number of new unemployment applications.Antonio Diaz of Miami, Florida filed for unemployment when he was laid off from his job as a bellman at the Fontainebleau Hotel in Miami, where he has worked for over 15 years. He received one $275 check from the state in April once his application went through, but has not received another payment since. Attempts to contact the state department in charge of distributing unemployment insurance have failed, and Diaz is quickly running out of savings.On top of dealing with a halt in his income, Diaz’s grandfather and father have both died from the virus, leaving him to take care of his grandmother.“I feel a mix of emotion,” Diaz said in Spanish through a translator. “I feel rage with the governor with him holding onto our unemployment checks, and then at the same time, throughout this, I feel sadness because I’m still grieving and I have to take care of my grandmother.”“Without this help from Florida unemployment, it has made this whole process a lot more difficult and it’s made it more difficult for me to be able to support her.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e2fbeffaf35eb30dc7a75f5672bfbe2aa5c4da46/0_292_5111_3068/master/5111.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e725ea811b16b04f02a2a335d03a56bf","title":"german exports covid 19 economy us jobless business live","story":"Grim day in UK retail as Boots announces plans to cut 4,000 jobs and John Lewis Partnership shuts eight storesWest Midlands mayor Andy Street, the former managing director of John Lewis, says the company is wrong to shut the Birmingham department store (which he opened five years ago).Street says John Lewis’s failure to make a success of the store is “extremely disappointing”. He believes it can still be a success, and has pledged to make the case for keeping the store open, saying:At this stage the closure is only a proposal, and one I believe risks being a terrible mistake. Therefore I will be making the case for why the company should not give up this tremendous opportunity in Birmingham.However, John Lewis said this morning that the eight stores being shut were all struggling before the Covid-19 pandemic, so it may not see the same opportunity as Street....Boris Johnson’s spokesman has told journalists in Westminster that the government will help John Lewis and Boots workers “in any way we can”.But... chancellor Rishi Sunak’s new £30bn mini-budget package is already meant to be providing support. Those measures, including a £1,000 bonus for taking back furloughed staff, didn’t prompt a last-minute change of heart at either company.Labour MP Bill Esterson points out that manufacturing is also struggling.As covered earlier, 2,000 Rolls-Royce staff are expected to take voluntary redundancy or early retirement by August, following the slump in air travel.The scale of the job cuts being imposed at Boots and John Lewis shows that Covid-19 is still battering the UK high street, says the FT’s John Eley:John Lewis’s decision to shut two full-size department stores in large centres — the Intu complex in Watford and the Grand Central development above Birmingham’s New Street station — is likely to send shockwaves through the retail industry.The 136,000 square foot Birmingham store opened in 2015 as part of an ambitious redevelopment of the city centre.While most of Boots’ stores remained open during the UK’s 12-week lockdown, the company still reported much lower shopper numbers and refused to pay rent to many of its larger landlords while it renegotiated lease terms. More than 100 of its larger stores in city centre, station and airport locations were closed, along with most of the Boots Opticians practices, while beauty and fragrance counters, which are major revenue drivers, were unable to operate. Boot’s jobs cuts are likely to hit its Support Office in Nottingham, which covers some 279 acres and dates back to 1929.Deputy and assistant managers, and beauty and customer advisers in stores are also at risk, according to the Evening Standard. Plus, of course, the staff who work at the 48 Boots Opticians outlets which will close. Sebastian James, the managing director of Boots UK, says: “The proposals announced today are decisive actions to accelerate our transformation plan, allow Boots to continue its vital role as part of the UK health system, and ensure profitable long-term growth. In doing this, we are building a stronger and more modern Boots for our customers, patients and colleagues.“We recognise that today’s proposals will be very difficult for the remarkable people who make up the heart of our business, and we will do everything in our power to provide the fullest support during this time.”Over in the US, jobs are still being lost at a scary rate too.The latest ‘initial claims’ report, just released, shows that 1,314,000 Americans filed new claims for unemployment support last week. That’s down from 1.41m the previous week, but still alarmingly high - the 16th month running in which at least one million people sought fresh help. It may be partly driven by companies who have been forced to shut down as Covid-19 lockdowns are re-imposed in some states.Barely 24 hours ago, Boris Johnson declared that his government wants “jobs, jobs, jobs”, before his chancellor outlined a £30bn package to support employment.Well, so far today it’s got “cuts, cuts, cuts”.As major employers, John Lewis and Boots will get the headlines today. But there are many more companies in distress, and likely to cut jobs.So warns Julie Palmer, partner and restructuring expert at Begbies Traynor:Even after yesterday’s government announcement there will be a significant amount of job losses on the high street. Many of the biggest companies have been fighting against the tide of destruction before this crisis, and there is a huge dam of distressed businesses building and waiting to break.The Covid-19 crisis means that some firms will now implement “drastic change”, rather than gradual transformation, she adds. In some cases, that means shutting stores.Investment will be poured into parts of the business that are strengthening and pulled from areas that unsuitable for these modern ways of trading. The likes of John Lewis and Boots will exist in the future, but they cannot maintain their empires under their current structure.You can read the details of the Boots job cuts here: Walgreens Boots Alliance Reports Fiscal 2020 Third Quarter ResultsTUC policy adviser Alex Collinson says today’s jobs cuts show that Rishi Sunak’s £1,000 bonus for taking back furloughed workers is insufficient:Unions and some economists warned last night that the UK could face mass unemployment unless the government acts more decisively. Today’s announcements suggest those fears are well-founded.Businessman Luke Johnson argues that the government needs to relax its physical restrictions further to boost retail:British health and beauty retailer Boots plans to cut 4,000 jobs and close 48 optician stores, in the latest major blow to the country’s retail sector from the COVID-19 crisis.British brands including John Lewis and Harrods have announced thousands of job cuts in the last two weeks after the pandemic forced customers to shop online and many remained reluctant to return to the high street even as restrictions eased.This has turning into a grim day for UK retail - with John Lewis and Boots both axing jobs, and Burger King suggesting it could close stores in future too.It suggests that Rishi Sunak’s summer statement yesterday is not going to prevent unemployment rising in the coming months, and will fuel concerns that the package isn’t big enough.Walgreens Boots Alliance CEO Stefano Pessina says the pandemic drove the company into the red in the last quarter, mainly due to the slump in UK sales:“Prior to the pandemic our financial performance for fiscal 2020 was on track with our expectations. However, this unprecedented global crisis led to a loss in the quarter as stay-at-home orders affected all of our markets.Covid-19 is also driving shoppers towards digital platforms, he adds (leading to today’s 4,000 job cuts in the UK):Shopping patterns are evolving more rapidly than ever as consumers further embrace digital options, spurring us to accelerate our ongoing investments in digital transformation and neighborhood health destinations Boots also warns that retail conditions are expected to remain “very depressed” in the UK, despite the gradual easing of lockdown restrictions.

We are burning through the Pliocene and heading towards a Miocene-like future,” said another of the authors, Gavin Foster, a professor of isotope geochemistry at the University of Southampton. “We now have to go further back in time to find situations that are relevant.”During the Middle Miocene, ice sheets shrank further and sea levels were much higher than the Pliocene. Foster said this was long before anything recognisably human had evolved on Earth.“This study shows – with a high level of scientific skill – the enormous challenge ahead in meeting the Paris agreement on climate change target of keeping a global temperature rise this century well below 2C above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase even further to 1.5C,” said the WMO secretary-general, Petteri Taalas."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d12233cbb70114f9b09feae55664a9c99fd180aa/0_204_4046_2429/master/4046.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=62d9545bd71164a385079bebd4950c21","title":"charlize theron 20 best film roles ranked","story":"As her new film hits Netflix, here’s a run down of the actor’s greatest performances, from sci-fi action and comedy to the portrayal of a serial killerIn this disturbing story of a father and son making their way across a post-apocalyptic America, Charlize Theron appears in flashback as the boy’s mother. Theron is a potent image of paradise lost, although it appears she has deserted her husband and child, intriguingly clouding her moral status.This fairy tale reboot has the interesting and witty casting of Theron as the Evil Queen, consumed with jealousy of Snow White (Kristen Stewart) – although it is the ice-blonde Theron who more deserves the title of Snow White. She is terrified of losing her beauty and like the fabled “Blood Countess”, Elizabeth Báthory, uses virgins’ blood to replenish it.An essentially decorative role for Theron in this madly convoluted noir from John Frankenheimer. Theron plays Ashley, a woman who has been having a romantic penpal relationship with a convict who is killed in a knife-fight just before his release. His cellmate Rudy (Ben Affleck), released at the same time, sees the lovely Ashley and passes himself off as her epistolary lover. Soon they are having non-epistolary sex, but then Rudy gets mixed up with a criminal plan dreamed up by Ashley’s brother.In this deeply strange film by Lasse Hallström, Theron plays Candy, a young woman who arrives with her boyfriend, Wally (Paul Rudd), at a prewar orphanage run by Dr Larch (Michael Caine), who secretly offers abortions. Larch’s young protege, Homer (Tobey Maguire), befriends them, goes with them to Rudd’s family farm and falls deeply in love with Candy while Wally is away fighting in the second world war. They go for soulful walks on the beach and Homer intuits that Candy has profound emotional trauma. Theron does her best in this odd, muddled film.With her striking asymmetrical black hairstyle, Theron presents here the action-movie mode that has become an important part of her screen persona. It hardly needs saying, but she is almost scarily beautiful and, with its interesting martial arts stylings, this is an underrated sci-fi action flick.Theron is the leader of an elite warrior crew who are all immortal, condemned to fight for justice as the centuries roll by. A return to her asymmetrical black hair mode, which she still carries off with great hauteur and charisma, although it is a pity this action movie doesn’t do her justice. This was a labour of love for Theron, who has a producer’s credit. She plays the feckless single mother of a little kid, who runs off with a truck driver leaving her daughter with her brother, played by Nick Stahl, who does his best to look after her. Theron is a fleeting presence, and many felt she should have awarded herself more screentime.Theron plays Mary, whose husband, Ray (Jason Bateman), has his life saved by the chaotic, ridiculous Hancock. He’s a wacky anti-superhero, played by Will Smith, whose exploits are widely resented, as they cause more problems than they solve. Mary is herself no stranger to superpowers, though she has opted for a quieter, non-superhero life. This subdued role is perhaps symptomatic of the way Theron and maybe all female stars get treated in Hollywood.This strained, contorted but intermittently powerful film about the Fox News TV sex-abuse scandal is compromised by its inability to decide if Fox staffers can be shown sympathetically. But Theron gives an interesting, if mannered performance as Megyn Kelly, the Fox News presenter who challenges Trump on his misogynist attitudes.Theron co-starred here with her then partner, the Irish actor Stuart Townsend, in this outrageously silly but entertaining period melodrama. She’s a Zuleika Dobson-type femme fatale at Oxford in the 1930s who has an affair with Townsend’s smitten student, who is then to be the intimate witness of her wartime adventures as the lover of a beautiful model, played by Penélope Cruz, and then the apparent mistress (or maybe spy) on the arm of a top Nazi. Goofy stuff, but there’s a lot here for Theron to do, and she has fun with the role.This remake of the 1949 family favourite gives Theron her Fay Wray moment. She plays Jill, a naturalist who has been caring for Joe, a giant, sweet-natured 15ft gorilla. She is persuaded to bring Joe out of his Ugandan habitat to Los Angeles where a wildlife conservancy will apparently foot the bills – but an evil poacher is ready to pounce. There are lots of high-spirited adventures for Joe with Jill often in his (chaste) embrace.James Gray’s tough, dour, impassioned drama about crime and municipal corruption stars Mark Wahlberg as Leo, out of jail and heartbreakingly determined to go straight, who winds up working on the railway yards, where working practices are crooked. Theron plays his cousin Erica, dating Willie (Joaquin Phoenix), the guy Leo saved from prison by not snitching. Erica represents a kind of beautiful prospect of freedom, the life Leo hasn’t had while in prison and may never have.Theron brings some serious martial arts chops to this action spy thriller set in 80s East Berlin. She will sashay through some neon-lit nightclub and accept with a knowing smile a Stoli on the rocks and some badinage from the barman, before putting the smackdown on some brutish thug. It may all be a bit silly, but Theron has some amazingly good one-on-one combat scenes and extended punchups where she shows that she is an authentic action star.It is always good to see Theron playing an authority figure, and in Ridley Scott’s hi-tech prequel to Alien she plays Meredith Vickers, the gorgeously icy, black jumpsuit-clad corporate figure whose shadowy company is bankrolling an intergalactic expedition that may discover the origins of human existence. The ship is called Prometheus, and Vickers is aboard as the official representative with a frosty habit of treating everyone as an inferior. Theron is the ice cube that keeps the drink cool.Diablo Cody wrote this intriguing and elegant satire on the terrible tolls of marriage and motherhood, directed by Jason Reitman. Theron plays Marlo, a careworn woman on the verge of breakdown due to sleeplessness caused by a young baby. Her wealthy brother hires a “night nanny” for her (Mackenzie Davis) and this impossibly slim, pretty, lithe young woman is superb with the baby. Marlo is obsessed with her carefree youth and health (things that she can remember having) and her burgeoning closeness with the nanny takes her to some very dark places. Theron boldly shows how her character, having already deteriorated, can spin further down.This excellent drama shows that Theron can rise to the occasion when she is paired with a strong co-star. That’s certainly what she gets with Tommy Lee Jones, who plays a retired military police inspector. He’s trying to discover the truth about the mysterious death of his son, a serving soldier, whose body was discovered in scrubland near his military base in New Mexico. Also on the case is a civilian cop, played by Theron, a lonely single mum who has been humiliated after a calamitious affair with her married boss. These two unhappy souls come together in the cause of justice, and achieve a quasi-father-daughter friendship. Strong, empathetic performance from Theron.Why hasn’t Theron done more comedy? This is great stuff from her, playing Charlotte, a dazzlingly glamorous and brilliant politician who is a presidential hopeful. Seth Rogen plays Fred, a schlubby, beardy loser of a journalist whom Charlotte once babysat when he was a tiny kid. Now she decides to employ him as her speechwriter because he’s one of the very few men around whom she can relax. Poor Fred soon falls deeply in love with her, and who knows if it isn’t reciprocated? A tender, smart, beguiling performance from Theron.Theron created an instant icon in George Miller’s crazy, operatically over-the-top action-chase thriller fantasia set in the post-apocalyptic desert, a 21st-century update of his Mad Max classic. Tom Hardy plays Max, fighting against the tyrannical warlord chieftain Immortan Joe. On his side is the dazzling Imperator Furiosa, the one-armed badass played with glittery-eyed panache by Theron, whose job is to lead raids, stealing gasoline, ammunition and other necessities. Furiosa always looks as if she has just walked away from (and perhaps caused) an explosion that has made her slightly smudgy-faced and yet is always very glamorous and stylish.Theron gave the world an absolute barnstorming and indeed Oscar-winning performance in this gruesome true-crime movie, “uglied up” to play the serial killer Aileen Wuornos, who was executed for seven murders just one year before this film came out. Theron had clearly studied the real-life Wuornos from the two documentaries about her by Nick Broomfield and created an eerily clever, chilling impersonation of a young woman who had been forced by poverty into sex work and found that her talent was in killing her male clients. Theron’s brown contact lenses create the glassily reptilian belligerent stare, and the flaky dull skin is fabricated with prosthetics. But makeup is only a fraction of what Theron does with this role, showing, through Wuornos’s tense, clenched body language, the reality that her whole life has been a fight she is destined one day to lose.This wasn’t Theron’s Oscar-prestige movie, but it is her best: the most subtle, evolved, persuasively horrible and funniest performance she has ever given, in a black comedy written by Cody and directed by Reitman. She plays the unspeakable Mavis Gary, a jaded former prom queen for whom high school was clearly the most important time of her life, and who now writes generic young-adult fiction, eavesdropping on teen conversations in malls to put into her books, and compulsively rewriting her own tales of teen triumph. She is a functioning alcoholic and depressive, heading for some kind of breakdown, which arrives when she chances upon a round-robin email from her old boyfriend, who attaches a picture of his heartrendingly lovely new baby.Mavis is electrified with a new project: she will return to her hometown, with all its pathetic contemptible losers, and break up her ex’s marriage – because they are clearly fated to be together. Theron makes a superb sociopath, even scarier than in Monster, because of her incomplete touch of satirical self-knowledge and also, I think, because of the seductively husky low voice. She also has a kind of “loser” non-romance with Patton Oswalt, not unlike the one she has with Seth Rogen in Long Shot, but this has far more edge. There is something very evil about her Mavis, something magnificently unsympathetic. Not every heroine has to be relatable. And Theron certainly isn’t here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1a1f7351ea8ccffdbfcf985c03f5defe36951814/0_0_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3358d9a162e143cfde715662a1d49365","title":"moj cleaners to get full sick pay backdated to start of covid 19 pandemic","story":"Announcement follows  reports that cleaners felt pressure to work though they had symptoms of coronavirusThe Ministry of Justice has announced that cleaners in its central London offices will now receive full pay if they are self-isolating or off sick. The arrangement, which will be administered through cleaning agency OCS, also provides back pay for cleaners who were sick or self-isolating after 1 April.The announcement follows  reports in June that the MoJ failed to investigate a potential Covid-19 cluster among its cleaners. The cleaners’ union, United Voices of the World (UWV), warned in April that workers felt forced to continue working despite feeling unwell because they could not afford to losewould have lost money. Those who took time off only received statutory sick pay of £95.85 a week.In May, the  reported that Emanuel Gomes, a worker on the MoJ cleaning team, fell ill and died hours after his shift. There is no evidence Gomes had Covid-19 and a postmortem gave hypertensive heart disease as the probable cause of death.Gomes’s family and United Voices of the World say that he continued working because he did not feel able to call in sick. On the day he died, a colleague said he was so feverish and unwell “he didn’t know where he was”’.“Emanuel went to work feeling sick – but he knew that if he didn’t work … he would get to the end of the month and wouldn’t have enough money,” his brother Leao told the .The MoJ strongly denies cases of Covid-19 were connected to its offices, saying: “It’s simply untrue to suggest there has been an outbreak linked to our headquarters.”In April, testing was not widely available for people who were not hospitalised with coronavirus. OCS told the  that it was not obliged to report Covid-19 cases at the time and had followed public health guidelines and asked iniduals with symptoms to self-isolate.Announcing the new scheme, an MoJ spokesperson told the : “We are extremely grateful to all the staff that have ensured our buildings remain safe for those who cannot work from home.“We hope the fact that OCS colleagues are now able to self-isolate on full pay will provide financial reassurance.”United Voices of the World had been campaigning for full sick pay well before the start of the coronavirus pandemic.Molly de Dios Fisher, one of the union’s organisers, said in response: “We wish to stress how deeply angry and saddened we are that this decision has come too late to save Emanuel Gomes. Had this sick pay policy been implemented sooner Emanuel might still be with us today.“We are proud to have finally forced the MoJ to pay full sick pay. This would not have happened without the near two-year struggle of our members who have taken repeated strike action. While this new scheme is welcome the MoJ has not committed to paying full sick pay for non-Covid sick leave and we will continue to fight for this, along with the living wage.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/296856a916b6a70b25cb0891ec38fab3f2ffa8c9/0_202_6016_3611/master/6016.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eaa2a7d8e57c448971265a029ba666de","title":"we are on our own bangladeshs pregnant garment workers face the sack","story":"Employers are avoiding paying maternity benefits and purging union members as orders plummet during Covid-19, say activistsA few weeks ago, Kalpona Akter’s phone started vibrating. She watched with mounting dread as message after message poured in. First there was the garment worker who had been sacked for demanding personal protective equipment for his colleagues. Then pregnant women and union members started calling for help, saying they were also losing their jobs.As Bangladesh’s garment sector reels from the economic impact of Covid-19 and the shock of  £2.4bn of cancelled or suspended orders inflicted on the industry by overseas fashion brands, a wave of job losses has swept across the country. Moreover, during lockdown hundreds of thousands of workers were not paid for work they had already done.While the Bangladeshi government has rolled out a major bailout package to keep the industry afloat, experts warn that 1.8 million workers are likely to permanently lose their jobs. Already, activists say manufacturers are using Covid-19 as an excuse to weaken unions and purge “undesirable” workers.Since they began tracking cases four weeks ago, Akter’s organisation and others have received reports of the termination of dozens of pregnant workers from more than 30 factories – a number she expects to “increase dramatically in the coming weeks, as workers continue to be fired every day”.One of the sacked workers, Mitu, was three months pregnant when her production manager fired her in late June. Mitu, who asked that we use only her first name, had taken 19 days of authorised medical leave after she became dizzy at work, nearly fainting. When she returned, she overheard the management discussing not wanting to pay maternity benefits. Then they fired her, citing missed work.“My family was depending on my income, and my maternity benefits,” she said. “We have had to take out loans to survive, but soon that will run out.”Another, Morzina, was five months pregnant in May when her manager told her and three other pregnant workers to stay home “for their safety”. When they reported back to work in June, they were told they no longer had jobs. Morzina, who had been working at the factory for eight years, also did not receive the retrenchment benefits – equivalent to nine months full pay – to which she was legally entitled.Since May, she has filed 50 lawsuits on behalf of sacked pregnant workers. In some of these cases, companies had taken workers’ identification cards and forced them to resign, while others simply refused to pay women their maternity benefits.Nazma Akter believes there are many more cases, but with industry-wide job losses, many pregnant workers are too frightened to come forward.“So many women are not getting maternity benefits – the factories are just telling them to leave, and giving them a few days pay,” she said. “Usually we would fight these but with the pandemic, women are afraid. They don’t want to lose their jobs.”Because of the move to remote working, many brands have also stopped carrying out social audits and factory inspections, which has led to an increase in workplace violations, according to Nazma Akter.“Without the monitoring, the factories can do what they want,” she said. “We are seeing a real increase in gender-based violence.”Union organisers are also being targeted, according to Babul Akhter, the president of the Bangladesh Garment and Industrial Workers Federation, who reports anti-trade union activities in a third of the factories where his group operates.“Before, when factories engaged in union busting, we could go directly to the brands and they would help,” said Akhter. “But now that the brands are cancelling orders and fighting with the suppliers, we are on our own.”Mark Sebastian Anner, a professor of labour and employment relations at Penn State University and an expert on the Bangladeshi garment industry, warns that the combination of massive job losses and the purging of union activists could lead to worsening conditions for employees, including forced labour.“This is a profound international crisis that has disproportionately affected the people at the bottom of the supply chain, to the extent that their very survival is at stake,” said Anner. “We’ll be seeing the repercussions for years to come.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/205d58d33a1083438c3abf603b13a77844002d44/0_375_4264_2559/master/4264.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=61c00ffd509997e527092b808217ba6e","title":"zimbabwe health minister facing coronavirus corruption charge sacked","story":"Obadiah Moyo has been charged with criminal abuse of office over the alleged awarding of a $60m contract for Covid-19 suppliesA Zimbabwean health minister charged with corruption in connection with the awarding of a multimillion dollar contract for Covid-19 medical supplies has been fired by the president.Obadiah Moyo was sacked by Emmerson Mnangagwa this week for inappropriate conduct by a public official.Last month, Moyo was arrested and charged with criminal abuse of office over the awarding of a $60m (£47m) contract to a company that allegedly sold supplies to the government at inflated prices.According to court papers, Moyo allegedly awarded a multimillion tender to Drax International LLC, headquartered in the United Arab Emirates, which was concluded without the consent of the Procurement Regulatory Authority of Zimbabwe.Moyo is currently on bail and is expected to appear in court again at the end of July.A representative of Drax, Delish Nguwaya, is facing charges in connection with the contract. He was arrested and has been released on bail. The Zimbabwean government has been criticised for failing to deal with corruption at a time when the country is in desperate need of an international bailout package to save the economy from collapse.The country is also facing a looming health crisis as it continues to record more Covid-19 cases, which currently stand at 885. Nurses are also on strike demanding better salaries, personal protective equipment and better working conditions.Recently, widespread online campaigns by social media influencers and NGOs have called upon Mnangagwa to root out corruption, particularly in the public sector where it is endemic.According to Transparency International, corruption is costing the country $2bn annually.Zimbabwe Anti-Corruption Commission (ZACC) chairperson Loice Matanda-Moyo has often expressed frustration over the government’s lack of resolve in tackling the problem.ZACC has drawn public ire for the “catch and release” of public officials, in which cases of graft are never concluded.Earlier this month, Zimbabwe’s former tourism minister Prisca Mupfumira appeared in court facing two counts of criminal abuse of office and concealing a transaction. She is accused of misappropriating of $95m from the national pension fund.

Whatever your trade, glowing reviews are good for business.But since setting up Surrey Hills Handyman in 2016, Lingard has sought to gain further advantage, using Google My Business, a free tool for businesses to manage their online presence across Google services. The tool helps him display his five-star ratings and the favourable reviews he has earned on his online profile, which – alongside the use of Google ads to reach new customers – have helped him grow his business exactly how he wants. Like word of mouth, in digital form.Four years on, Lingard can afford to be choosier. He specialises in “all the little jobs” that people often can’t find someone to do or don’t have time for themselves, focusing on quality, not quantity, “like bits of tiling or installing kitchen splashbacks, putting up picture hooks or fitting doorbells”.It’s here that promoting himself through Google tools has really paid off, taking on greater importance in recent months. Lingard had already taken to using Google ads, using keyword research to help find out what prospective clients were searching for online in and around Guildford – for instance, jet-washing a patio during the summer months – and then advertising those specific skills. This ability to be flexible and fleet of foot has had a significant impact on his business – “It’s quick, effective and direct,” he says – but really came into its own following the lockdown, when he was able to swiftly angle his remit as a “contactless service” in order to address customer fears around social distancing.Meanwhile, his Google My Business profile has helped him to keep existing customers updated with his working hours, while the review rating builds his reputation and earns trust with new ones. Lingard says Google also enables him to concentrate on the job at hand rather than tying himself up fielding calls asking what jobs he can do – the photos on Google My Business help showcase this to prospective customers. Even with the unpredictability of the future, given the pandemic, there is significant potential for tradespeople like Lingard to grow their businesses as households contend with the crisis. Homeowners have had more time to contemplate their surroundings, while a growing number of the UK workforce expect a permanent change to their company’s approach to flexible working post-lockdown. It means many homes and gardens will require improvements. Lingard’s Google profile, for example, flags up his skills at assembling flatpack office furniture.At a time when the wider job market looks uncertain, Lingard reveals that he is booked up six weeks in advance. “In a time of social upheaval and economic downturn such as this, demand for my services could have dwindled to nothing, but I’ve even been able to turn work away,” he says. “Google My Business has been central to me weathering the storm and future-proofing myself.”To find out how Google can help your business adapt, visit: g.cosmallbusiness"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b473ddf12486a48df79edc79336b9da1ddb50475/0_0_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6c64d254b4a65ad0ee81b15a92a6965c","title":"we realised we were a necessity how a high street baker used google to keep serving his community","story":"For Sam Mensah of London bakery Uncle John’s, the right digital ingredients equipped his business to rise to the challenge during lockdownThe bright yellow signage of Uncle John’s Bakery stands out like a beacon on West Green Road, in the north London suburb of Tottenham. Famed for its lovingly made Ghanaian sweet bread and other regional specialties such as drop doughnuts and meat pies, the bakery has served London’s African-Caribbean and wider community for 25 years.Sam Mensah took over the family business in 2015. “When my parents came to Britain in 1982, they had nothing behind them education-wise, but they were ready to seize the opportunities life in the UK could provide,” he recounts.“They longed for the comfort of Ghanaian sweet bread, but the available imports were stale on arrival. So they started baking their own, to a family recipe, using somebody else’s bakery after midnight. Soon they started selling it by word of mouth. Then they had it packaged, placing it in Ghanaian shops. Eventually they built up enough momentum to open a shop of their own.“It wasn’t always easy, but whenever things looked bleak, my mum reminded my dad of a Ghanaian motto: obeyeyie – things will get better. I think – and especially now, when people might feel like they need to give up on things – you have to have resilience.”Resilience and persistence is clearly baked into the family DNA, as Mensah too proved when he set aside a successful music career to take over running Uncle John’s from his ageing parents. Tackling a steep learning curve, he not only added two new production units and gained the certifications needed to be able to supply supermarkets, but also comprehensively rebranded the store and built up a digital and social media presence.And as the UK went into lockdown in March, it was this spirit of resilience that made all the difference. Mensah says he did have a moment of panic: “We closed the store for a couple of days. Then we realised the wholesale side was moving fast and that we were a necessity – that people will buy our bread. So we reopened, putting measures in place to protect our staff, and publicised our new opening times on social channels, and above all, on Google My Business.”Using Google My Business – a free tool for businesses to manage their online presence across Google, including updating opening times on Search and Maps - meant customers could not only see the bakery’s new hours of business, but also that online ordering was available, either for pickup, or for delivery within an eight-mile radius. Uncle John’s also delivered flour – a hot commodity at the peak of the lockdown.If luck is when preparedness and opportunity meet, Mensah had the perfect package at just the right time: an optimised website with Google Maps integration, a strong social media presence, and an informative Google My Business profile. Positive Google reviews further buttressed his credibility, reassuring first-time customers. With all the pieces coming together, what could have been a crisis became a springboard for further growth.Mensah is clear what a lifeline it has proved to be: “With Google My Business, we have been able to communicate our business’ adaptations during this current pandemic, and helped bridge the gap between our business and consumers by keeping customers informed. And in turn, through reviews, we are able to understand what the customer wants and adjust accordingly.”And the effects go well beyond his premises Mensah was also able to publicise his NHS initiative – priority service and free loaves for NHS staff. “Serving our community at this time is more important than ever,” he says. “We’ve given out more than 2,000 loaves so far.”In fact, this community ethos was what drove Mensah to take over the family business in the first place: “What really helped me make that decision was having a daughter of my own. I wanted her to see what legacy is about. I felt that this business was something very important within the community, and for the generation that comes after me.”For Mensah, the way forward is now clearer than ever. “Our goal is to stand our ground among all British companies, not just black businesses,” he says. “And it’s no longer just for us. It’s for all the people who are placing their trust in us.”To find out how Google can help your business adapt, visit: g.cosmallbusiness"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a371e11d8c0194b16ba2ad85052f592fafd61558/0_0_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4e65dd308a467c45f3bb10e9faf011db","title":"we sold the most books ever in a month how an inclusive bookseller adapted during lockdown","story":"Lynsey Pollard’s family-run business champions ersity in children’s books. Using Google tools helped Little Box of Books become a bestsellerLynsey Pollard picks up her phone from the kitchen table and pans the camera around to reveal dozens of boxes stacked through the living room behind her. “There’s another bookcase full downstairs and some in the hallway,” she says. “You should have seen it two months ago you could barely move. We even had to store them under the bed.”It’s been a hectic three months for the director of Little Box of Books, a subscription service for children’s books she runs with her partner Neil Langston from their London flat. In mid-March, just before the coronavirus lockdown, they took the risk of ordering a three-month supply of books instead of the normal one-month’s supply.“We had no idea how business would go, how our suppliers would manage or if they’d even exist afterwards,” Pollard says. “We wondered what would happen if one of us got sick. Neil also runs an IT consultancy and we’ve got an 18-month-old and a six-year-old to look after. For a two-person business, it was quite intimidating.”Pollard credits Google tools for the surge. “Google My Business has helped us to help our customers,” she explains. “We could let them know we were still open for business and fully stocked up. It is amazing to have a versatile and visible storefront apart from the website that drives traffic to our products, helping people to find us and trust us.”For Pollard and Langston, who founded the company in 2018 with the aim of bringing greater ersity to kids’ bookshelves at home and in school, this enhanced ability to create awareness of their product and capitalise on it is central to not just their business, but to their mission.Pollard, who previously worked in charity communications, had the idea during a period as a single mum to her eldest son. “I just didn’t see our family in any of the stories I was reading to him.” Now, each month, after scouring scores of publishing lists, she sends customers hand-wrapped books and other learning resources that include characters with different racial backgrounds, disabilities, step-parents, single parents, two mums, two dads and anything else that more accurately reflects the society we live in.Pollard and Langston hadn’t even finished testing their website, but she soon found herself on Sky News discussing the study and her new business. To make the most of the media exposure at the time, Pollard started using Google ads so her website would appear when people searched for more erse books. “It helped bring us our first customers who weren’t friends or family,” says Pollard. “That was such a great feeling, to know that people wanted to buy our product.”“We thought books and learning resources that would transport them outside of their family bubble during this time could be important,” says Pollard. “So we created ads to reference that, and help more people to find us.”Pollard says Google tools have enabled their business to reach an entirely new audience in recent months. “They have brought hundreds of people to us who may not have realised that most children’s books don’t accurately reflect the world we live in today. I love that it’s why we set up the company. I’ll continue to update my Google My Business as another place where people can find our business.”There’s a social element to all that Pollard and Langston do. For every box purchased, they send one to London-based child literacy charity Doorstep Library. And since March, each new order has received a stamped envelope addressed to a care home resident, so children can write letters or draw pictures for older people who are isolated.When we speak, anti-racism protests have spread from the US to the UK, further highlighting the need for greater ersity on children’s bookshelves. Pollard is already noticing the impact on her business. “People want to do better for their kids. Sometimes they just need a little help. We’d love it if all children could see themselves in stories. Then instead of talking about ‘erse books’, we could just talk about ‘books’.”To find out how Google can help your business adapt, visit: g.cosmallbusiness"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c51ef8835173f35e9907276295356a0df696b553/0_181_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5476b03b91e716cdf4f762c0ed8a8a87","title":"gym england reopening date coronavirus expected imminently","story":"Announcement also expected on nail bars as Northern Ireland gyms prepare to reopenThe government is to allow gyms in England to start reopening this month, it is understood, following intense lobbying from the fitness sector and MPs over why they had to remain closed when restaurants and bars could admit customers.It is expected that the culture, media and sport secretary, Oliver Dowden, will set out plans formally later on Thursday, with the expectation of reopening soon, if gyms are able to maintain social distancing and other coronavirus hygiene measures.Dowden is to host a Downing Street press conference at 5pm, No 10 said on Thursday. The formerly-daily coronavirus briefings are now only held when a minister has a particular update to announce.Dowden is expected to confirm a date for the reopening of gyms, which government sources suggested would be before the end of July.The culture secretary is also expected to announce the date when some other sectors left out of the 4 July easements, such as nail bars, can open their doors. There was, however, no immediate clarity on the position for swimming pools, which have also not yet been allowed to reopen.Asked by the Conservative MP Jason McCartney at departmental questions on Thursday morning about the guidance for gyms, Dowden said news would come soon.Gyms had “engaged very constructively” with the issue of how they could reopen safely, Dowden said, adding: “I hope to be able to make an announcement imminently in relation to that. And as I have said previously, the aim has always been to get gyms back by mid-July.”The fitness sector expressed disappointment after it was left out of the loosening of restrictions which came into effect last weekend, which allowed pubs, restaurants and bars to reopen if they adhered to public health guidelines.At the time, the chief executive of PureGym, the UK’s biggest gym chain, said the decision seemed odd in the light of Boris Johnson’s stated intention to improve the UK’s health after the Covid-19 crisis.“It is a strange war on obesity that sees pubs and restaurants open before gyms,” Humphrey Cobbold said.Gyms in Northern Ireland are set to become the first in the UK to reopen following lockdown. The Stormont executive has directed that leisure centres and gyms may reopen from Friday.Better Leisure, which operates 15 municipal leisure facilities on behalf of Belfast city council, will have a gradual reopening over the coming days.

And how effective are the disposable ones? The expert guide to choosing, wearing and caring for your face coveringPerhaps one of the problems has been the changing advice as new evidence emerges. The World Health Organization (WHO) now recommends people wear cloth masks. Ramakrishnan said that in the UK, “the message has not been clear enough, so perhaps people do not really understand the benefits or are not convinced”. It also doesn’t help that the guidance across the UK is different.In England, it is mandatory to wear a mask on public transport and in hospitals, for visitors and outpatients. From Friday, masks will be mandatory on public transport in Northern Ireland, and Scotland is also extending that to shops this week. In Wales masks are recommended, though not obligatory, on public transport.A mask, says Martin McKee, a professor of European public health at the London School of Hygiene \u0026amp Tropical Medicine, is a “means of reducing the propensity of someone who has got Covid-19 to spread it to others. We’re not talking about protecting yourself by wearing one, but about reducing the risk to other people.” Wearing a mask is just one measure, along with handwashing and social distancing, to try to contain Covid-19, and seems particularly useful for stopping people who have unwittingly contracted the virus, but who are not showing symptoms, from spreading (if you do have symptoms, you should be self-isolating, not going out wearing a mask). “What you’re doing,” McKee says, “is catching all the little droplets that are coming out of your mouth before they can get into the atmosphere, when they can dry out and become very small and float around as an aerosol. There is still stuff that is going to get out, but you are reducing that risk.”With so many of us still coming to terms with this “new normal”, we asked McKee and other experts to answer some common questions.“Indoors,” says McKee. “The risk of transmitting the virus outside is low. The risk is indoors, in crowded situations, where the air is not being filtered out, and particularly where people are speaking loudly, shouting or singing.” People should wear them at the supermarket and while out shopping, says Maitreyi Shivkumar, a virologist and lecturer in molecular biology at De Montfort University, and anywhere you’re “likely to come into closer contact with people you can’t really get away from”. Do you need to wear one while exercising outdoors? McKee says not, but Shivkumar says possibly. “I’ve seen pictures of lots of people running alongside the Thames in London, and in that scenario I would suggest you wear one. Outdoors, if you’re staying away from people, it’s fine, but in large crowds you should wear one.”The one that may provide maximum protection for the wearer, says Shivkumar, is a FFP3 respirator (a disposable shaped mask with a valve that filters air) “but we know that the production of them is more difficult and healthcare workers are not getting access to them, so it is important to reserve those for frontline workers who come into contact with Covid-19 patients”. And anyway, masks with valves – found on dust masks and antipollution cycling masks, for instance – are not thought to be effective at stopping the spread of Covid-19. A study by researchers at the University of Edinburgh into different mask types found that the valves improved breathability for the wearer, but would not stop infectious matter being breathed out. “For the public, cloth masks are fine,” says Shivkumar. “There’s not a lot of data on the efficacy of cloth masks but they’re better than nothing.”Jeremy Howard, a data scientist and cofounder of the campaigning organisation Masks4All, says you should really only wear one once. “They’re not designed to be worn more than once or cleaned,” he says.“They’re not a great choice to use at all,” he adds. “Disposable masks are generally surgical masks: they’re designed to protect from all the stuff that might be coming out of the surgeon’s face during surgery. They have to do so many things that they’re not perfect at any of them. A cloth mask, on the other hand, can have a better fit and more absorbent materials, and can be reused as many times as you like. It really is a better approach.”Some disposable masks come with an expiry date. If you’re planning to wear one for everyday use, is this something to worry about? “Do you want the official answer?” says McKee with a laugh. “I’d have to say yes.” But in reality, he goes on to say, as long as you’re using the mask to nip to the chemists on the bus, rather than caring for Covid-19 patients in hospital, “the risk of using ones past their expiry date, providing they actually look physically all right, is probably fine for this sort of circumstance”.You can buy lots of ready-made cloth masks now, but there are also tutorials online showing you how to make your own. “Nearly any kind of face-covering is effective at blocking droplets coming out of your mouth,” says Howard. “Shortly after they come out of your mouth, they evaporate and become much harder to block, which means it is more difficult for masks to block droplets coming into your mouth.” There isn’t good evidence that wearing a mask will prevent you from getting (as opposed to spreading) Covid-19.Any kind of tightly woven fabric is a good choice, says Shivkumar. “The more tightly woven, the better.” Howard recommends using cotton of 600-thread-count (if you can find this out – it’s the number of threads an inch). “Things such as high-quality bedsheets, for example. Generally, a better-quality cotton is going to have a higher thread count.” The WHO advises a combination of fabrics, with an inner layer of absorbent fabric (to contain the droplets) and a more waterproof outer layer, such as polyester.No, although, says Howard, “it’s better than nothing”. The fabric may be too thin or, if it’s a chunkier scarf, it can be difficult to get several comfortable layers out of it. “There was some data suggesting that bandanas and scarves are not very good because the fabric has a lot of holes in it,” says Shivkumar.The WHO advises a minimum of three, although four layers can be up to seven times more effective than a single bit of fabric. The problem, says Howard, is “you don’t want to go overboard because it reduces breathability”. He suggests two layers of cloth with a filter inserted between them this should be of a different material, such as a piece of paper towel or silk (Shivkumar has heard of people using coffee filters). “I use a piece of paper towel – I’ve got a little pocket for it in my mask,” says Howard. “When I come home after going out, I dispose of that, and put in a new one.”According to the University of Edinburgh study, masks need to have a tight fit to be really effective, though this needs to be balanced with wearability (a looser mask is better than no mask). It needs to be fairly snug to block droplets coming out of your mouth, and even though it has not been proven that a cloth mask (rather than personal protective equipment) protects the wearer from Covid-19, this may change. There is “some evidence that masks might directly benefit the wearer”, according to Paul Edelstein, emeritus professor of pathology and laboratory medicine at the University of Pennsylvania and one of the authors of a new report for the Royal Society.There are three places to check for fit, says Howard. The first is around your nose. “It’s a good idea to use something with a mouldable nosepiece. If your mask doesn’t have one, you can get a paperclip, a pipe cleaner or even just a piece of aluminium foil that you can roll up, attach to the top of your mask and mould to your face.” It should be snug around your chin, and fit well over your cheeks. “This is where cloth masks can be quite a lot better than surgical masks,” says Howard. “You can get or make a cloth mask that goes further, closer to your ears, and then tie it up around the back of your head. Surgical masks tend not to be as wide.”“Before you put the mask on, wash your hands,” says Shivkumar. “Only touch the straps try to avoid touching the mask area.” Howard is a bit more relaxed: “Surface transmission through cloth is pretty much unheard of for Covid-19. Officially, the medical advice is to take it off from the straps rather than the front, and you may as well do that because it’s easier.”Even if the chance of picking up an infection from your mask is low, you’ll want to keep it as clean as possible – wearing a dirty face-covering isn’t going to be particularly pleasant. “Put it in maybe a Ziploc bag that keeps it away from everything else – that’s what I tend to do,” says Shivkumar. “It’s going to be fine if you put it in your bag and it’s wrapped in a scarf or something.”Howard thinks that, for most of us, one mask a day should be sufficient. “If you’re doing extremely hot work and getting super-sweaty, you should probably change it if it gets very wet,” he says.It also depends on the material – a thin mask, or scarf, will become damp quickly. “Once it becomes damp, it’s not going to be as effective,” says Shivkumar. “But I’m hoping people are going to continue to be sensible and not spend hours together in a situation where they would have to wear masks.” McKee questions whether a damp mask is going to be less effective, but he adds it can cause other problems, such as skin irritation. “You wouldn’t want to be wearing a damp mask.”Treat your face mask “the same way as you treat your socks or underpants”, says Howard – as long as you’re the sort of person who only gets one wear out of their pants before washing. “It’s good to have a spare mask so you can have one being washed and wear the other one the next day.”Howard says you can – as long as the masks have been washed thoroughly.“In our house, we present wearing a mask as something that’s fun and exciting,” says Howard. “We let our daughter pick out which colour she wants.” Explain to your child why masks are a good idea. “We talked about how coronavirus is a disease that can make people sick, and we could even make her grandmother sick if we weren’t wearing a mask.” Make sure you have a mask that is child-sized and as comfortable as possible, “and particularly think about breathability”. In England, the government has said that children under the age of three should not wear a mask, but it is under five for those in Scotland. In England, children under the age of 11 are exempt from mandatory masks in Northern Ireland, it will be children under 13. As with adults, children with breathing difficulties, disabilities or who are unable to put on or take a mask off unassisted are exempt.If you are sitting indoors, should you wear a mask to order from the waiter and then take it off to eat? “I can’t see how this would work,” says Shivkumar. “The thing to remember with masks is: it’s not everything – it is important along with washing your hands, not touching your face and social distancing. It’s part of the bigger picture.”“If it’s a well-aired house, it’s maybe not necessary, but I would say generally if you’re indoors, stay 2 metres away and wear a mask, and that will reduce the risk,” says Shivkumar. “It’s about recognising the risks and working towards reducing them.” It depends on the situation, says McKee. “This is a continuum – trying to reduce it to a yes or no is problematic. If you’re going to be close to them, if you’re going to be there for a long period of time and it’s a very confined space, then you’re moving towards a point where you may think about wearing a mask. If you’re not going to be close to them, or if it’s a large room, then you’re towards the end of not needing to wear one.”As well as younger children (see above), there are exemptions for some people with health conditions or disabilities and people who assist them. For example, if you are travelling with someone who relies on lip-reading, you are not required to wear a mask. “There may be people for whom it may be very difficult,” says McKee. Asthma UK advises people with asthma to try a few different face coverings to see if they can find one that works for them. “We need to think about people who lip-read,” says McKee. “There are transparent masks that may help, but we have to recognise it is going to be a problem. And it may be an issue for people with learning disabilities.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7bceb476ebed5a1928aa80f006635c373fe6cba4/138_259_3362_2017/master/3362.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3deed6838f8214cf95d4aee13836dd2b","title":"bbc to end free tv licences for most over 75s","story":"Licences for over-75s will be means tested from next month, corporation has announcedThe BBC’s decision to end free TV licences for most over-75s, after a two-month delay because of the coronavirus outbreak, has sparked a row with the government.Ministers urged the broadcaster to reconsider what Downing Street described as “the wrong decision”. But the BBC pointed out it was the government that decided to stop paying for the benefit, and Labour and the charity Age UK accused the government of betraying pensioners and trying to shift the blame on to the broadcaster.The BBC’s chairman, Sir David Clementi, said it could no longer afford to waive the £157.50 annual fee for all over-75s without programmes and channels being cut. From 1 August, free licences will only be available to those on pension credit, he said.The BBC had set out plans to means test the free licence for over-75s from June, but this was delayed because of the coronavirus crisis, at an estimated cost of £35m per month.Clementi, said: “The decision to commence the new scheme in August has not been easy. The BBC could not continue delaying the scheme without impacting on programmes and services.“Around 1.5 million households could get free TV licences if someone is over 75 and receives pension credit, and 450,000 of them have already applied. And critically, it is not the BBC making that judgment about poverty. It is the government who sets and controls that measure.”He also pointed out the challenging financial environment the BBC faced.Clementi said: “Like most organisations, the BBC is under severe financial pressure due to the pandemic, yet we have continued to put the public first in all our decisions. I believe continuing to fund some free TV licences is the fairest decision for the public, as we will be supporting the poorest, oldest pensioners without impacting the programmes and services that all audiences love.”The digital minister, Matt Warman, challenged the BBC over the move. Speaking in the Commons, he said: “The BBC has had a generous licence fee settlement and it is deeply disappointing that they have chosen to go down the path that they apparently are going down. I would hope that there is yet time to reconsider that because … television has been a vital comfort for many people in the last few months and it is a vital part of our national economy as well.”Boris Johnson’s spokesman said: “This is the wrong decision. We recognise the value of free TV licences for over-75s, and believe that they should be funded by the BBC.”The spokesman declined to say whether the government would take any action to change the BBC’s action, saying only that No 10 disagreed with it.The Conservative chair of parliament’s culture committee, Julian Knight, also criticised the BBC over the decision, describing it as “body blow” to millions of British pensioners.He added: “I had hoped that the previous delay announced wold lead to the government and BBC coming together in order to thrash out a fresh deal. However, that has clearly not happened.The BBC agreed to take on responsibility for funding the scheme as part of the charter agreement hammered out with the government in 2015.The pandemic has cost the BBC more than £125m in lost revenues and new costs. Funding free TV licences for all over-75s would have cost the BBC £745m by 2021-22, it said, which would have led to the closures of BBC Two, BBC Four, the BBC News channel, BBC Scotland channel and Radio 5 Live, as well as a “number of local radio stations”.The shadow culture secretary, Jo Stevens, said: “The refusal of the government to fund this vital service after promising to do so is nothing short of betrayal.“Many over-75s have spent months at home with TV providing an invaluable source of company during the pandemic. For the government to blame the BBC who are having to contend with huge cuts is simply passing the buck.”Caroline Abrahams, the charity director at Age UK, also blamed the government: “The BBC has taken this decision today but in reality the principal responsibility lies with the government. Until a previous administration transferred these free licences to the corporation under a tapering funding arrangement, they had taken the form of a welfare benefit for a generation, and to have done that without any consultation left a really bad taste in the mouth.“The government cannot absolve itself of responsibility for the upset and distress being caused to many of our over-75s today, the poorest and most isolated above all. And the sadness is that these older people have already endured so much over the last few months.“The government needs to sit down with the BBC urgently to keep these TV licences for over-75s free.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ff02d590a99ec550c9a855e442e3b1b2477a7dd2/0_215_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=652e3ea770674453653c8e44d9e9fcf9","title":"stamp duty chancellor rishi sunak summer statement","story":"Rishi Sunak has announced a stamp duty holiday in his summer statement. How will this affect you?The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, has announced there will be no stamp duty to pay on property purchases up to £500,000.Stamp duty land tax, its proper name, is a tax paid by someone who purchases a property or piece of land in England or Northern Ireland – Scotland and Wales have their own systems. The tax is paid when the sale is completed and is based on the sum paid.Prior to the financial statement, there were two different points at which stamp duty was payable, depending on whether you were a first-time buyer or a mover. For movers, stamp duty had to be paid on any property costing more than £125,000.For first-time buyers there was no stamp duty to pay unless a property cost more than £300,000. If your first home cost more than £500,000 you paid the same as a mover but if it cost less than that, you only paid tax on the part of the price that fell between £300,000 and £500,000.The cut will make a difference for anyone buying a property over the old thresholds. For first-time buyers, it will generally be those in the south-east and London who stand to benefit, as elsewhere they would typically not be spending more than £300,000.The saving could allow people to move more quickly than planned – instead of needing the money for tax they can now channel it towards their deposit. The tax is paid after a sale is completed, so anyone who is part-way through buying a property will benefit.At £250,000, a first-time buyer was already off the hook for stamp duty but a mover would pay £2,500. They will now pay nothing.An investor spending £250,000 on a property will save £2,500, while one spending £495,000 will save £14,750.The housing market was frozen during lockdown, with buyers and sellers told to stall purchases. Since estate agents reopened there are signs that people are looking again – property websites and mortgage lenders have all reported jumps in interest from prospective buyers but the Treasury is obviously worried that the rebound will be fleeting.While some people are not moving because of immediate financial problems that will be solved by the cut, there will be many others who are staying put because they have lost their jobs, or are concerned about the outlook for the industry they work in. The cut may bring forward purchases but it may not stimulate many extra ones.Previous holidays have focused on first-time buyers and do not seem to have led to a surge in sales. The chancellor mentioned that prices had fallen since the crisis and talked about taking away uncertainty for people, so the move seems designed to support values. Some of the money saved by buyers could go towards their offer for a property and lead to increases in parts of the country where the market is busy. The fact that landlords and investors will also get a tax cut will make this more likely than if it had only applied to homebuyers.Typically, the largest increases come in the run-up to a stamp duty holiday ending, when people are keen to take advantage of the tax break while it lasts, so we could see a bubble next spring.On all purchases there is a surcharge if it is a second home."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ba1ff33a014ac5f1ba450c4a05d1fcab013bd9ab/0_63_5500_3302/master/5500.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=d821d7f7c970558f7a0aa331fd63412f","title":"stormzy black lives matter","story":"Rapper talks to the BBC about the ‘hundreds, thousands of years of real pain’ suffered by black peopleThe Black Lives Matter movement represents “hundreds, thousands of years” of “real pain”, Stormzy has told the BBC.In a short video feature in which the rapper surprised a young fan by painting his bedroom in recognition of his positive behaviour at school, Stormzy said he wanted the movement to “show what it means to be black”.Addressing criticisms of the protests and the response that “all lives matter”, he said: “If we weren’t oppressed, we wouldn’t be shouting, we would just be living our lives.”He continued: “I want you to understand that we’re not just crying or just shouting, acting like only black lives matter: that this is a real pain.

It’s partly imaginary but I have been to a specific place in Jamaica like this, with a secluded river you could cross by stones, and drooping trees. It wouldn’t be a festival for tens of thousands – maybe one or two thousand people, so not Glastonbury-sized. More like a retreat.Since we’re in Jamaica, it has to be a Jamaican artist and I don’t see many women headlining festivals. That’s getting better, but I’d want to champion a female artist. Koffee would be my headliner. I’ve seen her performing with Chronixx in Birmingham and she’s a young reggae artist making waves and doing great stuff. I’d love to see her on her home soil and Jamaicans love Jamaicans, so she’d definitely get the crowd going.I like the idea of having a mix of music and poetry and comedy and different things. I visualise a comedian presenter, maybe Judi Love, who has also got a Caribbean background, and the poet Anthony Anaxagorou. The music would explore all aspects. Yola would bring a country-soul vibe to warm things up in an intimate, singer-songwriter-y way. Moses Boyd is my dear friend and we’ve discussed going to Jamaica many times, but I don’t think he has yet, so I’d love to treat him. He’d bring that eclectic UK vibe with elements of electronic, grime and jazz.Mayra Andrade is a Cape Verdean artist based in Portugal.

She’s often on at festivals on a different day to me, so I always miss her, but if she played at my festival I’d finally get to see her. Then the afterparty DJ would be Louie Vega, taking us into midnight with Latin grooves.I’d like sound healing sessions with Tibetan singing bowls or gongs. People would lie down on a yoga mat and people would play different instruments, and the vibration of the sound affects the body and the mind, the mood and the emotions.

In fact it relegates them to second class citizens, without the investment and the opportunities to improve their life chances.”“That’s why this autumn I will be publishing a white paper that will set out our plans to build a world-class, German-style further education system in Britain, and level up skills and opportunities.”Although details of any additional funding will have to wait, Williamson admitted: “For decades, we have failed to give further education the investment it deserves.”Jo Grady, general secretary of the University and College Union, said further education had been particularly hard-hit under the Conservative government’s austerity programme.“Further education is in dire need of funding, but that is because the Conservative governments of the last decade have decimated it,” Grady said.“The government should be encouraging people to attend all forms of education, not picking artificial winners in a market it has created, nor denigrating university education at a time when the sector desperately needs support.”Williamson’s announcement comes at a time of considerable danger for the higher education sector, which faces losing billions on pounds from the coronavirus outbreak and its aftermath.This week the Institute for Fiscal Studies warned that 10 universities in England and three elsewhere in the UK were threatened by severe financial difficulties, with the whole sector to be hit by losses of £3bn to £19bn next year."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/720a44b4460c89249f9f5aef4e3cad692b9a5030/0_265_4000_2401/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7384b67b25513c4aa019bfcfd18a6c74","title":"uk renters tell us about the impact coronavirus has had on you","story":"We’d like to hear from renters in the UK about how the coronavirus pandemic has impacted your housing situationWith unemployment rising sharply, and rental prices continuing to increase, we’d like to hear from renters about the impact the coronavirus pandemic has had on them, and what the future holds.How has coronavirus impacted your rental contract, ability to pay rent, or relationship with your landlord?

Late on Wednesday evening, just hours before round one was due to get under way, Frittelli, McCarthy and Watney were removed from their existing tee groupings and placed together.In a statement, the Tour confirmed: “Dylan Frittelli, Denny McCarthy and Nick Watney will follow the symptom-based model, as they have continued to return positive tests but meet the CDC guidelines for return to work.“The Tour’s medical advisers and the CDC have indicated that PCR tests have shown a possibility of detecting viral RNA even after the infectious virus is no longer present. This would potentially become a persistent positive test result, despite the inidual not being contagious.“Out of an abundance of caution, however, any player or caddie who meets the above criteria but continues to return a positive Covid-19 test will either compete as a single in competition or be grouped with players under the same situation, and he will also have no access to indoor facilities on site.”Watney became the first player after the PGA Tour’s resumption to test positive for coronavirus, before the second round of the RBC Heritage on 19 June. McCarthy withdrew from the Travelers Championship a week later. Frittelli tested positive before looking to fly to last week’s Rocket Mortgage Classic. “I am experiencing no issues and feel great physically and was surprised and disappointed to learn of the positive test,” the South African said at the time.Further explanation by the Tour of its updated criteria states: “Cases in which a player or caddie tested positive and continues to test positive, the Tour follows a symptom-based model, as outlined by the CDC, allowing for him to return to competition if: at least three days have passed since recovery, which is defined as resolution of fever without the use of fever-reducing medications and improvement in respiratory symptoms and, at least 10 days have passed since symptoms first appeared.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d0a513b798336413285b61a2f8d9bcbb406c327f/183_172_4848_2908/master/4848.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8b94f35fa35447d58c99255aba801848","title":"why chris froome and team ineos parting of the ways cycling","story":"Dave Brailsford’s team had too many leaders for his liking so he has swept sentiment aside, as he did with Bradley WigginsTo understand how it is that six weeks before Chris Froome might have been starting out on his quest for a fifth Tour de France he is contemplating his imminent departure from his team of 10 years, you have only to consider two of Sir Dave Brailsford’s favourite catch phrases. Mission clarity. Compassionate ruthlessness.The unhappy 2012 Tour when Bradley Wiggins and Froome failed to gel perfectly taught Brailsford about mission clarity: make sure your leaders know the hierarchy and be certain they will stick to it. The emergence of a young, thrusting talent in the 2019 Tour winner, Egan Bernal, alongside two former winners in Froome and Geraint Thomas would be a nightmare to handle in ideal circumstances. Achieving clarity while racing the Tour with two leaders is bad enough, but three would be a very crowded marriage.When the one of the three with the strongest record is also trying to construct a comeback from a career threatening injury, as Froome is, the nightmare is compounded. Someone had to go, and Froome was always going to be the one. From his perspective there is another factor: the untimely death of SkyIneos director sportive Nicolas Portal this spring, which robbed him of his staunchest ally within the team.History makes it plain how Brailsford and Froome can part company. In 2013, when Froome was the thrusting Tour contender, and Wiggins was trying to figure out what to do with the rest of his life, Brailsford had little hesitation in throwing sentiment aside, ditching a rider he had worked with since his career started, and going with Froome. A lesser man might have backed Sir Brad, but Sir Dave had the clarity of mind, the nerve and the cold-bloodedness to go with Froome. Given the results the pair have achieved since then, it was clearly the right move. Compassionate ruthlessness: wield the knife but in the front not the back and do it with a kind smile while saying the right things.The split raises obvious questions. First, what will Froome’s programme be for the end of the season? Will Ineos dare put their former leader in the Tour de France? Froome will be desperate to ride but why would Brailsford want to risk disrupting the balance of his team? And how would Froome react if told politely that he can have his head in the Giro or the Vuelta, albeit not with the same level of team support?How will Froome deal with transferring to his new team for 2021 and can he return to his former level? Whatever the training numbers, the only way of seeing if he can come back after his horrific accident of last year to what he was from 2015-18 is for him to ride a Grand Tour in anger. So to that extent, it might be the best solution for him to return in the Giro or the Vuelta, away from the hot-house of the Tour de France and away from the constant questions about who is leader.Whether Israel Start-Up Nation can offer him the same level of support as Ineos is a simpler one: they can’t, until 2022 at the earliest. By 2013 when Froome won his first Tour, Team Sky had two successful Grand Tour-focused seasons behind them, winning both the 2011 Vuelta and the 2012 Tour. By 2017-18 when he achieved the grand slam of Tour, Vuelta and Giro on the trot Team Sky were the best Grand Tour team, at least since Miguel Indurain’s Banesto.Even if budget is not a factor a machine of that quality is not constructed overnight putting the parts in place takes time, and getting them to work in harmony takes longer. ISN have not even begun to shop around beyond their leader, and there is no chance of them buying the team riders they need before the end of 2021. Next year, Froome will have to cope without the multiple support riders in the mountains that Team Sky bought and developed over the years.He is a doughty competitor but even if he returns to his best – a considerable ask at 36 years of age, as he will be next year – he will be at a disadvantage faced with more seasoned units such as Ineos, Primoz Roglic’s Jumbo-Visma, and Thibaut Pinot’s FDJ. A leader of Froome’s quality will lift those around him, speeding up the development process, but it could be that ISN improve as his strength fades with age.When the history books are written, the relationship between Froome and Brailsford will be simple to sum up. This is not a sudden, acrimonious breakup when one party pushed the other too far, along the lines of Indurain’s sudden departure from Banesto in 1996. Indurain was their boy through and through and could not contemplate riding for any other team, hence his decision to retire rather than move.This partnership between Froome and Brailsford is more cold-blooded, a marriage of convenience between two equally hard-nosed and driven men, each with an eye for the main chance, and each of whom found considerable use for the other. As with Wiggins, when the end had to come, there will have been warm words but little sentiment and no tears in private."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b840bb547121bdb6f30b0a06b2a8f0f3ff3b4e80/290_0_4939_2963/master/4939.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=87abc56484e489663205d0e84d140af2","title":"dell xps 13 2020 review a fantastic but flawed laptop","story":"Latest top-of-the-line Dell is a brilliant machine with a great screen in a tiny body, but is let down badly by software problemsDell’s XPS 13 squeezes more screen, more power and even Windows Hello face recognition into a tiny frame, but trips up over software issues.The XPS 13 is Dell’s top-of-the-line compact laptop and starts at £1,349.

The 2020 XPS 13 has the biggest display yet, at 13.4in with a 16:10 ratio, and tiny bezels all the way around the edges.That means you get a relatively large display in the body of what would traditionally have been a laptop with just an 11in screen. And what a screen it is. The version tested had the 4K touchscreen option, which is crisper than practically anything else, super bright, colour accurate and all-round gorgeous. It supports HDR video, including Dolby Vision. Models are available with either touch or non-touch FHD+ screens too.The body of the laptop is made from aluminium, with your choice of black carbon fibre or white glass fibre on the laptop’s deck. It feels solid, sleek and unique. The wedge-shaped laptop weighs just 1.27kg and is only 14.8mm thick, with a smaller footprint than most of its competition.The new, slightly larger keyboard is great. Well spaced, stable, fairly quiet, with 1mm of key travel and good feedback when pressed. The large precision trackpad is responsive, with a tactile but muted click that hopefully shouldn’t annoy those around you.The XPS 13 ships with not one but two biometric systems for securely logging you into Windows without a password.The new design has a Windows Hello infrared face recognition camera squeezed into the bezel at the top of the screen and a fingerprint scanner built into the power button. That means you can either log in with a press of the power button or simply by looking at the screen when you open the lid. Both are fast, accurate and work brilliantly.The 2020 XPS 13 ships with your choice of 10th-generation Intel core chips. Most models have the Core i7 common to all top-spec computers, including the new MacBook Pro, Surface Laptop 3 and Huawei MateBook X Pro. The model tested for this review had a Core i7 processor, 16GB of RAM, 512GB of storage and a 4K screen.As such the XPS 13 has lots of power on tap, making it capable of just about anything, short of high-end gaming. Intel’s Iris Plus graphics are a step up from the previous HD integrated graphics, which you immediately notice when you start editing images on a 4K external screen.Used on battery the XPS 13 is nearly silent, with only low-level fans audible when pushed a little. Connect the machine to power and start doing demanding things and it will get a bit hot, with the fans going fairly strong. Even with fans at maximum, they’re not quite as loud as some competitors.The deck of the laptop doesn’t get overly warm, but you could feel some heat behind the R, T, Y, U and I keys. The vents on the bottom of the laptop are easily blocked by soft furnishings, meaning the machine really needs to be used on a hard table, desk or lap.The XPS 13 has two USB-CThunderbolt 3 ports, a headphones socket and a microSD card slot, which is very welcome. When one USB-C port is taken up by the charger, that only leaves one port for connecting accessories, such as a monitor, meaning you might need a dock or similar if using home-working tools.A Dell spokesperson said: “We’re investigating the issue and will update on our findings. We thank customers for sharing their experience on the Dell Community.”A full charge took 2.5 hours with the included 45W USB-C charger in optimised mode, but well under two if using Dell’s fast-charge setting with the laptop off.The XPS 13 is one of the most recyclable laptops you can buy, and is generally repairable. It is designed to enable repairs by authorised service personnel in the field, not just in a service centre, including replacement of the battery.An out-of-warranty screen repair costs £299.41, while a battery replacement costs £171.66. Dell also has an advanced power-management utility that can extend the useful life of a battery by altering when, how and how much it is charged, either automatically by learning from your usage and charging habits or manually via various profiles.Dell offers free recycling schemes, even for products from other brands, while its packaging is made from recycled materials. The firm has a number of sustainability and environmental impact schemes under way for 2030, including the recycling or reuse an equivalent product per purchase and use of recycled material. Dell publishes the carbon footprint of its products.The XPS 13 ships with a choice of Windows 10 Home or Pro, and it is one of the few laptops that can be bought with Linux instead of Windows, with Ubuntu 18.04 models.As tested with Window 10 Home, the XPS 13 ships with a lot of Dell utility apps, most of which are useful, such as the advanced Dell Power Manager. Many can be safely ignored or removed, but one particular utility for the included wifi chips caused no end of trouble.The Killer Networking utilities, which are advanced software components for the gaming wifi chip Dell chose to use here, prevented the machine from going to sleep when the lid was shut, which is a cardinal sin for a laptop as it can lead to it turning on in a bag and cooking itself.No update, clean install or troubleshooting could fix the sleeping issue. Disabling the Killer utilities with the manufacturer-provided tool was the only way to fix it. Killer Networking chips, made by Rivet Networks (recently acquired by Intel), are aimed at gamers and allow traffic prioritisation and other advanced features, but are notorious for causing these sorts of software problems, which makes it a puzzling inclusion in the XPS 13, which is by no means a gaming laptop.The Dell XPS 13 is a fantastic laptop held back by a few failures, most of which are issues traditionally associated with Dell and others.The design, build, look and physical function of the laptop is top-class. The 4K screen is simply gorgeous, with tiny bezels all around. At 13.4in on the diagonal with a 16:10 ratio, it has a surprisingly large amount of real estate for getting work done, while videos obviously look stunning. It really is a very large screen for such a small laptop.The keyboard and trackpad are great, and so is having Windows Hello in both an IR face recognition camera and a fingerprint sensor.There’s plenty of power on tap for doing everything you could want from a 13in laptop outside of gaming. Two Thunderbolt ports, a headphones socket and a microSD card slot are very welcome. It could do with one more USB-C or USB-A port, but not many machines have more than two USB-C ports these days. Battery life could also be better, but if you want it to last longer then buy the one without the 4K screen.The big issues are the fights I’ve had to have with the add-on Killer Networking utilities, which required disabling to get the laptop to sleep properly, and the bug in the BIOS update that crippled a few of my USB-C to HDMI adaptors. These are things that should not happen in a premium laptop costing this much.The Dell XPS 13 is a five-star laptop hampered by problems traditionally associated with Dell and other third-party manufacturers that give Windows computers a bad name, which is a real shame.Cons: short battery life, only two USB-CThunderbolt 3 ports, softwareBIOS issues, expensive, mics not great for video conferencing at a distance, speakers are shrill.

We stopped halfway, seeing a sign for a footpath to the lakes. Over a hill and after 40 minutes we came to a vast and beautiful hidden valley. In this natural bowl, horses, cows, sheep and goats were wandering, bells tinkling, a stream snaking through and a waterfall cascading down the far side of the valley. Behind us were snow-capped mountains. It was a scene of such Tolkien beauty that I half expected to see an elven princess on a unicorn. All of it empty and just for us.Colin BeesleyEvery week we ask our readers for recommendations from their travels. A selection of tips will be featured online and may appear in print. To enter the latest competition visit the readers\u0027 tips homepageEverything we ate bar one ingredient came from the valley we were sitting in – with the exception coming from the next valley. Spires of rock soared behind us to the cloudless sky and pristine water gurgled below us. We climbed on a winding path above the treeline and down to wide, stone-strewn river channels that showed the power of the ice melt in spring. There was no tarmac road so very few vehicles. Just nature, like an extant Eden. This is the village of Thethi in northern Albania.Andy ClarkThe hike from Positano to the top of Molare, the highest point on the Amalfi peninsula at 1,444 metres, is one of the best I’ve done in 30 years of walking. The views take in Vesuvius, the Bay of Naples and Capri, and you can even make out Pompeii if you know where to look. On a June day I met nobody, despite this being one of the most-visited areas in Italy.Garrett DundonThis Swedish-speaking autonomous region of Finland is a beautiful archipelago between the two countries. Fasta Åland, the main island, can be easily explored by cycling the network of quiet countryside roads (bikes can be hired, even with a buggy for your luggage). Stop off for dips at lakes and beaches, or sample produce from the famous apple orchards. Take in the red-and-white wooden houses, local dishes (especially the Åland pancake served with plum jam) and wildlife (including elk). You can fly there but it’s more fun to take a ferry from Sweden (Stockholm) or Finland (Turku or Helsinki).FranBovec is a wonderful small town that’s a base for a host of outdoor activities, including climbing Mount Kanin, cycling in the Soča valley and white-water rafting down the Soča River. The journey from Ljubljana involves a hair-raising trip up (and then back down) the 1,611-metre Vršič Pass. The town itself has enough restaurants and bars (including the Thirsty River microbrewery) to keep you occupied in the evenings after days of exertion. We stayed at Mrakic apartments, with charming host Vasja providing breakfast plus tips and guidance on where to go.Thom PiddockHidden above the pretty harbour of Vela Luka, on the island of Korčula on the Dalmatian coast, is an archeological site that dates back to the stone age. Climb 130 metres up Pinski Rat hill to Vela Spila cave. Step inside and be swallowed up by its magnificent 40-metre-wide oval cavern, where excavations have discovered human activity dating back almost 25,000 years. Head up to the mouth of the cave at sunset to soak up the colourful panoramic views back across the harbour and the sparkling waters of the Adriatic and islands beyond.Su OinnA sharp bend in the road and suddenly you are looking down at a breathtaking vista of the Atlantic Ocean beyond a sweeping bay fringed with mountains. Tiny multicoloured houses nestle in the centre of the view. This is Allihies, my mother-in-law’s village on the Beara peninsula, in the south-west corner of Ireland. The Beara Way hiking trail skirts the village but there are spectacular coastal walks along the smaller roads, too. In the hills behind the village, tracks lead to the ruins of copper mines. Watch dolphins, gannets, choughs and feral goats, and in the evenings listen to music in one of the three pubs. You’ll soon be talking to my friendly in-laws. JanetIt takes an hour to hike up Canigó mountain, and when you reach the point overlooking the monastery, you are surrounded by peaks as far as the eye can see. Everything is silent and peaceful and the only sound you can hear is birdsong – it’s an absolutely beautiful place. The monks are incredibly welcoming – and some of the most chilled people I have ever met!• Entry €4-€6, stmartinducanigou.orgOlivia Middleton"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/48f8cb347985fe249f3bf2fca02053e345aa0f32/0_49_1200_720/master/1200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5f24890e21cf7b0302467f910958bd22","title":"post lockdown camping its a taste of freedom","story":"On a first foray out of London, our writer kicks up her heels with a stay in a (freshly sanitised) yurt, boating on the Norfolk Broads – and drinks in several pubsWe arrived at our yurt and said hello to our next-door neighbour, who was stretched out on a deckchair. He replied with a grin and one word: “Freedom!”It was Saturday 4 July, the first day that campsites were allowed to open in England after lockdown. My partner and I had left our homes for the first time in nearly four months and driven to the Waveney River Centre in Norfolk, a campsite and marina, to find out what “the new normal” means for campers.We were greeted by a battalion of beaming staff, all happy to get the summer season going at last. The first of many hand-sanitiser points was outside reception, which had a one-in, one-out policy and social-distancing markers. Other than that, check-in proceeded as normal. We were staying in one of seven yurts, all fully booked for the weekend, as were the 14 caravan pitches and six camping pods. Only the 45 tent pitches had deliberately not all been filled, to keep numbers at a manageable level. (There are also 35 self-catering lodges on the site.)As is the case at many campsites, most of the facilities were open, but with some alterations. In the toilet block, alternating cubicles and sinks were taped up so people couldn’t get too close. Staff were stationed at the showers all day, ready to clean them after each use. The main shop was closed, but basic items had been moved to the ice-cream kiosk. The play area was open, but the indoor pool was sadly shut, as per (baffling) government guidance.Liam Holmes, Waveney’s general manager, said early feedback from guests had been positive, with people feeling particularly reassured by the visible extra cleaning.The campsite borders the River Waveney, and we were the first passengers on the newly reopened foot ferry. The service, which dates from the 19th century and was revived in 2012, originally carried south Norfolk villagers to Lowestoft fish market. These days, it takes visitors to Carlton Marshes nature reserve, just across the Suffolk border. We wandered around the marshes, meadows and pools, and spotted birds including a little egret and a marsh harrier. The wide-open space was a balm after so many weeks spent in my tiny London garden.Back at the campsite, we exercised another regained right and went to the pub. The Waveney Inn had a one-way system with separate entrance and exit, and we had to give our details for contact-tracing purposes. It was table-service only, with contactless payment for our Southwold bitter, fish and chips and ploughman’s salad. No one seem deterred by the new measures: the pub was full of families enjoying themselves.A cold wind had whipped up by bedtime, which gave us a good excuse to light the woodburner in our yurt. The yurt smelled freshly sanitised (the particular antiviral spray used is specified on the website) and was comfortable, with double bed, sofa and electric lamps guests bring their own bedding.The next day, we hired a day cruiser from the on-site marina to explored this section of the Broads. Several campers were doing the same – there was a queue for the boats. Again, social-distancing measures were in place, with customers fitting their own lifejackets and staff issuing instructions from the bank, rather than boarding boats.We went as far as Reedham, a riverside village about two-and-a-half hours away, for a pint at the Ship Inn, then stopped halfway back at the Bell Inn at St Olave’s for lunch (a generous seafood platter). Staff at both pubs were cheerful and welcoming, and the manager of the Bell – “Broadland’s oldest recorded inn” – thanked us for supporting them. After months of nothing more exciting than a daily walk, a day’s boating on the Broads seemed like a real adventure.Back at the marina, we handed the cruiser keys back and walked a few minutes up the lane to St Mary’s church, which has a thatched roof and a ziggurat-style tower. More substantial walks include one to Oulton Broad, via the foot ferry, and on to the sandy beach at Lowestoft. More beaches are a short drive away at Great Yarmouth and Southwold.We ended the day with a barbecue on the deck outside our yurt. By the time we were ready for bed, a low moon was hanging over the river and the sky was full of stars. Our neighbour was right – this was a taste of freedom, and it felt fantastic.• Accommodation was provided by Waveney River Centre, camping from £11 a night, yurts from £48 a night, waveneyrivercentre"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ad1c5057178da31a96b72c8675f71e44fbeb7d8c/0_368_2729_1637/master/2729.jpg?width=1200\u0026amp;height=630\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026amp;overlay-width=100p\u0026amp;overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026amp;s=db4b16f4b15783957105cd615b26f00a","title":"mama boko haram nigeria maiduguri","story":"Aisha Wakil knew many of Boko Haram’s fighters as children. Now she uses those ties to broker peace deals, mediate hostage negotiations and convince militants to put down their weapons – but as the violence escalates, her task is becoming impossible. By  Chika OduahIt was another scorching afternoon in Maiduguri. In the west of the city, in Nigeria’s north-east, 51-year-old Aisha Wakil sat in her office talking to a jihadi fighter named Usman. Wakil was draped head-to-toe in fine sequinned chiffon a niqab covered most of her face, leaving visible only her dark eyes. Ka’aji, a sweet, woody incense that Wakil kept burning in a corner, perfumed the room.Wakil and Usman kept their voices down. They were hashing out a secret plan to free a 16-year-old girl who was being held hostage by Boko Haram. It was May 2019, 10 years after the Islamist group had begun terrorising Nigeria as part of a jihad it was waging against the government. The violence, which had spilled into neighbouring countries, had left more than 30,000 people dead.Over the years, Boko Haram had become notorious for kidnapping women and girls. The most infamous instance came in 2014, when its fighters captured 276 schoolgirls from a secondary school in the remote village of Chibok. But there were abductions before Chibok, and dozens after. Some of those captured were forced to become suicide bombers, and Boko Haram has used more than 460 female suicide bombers, more than any other terrorist group in history. The teenage girl who Wakil and Usman were discussing was one of the group’s latest victims. For months, Wakil had been pleading with Boko Haram fighters to free her.With soldiers and local vigilantes trying to hunt them down, the group’s members had largely fled Maiduguri, the largest city in Borno state, and the other cities in the region. They set up camps tucked away in the arid bush land stretching across northern Nigeria, Cameroon, Chad and Niger. Some fighters went to live in hideouts in the vast former game reserve of Sambisa forest and on the remote islands dotting Lake Chad, where they kept thousands of hostages – women, girls, men and child soldiers forced to join their ranks.After annihilating villages, the fighters would slip back to their camps. Nigerian soldiers scrambled after them, but the army’s heavy vehicles would get stuck in the spiky shrubs and the soft, sandy ground of the Sambisa. They couldn’t venture far into Lake Chad’s swampy coast, especially during the rainy season. The insurgents were swift, cruising over the land in convoys of motorbikes, and then disappearing like smoke.Wakil was one of the few people outside Boko Haram who could reach its members. She was in touch with senior fighters and, in her office that day, she was using that access to negotiate freedom for the hostage. The girl was Christian, and in interviews with the local media, her parents had been asking the Nigerian government to rescue her. Wakil wanted her out safely. She believed Usman was the right person to get the job done. He was, after all, a Boko Haram militant – a mid-ranking one, who travelled between the bush and the city for special assignments.To get to Wakil’s office, Usman had to pass through the city without attracting attention. The streets were crawling with security personnel – soldiers, police officers, intelligence agents, volunteers from the Civilian Joint Task Force, a local paramilitary vigilante group. At the time, Boko Haram attacks were on the rise again and locals moved about with caution. So did Usman. With his frayed clothes, scratched-up hands and lean frame, he fit the physical profile of a Boko Haram fighter perfectly.Usman wanted to do some good. He had decided to cooperate with Wakil, relaying her messages to the mujahideen back in the camp. Their meeting ended on an optimistic note. It seemed possible that the hostage might be freed.Maiduguri is situated within what was the longest-standing kingdom in African history, a powerful pre-colonial Islamic state known as the Kanem-Bornu empire. Established by the ancestors of the modern-day Kanuri people, the empire lasted from the eighth to the 19th century. At one point, the empire’s territory stretched east from modern-day Nigeria through Chad, to Sudan and north to Libya. The empire’s kings – first known as mai, then later as shehu, a derivative of the Arabic title sheikh – were among the first monarchs to practice Islam in sub-Saharan Africa.For a long time, Maiduguri was regarded as the “home of peace”. Life there revolved around Islamic traditions: the call to prayer echoed from mosques. On Fridays, the streets were packed with people making their way to jum’ah prayer thousands of boys sat under trees, reciting verses from the Qur’an under their teachers’ gaze.From the Sahara Desert, cascades of sand blow into the city, covering the terrain in fine layers of dust. At midday, Maiduguri is blindingly hot. It has a particular kind of dry heat that prickles the skin. At night, the heat eases off a bit, giving way to breezes rising over the murky Ngadda River, rustling past neem trees scattered across the land.Wakil moved to the city in 1989, to enrol at the University of Maiduguri. Unlike many of her fellow students, she wasn’t a member of the indigenous Kanuri people – she was Igbo, an ethnic group whose ancestral land lies in the south-east of Nigeria. It was there that Wakil was born, in 1968, and where she grew up, as the country was trying to reconcile and rebuild in the aftermath of the civil war, which ended in 1970.Wakil came from an Igbo family of devout Roman Catholics and she, too, had been deeply devoted to the faith. It led her to God, she said, and throughout her youth she took to reading her Bible and praying for hours on end. It was not until the early 90s that she converted to Islam, after meeting the man she would marry, Alkali Gana Wakil. He was Kanuri and Muslim. “According to the tradition, the woman should follow the man’s religion. I did it to maintain that culture, for peace to reign in my matrimonial home,” Wakil told me.Her relatives back home in the south were deeply disappointed with her conversion, and the fact that she, a “southerner”, had gone off and married “a northerner”. She changed her name to one of the most revered in Islam, Aisha – after the favourite wife of Muhammad and “mother of the believers”. (Today, Wakil refuses to reveal her original Igbo and Christian names.) She and her husband moved into a quaint bungalow close to the most sacred place in Maiduguri – the Shehu’s palace and adjacent mosque complex.The first time I met Wakil, in 2018, she grinned and embraced me tenderly when I told her that I was also Igbo. “It’s like being with my sister,” she said, giggling, and lifted her niqab to let me see her face. Wakil had done her best to adopt Kanuri culture. She burned ka’aji. She took on local beauty customs, keeping her hands and fingers covered in lalle, a type of henna plant dye. She followed the local expectations of a Muslim wife, too, covering her head in a hijab whenever she stepped out of her home. When her husband started telling her that he did not like the way men were admiring her face, she began wearing the niqab to conceal it.Shortly after Wakil moved to her house in Maiduguri, she decided to start leaving her front door open. She was still fairly new to the city and wanted to be welcoming. Soon, poor Kanuri boys, about six or seven years old, began streaming in. Wakil let them play in her compound. Eventually, she would let them garden with her and pick fruit from her trees. Although she already had two of her own children at the time, she started calling these gangly neighbourhood boys her “sons”. In turn, the boys called her “mama”, and to show how much they appreciated her, they started inviting her to attend their circumcision ceremonies, which she ended up sponsoring as a way to help their families, who were struggling financially.The circumcision of a Muslim boy is a sacred rite in northern Nigeria. In Maiduguri, it usually takes place when boys are about seven. Wakil was there at her newfound sons’ circumcisions, holding their hands as they flinched under the blade. When the old men finished cutting, Wakil would gently wash the boy’s penis, submerging it in ka’aji to disinfect it and keep evil spirits away. At the end, she had a chicken killed to celebrate each boy’s rite of passage.But Wakil was still getting used to the customs of north-eastern Nigeria. Some people there saw her as an outsider, a southerner. At times she felt like one, too. And as she continued to adjust to a culture that was so different from the one she grew up in, it was her sons who kept her company. They came to adore the Igbo dishes she cooked them, such as isi ewu, spiced goat’s head steeped in red palm oil. Back in those days, Maiduguri still felt like the city of peace.Around the turn of the century, life in Maiduguri started to change. After 1999, when military rule ended and civilian rule was restored to Nigeria, sectarian tensions increased. Between 1999 and 2001, to ensure that the new secular, democratic government in Abuja would not encroach on Islamic principles, 12 northern states adopted full sharia law. Christians living in the north said they felt threatened by sharia, despite officials’ promises that it would not apply to them.Religious tensions were particularly raw in the wide swathe of fertile land south of Borno state, known in Nigeria as the Middle Belt. In 2001, in one Middle Belt city, Jos, about 1,000 people were killed in violence between Christians and Muslims. In Maiduguri, that same year, a total lunar eclipse sparked a riot, after local Muslim men took the eclipse as a sign that the city was overrun with immorality. News agencies reported that the men set ablaze at least 40 hotels, brothels and bars. The 911 terrorist attacks in New York, and Osama bin Laden’s exhortations to Muslims in Africa to rise up against unbelievers, only added to these existing conflicts.Since the 90s, a man called Mohammed Yusuf had been travelling around Nigeria’s north-east, preaching against western influences. Yusuf subscribed to a radical, militant strand of the conservative Sunni branch of Islam known as Salafism. In his sermons, he attacked boko (meaning secular education) and deemed it haram (sinful). By 2001, Yusuf had a devoted group of followers, known as Yusufiyya, and people started referring to his ideology as Boko Haram.Yusuf tapped into the growing anger at rising inequality in Borno state, where most villages lacked power and clean running water, and the majority of people lived on less than $1.25 a day. He railed against government corruption, as well as the growing influence of western Judeo-Christian culture in the north. He condemned the idolisation of international football stars, the prioritising of Nigeria’s secular constitution over Islam and the government’s push to make primary education compulsory for children.In 2005, Yusuf set up the Ibn Taymiyyah mosque and compound, near Maiduguri’s train station. A few hundred of his followers moved there, settling around the train tracks. Yusuf’s rhetoric got more extreme as he agitated for the Borno state governor to enforce sharia law, beyond its formal adoption in 2000. He railed against the US invasion of Iraq, the torture of Muslim detainees in Abu Ghraib and Guantánamo Bay. He told his followers that Nigeria was an infidel state, and it was time to prepare for jihad against the government. Meanwhile, violence between Christians and Muslims across Nigeria continued to escalate. The worldwide protests that followed a Danish newspaper’s publication of cartoons depicting Muhammad in 2005 led to more deaths in Nigeria than anywhere else in the world. Many protests turned violent, which began a vicious cycle of attacks and counterattacks between Christians and Muslims, leaving dozens dead.Wakil knew Yusuf, having befriended his wife and father-in-law around the time he began amassing a following. She saw him as another son. Maiduguri residents who knew Yusuf told me that he respected Wakil. She would cook for him in his father-in-law’s home, and urge him not to fight the government.Around this time, she noticed her other sons were spending more time at Yusuf’s mosque. “They just began disappearing,” she told me. She remembers one of the boys who went away for three months. When he returned to town, he was no longer the jovial teenager that he used to be. He came back with a quiet, brooding disposition. When she asked where he had been, he told her that he had gone somewhere to learn how to kill people.“I thought it was a joke!” Wakil told me. “Kill people?”At first, she had no idea that jihad training camps were springing up in Nigeria, let alone that one of her sons had participated, upon Yusuf’s instruction. She confronted Yusuf about it. “He didn’t deny it,” Wakil said. “He said they were preparing for jihad.” Later, she learned about a camp in the Middle Belt and her sons started telling her to call them by new names, their noms de guerre.Yusuf and his followers were becoming increasingly combative, repeatedly fighting with security agents. Yusuf’s popularity swelled after each arrest. The final trigger was a now-infamous incident that took place in June 2009. One day when Yusuf was away, his followers were riding in a convoy of motorbikes on their way to a funeral when a government patrol force confronted them to ask why they weren’t wearing helmets. The Yusufiyya argued with the patrol force, and soon shots rang out. It’s not clear who shot first, but several officers ended up wounded, and some of Yusuf’s devotees died. The government never investigated what happened.Yusuf was livid, and responded with a series of diatribes directly threatening the Nigerian government and ordering Muslims to acquire weapons. Those messages went beyond Maiduguri, recorded on DVDs and tapes that circulated across the region.Wakil realised that her sons and Yusuf were headed for trouble. She spoke to his father-in-law about her concerns, and he, too, was worried. On 21 July 2009, police raided the home of a sect member and seized bomb-making materials. The Yusufiyya burned down a police station on 26 July in Bauchi state, west of Borno, where Yusuf had a farm. Police raided the farm, killing dozens of militants. Later that day, jihadists also attacked a police station in Maiduguri and for the next four days, they terrorised the city, killing police and soldiers, and slitting the throats of civilians caught in the middle. In response to the killing spree, Nigerian troops shot more than 100 of Yusuf’s followers. Soldiers captured Yusuf and handed him over to the police, who executed him. Wakil cannot forget the night of 30 July 2009, when she saw Yusuf’s bloodied corpse on the local evening news TV broadcast.The government thought Yusuf’s death was the end of Boko Haram. But it only made things worse. After going into hiding, the group re-emerged in 2010 with Yusuf’s brutal deputy, Abubakar Shekau, as Boko Haram’s new leader. From then on, Boko Haram began targeting schools and kidnapping women. The group’s goal was to overthrow Nigeria’s government and replace it with an Islamic state.Many of Wakil’s sons were now under Shekau’s command. But as appalled as she was by the destructive path her sons had chosen, Wakil felt she couldn’t abandon them, or hand them over to the government. Throughout the nearly two years I spent following her, I never heard Wakil describe any of them as “terrorists”. These were men she had taken care of as they grew up. Now, she decided to pray for them to repent. And she kept looking after them: she gave them clothes, money and phones, believing they could be reformed with love. She took care of the wives and children they left behind in the cities. When state security agents came after Wakil’s sons, she hid them inside her home: they slept in the parlour, while she and her daughter, Ummi, slept in the next room.But she feared how far her sons would go. Maiduguri became an urban war zone. At night, the sound of gunfire filled the air. During the day, residents were afraid to gather for weddings and parties. Speaking out against the militants could get you killed, so residents kept usually silent.But Wakil was an exception. Her associations with Boko Haram were no secret. Producers at a local TV news station invited her to the studio to speak about the rising insecurity. During that broadcast, Wakil said the fighters should stop, that she was pleading to them as a mother to her sons.After that, residents and journalists started calling her “Mama Boko Haram”. She was the only woman who would publicly declare that she spoke regularly to the militants.The University of Maiduguri is the most prestigious university in Nigeria’s north-east. With its modern, expansive campus, more than 20,000 students and international staff, it is the pride of the city. And as a secular, coeducational institution, it was also an obvious target for Boko Haram.In 2012, the group carried out a series of high-profile attacks. In early January, Goodluck Jonathan, Nigeria’s president at the time, admitted that Boko Haram members had infiltrated his government and the security services. Later that moth, in Kano, Nigeria’s second-biggest city, Boko Haram carried out a series of coordinated shootings and bombings that left more than 178 dead. Back in Maiduguri, not even the beloved Shehu of Borno – who had publicly denounced Boko Haram as un-Islamic – was safe. He barely escaped a suicide bombing in the central mosque where people were worshiping.That same year, Wakil got a call from one of her sons warning her not to let her daughter Ummi, who was a student at the university, go in that day. The campus was about to be attacked. Wakil spoke as gently as she could. Addressing him as “my son”, she did her best to coax him into abandoning the plan. She told him that killing innocent people was not God’s will. He said there was no way to stop the mission, because everything was already in place, but that she should protect her daughter.When he hung up, Wakil turned to Ummi and told her to rush to school. “She was telling me, go to school quickly,” Ummi later told me. “I didn’t know why she was hurrying me.” Wakil knew that her sons wouldn’t want to bomb the university with her daughter inside. Ummi was like a sister to them: she, too, had taken care of them. So Wakil used her like a human shield.When the insurgents spotted Ummi, the man called Wakil again. Why had Mama let her daughter go to campus, he asked her. After some back and forth, he said that, on Mama’s request, they were going to call off the attack.Very few people outside Boko Haram could claim that kind of influence over its members – and at first, the government considered Wakil’s relationship with them an asset. They believed she could help them open talks with the group.As the violence spiralled, in 2013 Wakil was invited to join a committee that President Jonathan had set up to open talks with the insurgents and broach the option of granting them amnesty. Wakil joined, but the talks didn’t go anywhere. Boko Haram didn’t trust the politicians, and as details of the negotiations kept being leaked to the media, the insurgents became less and less inclined to cooperate.But since Shekau had become Boko Haram’s leader, Wakil had been carrying out her own negotiations, talking to members by phone or through her informants, or meeting them in person in her home. She beseeched them to leave the group, and dozens of them did. She convinced some of them to abandon their arms, directing them to a large rubbish dump in Maiduguri where they could drop the weapon and walk away. A couple of times, militants helped her to disassemble explosives. She buried the pieces in her garden. As we walked around it together, she pointed out the spot where she had destroyed a bomb if I looked hard enough, she said, I might still be able to see pieces of it.She helped former members establish a new life in other parts of the country. One day, she gave money to some 30 ex-militants. With the money, one ended up going to the commercial capital of Lagos to work in the textile sector, she said. Another made his way to the south-east to become a butcher. According to Wakil, many of these sons were killed by vigilantes or arrested once word spread about who they were.Not everyone understood what Wakil was doing. And it wasn’t long before rumours started going around. People said she was suspiciously close to the insurgents. They wondered why her home had been spared, while just about every other area in Maiduguri had been touched by gunfire or a bomb.It was true, Wakil said, that they had agreed never to attack there. But that was because her home was considered a sanctuary by all sides. When bullets were fired in the city, it was where civilians went to seek refuge. Insurgents ran there when they were being pursued by state security and soldiers security officials ran there when they were fleeing Boko Haram.At these moments, government security agents and Boko Haram fighters sometimes came face to face in Wakil’s home, exactly as she wanted. She would bring over bowls of isi ewu and encourage the men to eat together in peace. “They will eat and they will be very happy,” she told me with a laugh. They would be wary at first, but over food they slowly warmed up enough to have frank conversations.It was Wakil’s own version of peacebuilding. But unsurprisingly, some people felt uncomfortable about her unorthodox methods. On 14 August 2016, Wakil was declared wanted by the Nigerian army after the militants released a video of the Chibok girls in captivity. In a statement, the army spokesman, Sani Usman, said that Wakil – and two other people who were wanted, a journalist and a peace activist – was “in possession of information on the conditions and the exact location” of the Chibok girls. “They must, therefore, come forward and tell us,” Usman’s statement went on.Wakil was distraught. Not only did she not know where the girls were, but for years she had been cooperating with the security services. She had met with the army’s chief of staff and kept the military informed about her activities. Now she was being treated as an accomplice. She posted a response on Facebook: “Yes I have links with Boko Haram and you have always known that,” she wrote. “I have been in the front fighting for peace long before Chibok girls were kidnapped. Nigerian security knows me too well, I am not shady. Why declaring me wanted? … this has put my immediate and extended family under a lot of pressure and I do not deserve this from the government.”The next day, Wakil turned herself in at the defence headquarters in Abuja, and was interrogated for about eight hours. Security personnel asked her for her life story, how she ended up in Maiduguri, how she came to know the insurgents. Though she was not offered any public apology, the army accepted her story and released her after 48 hours. She returned to Maiduguri and got back to work.In early September 2018, two years after her interrogation, Wakil sat in her office with two Boko Haram militants. “You hear me? We will come out,” said Ali Garga, one of the Boko Haram militants, in a gentle voice. “We don’t want any security to disturb us, like police.”Wakil sat in her chair quietly listening. She seemed worn out. The previous year, she had launched a nonprofit organisation called Complete Care and Aid Foundation. Every few weeks, she and her team would visit refugee camps, where they would distribute clothes and food to women who had lost their husbands to Boko Haram, as well as check on the storehouse where they kept bags of rice and beans.But the relief work was not her most pressing priority. She urgently wanted to get her boys to stop the violence – and it was taking a physical toll on her. She suffered from acute back pain and crippling headaches. Still, she kept going.“We drop everything, we drop everything, Mama,” Garga went on, speaking on behalf of some of the men in his unit. He did not specify just how many men wanted to surrender. A man with a hard, skinny body and kind eyes, Garga had been a cattle herder before becoming a mujahid. But he had grown tired of the guerrilla life, eventually coming around to see what Boko Haram was doing as criminal, not Islamic. He missed his cows, his home, his freedom. Later, he turned to me and explained that he was surrendering because Wakil was making it possible for him to do so.As part of the surrender, Garga said he planned to release some of the Chibok girls who were still captive. Of the original 276, about 112 are still missing. Garga, who claimed he had about 40 of them under his care in a secret location, told Wakil he would sneak out of the camp with the girls and other abductees.An hour later, Wakil said it was time for her sons to eat. She brought out plastic containers of rice and bottles of water and orange soda. The men sat quietly, scooping up the rice with their hands and then wolfing down their food, until an informant began to praise Wakil. “Mama Aisha, mother of the Boko Haram. May God bless you, Aisha. May God help you,” he said.Three weeks later, I was in Wakil’s home on a Saturday night when she ran towards me with her phone in her hand, shouting, “Ali is dead! Ali is dead!” A trusted informant, whom I had met several times, had just called her. Wakil was hysterical. She threw her body on the cold tiled floor and cried. I watched her shoulders shake up and down. She told me that when Garga went back into the bushes, some of his fellow mujahideen found out about his plan to escape with the Chibok girls. They killed him. Wakil later found out that he had been tortured.Ali Garga’s death was a huge setback to Wakil’s peace talks. Things hadn’t been going her way lately. She had sold many of her assets, including jewellery and land, and had no more money to lure the militants away from the group. Her talks kept hitting dead ends. Her informants were getting killed as they travelled between Maiduguri and the bush, where the militants were based. She never knew who did the killing. Periodically, she would get a message that another contact had been killed by a stray bullet, or drowned in a river.In late 2019, her foundation was hit with a lawsuit over allegations of fraud. She was detained shortly afterwards. According to the government’s anti-corruption agency, contractors who had supplied at least 111.6m naira (£229,000) worth of goods such as cars, maize and medical supplies to the foundation had not been paid and some of the awarded contracts were bogus.In January, I travelled to Maiduguri to see if I could visit Wakil in the prison where she and the foundation’s programme manager and country director were being held. I learned that the prison administrators had allowed her to go to the hospital to get treatment for her high blood pressure. At the hospital, Wakil told me she was innocent, blaming everything on the programme manager, who had handled the contracts. (Like Wakil, the programme manager and country director have also pleaded not guilty. The trial has been postponed until further notice, and all three suspects remain in custody.)Meanwhile, Wakil told me, the number of people joining Boko Haram was growing, despite the Nigerian military’s claims to the contrary. They were getting their hands on more sophisticated weapons: Russian anti-aircraft missiles and mortars that had been circulating in north Africa since the fall of Libya’s Muammar Gaddafi, as well as drones. And then there were all the Boko Haram splinter groups, which made it harder for Wakil to keep track of which faction was carrying out which attack.Despite the presence of a multinational task force of specially trained army units, and repeated claims by Nigeria’s president, Muhammadu Buhari, that the group has been “technically defeated”, its insurgency continues. In March, the Chadian and Nigerian armies kicked off a major offensive operation against Boko Haram. Later that month, 92 Chadian soldiers were killed in a battle that lasted seven hours. Chadian forces claimed they killed 1,000 militants in a mission launched that month. In June, militants carried out multiple attacks in north-eastern Nigeria, which left scores of civilians dead.It’s hard to say who is winning the war, but Wakil’s boys are dying before they can even surrender. A couple of days after Ali Garga was killed, Wakil called me into her bedroom to watch old videos of him. It was night-time, and I sat on the fluffy pink comforter beside Wakil, and looked at the tablet in her hands. There, on the screen, were Garga and his wife, a rifle slung over her shoulder. They were dancing in a clearing of trees. All around them, sword-carrying mujahideen danced with women, standing shoulder to shoulder, shuffling back and forth. Everyone was beaming. Under a bright sky, Boko Haram was dancing.I looked up from the tablet and saw Wakil smile as she watched her son. I remembered something she had told me one evening in her kitchen. All she wanted, she said, was for her boys to come out, so she could cook isi ewu for them and they could eat together like old times. • Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, and sign up to the long read weekly email here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/32d0906c1bcea2c9ab2abb7f15f07ea2c0c3cbea/0_219_3164_1898/master/3164.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6778e50da57654efb3f7134b53f3af07","title":"leicester how have you been affected by the local lockdown","story":"We want to hear from people living in Leicester about how restrictions are affecting themLeicester is the first city to experience a local lockdown with non-essential shops and schools closed from Tuesday.Restrictions are set to be in place for two weeks after infections rose, with Leicester accounting for around one in 10 of all coronavirus cases in the past week.We want to hear from local people, schools and business about their experiences.

I am looking after the ’s live feed while my colleague Damien Gayle takes a lunch break. Please get in touch via any of the channels below to share with me news tips, comments and more. Peter Beaumont, senior reporter on the ’s global development desk, has written his take on the World Health Organization’s press conference earlier:The World Health Organization has announced an “independent” and “honest” review of how nations and the UN global health body handled the flawed international response to the coronavirus pandemic.Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the head of the WHO, gave details of the review during a downbeat press conference in which he painted a grim picture of the escalating trajectory of the pandemic.“We know that when countries take a comprehensive approach based on fundamental public health measures … the Covid-19 outbreak can be brought under control,” Tedros said. “But in most of the world the virus is not under control. It is getting worse … more than 544,000 lives have been lost. The pandemic is still accelerating. The total number of cases has doubled in the last six weeks.”The review panel will be co-chaired by Helen Clark, the former prime minister of New Zealand, and Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, the Nobel peace prize laureate and former president of Liberia.As global confirmed cases approach 12 million, the WHO has found itself in the crosshairs of the Trump administration, which has announced its withdrawal from the body as it fends off what critics have described as its own botched response to the pandemicSchools and universities in Moscow are to reopen next week, as the city advances to the next stage in its lifting of coronavirus restrictions amid a slowing of the spread of the virus, Reuters reports.The Russian capital has so far recorded more than 227,000 coronavirus infections, with 568 more reported on Thursday. Authorities last month began to lift restrictions to slow the spread of the virus in place since March, staggering the reopening of businesses and lifting of other measures.Sergei Sobyanin, the mayor, said on Thursday that schools, universities, summer camps and cultural centres could reopen starting next week. From the same time, residents of the city of nearly 13 million will no longer be required to wear masks outdoors, he said. But masks will remain mandatory in shops, medical facilities and on public transport. Sobyanin said the lifting of Moscow’s lockdown was a success as the number of new cases recorded on a daily basis in the city was falling. “Of course every phase of lifting restrictions contains elements of unpredictability and risk,” he wrote on his website. “But life has shown that the situation has remained manageable and that the risk was justified.”  Russia on Thursday reported 6,509 new cases of the coronavirus, pushing its official nationwide tally to 707,301, the fourth largest in the world. It has reported 10,843 deaths. Half of Indonesia’s new coronavirus cases on Thursday came from one military training centre, as the world’s fourth most populous country reported its biggest single daily rise in infections, Reuters reports. Indonesia has recorded 70,736 cases so far. There were 58 new coronavirus-related deaths on Thursday, bringing the official total to 3,417, a health ministry official, Achmad Yurianto, told a news conference. He said a significant new cluster had emerged at a military training centre in West Java, where 1,262 cadets and trainers have tested positive for the disease.Public health researchers suspect that due to the limited scope of testing, the actual case total could be far higher. Partial data for 20 of Indonesia’s 35 provinces gathered by a volunteer group, Kawal Covid-19, from local government websites shows there were a further 6,847 deaths of people who had not been tested but showed acute symptoms.The central government does not include such cases, as untested patients could have died from other causes.Yurianto attributed the increasing new cases to people not wearing masks as Indonesia eased lockdowns to help revive the economy. Nightclubs in Tokyo will be paid subsidies to stay closed under plans unveiled by city authorities, as new coronavirus infections in the Japanese capital hit a single-day record, according to the French news agency AFP. Under the plan, the Tokyo metropolitan government will give 500,000 yen (US$4,660) to nightclubs and other venues – including so-called host and hostess bars – if they close for more than 10 days, local media reported.Kaori Kohga, the head of the industry association representing hostesses and clubs, gave the announcement a lukewarm reception.“It’s a good start,” she told AFP, “but 500,000 yen per club is not sufficient to curb the cases in these districts.”“Money may only go to clubs, not inidual hostesses,” she added. “I’m afraid that the effect of the proposed subsidies may be limited.” There has been a fresh surge in coronavirus cases in Tokyo, particularly in the major commercial and entertainment districts including famed Shinjuku. Tokyo said the number of new coronavirus infections reached a single-day record of 224 on Thursday.To recap on what was just announced by the World Health Organization chief, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the UN health body is appointing a committee to evaluate the global response to the coronavirus pandemic and make recommendations for an enhanced system of global health governance. The WHO is yet to publish any further details on what this evaluation committee, to be led by Helen Clark, the former prime minister of New Zealand, and Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, the former president of Liberia, is supposed to be about. From what I can gather from the contents of Tedros’s speech, its aim is to evaluate “national surveillance and response systems, how we shared information with our communities, and whether we earned their trust, how we governed, and whether our global health architecture is fit for purpose.”It comes off the back of a resolution passed in during the World Health Assembly in May, where the WHO’s 194 member states (which no longer include the US, of course) agreed to “recognise the role of the the leadership role of WHO and the role of the UN system in coordinating the comprehensive global response” to coronavirus and other global pandemics. He said the panel’s terms of reference were yet to be developed, and the remaining members of the panel would be selected by the two co-chairs from candidates proposed by member states. It is due to present an interim report in November and a full report in May. Tedros’s comments suggest its goal is to design a model for global health governance that will coordinate responses to future outbreaks and other challenges such as antimicrobial resistance, inequality and the climate crisis. He added: “This cannot be another blue-ribbon panel that issues a report that goes up on the bookshelf. We must come together in a global conversation, to take these hard-won lessons and turn them into action. “My friends, make no mistake. The greatest threat we face now is not the virus itself. Rather, it is the lack of leadership and solidarity at the global and national levels. We cannot defeat this pandemic as a ided world.”The former New Zealand prime minister Helen Clark and the former Liberian president Ellen Johnson Sirleaf have been appointed as co-chairs of a committee to evaluate the global response to the coronavirus outbreak. I’m honoured to join prime minister Helen Clark to undertake this important and challenging assignment. I thank you for this opportunity and look forward to doing all we can to respond to these challenges that have prevented us from being united in moving forward not only to address the effects of Covid-19 but to ensure a better health system for all nations of the world. The spread of the coronavirus pandemic is “still accelerating” and most countries have not yet managed to get it under control, the head of the World Health Organization has said. Speaking at the weekly member states information session, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said more than 11.8 million cases of coronavirus had been reported to the UN’s health agency, half of them in the past six weeks. He said the outbreak had exposed global and national inequalities both in health systems and in wider societies, and that its impact had “unravelled gains” previously made in the fight against diseases. Tedros said:It is often said that disease knows no borders. It does not care about our political differences, and it disregards the distinctions we draw between health and economy, lives and livelihoods. The Covid-19 pandemic has disrupted them all. It has exploited the inequalities in our health systems and the schisms in our societies. It has exposed existing inequities, widening and deepening the cracks between us.The virus has upended health systems in some of the world’s wealthiest nations, while some countries that have mounted a successful response have been of modest means.But in most of the world the virus is not under control. It is getting worse. 11.8+m cases of Covid-19 have now been reported to WHO. More than 544,000 lives have been lost. The pandemic is still accelerating. The total number of cases has doubled in the last six weeks.Iran has reported a record one-day coronavirus death toll of 221, as the number of cases confirmed in the country since its outbreak began in February passed 250,000. In its latest update, the health ministry said the number of people who had tested positive for the virus in Iran had reached 250,458, an increase of 2,079 on the day before. So far 212,176 patients have recovered. The death toll from the outbreak now stands at 12,305, said the ministry’s spokeswoman, Sima Sadat Lari. Of those who tested positive for the virus in the past 24 hours 995 were admitted to hospital. Currently 3,324 patients are in a critical condition and being treated in intensive care units.Iran has been facing a sharp rise in the number of daily infections and deaths in past weeks as lockdown measures have eased. Authorities in Serbia are deciding on measures to try to curb the spread of coronavirus, after a second night of clashes between police and people protesting against a second lockdown. The country’s crisis team is expected to ban gatherings in the capital, Belgrade, and limit the operations of cafes and nightclubs following a rise in infections that they say threatens the health system.It is not clear whether officials will reintroduce a weekend curfew, the initial announcement of which triggered the violent protests in Belgrade and three other cities.On Wednesday night 10 police officers were injured during a second night of clashes in Belgrade. Dozens of protesters were injured in clashes there and in other cities. Clouds of teargas and smoke filled downtown Belgrade on Wednesday evening after a peaceful gathering descended into tense confrontations between protesters and police. The interior minister, Nebojša Stefanović, said that among the police officers injured on Wednesday evening was one who suffered two broken legs.Similar protests were held in the cities of Novi Sad, Niš and Kragujevac, where the premises of President Aleksandar Vučić’s ruling Serbian Progressive party (SNS) were vandalised.On both nights, scenes of police brutality were captured on camera, including an incident on Tuesday in which officers used batons to beat three men sitting peacefully on a bench.The local Beta news agency reported that one of its journalists was beaten by police. Serbia has confirmed more than 17,000 cases of coronavirus, and 341 people have died. A few hundred new infections are being reported daily.Daily infections have shot up over the past few weeks, overwhelming hospitals. Critics accuse the Serbian authorities of under-reporting the death toll and hastily lifting almost all virus restrictions before a national election in late June.The poll, which was boycotted by much of the opposition, cemented Vučić’s grip on power.Hello, this is Damien Gayle taking the reins on the blog now for the next eight hours, bringing you the latest updates and headlines in the coronavirus outbreak from around the world.

The intensive care unit at the main hospital in Bergamo, the Italian province worst affected by coronavirus, is Covid-free for the first time since the outbreak of the pandemic in Italy in February.The virus was first detected in the province on 23 February, two days after Italy’s first local transmission was confirmed, and went on to kill an estimated 6,000 people. “Victory has come,” said Luca Lorini, the director of the emergency unit at the hospital, where staff on Monday gave a “liberating” applause and dedicated a minute of silence to those who died.At the height of the emergency, the intensive care unit at Papa Giovanni XXII hospital was treating up to 100 patients.Maria Beatrice Stasi, the hospital’s general manager, told La Stampa: “Today we see our staff finally dressed in their normal uniforms.”At a national level, there were 899 people in hospital with Covid-19 and 71 in intensive care as of Wednesday. Italy recorded 15 more coronavirus deaths on Wednesday, bringing the total to 34,914, and 193 new infections."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/02eedc8a467e63d3584858a8f077ea15a2869f7b/0_22_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a168cd0eb4e002fd3080860ca2181428","title":"uk coronavirus live latest news covid 19 updates","story":"IFS analysis of chancellor’s plans says ‘reckoning’ will have to come to repair battered public financesThe culture secretary, Oliver Dowden, is to host the Downing Street press conference at 5pm.

May said it was important to recognise that the workplace was a safe space for domestic abuse victim.  One of the concerns I have as we come out of lockdown is there’s a lot of talk about a new way of working people working at home, it’s been shown that people can work at home now, many people, not everybody, but many people can. What I don’t want to see is employers simply saying that everybody who can work at home should be doing so in the future. Because if you’re a victim of domestic abuse, work is your safe place. And employers need to think about that. Think about those of their employees, for whom in the workspace is a safe place and being at home is not.As home secretary May restricted the police’s powers to do stop and search because black people were seven times more likely to be stopped by police than white people, but her reforms have since been overturned. Research published last night by the home affairs select committee showed that young black men were stopped and searched by police more than 20,000 times in London in the lockdown - equivalent to more than a quarter of every black 15-24-year-olds being stopped once. May told the BBC she believes the police powers should be looked at again and people should not be stopped on the streets of our country simply because of the colour of their skin.Alexander Paul, who came in to the Home Office to tell me about his experience with a group of others. A upright young man, never been in trouble, but been stopped so many times. And that made me think we needed to look at this. And when we looked at it, the inspectorate of police found that actually about a quarter of stops and searches were not being conducted lawfully. So I put a code of conduct in place and said you must do it according to the law. It seems pretty simple to me, for the police to do something according to the law. And I fundamentally believe that you should not be stopped on the streets of our country simply because of the colour of your skin.Asked how the current government is handling the pandemic she said the last few months have been incredibly difficult for Boris Johnson and for the whole of the government. She says there is nobody in the country who would rather be them dealing with it.I think the last few months have been incredibly difficult for Boris and for the whole of the government because they’ve been dealing as governments have around the world with something that nobody expected and something new. I think it’s been incredibly difficult. They’ve been working flat out every day to make sure that they’re responding to this pandemic. And it’s, I don’t think there’s anybody in the country sitting, listening to this programme, who is saying it was would rather be them dealing with it.Boris Johnson failed to meet his target of having all coronavirus tests completed within 24 hours by the end of June, newly released data shows.There was only a minimal increase in the proportion of tests completed within the timeframe after the prime minister made his pledge, statistics from the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) suggested on Thursday.Dido Harding, the executive chair of the NHS test and trace programme to stem the spread of Covid-19, said they remained “committed to continually improving” the programme.“This week we have seen test turnaround times improve further, with the majority of positive cases reached by contact tracers in under 24 hours,” she added.Johnson made the commitment in response to Hunt, who chairs the Commons health and social care committee, during PMQs amid concerns that not enough people were being tested for Covid-19.The government is to allow gyms in England to start reopening this month, it is understood, following intense lobbying from the fitness sector and MPs over why they had to remain closed when restaurants and bars could admit customers.It is expected that the culture, media and sport secretary, Oliver Dowden, will set out plans formally later on Thursday, with the expectation of reopening soon, if gyms are able to maintain social distancing and other coronavirus hygiene measures.Dowden is expected to confirm a date for reopening, which government sources suggested would be before the end of July.The culture secretary is also expected to announce the date when some other sectors left out of the 4 July easements, such as nail bars, can open their doors. There was, however, no immediate clarity on the position for swimming pools, which have also not yet been allowed to reopen.Tens of thousands of people who work in high-risk jobs, such as taxi drivers, cleaners and shop workers, will be tested for coronavirus even though they have no symptoms, the government has announced.The Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) said the pilot study, which begins immediately, would improve understanding of the prevalence of the virus in asymptomatic people in higher-risk jobs.It is believed that people without symptoms can spread coronavirus to others without being aware that they are infectious.Firms included in the trial are taxi firm Addison Lee, BT, services firm Mitie and pharmacy giant Boots.Workers will be given a one-off test to see how common asymptomatic Covid-19 is among these groups.Local authorities in Bradford, Newham, Brent and Oldham will also select groups of people for asymptomatic testing who are deemed to be high-risk.The DHSC said each business will receive thousands of tests for staff via home-testing delivery or a mobile testing unit.A 57-year-old man has become the first person to be arrested in connection with an alleged fraud of the government furlough scheme.HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) said it had arrested a male from Solihull, West Midlands, on Wednesday, in connection with allegations of a £495,000 fraud of the coronavirus job retention scheme (CJRS).HMRC said it was the first such arrest to happen.Officers executed a search warrant, seizing computers and other digital devices, while funds held in a bank account relating to the arrested man’s business have been frozen.The coronavirus job retention scheme is part of the collective national effort to protect jobs.The vast majority of employers will have used the CJRS responsibly, but we will not hesitate to act on reports of abuse of the scheme.This is taxpayers’ money and any claim that proves to be fraudulent limits our ability to support people and deprives public services of essential funding.As usual, we have built steps in to prevent mistakes and fraud happening in the first place, but anyone who is concerned that their employer might be abusing the scheme should report it to HMRC online.More than £27.4bn has been claimed through the scheme, supporting 1.1 million employers and 9.4 million furloughed jobs.HMRC added that the man was also arrested in relation to a suspected multimillion-pound tax fraud and alleged money laundering offences.A further eight men from across the region have also been detained as part of this linked investigation, which involved the deployment of more than 100 HMRC officers to 11 locations.Computers, digital devices, and business and personal records were also seized during the raids.I am faintly obsessed with Rishi Sunak’s social media output, and from a glance at Twitter, I know I am not on my own. But the chancellor has defended “Brand Rishi”, saying he wants to get the government’s message across to as many people as possible and that if it means “they poke fun at me in the process” then “so be it”.The minister has been gently - and not so gently - mocked for posting graphics and soft-focus pictures overlaid with his signature and artistic text.We covered Sunak’s appearance on the Today programme this morning (see 8.55), but it’s interesting to see what he said when questioned about “Brand Rishi” on the same programme. Asked about the posts, he said:This is about communication, and the way we communicate is changing. We’ve seen a change in how people engage with the way they get their news, and the way they get their information.I’m keen to try and get our message across to as many people as possible and engage them, and if that means they poke some fun at me in the process so be it if it means they’re talking about what we’re doing and debating it.The chancellor visited a Wagamama restaurant after delivering his summer statement in the Commons on Wednesday, where he had photographs taken by a Treasury photographer.Sunak did not wear a face covering despite serving food to customers in the restaurant.No other cabinet ministers have been photographed in public wearing a face covering, yet the government guidance says people should wear a face covering in “enclosed public spaces where social distancing isn’t possible and where you will come into contact with people you do not normally meet”.Now this sounds like a good idea! PA Media reports that remote workers could be given the chance to relocate to Barbados under new proposals being considered by the Caribbean island.Apparently the prime minister, Mia Amor Mottley, is looking at plans to introduce a “12-month Barbados welcome stamp” that would allow visitors the option to work remotely from the Caribbean island for a year at a time.You don’t need to work in Europe, or the US or Latin America if you can come here and work for a couple of months at a time go back and come back.Currently, British passport holders don’t need a visa to visit Barbados but are granted a period of time to stay.Barbados plans to officially reopen its borders to international travel on 12 July. However, current guidance states people travelling to the country must have had a Covid-19 test within 72 hours prior to leaving.They must also submit a form 24 hours before travelling. Anyone who hasn’t taken a test will be tested upon arrival to the country and placed in isolation if necessary. Might schedule in a chat with my boss - who’s with me? Scots can meet people from other households indoors from tomorrow for the first time in over three months, as the first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, confirmed that the country was now ready to enter phase 3 of her government’s route map to re-opening.Announcing a raft of new guidance, she also said that non-cohabiting couples were now allowed to meet outdoors, indoors and overnight without physical distancing.Sturgeon has also brought forward the date when places of worship can re-open for congregational services and communal prayer to 15 July.Sturgeon made the announcements as she confirmed there had been no further coronavirus deaths in Scotland overnight, telling the chamber that the virus “has now been suppressed to a low level”.Describing the measures as “the most significant milestone in Scotland’s emergence from lockdown”, she said that Scots could meet in extended groups of up to 15, and up to five households, outdoors and indoors up to eight people from up to three households, including overnight stays, from tomorrow.Under-18s can meet an unlimited number of households indoors or outdoors from tomorrow.She also confirmed that pubs, restaurants and hairdressers are allowed to open indoors from next Wednesday, with exemptions to the 2-metre rule, although face coverings will be mandatory from tomorrow.No new coronavirus deaths have been reported in Scotland in the last 24 hours, the first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, said.A total of 2,490 patients have died in Scotland after testing positive for coronavirus, no change on yesterday’s figure.Speaking in the Scottish parliament, the first minister said 18,315 people had tested positive for the virus in Scotland, up by six from 18,309 the day before.There are 646 people in hospital with confirmed or suspected Covid-19, down 121 on Wednesday.Of these patients, nine were in intensive care, a fall of two."},{"url":null,"title":"climate","story":"Analysis confirms Covid-19 lockdown translated to short-term emissions reductions\u0026lsquoI intend to make substantial progress\u0026rsquo on securing our habitats, says Malcolm Noonan"},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"Michael Viney: Wild grasses have loved the mood swings of our climate this yearAnother Life: As one of many of the world\u0026rsquos declining seabirds, puffins are now receiving much more necessary and serious attentionAnother Life: A new book on the founders of the Tyler Prize shows their political influenceAvian science journal Ibis reports \u0026lsquogreat conservation concern\u0026rsquo about the speciesAnother Life: Dairy farmer Bruce Thompson examines impact of worming drug on beetlesMichael Viney: Crumbling hilltop trig pillars\u0026rsquo played key role in the mapping of IrelandAntipodean flatworms pose risk to indigenous variety which could have severe knock-on effectsAnother Life: Some floaters circle territories and sneak the odd \u0026lsquoextra-pair copulation\u0026rsquoMichael Viney: Plant intelligence rests in the ways by which they solve their problemsA Life on Our Planet is a terrifying catalogue of our self-sabotaging transgressionsGreys carry squirrel-pox virus which is fatal to Ireland\u0026rsquos native redsAnother Life: The disappearance of this bird from cities has prompted much researchRobinson has followed Mair\u0026eacutead, his wife and collaborator, into the list of Covid-19 fatalitiesWill Covid-19 begin a resurgence of the 1970s withdrawal from growth-driven capitalism?Greater industry involvement required if bovine TB to be eliminated by 2030 targetMichael Viney: Camera traps are now used as a regular part of hare monitoringMarine life with very specific habitat needs threatened in the face of sweeping changeThree terrapins as pets seems a bit ambitious considering their needsThe list of causes of damage is long, making it hard to know where to startFew, if any, of Ireland\u0026rsquos mammals have evolved the ability to eat venomous creaturesGolden kelp is notably bare of other sea life, so there are concerns over its possible impact"},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

Photograph: Dara Mac Dónaill Two of the nursing homes worst hit by coronavirus appealed directly to then minister for health Simon Harris for help as they fought severe Covid-19 outbreaks in March and April.The private homes – Tara Winthrop in Swords, Co Dublin and Dealgan House in Dundalk, Co Louth – struggled to cope with outbreaks prompting them to make desperate, late-night pleas for help.Newly released emails show the depth of the crisis in some nursing homes, the sector most affected by the Covid-19 pandemic accounting for 985 or 56 per cent of the 1,738 Covid-19 deaths. Joe O’Donovan, chief executive of Tara Winthrop, one of the first nursing homes in Ireland to experience a Covid-19 outbreak, told senior State health officials on the weekend of March 20th-21st the facility “cannot contain the outbreak without support directly on our units” and management at the nursing home “no longer have the resources to manage the outbreak”. The situation reached crisis point at Dealgan House over the Easter weekend in April, when a director warned in an email to the HSE that if the home’s residents were to have “a fighting chance of survival, the home needs to be virtually turned into a hospital”.Both homes recorded multiple cases of coronavirus and deaths related to the disease, running to more than 20 confirmed or suspected Covid-19 deaths at each care facility. A quarter of the residents at Dealgan House died.The appeals for help are contained in emails released by health service regulator, Health and Information Quality Authority (HIQA), to The  under the Freedom of Information (FoI) Act. The records were redacted of information identifying iniduals and the homes. This newspaper has independently established the identity of the homes and the iniduals in the correspondence.‘Immediate threat’In an email sent at 11.15pm on Friday, March 20th, to HSE officials, Mr O’Donovan said the large Swords home needed an additional 12 staff the following day to cover symptomatic staff calling in sick and 11 staff to cover the shortfall on the Sunday.“I cannot highlight enough the immediate threat…at the home from Covid-19,” he wrote.In addition to the extra staff, Mr O’Donovan appealed for personal protective equipment (PPE), the results of swab tests, swabs for further tests and “one single contact in public health”.He warned that without further supplies of PPE, the home would breach minimum requirements “of the most recent HSE guidance note on PPE”.He had not received a response by the following day so he escalated his concerns. At 1.53pm that Saturday, he forwarded his previous night’s email to the same recipients and this time copied the then minister for health and other Department of Health and HSE senior officials.The situation at the north Co Dublin home “continues to get more serious by the hour” with more staff out sick, he said.Mr O’Donovan referred to a newspaper article published that day reporting then taoiseach Leo Varadkar telling a private Fine Gael parliamentary party meeting that in Italy nursing homes residents were not going to the hospital when Covid-19 hit but to the morgue, and that Mr Varadkar did not want that to happen here.“It has and is happening,” Mr O’Donovan wrote in his email that Saturday afternoon.Mr O’Donovan signed off, saying: “Again, I appeal for your immediate attention to this critical situation for a high-risk vulnerable group.”At 5.40pm, he sent a follow-up email expressing relief that “six personnel” had arrived to help and these were “crucial to us containing the outbreak and protecting the residents”.“We no longer feel unheard and unsupported,” he wrote. In a call with a Tara Winthrop staff member the following week, Hiqa noted that it was told that the number of staff calling in sick was increasing daily to the point that the Swords nursing home was “considering asking relatives to come and assist with caring” for the residents they were related to.The crisis was just as grave at Dealgan House when it hit three weeks later, at the Easter weekend.Direct appealFintan Farrelly, one of the home’s owners, emailed the State’s chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan late on April 11th saying he would not normally make a request “through this channel” but “as it is Easter Saturday and the situation is so urgent, I’m appealing directly to you”.“In our nursing home, people are dying and we are struggling terribly with staff absences. Many of these staff were tested weeks ago and have had no result,” he wrote.The privately owned nursing home did not know which residents were infected until they had symptoms and that “in a number of cases, the residents have passed away within hours of showing the first symptoms”, he said. They “desperately” needed mass testing of all staff and residents with next-day results, he told Dr Holohan, “so that we can get a clear picture of the situation and get the outbreak under control”.Mr Farrelly alerted Mr Harris to his concerns the next day, telling the then minister for health in an email at 8.47pm on Easter Sunday that the nursing home required extra nurses from the HSE to work day and night shifts.“I fear that when the history of Ireland’s Covid-19 pandemic is written, the failure to adequately support nursing homes during the month of March and up to the current time, will have resulted in multiple avoidable deaths and will be identified as the greatest tragedy of the pandemic,” he wrote. “We are said to be ‘all in this together’ but we feel strongly that Ireland’s most vulnerable and concentrated group, the over 25,000 residents of our nursing homes, have been and continue to be neglected by your department and the HSE. We cherish our elderly people and feel they are being badly let down by the State.” The staff had been “decimated”, he wrote, and said some who were self-isolating had not received test results, so they could in fact be “unnecessarily absent from work, thus exacerbating desperate staff shortage”.“It was not our experience that healthcare workers were prioritised for testing and it appears that prioritisation only applied to the HSE,” he wrote. Mr Farrelly said the home was desperately short of nurses “and on occasion have only had one nurse on night duty, dealing with 80 residents, some of whom are very ill”.“Our experience is that the support promised from the HSE is not forthcoming and I ask you why not?” he said in his email to the minister.‘Dire straits’Mr Farrelly said he was “very disturbed” to hear that while Dealgan was “in dire straits and our residents are dying” a local hospital in Co Louth was “practically empty of patients and is fully staffed” and nurses were told to take leave “due to an insufficient workload” and “will be called if necessary”.“This beggars belief!” he wrote.On Monday, April 13th, Mr Farrelly emailed a HSE official with a long list of what the home required, including nurses and healthcare workers. Dealgan’s residents “deserve a chance to fight this virus” at the home, he said, and the only alternative was to sent them to a local hospital.“This is not our wish nor that of families, nor I’m sure that of the HSE,” he wrote. Four days later, the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland (RCSI) Hospitals Group stepped in and temporarily took over the management of the Co Louth nursing home. A spokesman for Dealgan House said this week the Covid-19 outbreak was closed and they had not had a new outbreak since May. The 84-bed capacity home had 22 Covid-19 deaths. Tara Winthrop said on Wednesday that it had 18 confirmed and five suspected Covid deaths at the facility, which has 140 beds. A spokesman for the home said a further five asymptomatic staff tested positive two weeks ago as part of the HSE’s weekly testing of all nursing home staff but they had isolated, recovered and returned to work. All residents subsequently tested negative, he added.The spokesman said close liaison with Mr Harris, his department and the HSE from March “enabled learnings from this experience to inform and improve the measures taken subsequently to help cope with outbreaks across the nursing home sector”.He said the Swords nursing home was “working tirelessly to protect the residents and the staff and continue to work, on a daily basis, with the experts in the HSE, Department of Health and Hiqa to fight this virus”."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4300202.1594295434!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"six counties had no covid 19 case over past week","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tCounties Donegal, Kilkenny, Longford, Monaghan, Roscommon and Wexford added just one new case.

No country in the EU was faced with penalties as high as in Ireland.The Donegal TD said he had seen minutes of the meeting between Mr Varadkar, then taoiseach and Minister for Finance and the five banks on May 11th about the payment breaks.MinutesIn the minutes the banks said the regulator required them to charge interest and if they did not do so the accounts would go into default, but “neither of these claims are true”, he said.The Tánaiste, however, disputed this account and said that while he had not seen the minutes he was at the meeting and that the banks “never claimed that they couldn’t waive the interest. They did say it would be possible for them to waive interest for that period.”But the Sinn Féin TD said that unless the minute taker was at a different meeting “there is a serious issue here” because in “black and white” it was written down that the banks said they needed to charge the interest.Mr Varadkar told him the banks’ issue was that “somebody has to pay the cost of the payment break”. Ideally the cost should come out of the banks’ profits but they had none this year, he said. The costs should not fall on taxpayers or mortgage holders who are up to date on their payments and it was currently on those availing of the break.Mr Doherty raised the matter in the Dáil following confirmation earlier this week by the Central Bank that under regulatory rules banks are not required to charge interest for the duration of the breaks.Irish banks are charging more interest than any other EU banks, Mr Doherty said. He pointed out that other EU countries including Spain had introduced legislation to prevent interest being charged.Mr Varadkar said different countries are doing different things but it was broadly in line with Ireland and he said “it’s not as you presented it in your comments”.He said “the fundamental point is are the banks going to make extra money out of this. If they are, that is not acceptable and we will deal with that.”"},{"url":null,"title":"asia","story":"Park Won-soon did not show up for work and cancelled all schedulesBeijing calls on Australia to stop interfering following response to China imposing new security law in territoryGlory to Hong Kong, deemed to contain \u0026lsquostrong political messages\u0026rsquo, can no longer be sung or playedMost deaths have come from hardest-hit Kunamoto prefecturePM\u0026rsquos image undamaged as Bharatiya Janata party proves adept at deflecting blameFor three decades the armies of the two most populous countries have been patrolling a disputed border in the HimalayasDozen people missing on southwestern island of Kyushu as government pledges to boost rescue effortsArmy deployed to patrol the NSW and Victoria borders, closed for first time in 100 yearsFlooding and mudslides on Kyushu force hundreds of thousands to evacuate homesGlobal wrap: Subcontinent overtakes Russia, as border between Australian states to closeNew law leaves pro-democracy protesters unsure of where Beijing has redrawn the lineFourteen presumed dead while dozens remain missing in southern part of countryMore than 75,000 evacuated in southern region after landslides and torrential rainZheng Yanxiong will work with police to stamp out pro-democracy demonstrationsNorth Korea claims to have no cases of Covid-19 despite links with ChinaBeijing enraged at plan to help up to 3m residents in fallout over national security lawAt least nine charged under Chinese law that critics say strips Hong Kong of rights and freedomsLaw will punish crimes of secession, subversion, terrorism and collusionHot and bothered commuters refuse to wear masks on public transportTesting blitz as recent jump in infections in Australia stokes fears of second waveStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4300032.1594282604!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus melbourne begins six week lockdown after virus spike","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMembers of the Melbourne Fire Brigade (MFB) prepare to take food parcels to residents in a locked down public housing estate in Melbourne. Photograph: William WestAFP via GettyMelbourne began a six-week lockdown on Thursday following a spike in new coronavirus cases, as states around the country tightened internal borders to prevent a second wave sweeping the country.Australia has avoided the high casualty numbers of other countries to the Covid-19 pandemic, which has killed 544,055 people globally, but an outbreak in Australia’s second most populous city prompted the state of Victoria to impose “self isolate” orders for the city’s estimated five million.Victoria on Thursday reported 165 new infections have been detected in the last 24 hours, an increase on the previous day’s 134 cases.Other states and territories have recorded few or zero cases in recent weeks and are continuing to reopen their economies, but Australian prime minister Scott Morrison told residents not to become complacent.“We must continue to follow those social distancing protocols all around Australia, even in states or territories where the number of cases is effectively zero,” Mr Morrison told reporters in Canberra. The northern state of Queensland said it would ban non-residents arriving from Victoria. It will open its borders to people from other states and territories on Friday.Even people travelling from Victoria who were willing to pay for the mandatory 14-day hotel quarantine would be banned, the Queensland government said.“They are making the decision that that two weeks and that cost is worth it to get out of Victoria,” deputy premier Stephen Miles said in a televised news conference.“We don’t want that to continue,” he added.The country’s most populous state, New South Wales, closed its heavily trafficked border to neighbouring Victoria on Wednesday. South Australia also closed its border with Victoria.It came as the number of cases worldwide passed 12 million, according to Johns Hopkins University. CataloniaAll residents and visitors in Catalonia must wear face masks in public at all times, becoming the first Spanish region to toughen a national directive mandating their use when in close proximity to others.The order was announced by regional leader Quim Torra four days after more than 200,000 people in the Segria area were placed under a local lockdown following a series of coronavirus outbreaks there.“Masks will be mandatory all over Catalonia, not just in the Segria region... I think it’s an important measure,” Torra told the regional parliament. “We will distribute protective equipment.”Another Spanish region took a similar decision shortly afterwards. Authorities in the Basque Country made masks mandatory regardless of the distance between people in the small town of Ordizia, where another cluster of nearly 50 cases has been detected, said the region’s health counsellor.Spanish authorities last month made wearing masks compulsory indoors and outdoors in all circumstances in which 1.5 metres (5ft) of social distancing could not be maintained, and until a coronavirus cure or vaccine is found.Torra’s order removed that social distancing exception for Catalonia, making masks compulsory in all social situations.The tougher measure aims to stave off a relaxation in attitudes towards the virus observed among some citizens, officials said.Masks will be mandatory in Catalonia for people above six years old outdoors and in any indoors space open to the public regardless of the physical distance between people, regional government spokeswoman Meritxell Budo told a press briefing.Breaking this obligation will result in a €100 fine, she added.The pandemic has hit Spain harder than most other European countries, causing more than 28,000 deaths and close to 270,000 infections, according to official data.In Italy, also badly affected, the same strict mask-wearing rules are in effect until July 14th in regional Covid-19 epicentre Lombardy. Elsewhere in the country, wearing masks is not obligatory outside for those who can keep a safe distance from others.IndiaIndia has reported nearly 25,000 new coronavirus infections as the disease continues to spread through the nation of nearly 1.4 billion people.The virus is showing no signs of slowing in the worst-affected countries — the United States, Brazil and India.The three nations account for more than 60 per cent of new cases, according to recent tallies from Johns Hopkins University.In India, where the death toll has risen above 21,000, research by the Institute of Mathematical Sciences in Chennai shows that the reproduction rate of the virus ticked up in the first week of July to about 1.2 after it had steadily fallen from a peak of 1.8 in March.The rate needs to be below one for new cases to start falling. Health experts say the true extent of the virus’s spread in India is unknown and that the country must test more given its enormous population.The US reported nearly 59,000 new daily cases, just short of the record 60,000 cases set a day earlier, as President Donald Trump insisted that schools reopen in the autumn.Brazil reported nearly 45,000 new cases.The virus has also been spreading rapidly in South Africa, which reported nearly 9,000 new cases in its latest daily update.A provincial health official said 1.5 million graves are being prepared and it is the public’s responsibility “to make sure that we don’t get there”.In the US, the number of confirmed cases has passed 3 million — meaning nearly one in every 100 people has been confirmed as infected — and the number of deaths is more than 132,000.But Mr Trump remains determined to reopen America’s schools despite worries about the virus, and on Wednesday threatened to hold back federal money if school districts do not bring their students back in the autumn.He complained that his own public health officials’ safety guidelines are impractical and too expensive.JapanTokyo reported more than 220 coronavirus cases on Thursday, a record for a single day, even as officials continued to assert that a state of emergency is not necessary.Tokyo governor Yuriko Koike said that increased testing had led to the surge, with authorities encouraging night-time businesses such as host and hostess bars to voluntarily test their staff.Nonetheless, while small in comparison to some global cities, the number came as a shock after the figure had dropped below 100 on Wednesday for the first time in a week. Officials have argued that the recent spike in cases is different from back in April, as the bulk of the infections are from those in their 20s and 30s who are less likely to fall severely ill.New ZealandPolice officers will patrol New Zealand’s quarantine hotels around-the-clock after a number of people – including a man who tested positive for coronavirus – escaped the managed isolation facilities.In two separate incidents in Auckland hotels guests in isolation left their quarantine hotels, with one woman escaping over a hedge, and another man over a small fence.The 32-year-old man – who was away for 70 minutes and visited a busy inner-city supermarket – tested positive for Covid-19. He has since been charged under new public health legislation. He faces a large fine or six months in prison.Government minister Megan Woods said on Thursday “the abscondees are a new phenomenon” and that their carelessness put the health of the whole country at risk. New Zealand has in effect eliminated the virus after a six-week lockdown, with ongoing tight border controls.New arrivals in the country – the majority of whom are New Zealand citizens – have reported growing hostility from New Zealanders, some of whom feel the country’s Covid-free status was being jeopardised.There are 5,648 people in managed isolation and quarantine, and on Thursday a further three new arrivals tested positive for Covid-19. – AgenciesEverything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"middle","story":"Health officials say country in \u0026lsquodangerous place\u0026rsquo after early success in curbing epidemicSpeculation grows that \u0026lsquofire\u0026rsquo may have been deliberate attack on facilityIsrael\u0026rsquos move on West Bank and Trump peace plan blocked by Palestinian rivals\u0026lsquoDefender of Israel\u0026rsquo Boris Johnson says move would be \u0026lsquoviolation of international law\u0026rsquoPlan to annex parts of West Bank condemned by UN commissioner as \u0026lsquodisastrous\u0026rsquoSome 9.3m Syrians are now food insecure, an increase of 1.4m in past six monthsSeparatist insurgents from Balochistan province claim responsibility for attackNo group claimed responsibility for the attack and Taliban has denied involvementThousands of children could die from preventable diseases because of dire state of healthcare, UN warnsArab world unites in opposition and warns of dire consequences if annexation proceedsOnly under-65s can take part and pilgrims will be quarantined before and after pilgrimageWorld community urged to reject move to intensify \u0026lsquoprofound human rights violations\u0026rsquoAmple evidence uncovered of movement\u0026rsquos widespread persecution of Yazidi minority and other ethnic minoritiesSarah Hegazi\u0026rsquos simple gesture at a concert led to outrage, persecution and heartbreakDemonstrations against prices and wages erupt in Sweida and spread to DeraaAnnexation would be incompatible with international law, Maas warnsTerror group ramps up attacks as crises including coronavirus provide opportunityGovernment pressed to speed up talks with IMF and donors to secure funds and halt slideBritish-Iranian woman seeking release after first furlough from jail in Iran since 2016Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4294866.1593715662!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"the abrupt end to brexit talks is not only surprising but perplexing","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBoris Johnson: Has the immediate political scope to move either way on the negotiations. Photograph:   Will OliverEPABut the language on both sides was restrained and Frost’s had none of the belligerence that often characterises his rhetoric towards Brussels. The fact that Barnier chose not to give a press conference was seen by some as another happy augury but it was in fact simply an act of deference towards Angela Merkel and Ursula von der Leyen, who were giving a joint press conference later.Before this week’s talks began, the EU told Britain it was ready to compromise in order to accommodate the red lines Boris Johnson identified in a video conference last month with the presidents of the European institutions.“The EU side had listened carefully to UK prime minister Boris Johnson’s statements in recent weeks, in particular, his request to reach a political agreement quickly, and his red lines: no role for the European Court of Justice in the UK no obligation for the UK to continue to be bound by EU law and an agreement on fisheries that shows Brexit makes a real difference,” Barnier said on Thursday.The Europeans hoped that Britain would respond with a step towards compromise of its own but by the time the talks ended on Thursday, Frost had produced no such offer. During the course of the week, it became clear that unless Britain makes a substantial move within days, there will be no significant progress this month.Judgment callJohnson this week named Frost as his next national security adviser and the chief negotiator’s word carries a rare level of authority in Downing Street. Last October, he successfully urged Johnson to accept the revised withdrawal agreement as the best available deal. He faces a similar judgment call today.The British red lines Barnier spoke about on Thursday are those Johnson identified in last month’s conference call. The two sides are also at odds over the governance structure but Johnson did not mention it on the call and British misgivings about signing up to a single overarching agreement have diminished. Some within the government recognise that it offers opportunities as well as risks.The issue of fisheries is highly charged politically on both sides but neither views a compromise as impossible. Although Britain rejects the concept of binding “level playing field” commitments, it will agree to maintain current employment, environmental and consumer standards.The toughest issue is state aid, with the EU calling for Britain to continue to follow EU rules on a continuing basis. This is problematic for Britain both because it limits the country’s freedom to subsidise indigenous industry and because it would give the ECJ a role in British economic policy.One obstacle in the way of a compromise is the fact that Britain has not yet set out plans for how it wants its own state aid regime to operate after the end of the transition period on December 31st. This leaves the EU unable to evaluate how a system of parallel state aid regimes would work, with both sides agreeing guidelines but regulating separately.While the British accuse the Europeans of being too legalistic, the Europeans complain about British amateurishness. But both sides agree that Johnson wants a deal and that he would like to get it as soon as possible.At the start of the coronavirus pandemic, there was talk around Westminster and Whitehall about how the crisis could reduce – or at least obscure – the impact of failure to agree a deal with the EU. But few now talk about the disruption of a no-deal outcome being lost within the greater disruption caused by coronavirus.Cost of no-dealBank of England governor Andrew Bailey said last week that the British government could have struggled to fund itself if the bank had not intervened with £200 billion of quantitative easing to buy government debt. The cost of a no-deal outcome to the EU talks, on top of the ballooning cost of the coronavirus crisis, would test either Bailey’s patience\u0026nbspor his credibility when he insists the bank is not underwriting the British government’s debt.Donald Trump’s declining political fortunes are also driving Johnson towards an EU deal as he prepares to deal with Joe Biden, a multilateralist whose advisers see Brexit as an expression of right-wing populism. As Suzanne Lynch has reported, Biden and his team are also acutely sensitive to any risk to the peace process and will monitor closely Britain’s implementation of the Northern Ireland protocol.Despite the fall in his approval ratings, Johnson remains in a very strong position with an 80-seat majority in parliament and no prospect of a general election until 2024. He has the immediate political scope to move either way on the negotiations but failure to reach a deal with the EU will make it harder for him to fulfil his government’s domestic agenda and to make a success of Brexit.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

A primary is a traditional election where eligible voters select their candidate privately through a ballot system. A caucus is a public process which sees voters align publicly with their chosen candidate at caucus sites.Based roughly on their share of the vote in each state - states have different rules -\u0026nbspcandidates are assigned a number of “delegates”, which will be sent to represent each state at the Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in July.On March 3rd – Super Tuesday – 14 states and one overseas territory voted. After a faltering start to the primaries that almost saw him written off, former vice-president Joe Biden got his campaign firmly on track with victory in nine states. Though Vermont senator Bernie Sanders finished first in four states, including delegate-rich California, Super Tuesday checked the Sanders momentum after a strong opening to the primaries in Iowa, New Hampshire and\u0026nbspNevada.On March 10th\u0026nbspsix more states vote, with most of the remaining primaries taking place throughout March and April. The final primary contest takes place on June 7th. However, by the end of March, well over 50 per cent of the delegates will have been allocated.In order to be selected as the party’s nominee at the convention in July, a candidate needs a majority of 50 per cent of delegates plus one, so the magic number is 1,991 pledged delegates out of the total of 3,979.However, with four candidates remaining in the race - Elizabeth Warren and Tulsi Gabbard complete the field, after Michael\u0026nbspBloomberg’s\u0026nbspwithdrawal -\u0026nbspit is possible that no one candidate will have a majority of delegates when Democrats convene in July.Though the rules were changed after the 2016 convention following tensions between the Sanders and Hillary Clinton campaigns, so-called superdelegates - unpledged delegates - still play a role. These are senior members of the party – governors, former members of Congress, etc. Their 771 votes come into play if the convention is contested, which is\u0026nbspa possibility.Notably, six of the candidates were asked during a debate in Las Vegas on February 19th if they would support the idea of a candidate winning the nomination if they secured a plurality but not a majority of the delegates. All but one – Sanders – said they were opposed to this. The issue may become a headache for the Democratic Party as the primary process progresses."},{"url":null,"title":"rishi sunak knows mission wean britain permanent covid socialism","story":"Pandemics, wars and national catastrophes pose a particular challenge to free-marketeers. It is not just that they require an enormous dose of centralised, government intervention, policies that are anathema to small-statists in ordinary times. An even greater problem is that central planning and huge expansions in welfare are extraordinarily addictive.“Temporary” programmes have a horrible tendency of becoming the new normal, which is why major shocks usually do more to advance socialism than Left-wing election victories or the scribbling of ideologues, as FA Hayek once noted. It is incumbent upon libertarians to help devise workable, politically possible, incremental solutions that allow countries to rediscover economic freedom when a calamity ends.It is hard to undiscover the magic money tree once its existence has been acknowledged the public’s mindset can shift quickly when they begin to enjoy “free money”, and the “losers” from any attempt at unwinding emergency expenditure tend to shout more loudly than the “winners” (in the form of taxpayers). This has plagued and ruined Conservative governments throughout history, forcing many to pursue proto-socialist policies: even before the virus hit, the tax burden in Britain had hit a multi-decade high.Rishi Sunak, to his great credit, understands this. He was forced to spend in a gargantuan way during the first phase of the crisis, insuring the entire economy against the fastest and largest recession in centuries, but he is determined not to allow coronavirus to usher in a permanent Milibandite settlement. He also doesn’t want to fall into the trap of dismissing the scourge of unemployment, as a few Tories once did: the only question is one of means, not ends. Do we want markets to help us out during the next phase of the fight against the virus, or do we want socialism?His speech on Wednesday is best understood as the first stage in his attempt at charting a conservative, freeish-market route out of lockdown, fighting to create jobs in extremely difficult circumstances. He wants to unwind command and control, and replace it with a more bottom-up form of assistance. He is still intervening in an extreme way – any Chancellor would be at this stage – but is trying to shift and time-limit support in a manner that doesn’t attempt to buck market forces.Sunak’s biggest decision was to end furlough in October, rather than delaying it endlessly, as the likes of Spain have done. While he believes in the “nobility of work”, there is no point in giving people “false hope” by propping up doomed jobs forever. Encouragingly, he is no supporter of Franklin D Roosevelt’s economics.Instead of replacing furlough with massive public sector make-work schemes – the apocryphal example involves paying people to uselessly dig holes before filling them up again – he is trying to support the private sector by cutting the cost of employing staff, helping workers retrain and turbocharging the housing market.His Kickstart scheme may or may not work, but it’s better to subsidise getting young people into employment or training than adding them to the public sector payroll. Ditto traineeships and apprenticeships. The danger here is that the unemployment crisis is shifted to older workers.There are also at least two upsides to “eat out to help out”. It will infuriate the authoritarian health fanatics who hate the idea of people enjoying cheap food, while showing that the Tories care about self-made, often immigrant entrepreneurs. It acknowledges that many restaurants will go bust, but empowers consumers to choose which survive. The policy is therefore far more pro-market than simply subsidising all restaurants equally.The same is true of his “green jobs”. If one is going down that route, better to allow consumers to choose their own projects and providers the command and control solution would be for the state to spend everything itself. These “green” jobs are normal jobs, and the beneficiaries – suburban homeowners and double glazing fitters – part of Johnson’s Tory coalition.The question, of course, is what next. Sunak’s Autumn Budget will need to be a blockbuster. It will need to include genuine deregulatory initiatives and further tax cuts. It was reassuring to hear Boris Johnson earlier decrying the opposition’s call for a wealth tax, and the PM’s new slogan contrasting the Tory “jobs, jobs, jobs” to what he described as Labour’s “tax, tax, tax.”As they face a tsunami of economic pain over the next few months, the Tories must remember that no country has ever taxed itself back to full employment. Free markets work collectivism doesn’t.  Sunak\u0027s statement was a good first step his next challenge will be to unleash an entrepreneurial revolution to create the millions of genuine, unsubsidised jobs Britain will be crying out for.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"bbc free tv licence over 75s means tested","story":"The free TV licence for over-75s will be means-tested from August 1, the BBC has said.The BBC has said it will begin its new scheme covering the over-75s licence fee concession on August 1.BBC chairman Sir David Clementi said: The decision to commence the new scheme in August has not been easy, but implementation of the new scheme will be Covid-19 safe.

We can all eat out to help out.The Chancellor said restaurants participating in the scheme would be able to offer half-price meals every Monday to Wednesday throughout August.This means that everyone in Britain is entitled to discounts at restaurants over a total period of 13 days. Householders will be given grants of up to £10,000 to make their homes more environmentally friendly under a Government scheme that could save them £300 on average energy bills.The £3 billion energy-efficiency plan for homes and public buildings will support 140,000 jobs, save households money and cut carbon emissions, Mr Sunak said.In his summer economic statement, the Chancellor confirmed plans for a £2 billion green homes grant in September to provide vouchers for homeowners and landlords to cover at least two-thirds of the costs of insulation and other energy-efficiency measures.Employers will be given £1,000 for every worker they bring back from furlough as part of a £9.4 billion jobs retention bonus scheme.Under the new programme, businesses will receive a one-off payment for each employee that they have retained at the end of January.Iniduals must be paid at least £520 per month for their employers to qualify for the support in order to ensure they are in “decent work”.Mr Sunak hailed the “significance” of the policy, noting it could cost the Treasury in excess of £9 billion if all 9.4 million furloughed workers return to their jobs.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/07/07/16/coronavirus-bitcoin.jpg","title":"coronavirus bitcoin price trading south america covid 19 cases venezuela","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.\u0027The impact that Covid-19 has had on the cryptocurrency industry is huge,\u0027 analyst saysBitcoin trading has risen significantly in several South American countries currently experiencing a surge in new coronavirus cases, a study has revealed.Countries including Argentina, Chile and Colombia bucked a trend that saw the volume of bitcoin trading drop globally between 2019 and 2020.Cryptocurrency trades on the LocalBitcoins platform fell by more than a third in total – falling from £537 million to £337m – but rose in volume by nearly a quarter in Chile and more than doubled in Argentina.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesData gathered by investment publication Invezz revealed the dramatic impact the coronavirus has had on bitcoin trading.

The NASUWT teachers\u0027 union has asked the government for more information, including over how classroom teaching will carry on in the event of staff absences and what extra support will be available to help schools establish a safe return. Their general secretary said “a significant number of measures” laid out in the guidance for a full reopening in September “require additional resources” in a letter to the education secretary, which urged the government to address the concerns of teachers and school leaders before all students are welcomed back in two months’ time.  Sharing the full story, not just the headlines“How schools will be able to fund these additional expectations is a key question we are being asked,” Dr Patrick Roach said in the letter to Gavin Williamson. As well as mentioning extra funding, NASUWT said teachers and headteachers have also raised questions around protections for clinically vulnerable staff and extra cleaning provisions. What are the UK lockdown rules now?How to ease yourself back into socialising once lockdown liftsThe new lost generationWhich countries are seeing a second wave of coronavirus?How to wear a face mask safelyDr Roach also urged Mr Williamson to address concerns over “the logistical challenge” of getting enough school transport so children from different year groups and schools would not have to mix.He asked the education secretary to design a ”coordinated national plan” for the safe and full reopening of schools in September that addresses the ”many practical and logistical issues” teachers and headteachers have raised.The Department for Education (DfE) said last week “detailed plans” have been released for schools and colleges in England to welcome back all students from September following disruption due to the coronavirus outbreak. Certain year groups, including Year 1 and Year 6, were allowed back from the start of June. Mr Williamson has said it will be “compulsory” for all pupils to go back to school in September.Why Gavin Williamson can’t afford to mess up the reopening of schools“The NASUWT recognises the importance of schools reopening to all children as soon as it is safe to do so,” Dr Roach, the general secretary, said.“Schools have only a few weeks before they close for the summer break,” he added. “Teachers and headteachers need urgent clarification from the DfE if they are to be able to meet the guidance on September reopening consistently and safely.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The education secretary said: “The very best place for children to be is in the classroom, which is why we have set out our plans for all young people to return to education full-time from September.”Mr Williamson added: “I want to reassure parents and families that we are doing everything we can to make sure schools are as safe as possible for children and staff, and will continue to work closely with the country’s best scientific and medical experts to ensure that is the case.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Health minister Nadine Dorries has told MPs she was left “shocked but incredibly angry” at what the “harrowing” evidence revealed by the Cumberlege inquiry published yesterday.The report by Baroness Julia Cumberlege revealed tens of thousands of women and children suffered avoidable harm because of the continued use of epilepsy drug sodium valproate in pregnancy, hormone pregnancy test Primodus and pelvic mesh implants.Responding to the inquiry’s final report Nadine Dorries MP, herself a former nurse, said the government would need time to respond to the recommendations but she said: “I have watched and read some of the testimonies. They left me shocked, but also incredibly angry. And most of all determined to make the changes that are needed to protect women in the future.”Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesPatients at risk from unsafe medicines and implants, inquiry revealsShe said the report “makes for harrowing reading, every page makes clear the pain and suffering that has been felt by so many patients and their families”.The patient safety minister said the healthcare system had to do better in the future: “The task now is to establish a quicker and more compassionate way to address issues of patient harm when they arise.“We must ensure that the system as a whole is vigilant in spotting safety concerns.“We must make sure that different voices are invited to the table and we must also make sure that patients and their families have a clear pathway to get better answers, and a resolution.”She also told MPs she believed there was an “unintentional bias” against women in healthcare when women raise safety concerns and she pointed to repeated health scandals affecting “women only issues.”She added: “I know that there will be strong feelings from across the House about this report, and that honourable members will be eager to hear a fuller response. However, it is imperative for the sake of those who have suffered so greatly that we give this review the full consideration, it absolutely deserves.”Former health secretary Jeremy Hunt, who established the Cumberlege inquiry in 2018 told MPs: I commissioned this report because I knew that many lives have been ruined because we didn\u0027t act quickly enough to deal with problems in these three areas, but I have to say the results are far more shocking and disturbing than I ever imagined.He warned the issue was far bigger than the three drugs and devices looked at by the inquiry and urged ministers to support the central recommendation of a patient safety commissioner.Mr Hunt also urged his successor as health secretary Matt Hancock to respond to the inquiry before the end of September.Liberal Democrat acting leader Ed Davy said: We want to see the conclusions implemented as soon as possible. We want to see the compensation for the women and their adult children, but I also want to see criminal charges brought against the real perpetrators of this scandal.

If there are any clumps of stars that are moving together in a particular fashion, that usually tells us that there is a reason that they\u0027re moving together, said Lina Necib, a postdoctoral scholar in theoretical physics at Caltech, who led the study, in a statement.To find the stars now known as Nyx, researchers combined two major projects that look to catalogue the workings of our galaxy. They were the FIRE project which is creating detailed simulations of the galaxy based on our full understanding of how they form and change over time, which worked alongside the Gaia space observatory\u0027s project to produce a full 3D map of our Milky Way and those stars beyond it, which hopes to catalogue about a billion stars.Researchers hope to use both experiments to try and understand how the vast Milky Way that includes our own Sun came about. But the new breakthrough came from using the two together – they first tracked the movements of stars as they moved through the virtual galaxy, and watched for ways to understand whether they had formed within the galaxy or if they had arrived there from elsewhere, and then comparing that with real data from Gaia to understand where real stars are likely to have come from.More than 30 planets in galaxy could have alien life, researchers sayWhen the two pieces were combined, the researchers found thta there appeared to be a huge, unexpected structure in the data. There seemed to be a cluster of 250 stars that was rotating alongside the Milky Way, but heading towards its centre.Your first instinct is that you have a bug, said Necib in a statement. And you\u0027re like, \u0027Oh no!\u0027 So, I didn\u0027t tell any of my collaborators for three weeks. Then I started realizing it\u0027s not a bug, it\u0027s actually real and it\u0027s new.After checking through the literature to ensure it had not been discovered before, she realised that the cluster was actually a previously unknown stream of stars that had found their way into our galaxy and never been seen before. It was named Nyx, after the Greek goddess of the night.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s groundbreaking decade of space exploration: In pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Mystic Mountain, a pillar of gas and dust standing at three-light-years tall, bursting with jets of gas from fledgling stars buried within, was captured by Nasa\u0027s Hubble Space Telescope in February 2010The first ever selfie taken on an alien planet, captured by Nasa\u0027s Curiosity Rover in the early days of its mission to explore Mars in 2012Death of a star: This image from Nasa\u0027s Chandra X-ray telescope shows the supernova of Tycho, a star in our Milky Way galaxyArrokoth, the most distant object ever explored, pictured here on 1 January 2019 by a camera on Nasa\u0027s New Horizons spaceraft at a distance of 4.1 billion miles from EarthAn image of the Large Magellanic Cloud galaxy seen in infrared light by the Herschel Space Observatory in January 2012.

The broadcaster was due to introduce means-testing at the start of June.As a result of the new policy, more than three million households will need to pay the £157.50 fee from August, according to the BBC. Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesSir David Clementi, the chairman of the BBC, said: The decision to commence the new scheme in August has not been easy, but implementation of the new scheme will be Covid-19 safe. The BBC could not continue delaying the scheme without impacting on programmes and services.Sir Clementi added that around 1.5 million household could be exempt from paying for their TV licences if someone is over 75 and receives Pension Credit. He also stressed that it was the government rather than the BBC that set and controlled who benefited from this measure.BBC to cut around 450 jobs across England BBC tells staff ‘not to wear Black Lives Matter badges on screen’Like most organisations the BBC is under severe financial pressure due to the pandemic, yet we have continued to put the public first in all our decisions. I believe continuing to fund some free TV licences is the fairest decision for the public, as we will be supporting the poorest oldest pensioners without impacting the programmes and services that all audiences love, he added. The BBC agreed to take on responsibility for funding the scheme as part of the charter agreement hammered out with the Government in 2015.Without the new means-testing system in place, the corporation said free TV licences would have cost it as much as £1bn a year because of the UK\u0027s ageing population.  However, the decision to scrap the free licence fees for over-75s has received criticism.  Caroline Abrahams, charity director at Age UK, said last week that it would be a tragedy if old people lost the support, information and companionship they receive from their TV from August because they could not afford the licence. Covid-19 was a chance for the BBC to strip the Proms of its jingoismSpeaking in the House of Commons before the announcement, Christian Matheson, the shadow culture minister, said pensioners would be forced to choose between eating and watching TV if the free licence policy was scrapped. In response, culture minister Matt Warman said it was deeply disappointing that the BBC appeared to still be pursuing this course of action.

To claim universal credit, EU citizens must show they are habitually resident in Britain through the HRT, and in doing so prove their “right to reside”, which depends on factors including work history, whether they have children in school and the circumstances of any partner.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe report states the test has “considerable flaws” and imposes “unnecessary hardship” on claimants due to challenges in providing the correct documentation and proving employment in the UK is “genuine and effective”. An analysis of Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) figures by the think tank showed around 45,000 universal credit claims were closed because of HRT failures in the last 12 months of available data. This accounted for about 10 per cent of all those who took the test, around half of whom are estimated to be EU citizens.New universal credit claimants having to skip meals, charities warnEU nationals could be denied UK citizenship by new Home Office tests EU citizens applying for settled status plummets during pandemicThe report states the number of claims will likely have increased “dramatically” due to Covid-19, meaning thousands are likely going without government support and facing unnecessary financial hardship.In one case, a self-employed French citizen working in the creative industries, who has lived in the UK for more than 10 years, lost work in March because of the pandemic. After applying for universal credit, she was called by the jobcentre and asked a series of questions about her work history to determine whether she passed the test. The woman was asked to collect documentation on her income stretching back to 2009, and later told she had failed the test without explanation, only that her income may have been too low to be considered “genuine”.“I was not even aware that it was called the ‘habitual residence test’ until I received the outcome and I was told that I failed it,” she said. “I had no idea what was going on and it wasn’t clear what they were looking for.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailEU nationals who have been in the UK for five years or more can apply for EU settled status – which means they are automatically treated as having a right to reside and, therefore, would not have to pass the HRT when applying for benefits.However, those who have been in the UK for fewer than five years receive pre-settled status, which means they will still need to prove their right to reside as before. How benefit denials could force EU citizens to work through pandemicThe IPPR report also warned that the HRT is “shrouded in secrecy” and that more transparency on the test is “urgently needed” because “very little research” has been conducted into how the test operates in universal credit claims and whether it works as intended.The government has released no statistics on the operation of the HRT in regard to universal credit and has refused numerous requests for information from both the public and MPs on costs grounds. “Given the straightforward nature of some of these questions, this raises serious questions about the government’s ability to monitor the operation of its own policies in this area,” states the report.Marley Morris, the associate director for immigration at the IPPR, said Boris Johnson should “make good on” his words of praise for the contribution of EU citizens during the pandemic and suspend the test for the duration of the immediate economic crisis. This, he said, would “cut bureaucracy at the DWP, relieve the pressures on councils and provide a lifeline for EU citizens who have made the UK their home”.“EU citizens are at the sharp end of this crisis – with many working in vulnerable sectors, such as hospitality and retail, and at serious risk of redundancy,” he added. “Yet the government’s flawed HRT risks barring many from accessing universal credit, leaving them with no safety net as the economic crisis unfolds.”Dame Gillian Guy, chief executive of Citizens Advice, said the charity had seen some people failing the test despite meeting all the criteria, and others struggling to meet the stringent evidence requirements, with the pandemic having made gathering and submitting this paperwork even harder than usual.“Suspending the HRT for the duration of the crisis is vital for people to get the support they need, especially while large numbers need to claim universal credit to afford food, rent and other essentials, she said.Stephen Timms MP, the chair of the Work and Pensions Committee, said: “I welcome this research, which shines an invaluable light on this little known and poorly defined feature of the benefit system. I hope the research will strengthen the case to reform it.”Maike Bohn, the co-founder of the3million, said: “EU citizens have to pass a strict, complex test in an opaque system with little or no easy-to-understand guidance. Erroneous decisions appear plenty and can take a long time to challenge, meanwhile, people are without that vital financial help they need to prevent destitution and homelessness.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Players take a knee in support of the Black Lives Matter movement on the first day of the first Test cricket match between England and the West Indies at the Ageas Bowl in SouthamptonA circus performer from the Association of Circus Proprietors in Whitehall, London.

The Met Office has predicted the hottest day of the year “This situation has been considerably exacerbated by the pandemic as more people are losing jobs and face destitution. The challenges of isolation and limited contact with advice services also serve to make the situation worse.”A DWP spokesperson said: “This government is committed to supporting people affected by Covid-19 and has implemented an enormous package of measures to do so such as income protection schemes, mortgage holidays and additional security for renters - which are all open to those with no recourse to public funds - as well as injecting over £6.5bn into the welfare system.“EU citizens who are exercising a qualifying right to reside and are habitually resident in the UK will pass the HRT and can access income-related benefits. EU nationals can also apply to the  Home Office EU settlement scheme to prove their right to reside.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Several areas in England are experiencing a surge in new coronavirus cases, with places in the North West appearing most at risk to a second wave of infections similar to the one seen in Leicester.The latest figures from Public Health England reveal Bradford and neighbouring Kirklees in West Yorkshire have seen high numbers of daily confirmed cases in recent days.Higher infection rates in Leicester prompted the government to introduce a local lockdown just weeks after nationwide containment measures first began to ease.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesFollowing Leicester’s lockdown last week, epidemiologist Professor Neil Ferguson warned that more localised lockdowns in the UK are “inevitable”.The former government adviser said that an estimated 8 per cent of the UK population has so far been infected, and that the pandemic is still in its “early stages”.Leicester remains the worst affected area in England in terms of cumulative case rate, with more than 1,000 people per 100,000 residents having been infected by Covid-19.Other areas to have experienced similarly high case rates include Ashford in Kent and Barrow-in-Furness in Cumbria, however both places have seen new cases fall substantially since May.The rate of new coronavirus infections in Ashford began to flatten off in early June, according to data collected by PHE. By contrast, daily cases in Leicester appeared to accelerate at around the same time.A similar surge occurred in Kirklees, despite the curve initially appearing to flatten one month ago. The number of new daily cases consistently fell below 20 in the first week of June, before spiking to more than 40 on 11 June.In Bradford, the number of new cases fell significantly in late May, before rising again throughout June. Unlike Kirklees, however, the rate of new infections appears to be once again slowing.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

To start with, he will make 36,000 face coverings a week, but the size and scope of the factory means he will be able to scale up production and make up to 500 million coverings annually.The coverings are disposable and made up of three-ply non-woven plastic material – meaning they are water resistant and can be worn for up to 24 hours. He will sell the coverings from his website – they will cost £3.79 for 10, or £2.99 if consumers subscribe for weekly deliveries.On donating thousands to The Felix Project, the teenager said: “I want to support those who are helping others in this crisis.” Mark Curtin, of The Felix Project, said: “These Signature Masks will help protect volunteers and staff in our food redistribution warehouses.”Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Viruferrin has been scientifically proven to block 98 per cent of similar viruses to Covid-19, including influenza and Sars.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe snood-like coverings can be worn for up to 50 hours before they need washing, and their effectiveness only drops to 96 per cent after over 200 hours of wear.The face coverings are cut and sewn together by Cookson \u0026amp Clegg in Blackburn, which is run by Patrick Grant, star of the Great British Sewing Bee. He is also behind a campaign to get Britons making their own coverings, The Great Community Sew.How to support our campaignThe coverings, which retail at £20, are different to medical grade PPE used by NHS workers. However, due to the protein coverings they are more effective than standard face masks at protecting wearers from viruses.There was a buzz at the Royal Park Felix Project depot when boxes of Virustatic Shield coverings arrived.David Clark, who has been volunteering for three years, said: “I think it is important to wear these face coverings when you’re delivering to members of the public who potentially come into contact with vulnerable people.”Mr Clark dropped off some coverings to Ian Breen, centre manager at Acton Homeless Concern, which serves hot meals five days a week to those in temporary accommodation or on the streets. Mr Breen said: “It is fantastic to have a delivery of some masks for free. It is important to protect those working here and the people who use our centre.”Gretchen Fisher, from Ealing, who has been volunteering for four years, added: “I wear them whenever I go out as you have to protect others.” Mantas Keblis, the depot manager, said that having “extra precautions” would help food reach more people in London. “Everyone really likes them. They are very comfortable to wear.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

And today, because of the enormous generosity of Virustatic Shield, whose innovative anti-viral snoods we’ve also been producing, 10,000 of London’s most vulnerable people will receive a vital face covering, delivered to them via The Independent’s fantastic campaign.Which star will you bid for in Peter Blake’s big hotel cover auction?Help the Hungry: Our readers help us reach £6.5mHow Help The Hungry is helping refugees forced to live on £5 a day It is now mandatory to wear face coverings on public transport, but these coverings are in short supply.That’s why we started The Big Community Sew to encourage people to make face coverings for their friends and neighbours, and by doing so preserve vital supplies of PPE for NHS workers and care home staff who are fighting this virus on the frontline.The science behind face coverings is simple: they help prevent the wearer from unwittingly spreading the disease.

Each section features a famous face, including Morgan Freeman, Whoopi Goldberg and Sir Paul McCartney, and is signed by Sir Peter, 87.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesProceeds will go to two beneficiaries, including The Independent\u0027s Help The Hungry Now appeal partner The Felix Project.Today, Ms Lumley said it was an “honour” to be part of the fundraising effort.

It is a fabulous way of making life worth living.”Help the Hungry: Our readers help us reach £6.5mDame Judi said: “How wonderful that Peter Blake’s amazing artwork will have a new lease of life for such good causes.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Our Help The Hungry appeal today passed the £7m mark, enabling our appeal partner, The Felix Project, to deliver the equivalent of 4.3 million meals to hungry schoolchildren and vulnerable Londoners in the 12 weeks since lockdown began.The milestone was reached thanks to more significant corporate donations, including an additional £100,000 from online grocer Ocado, taking its total donation to £390,000, and a further £90,000 from banking group Citi boosting their aggregate give to £250,000.It comes as the charity Feeding Britain warns that 3 million children face the prospect of hunger during the upcoming school holidays. Of these, it cautions, only 1 million are eligible for the government’s free school meal summer holiday voucher of £15 a week, with the remaining 2 million living with parents who narrowly do not qualify but cannot always afford food.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHelen Barnard, of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, confirmed that the summer voucher scheme – agreed by the prime minister after being forced into a U-turn by footballer Marcus Rashford – only covers a minority of children in poverty. She said: “Soaring numbers of families are being pulled under and having to rely on food banks to get through the current crisis, even with the voucher scheme in place.”The harsh reality is that an astounding 66 per cent of food-insecure families – amounting to almost 200,000 children in London – cannot access government help and are forced to rely on food parcels from charities such as The Felix Project.Food and 10,000 face coverings donated to charities and vulnerableWhich star will you bid for in Peter Blake’s big hotel cover auction?Help the Hungry: Our readers help us reach £6.5mHow Help The Hungry is helping refugees forced to live on £5 a day At the start of lockdown, The Felix Project faced an existential crisis with a total collapse of its fundraising. Thanks to The Independent’s campaign, it has not only been able to survive but has operated at twice its normal capacity, delivering up to 40 tons of nutritious produce a day and supplying 86 schools and 400 charities and community hubs across the capital over the course of a week.The Independent shareholder Evgeny Lebedev said: “These generous new donations take us 70 per cent of the way towards our goal to secure £10m to combat food poverty in London over the next three years. Our pledge is given added urgency by the release of worrying economic data, including that the number of people out of work and claiming benefits jumped 23 per cent to 2.8 million last month.”Jo West, of Ocado Retail, said most of its donation had been raised from Ocado and their customers via their “you give, we give” scheme. She added: “We’re extremely grateful to our customers for their generosity which enables groups like The Felix Project to bring food to people in desperate need.” James Murray, chair of the Bridgepoint Charitable Trust, which donated £50,000, said: “We are delighted to contribute to the work of The Felix Project in feeding vulnerable communities.”Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I would not be here if it wasn’t for this project,’ one helper saysWhat has it been like to volunteer during the pandemic? Social enterprise Bread n Butter – one of the charities supplied by our Help The Hungry appeal partner, The Felix Project – closed its doors at the end of March.However, its founders saw a growing need among the city’s most vulnerable for regular home-cooked, nutritious meals, so they joined with community centres Stonegrove Community Trust and the Hive Trust.Since then, Bread n Butter’s team, aided by volunteers, have been cooking and delivering more than 1,000 meals a day to Londoners in need in Barnet, Enfield and Brent. Here, we speak to four people who keep this project going.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesRichard Simon, a furloughed IT worker, joined the Stonegrove Community Trust’s OneStonegrove project in Edgware at his wife’s suggestion. The 52-year-old said: “Working in the kitchens was like being on Ready Steady Cook. You don’t know what ingredients you’re going to be working with, so you have to think on your feet.” The father of two, who dedicates 20 hours a week, added that the biggest thing he had learnt was the power of “working together”.“For a group of people who don’t know each other, we just get on with it, working flat out.

The former Oxfam shop worker, who has high-functioning autism, said that because of her condition, having a “structured day” is incredibly important. “Without routine, I can’t cope,” she said. “I would not be here if it wasn’t for this project.”Ms Karbritz, who is also anorexic, said working with food had been transformative. “Working to create healthy, nutritious food everyday has changed my relationship with it. I have also learned how to cook, whereas before I lived out of tins.”Mariana Bassi Da Silva, a software developer, wanted to volunteer as she was not working due to the pandemic. A keen cook, the 34-year-old volunteered for OneStonegrove and said the project had helped develop her love of cooking. The Brazilian-Italian, who moved to London seven years ago, said the greatest impact the project has had on her was the sense of “belonging”.“It is hard to settle in when you move,” she said. “Here, I have a community.

Despite the vast differences between the two situations, Fawcett’s extensive military experiences and qualifications have helped him and his team develop a robust response to the Covid-19 crisis.Sharing the full story, not just the headlines“I was the only doctor there for about 300 people, which was quite an eye-opening experience,” says Fawcett of his first stint in Afghanistan in 2007 as part of the Army Reserves. Working at the Role 2E Field Hospital in Camp Bastion and at the Forward Operating Base, Fawcett provided key treatment on the Afghanistan frontline.On his second stint in 2007, he spent three months in Camp Bastion as a Trauma Team Leader, and on his third tour in 2011, he was the clinical lead for the Medical Emergency Response Team, a four-person medical team operating from a Chinook flying over Afghanistan, picking up wounded soldiers on the battlefield.What’s more, Fawcett – who also counts a role with the Midlands Air Ambulance Charity as a helicopter doctor amongst his impressive repertoire – has completed an MSc in Disaster Healthcare. Playing an instrumental part of Stoke hospital’s response to the Coronavirus pandemic is just one more string to his bow.“I was able to take a lot of stuff I learnt and apply it from the very start,” Fawcett says of putting his Masters in Disaster Healthcare into practise. “Before the patients even get to the emergency department, we make sure there’s clear boundaries, and patients are directed to the right areas to avoid any cross-contamination.”His army tours also contributed: “Looking at the designs of how they set up field hospitals and stuff helps,” he adds. “And working with international colleagues – it’s good to get a non-UK perspective on how other countries deal with certain circumstances.”This involved an overhaul of the whole emergency area and its processes. “We now run two emergency medicine departments out of one department,” he explains. “We’ve had to basically split the whole department in half.”Now, Stoke hospital features red zones and green zones: the former is for those displaying potential Covid symptoms and the latter is for those who aren’t. As such, the pathways and patient-flow of the hospital have had to be changed to avoid any instances of contact between these areas.“We have separate ambulance entrances for red and green patients. We have two resuscitation departments, two areas for major patients, two areas for walk-in patients, two minor injuries areas, two paediatrics departments, as well as designing alternative pathways to try and stream those patients that don’t have to come through the emergency department to other places.” he explains, noting how such isions have had to be executed throughout the whole hospital to prevent crowding and maintain social distancing.How schools in England are helping pupils return to the classroomThe task may have been monumental, but Fawcett takes pride in the hospital’s response: “This is what we’ve always trained for and it’s been good to see how us as an emergency department have responded to it.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.The head of HM Revenue and Customs has told Rishi Sunak he cannot certify his flagship £1,000 job retention scheme as value for money because of uncertainty about its cost and the number of jobs it will save.The tax authority\u0027s chief executive Jim Harra voiced his concerns in a letter to the chancellor on the eve of Wednesday\u0027s emergency mini-budget in which the £9 billion scheme was unveiled as the centrepiece of Mr Sunak\u0027s bid to avoid a wave of redundancies when furlough arrangements cease on 31 October.Meanwhile, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has warned the country cannot afford the dead weight of payments which may go to companies under the scheme for millions of jobs which are not under any threat.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesUnder the scheme, employers will receive £1,000 for every furloughed employee who remains in post until the end of January 2021 on a salary of at least £520 a month.With some 9m people benefiting from state-funded furlough payments of up to £2,500 a month during lockdown, the scheme could cost £9bn.Created with Sketch.Rankin unveils portraits of NHS workers on the coronavirus frontline Show all 12Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Midwife, University Hospital Coventry and WarwickshireSuperintendent Pharmacist, Bedminster Pharmacy in BristolMidwife, University Hospital Coventry and WarwickshireSuperintendent Pharmacist, Bedminster Pharmacy in BristolBut Mr Sunak himself has admitted that it will not be possible to limit payments only to those who would otherwise have lost their jobs.What are the UK lockdown rules now?How to ease yourself back into socialising once lockdown liftsThe new lost generationWhich countries are seeing a second wave of coronavirus?How to wear a face mask safelyAnd experts have warned that, while companies will happily pocket the cash for staff who they intended to retain anyway, many will not regard the £1,000 flat-rate payment as sufficient incentive to keep those who are no longer needed.In his letter to the chancellor, Mr Harra requested a ministerial direction – a formal order to go ahead with a scheme which would otherwise breach his responsibilities as accounting officer to ensure that his department’s activities deliver value for money.Mr Harra said while there was a “sound policy rationale” for the scheme, “the advice that we have both received highlights uncertainty around the value for money of this proposal”.“It has proved difficult to establish a counterfactual for this scheme, which depends on the overall cost of the scheme and the number of extra jobs it would protect both of which are currently highly uncertain,” he said.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.First time buyers will be left “worse off” by the scrapping of stamp duty for most purchases during the pandemic, a think-tank is suggesting.House prices will rise as some of the tax break is captured by sellers, the Institute for Fiscal Studies warned – which will punish first time buyers already largely exempt from the levy.“This is a group that might actually be made worse off by the policy,” said Helen Miller, the IFS’s deputy director.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesShe argued that, when those taking the first step on the housing ladder were the only group escaping stamp duty, they “retained” the benefit.“Now it is across the whole market, it’s more likely that prices will rise and therefore first time buyers could be left keeping less of the discount,” Ms Miller added.Sunak warns \u0027hardship lies ahead\u0027 and apologises to those lacking helpThe warning came as the IFS also questioned Rishi Sunak’s £10-a-head ‘eat out to help out’ discount on restaurant meals next monthMs Miller argued the problems facing restaurants might be caused more by an inability to accommodate customers – because of social distancing rules – rather than a lack of demand.It was also “odd” to exclude takeaways, where more businesses could be helped, facing fewer such constraints.“Just a week ago we thought the risks of eating in restaurants were sufficiently high that we banned it,” Ms Miller said.Created with Sketch.Coronavirus: The global gap in education Show all 12Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.“Now we are effectively saying that, in August, we are going to make takeaways relatively more expensive than eating in, even for the same food eaten from the same establishments.”The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Here are some of the measures that schools are implementing to make the transition easier for pupils, staff and parentsIn association with the UK GovernmentHinchingbrooke School is an academy school in Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire, with more than 1,900 pupils and 200 staff. Teachers started welcoming back A-level students last week.“We’ve only had the Year 12s in so far, but for them it was really clear they were delighted to be back,” says Mark Patterson, school principal, pictured above. “You could see it on their faces. It’s getting back to some sense of routine, structure and normality.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHe continues: “I think a lot of them have been surprised by how much they’ve missed school. I think if you’d asked them before lockdown ‘Would you like a week off?’, they’d have said ‘Please!’. I bet if you asked them now, they’d say ‘Can I come back?’. I think the parents and students now realise how important school is.”Prior to the return, teachers organised a virtual assembly for Year 10 and 12 pupils, and sent a booklet home detailing the new guidelines which would be in place.5 back-to-school tips for parents\u0026nbsp“Don\u0027t give them a lot of small instructions – recognise your child would have had an enormous amount of\u0026nbspinstructions during the course of the day.”“If you are rewarding your child\u0027s behaviour, it\u0027s very important to do it every time.”“For a child who\u0027s been finding it tough,\u0026nbsptalking to another child who\u0027s been in the same situation is by far the best way of letting it out.”“It\u0027s important to encourage a child to work for themselves and get on with their own inner task.”New measures include red circles marked on the ground that are two metres apart and one-way systems throughout the school.“We’ve reorganised all the classrooms that we’re using so the desks and chairs are two metres apart,” Patterson explains. “We’ve got designated areas set aside at break and lunchtime for each group to go to, and we’ve got signage around the school reminding everybody of the importance of hygiene, frequent hand washing and keeping their distance.”Implementing new measuresRheeya Makwana is one of the Year 12 students who has returned to Hinchingbrooke. “We’ve been having online lessons and voiceover PowerPoints, but it’s not really the same as being in a classroom,” she says. “The structure was really good and I felt like I learned a lot more being back at school. I came home in such a good mood.”Rheeya’s father Yogesh Makwana did have some initial worries about his daughter returning to school: “There’s always some concern, but all the communication from school has been excellent in the build up to it and all the measures that have been put in place have reassured us. If you offered our 13-year-old the chance to go back to school tomorrow, he’d do it in a heartbeat. He misses his classes the social interaction. He loves PE and he does so much at school that he misses.Year 10 pupils Vahine and Lucia will also be returning to the school this week. “The twins are really looking forward to it,” says their mother, Alesia Dickinson. “They’ve been messaging all their friends to find out what group they’re in. Less than a week after we said yes to going back we found out what bubbles they were in and we had clear guidelines about times, rooms and what they can expect when they go back to school. They’re raring to go.”Both Makwana and Dickinson agree that their children have missed the structure of school lessons and that the transition back to the classroom has been easier than expected. “I think it’s a positive thing,” says Dickinson. “I think it’s a step in the right direction. We need to let the children start that process.”Going back to Embark schoolsTrust leader at Embark Matthew Crawford, pictured below, has been welcoming back primary pupils to the Federation’s schools across Derbyshire.“The feedback we have had so far from all the schools across the Trust is that it’s going really well in terms of welcoming the children back,” he says. “It’s not a one-size-fits-all. Each school has done a risk assessment based on what they can do.”Most Embark schools are now back at around 25-30 per cent capacity, Crawford says. It\u0027s up from around two per cent when lockdown began, when it was just key workers’ children and more vulnerable pupils in the classroom.“It’s lovely to hear the children playing and see schools becoming vibrant again,” he adds. “As soon as lockdown began, we started work on our Reconnection to Recovery and Resilience programme, a nine-stage support package to welcome children back safely.”Keyworker Vicki Ellis has two children who have returned to one of Embark\u0027s schools Richardson Endowed Primary - Amelia in Year 3 and Darcey in Year 1, pictured below.The first day the girls were back I was wondering how they were all day. I knew the school had done everything possible to welcome the children back in a happy, positive way but I worried whether Amelia and Darcey were enjoying themselves. But when they came home they were so happy to have had that day at school – and eager to go back next day. Crawford explains that the school has tried to make the transition back to the classroom as fun as possible for the children: “We’re following the guidelines but in a way that’s fun for the children. We aren’t marking big Xs on the floor. Some of our schools, for example, are painting snakes in bright colours to show the way.”Embark has also shared its programme with schools as far as Devon, Durham, South Gloucestershire and Wales.“It’s a suite of resources and activities that schools can adapt to their own settings, taking the bits that work for them,” explains Crawford. “It’s lovely that the brilliant work of our staff is making a difference and impacting the lives of millions of children across the country, not just the 3,000 within our Trust.”Information in this article applies to schools in England only.

But when coronavirus hit in March, Ireland’s biggest sportswear brand had to break the habit of a lifetime and sack its entire 750-strong workforce at its Strabane factory due to the lockdown.With sports events cancelled or postponed, orders from teams and retailers vanished.However, the company was thrown a surprise lifeline when, a day after announcing the layoffs, the Western Health and Social Care Trust approached O’Neills on a Friday about fulfilling a shortage of scrubs to safeguard frontline NHS workers.Factory staff spent that weekend making sample scrubs. By the Monday, O’Neills had secured an order for 10,000 sets of maroon tops and trousers for GPs at a coronavirus testing centre at Altnagelvin Area Hospital, Londonderry.As a result, the company rehired 150 workers immediately. It has since brought back more than 400 staff overall as orders from other health trusts across Northern Ireland grew, with the remaining 350 employees being furloughed.The company now produces some 10,000 sets of scrubs a week. Managing director Kieran Kennedy, a veteran of 41 years at the business, says employees have been supportive of the switch from making sporting goods.“We are a close-knit community in Strabane. Many employees know people who work in the NHS and they want to give back,” he explains. “We could either feel sorry for ourselves or be productive and take a bite at the cherry. Without the NHS orders, we would have had no sales and no cash flow. The scrubs kept the show on the road.”Kennedy says the move outside the company’s traditional business area has been relatively easy. For instance, O’Neills had stockpiled a six-month supply of yarn – the raw material for the scrubs and other clothing – from China to hedge against Brexit uncertainty. The company knits the scrubs at its Strabane factory, then dyes and coats them with anti-viral substances at its production plant in Dublin.Workers on the factory floors are social distancing, as well as wearing face masks, sanitising their hands and having their temperature checked.Kennedy is upbeat on the company’s future prospects, noting that big sporting fixtures are returning, which should boost sales and enable him to rehire more workers. But for the foreseeable future, Kennedy plans to continue producing protective gear – an unexpected new revenue stream.   The gift shop owner donating Happy Bags to localsWhen Sarah Lloyd Williams, pictured above, had to temporarily close her quirky little gift shop in Frome on 22 March, she had no idea what she was going to do with the time ahead.At first, Lloyd Williams relished the opportunity to spend every day with her dog, Chester, taking him with other dogs out for walks. However, by nature, she is a hands-on person and soon realised she needed to find something to fill her time other than dog walking and cleaning.She had found out that someone local to her had been having a hard time. “I knew this lady slightly and wondered if there was anything I could do to help, Lloyd Williams explains. I didn’t feel that I knew her enough to contact her offering assistance, so instead I decided to leave a little gift on her doorstep.” She called it a Happy Bag, containing a copy of The Happy Newspaper (a quarterly newspaper by Emily Coxhead containing nothing but good news), a chocolate bar, bath bomb and a little note.This good deed went down very well: the recipient messaged Lloyd Williams to ask if she could buy a Happy Bag for her friend. “I didn’t want any money, Lloyd Williams explains. This was something small that I could do with items that I already sell in Figgins, so I delivered a Happy Bag to her friend and it went from there.”She ended up delivering a number of bags in the local area and it led to doing a few other little things for people, such as picking up medicines, shopping and more dog walking.For Lloyd Williams, this became a lovely way to connect with people that she barely knew, or had never met before, and it made lockdown much easier to navigate: “Giving away some Happy Bags certainly made me feel much happier. It’s a tiny thing, but sometimes that’s all it takes to make someone’s day,” she says.Figgins has now reopened, with Lloyd Williams taking steps to make sure her shop is safer with a screen, hand sanitising stations, floor stickers and limiting the number of people in the shop at any one time. Lloyd Williams is also donating a Happy Bag every week to someone in the local community.At the start of lockdown, Andy Hibbert, above, transformed his car-sharing business.Launched in 2017, Car \u0026amp Away had enabled holidaymakers to rent out their cars from Gatwick and Bristol Airports while they were away, but when the coronavirus forced airports to close, business plummeted.The CEO from south west London quickly decided to use the business\u0027 existing assets to help key workers and launched a new service: Karshare.“We had this burgeoning desire for people to rent their car from home because it was sat there doing nothing,” Hibbert explains. “But then Covid came along. As a business we were stranded. We thought: this is ridiculous. We have all the systems in place to enable us to share cars. Why don\u0027t we launch the car-sharing concept where owners donate their cars to critical-care workers and people who are supporting the most vulnerable in our community?”At the peak of the pandemic, travelling by car minimised viral spread on public transport and limited key workers’ exposure, while making their journeys easier at a stressful time. Karshare encouraged members of the public in Bristol, Brighton, London, Manchester and Leeds to donate their cars for a week to NHS staff and volunteer organisations. The cars were then deep cleaned and matched to local key workers in need of transport.Insurance and road coverage were provided for free, and the owner received a full tank of petrol as a thank you.Impressively, 700 cars have since been donated – including to 31 London NHS trusts – with a total 19,000 days of use. Leasing company ALD donated 30 new cars in Bristol. “We were overwhelmed initially about the donations,” says Hibbert.One key worker who benefited was Michaela Morris, deputy chief operating officer at the NHS Nightingale Hospital London in Docklands. “She was put into a hotel and told she needs to be on call 247, so we quickly found her a car,” says Hibbert. “It’s remarkable that she has been able to continue that work because of the generosity of the public.”Karshare also helped a care worker who had only been able to reach a couple of vulnerable patients a day on his bicycle. When he was loaned a car he could reach up to 11 – and save more lives.While Karshare is now focusing efforts on making the business profitable again, it is also inviting donations to critical workers and will ask for contributions to cover the insurance. Karshare is also being extended to the wider community, allowing people to rent their cars from home.“There are financial pressures for people,” adds Hibbert, “yet they\u0027ve got an asset on their driveway that could really help.”The distillery that swapped gin for hand sanitiserIn the midst of a global pandemic, constrained by lockdown, a fledging gin brand was surrounded by alcohol with no bars open to supply. But reports of hand sanitiser shortages hit the headlines and gave the team an idea.Sean Roche launched Aintree Gin in December 2019. An organic, craft spirit, it takes its name from its home in Merseyside – a village renowned for its famous racecourse which hosts the historic Grand National.By spring, Roche and the team had introduced the gin to over 30 establishments around Liverpool. They were gearing up for the steeplechase, but lockdown put paid to their plans. “As soon as everything started to shut … all of our income went down to zero,” Roche says.Realising online sales would be key, the team started building a website – then they had a brainwave. “News reports started to regularly mention how shortages of… alcohol-based sanitiser were putting NHS and care workers at risk,” says Roche. “We knew that because we were already using pure alcohol to make our gin, we could change our production line to make sanitiser.”Their first batch was ready within weeks. Word got out and, soon after, they were inundated with requests from care homes, hospitals and more, Roche recalls.Volunteers were recruited and more than 600 litres were donated in six weeks. But as supplies ran low, and with no money coming in, the enterprise became financially unviable. “We had two choices,” says Roche. “Stop – or start selling something.”Opting for the latter, new containers were ordered and labels designed so the sanitiser could be sold online. They started offering a range of PPE products too, from face shields to masks. “This created a revenue stream that allowed us to continue,” adds Roche.A PPE pop-up and free hand sanitiser stations at an Asda store followed. “We donated more than we made in profit over the period,” Roche admits.Today, sales are going strong. As businesses look to reopen, many are turning to Aintree Gin for their sanitisation requirements – and also the brand’s primary product. They now aim to supply as many bars and restaurants as possible, and get into supermarkets as well.To read about more inspiring GREAT stories, visit greatbritaincampaigninspirationsWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

The provincial agricultural department said in a statement that the dog meat trade had descended into “anarchy” in recent years, causing rabies and other diseases to spread from region to region.The department said in a statement that the “catching, buying, selling and slaughtering of dogs” would be punished “severely”, with maximum penalties including five years in prison and fines of up to 50 million riel (approximately £9,700).Dr Katherine Polak, head of Four Paws, said: “The historic decision by the Siem Reap government to ban the stealing, trading and killing of dogs is a huge milestone for animal welfare in Cambodia and is reflective of current sentiment among Khmer people.UN warns of ‘steady stream’ of infectious zoonotic diseases‘If we don’t buy, they don’t die’: Tackling the wildlife trade demandCan social media be weaponised against the illegal wildlife trade?Prince William backs report to ‘end the illegal wildlife trade’Yulin Dog Meat Festival: How did it start and will it get banned?“We hope that Siem Reap will serve as a model for the rest of the country to follow suit to protect the lives of millions of dogs.”The dog meat industry in Cambodia sees an estimated three million dogs slaughtered for consumption annually. Thousands of animals are transported from Siem Reap to different parts of the country each month, including to the capital, Phnom Penh.Tea Kimsoth, director of the provincial agriculture, forestry and fisheries department, told Reuters that demand for the meat was driven by foreigners, especially South Korean visitors to the country.“They like it, that’s why it led to restaurants serving it, so now we ban it,” he said, adding that the trade was “alarming”.The Cambodian province’s decision follows China recent ban on the sale of dog and cat meat. The animals were kept in poor conditions, making them vulnerable to disease that could be transmitted to humans, said activists.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Millions of Australians are in lockdown once again, as state officials grapple with a significant cluster of new Covid-19 infections that has blindsided medical experts.For residents who were enjoying restrictions easing, it’s crushingly frustrating news. Yet some say it was inevitable – citing factors such as high density city tower blocks, difficulty in physical distancing, the need for more to download the government’s contact tracing app, and non-adherence to essential prevention measures.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe outbreak is happening in the country’s second largest city, Melbourne, in its second largest state – Victoria. From midnight on Wednesday, all of politan Melbourne and Mitchell Shire areas – almost five million people – were locked down again for six weeks, with only four valid reasons to leave their homes: essential shopping, care-giving, exercise, essential work or study.Australia’s biggest border – New South Wales and Victoria - is now closed. Other states such as Queensland are now closing their border to Victoria’s residents.China accuses Australia of ‘gross interference’ over treaty suspensionAustralia to reimpose lockdown in second-largest city MelbourneAustralia to close Victoria-New South Wales border It’s a far cry from April, when epidemiologist Professor John Mathews told The Independent: “Australia has every right to hold its head up and say we’ve done well... My reckoning is we’ll come out in pretty good shape.”Victoria on Thursday recorded 165 new coronavirus cases in a single day, putting it in a much worse situation than in March. It’s still worth remembering that total coronavirus fatalities remain low: 106 deaths in Australia offers a stark comparison to 44,602 deaths in the UK.Whether the recent rise constitutes Australia’s second wave is up for debate, with the WHO insisting the world is still in the middle of the first.But it has shocked Professor Paul Glasziou: “I must admit, I thought we’d only get small spikes and we pretty much had things under control,” the Professor of Evidence-Based Practice at Bond University tells The Independent. “I never thought it’d be this size. Everyone’s pretty spooked by the scale of it. It’s very serious.”Concerns are also being raised because Victoria is now witnessing community transmission, rather than from overseas return travellers. It’s somewhat ironic it has happened in Victoria – one of the most draconian Australian states in terms of lockdown laws and the last major state to ease restrictions.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Each Australian state manages them differently Victoria’s state government contracted a private security firm.Reports emerged of quarantine security guards having sex with guests, wearing the same personal protective equipment all day and appearing nonchalant about guests room hopping.Hotel sex scandal linked to Australia coronavirus outbreakFor Dr Rob Grenfell, Director of Health and Biosecurity at CSIRO – an Australian federal agency responsible for scientific research - this is slightly unfair scapegoating: “There’s no sense in inidual naming and shaming” he says. “They do need intensive training in how serious this all is. But the bottom line is – and I might sound fatalistic here – this is a highly infectious disease. This is what happens.”The hotel quarantine leakage, which slipped under the radar, then became community leakage. Infections in Melbourne’s high rise city towers have started taking off. Some have called them ‘vertical cruise ships’ due to their density, uncleanliness (lack of hand sanitiser was cited in public housing lift entrances), difficulty physical distancing (e.g. in lifts) and the jobs of many people living inside.Victoria’s decentralised state health system means their chief medical officer has less power than in other states, so inidual health departments decide whether to accept the advice they’re given.Complacency may also play a role according to Prof Glasziou: “Lots were failing to get tested when they had symptoms. It breaks the essential find \u0026gt test \u0026gt trace \u0026gt isolate strategy.”Epidemiologist Raina Macintyre told the ABC news channel that if 80 per cent of people had downloaded the government’s contact tracing app, “we might not be seeing the return to lockdown measures happening now.”But these are all micro reasons when a more universal macro reason for the surge in infections is potentially responsible, one that could play out in any Australian state, says Prof Grenfell: “In America it seems everyone knows someone who has died. This is real. It’s not real for us with our low death toll. Certainly if you’re young. It’s the balance of conveying the seriousness of the situation with showing some empathy with what you’ve lost.” Being the father of a 21-year-old, he can understand the frustration: “These are supposed to be the best years of your life,” he says.Yet medical professionals insist that Australia could still authentically claim to be a world leader in its response.“Compared to Trump’s America, Australia has done well,” says Stephen Leeder, Professor of Public Health at the University of Sydney. “The UK’s political leadership doesn’t appear from outside to have been totally robust or on the ball.”“Look at cities overseas like NYC” says Prof Glasziou, “they’ve come back from much worse situations than this to more manageable levels.”Prof Grenfell agrees Australia hasn’t squandered its progress. “I’d be bold to say we’re still there with the cluster of countries that have responded to this very strongly and effectively” he says, citing Seoul as a city which experienced a worrying second cluster as its nightclubs reopened. “With alcohol consumed in close confines, people aren’t going to adhere to social distancing. I’m horrified the UK is opening its pubsclubs.”In America it seems everyone knows someone who has died. This is real. It’s not real for us with our low death toll.Lessons to learn from Victoria’s outbreak include finding new, creative ways of integrating pre-existing measures. “A Parisian cafe put teddies on every second chair!” Prof Glasziou says.And then introducing new ones – Melbournians may need to wear masks, especially on its famed trams and other public transport. The World Health Organisation released updated guidelines on June 5 acknowledging masks can reduce transmission when physical distancing can’t be maintained or in places of high prevalence.Australian epidemiologists are on saying masks, whilst no panacea, could help cities like Melbourne when handled correctly, fitted well, and disposed of properly.Other strategies, such as sewage testing, are being piloted as experts warn outbreaks are now likely to occur in other states.“We’re still at risk of this happening again and again and again,” Prof Grenfell warns, “until a vaccine.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

There have been more than 170 new cases of Covid-19 since last week, marking the biggest increase since the virus\u0027s spread was close to being eliminated in April.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

We’ll pay businesses to hire young apprentices, with a new payment of £,. The scheme will also pay for businesses to take on apprentices over the age of  with a bonus of £,.He said he refused to allow young people - hit hard by the economic impact coronavirus - become a lost generation of workers. He said: Today, we act, with a plan for jobs. Our plan has a clear goal: to protect, support and create jobs.It will give businesses the confidence to retain and hire.To create jobs in every part of our country. To give young people a better start. To give people the opportunity of a fresh start.”The announcement comes after growing fears young peoples earnings could be permanently scarred because of lockdown, and the IPPR think-tank forecast unemployment for under-s could double to just over one million by the end of . Mr Sunak added: In particular the help we want to provide for those who will be hardest hit by this crisis: younger people. Over , people are leaving education this year. Many more are just starting out in their careers. Coronavirus has hit them hard - under s are two and a half times as likely to work in a sector that has been closed.If the first phase of our economic phase was about protection, and the second phase today is about jobs, there will come a third phase to rebuild. He vowed the Government would heal the wounds of the coronavirus pandemic. The Apprenticeship Levy already incentivises large firms to take on apprentices, but small firms will now also be given a cash bonus for taking them on. The scheme to boost apprentice roles for young people is in addition to plans to get more firms to take on trainees for  weeks -  months by offering them £, for every trainee. The Chancellor announced today: The Chancellor said there would be extra support to sector-based work academies, who provide training and work placements.

Around , businesses are eligible for the scheme dubbed Eat Out to Help Out and is designed to support . million jobs which are disproportionately young, female and part-time workers. The entire package was part of a three-stage coronavirus economic recovery programme. The first stage - laid out at the start of lockdown - protected jobs and businesses from going under as the country closed up shop. This next stage announced today aims to create a bridge to ensure furloughed workers arent laid off across the country and people who missed out on opportunities were able to find them. Boris Johnsons promise to level up Britain set to be announced in the Autumn budget will form the final stage to help rebuild the nation. Matthew Lesh, Head of Research at the Adam Smith Institute think-tank, welcomed the initiatives to help young people. He said: The Covid- virus harms older people the most, but the economic lockdown is destroying le opportunities for young people. They are losing jobs in hospitality and retail and will find it harder to get onto the jobs ladder, risking a long-term loss of income. The Government is rightly focusing on getting young people into real jobs, rather than establishing expensive make-work schemes.

The publisher of the Mail on Sunday is the one on trial. It is this publisher that acted unlawfully and is attempting to evade accountability to create a circus and distract from the point of this case - that the Mail on Sunday unlawfully published my private letter.Each of these women is a private citizen, young mother, and each has a basic right to privacy.Both the Mail on Sunday and the court system have their names on a confidential schedule, but for the Mail on Sunday to expose them in the public domain for no reason other than clickbait and commercial gain is vicious and poses a threat to their emotional and mental wellbeing.A Mail on Sunday spokesperson today said they had absolutely no intention of publishing the identities of Meghans five friends.They said: But their evidence is at the heart of the case and we see no reason why their identities should be kept secret.That is why we told the Duchesss lawyers last week that the question of their confidentiality should be properly considered by the court.Last week, the duchess claimed in court documents that her friends had been rightly concerned for her welfare when pregnant.The Duchess named the pals - although they are only referred to as A, B, C, D and E in the papers - and they could now be called to testy at a trial.People magazine previously described them as Meghans inner circle – a longtime friend, a former co-star, a friend from LA, a one-time colleague and a close confidante.Meghan has identied one of her five pals, Friend A, as the person who told People magazine the letter said: “Dad, I’m so heartbroken. I love you. I have one father.She claimed this was an “unfortunately inaccurate” portrayal of her letter, claiming she didn’t know her friend would go public.Meghan Markle and her husband Prince Harry are now living in the US after quitting the Royal Family earlier this year.A pal revealed this week friends fear she is struggling and has gone very quiet.Documents filed by Meghan’s lawyers in the High Court recently revealed she felt she had been left “unprotected” by the Royal Family while pregnant with son Archie.Meghan has also claimed she was the subject of a number of damaging and distressing articles, with Kensington Palace ordering her to say nothing but “no comment”.Her legal document stated: “As her friends had never seen her in this state before, they were rightly concerned for her welfare, specically as she was pregnant, unprotected by the Institution, and prohibited from defending herself.”In the documents, Meghan also claimed her Royal Wedding made Britain £billion in tourism cash.She believes the money raised from the wedding at Windsor Castle in May  “far outweighed” the contribution stumped up by the taxpayer towards security.The Duchess recently “cut ties” with her friend Jessica Mulroney after she became caught up in a race row.The pair had been friends for years, ever since they met in Canada when Mulroney, , introduced the then TV star to Toronto’s social set.Mulroney became embroiled in a war of words with lestyle blogger Sasha Exeter, who claimed Mulroney had taken offence to her generic call to action asking white influencers to speak out amid the Black Lives Matter protests.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

This factory is very active. That activity has not slowed down — not during negotiations and not now. “Its still making nuclear weapons.”Other tell-tale signs are a strong security perimeter and what appears to be several high-rise residential buildings on site where scientists and technicians are thought to live. There are also said to be monuments at the Wollo-ri site that indicate visits from Kim Jong-un, although there are no state media reports on any such visits, suggesting secracry. A ,-word report published by the North Korean Foreign Ministry has laid bare its plan to combat American aggressions, reports NKNews.The report was published on the -year anniversary of the Korean War.In its statement, North Korea said it had missiles and nuclear weapons which are capable of mercilessly punishing those who dare to raise a hand to the DPRK.It added: The main purpose of which is the movement and deployment of the American armed forces on the Korean peninsula from abroad and from the mainland and the quick delivery of an attack on the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea.The CIA and Pentagon declined to comment when asked by CNNthe facility is believed to play a role in North Koreas nuclear program.North Korea has said it has no intention of sitting down again with the United States, though US President Donald Trump said this week he would be open to another summit with leader Kim Jong Un.The two leaders have met three times, but failed to find a compromise over the Norths nuclear weapons programme, or the international sanctions imposed on Pyongyang.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The discount - dubbed Eat Out to Help Out - includes meals for kids too, but wont include alcoholic drinks.The discount can be used unlimited times too, so people can enjoy it as many times as they like.It will help .million jobs and affect , businesses, the Treasury says, and will cost roughly half a billion pounds.The average family spends nearly £ a week on cafe meals and eating out.It means that for a family of four eating out at arestaurant, a total bill of £ would be reduced to £.This will give a much-needed lt to thousands of restaurants, bars, cafes and other establishments suffering from smaller customer numbers.The policy aims to encourage people to spend the money they have saved in the UK rather than go abroad on holiday.He revealed today: For the month of August, we will give everyone in the country an Eat Out to Help Out discount.There are . million people work in this industry. They need our support. With this measure we can all eat out to help out.After the announcement, Mr Sunak visited a Wagamama restaurant at the Royal Festival Hall in central London where he served some customers their lunch.Today hes also announced:However, many people struggling were quick to point out that the eating out scheme wasnt the right priority, and the Government should be doing more to directly help with jobs.Already hundreds of thousands of people have lost their jobs and many more are expected to follow.One critic on social media said: No worriesyou cant pay your rent, just copy a cheeky half-priced Nandos on Monday.Pub owners were also upset they hadnt received direct help either.Dawn Hopkins, vice chair of the Campaign for Pubs, was less complimentary.She said: Wet-led pubs like mine, with restricted and reduced trade due to Government rules, have been given no support from the Government.In truth the Chancellor hasnt tried to help pubs, hes just decided to help tourism and whilst that is important, so are pubs in other areas and so is community and today the Chancellor has turned his back on many community locals.Julian Jessop from the Institute of Economic Affairs added: The Eat Out to Help Out scheme may be a gimmick too far. It seems an overly complicated way to deliver a boost to demand lasting just a few days in August.Businesses will need to register, and can do so through a simple website, open next Monday, he said.Each week in August, businesses can then claim the money back, with the funds in their bank account within  working days. Its hoped that the huge slash to VAT will enable firms to cut prices for tourists and day-trippers, so they can spend their money on getting the hospitality sector moving again.Ministers are expected to launch a huge campaign to encourage people to take a staycation in Britain this year rather than holiday abroad to further boost revenues.Todays radical plans are designed to save .million jobs in the hospitality industry - which is the rd biggest employer in the UK.He revealed his sweeping plans in an emergency mini budget - known as a summer economic update - to MPs in the House of Commons this lunchtime.The move comes just four months after he gave his Spring Budget in March - filled with a £billion economic package to try to protect the country from the economic impact of coronavirus.Since then hes splurged billions on the NHS, the huge furlough scheme, and several other big projects to keep the economic engine moving.Todays mini budget comes just after the prime ministers New Deal speech - promising to plough more cash into building major infrastructure projects to create jobs and growth.The Government wants to focus on young people, who have been particularly hard hit by the pandemic and are more likely to have lost or will lose their jobs.The VAT cut is designed to make holidays, staycations and days out cheaper over the next few months, and encourage people to take them.The VAT cut - down from  per cent down to five per cent - will save families around £ a year, research from Bilk suggested.It could knock as much as £ off a weeks holiday, too.The Sun revealed exclusively last weekend that a stamp duty holiday was on the cards for six months to help boost sales - and was expected from the Autumn.The temporary measure would remove tax on the purchase of homes to target those most in need of help following the coronavirus crisis.But Mr Sunak has been forced to bring forward the move because of fears the housing market would freeze while buyers waited for it to come in the autumn. The move will enable some homes at the lower end of the London housing market to be taken out of stamp duty but crucially would take out hundreds of thousands of properties in the crucial Blue Wall seats that handed Boris Johnson his huge election win last year.Already property prices have started to fall due to the coronavirus disruption.The Government will fund thousands of jobs for people who are out of work as part of stage two of their plans to bounce Britain back from coronavirus.Under the £billion Kickstart Scheme, the Government will pay towards six months of wage costs of each  to -year-old hired by employers.It will cover  per cent of the minimum wage for a maximum of  hours a week — with firms able to top up wages.Employers will be able to offer a six-month work placement for people aged between  and  who are claiming Universal Credit and at risk of long-term unemployment.An initial £billion has been put aside for the scheme but the Treasury said it will increase the budgetthere is high take-up.The Sun also revealed this week the details of the new scheme to help boost a green recovery.Hundreds of thousands of households will get the grants of up to £, to make their homes more environmentally friendly.Vouchers worth up to £, will be available to some of the poorest families.Homeowners will be able to spend the cash on loft, wall and floor insulation, eco-friendly boilers, heat pumps, double or triple-glazed ­windows, low-energy lighting and energy-efficient doors.The scheme will go live in September and, according to Treasury estimates, will save families up to £ a year on energy bills.The grants will be part of a wider £billion investment in green technology to be unveiled as the UK moves towards going carbon neutral by .The extra £billion will be spent on revamping public buildings and social housing.Every firm who hires an - year old trainee will get a £, cash bonus, the Chancellor is expected to confirm.He will pledge £million to the scheme which will incentivise firms to take on and train young workers struggling to find a job.To receive The Sun’s Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.To follow us on Facebook, simply ‘Like’ our Coronavirus page.Get Britain’s best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day – find out more.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The respected IFS think tank warned Chancellor Rishi Sunak will be forced to hike taxes as the nationaposs £bn Covid- splurge leads to a reckoning. And borrowing will hit its highest levels in  years apart from the two world wars, the experts said. in the wake of yesterdayaposs mini-Budget. It comes after Mr Sunak refused to rule out long-term tax rises and admitted there will be dficult decisions in future amid a very signicant recession. IFS Director Paul Johnson predicted no big tax rises this year or next, but said: A reckoning, in the form of higher taxes, will come eventually. He added: This is no normal recession - it’s the deepest in our history.” Last month the national debt exceeded the UKaposs entire annual GDP for the first time since  as the Chancellor pumped cash into propping up the economy. £bn has been spent on the NHSaposs test and trace programme alone - and another £bn on protective equipment for frontline staff. IFS Deputy Director Carl Emmerson warned debt will be much, much higher than anticipated - and £bn of borrowing this year and next wouldnapost be a surprise.  He said: “We are going to borrow more as a share of GDP than we did at the peak of the financial crisis. “And in fact the UK will borrow more as a share of GDP than it ever has done in the last  years, outside of the two world wars.”  Mr Emmerson said while government borrowing is currently cheap, that could change. He said: Managing that elevated debt, and in particular the risk that the relationship between interest rates and economic growth turns out to be less favourable than it is at the moment, will be a task for not just the current Chancellor but also many of his successors. “It’s going to take decades before we manage that debt back down to the levels we were used to pre this crisis.”  Mr Emmerson said tax rises of around £bn a year - .% of GDP - might be needed just to stabilise the debt adding: It could be quite a chunky tax rise.” But he added there was uncertainty around the figure - because the economy may end up permanently smaller.Mr Emmerson said: The Chancellor also said in his speech yesterday that over the medium term we must and we will put our public finances back on a sustainable footing. Now what I think that means is that once weaposre through the crisis phase, once the economy has established its new normal, we are probably going to find that the economy is not as big as what it would have been had the coronavirus never hit. If thataposs the case, and itaposs very likely to be the case, revenues will still be depressed. Andwe want to try then to bring the deficit back to where it would have been absent the crisis we will need to do some spending cuts, or given a decade of austerity, perhaps more likely some tax rises. Delivering its verdict on the Summer Economic Update, the IFS predicted tax rises were inevitable. Director Paul Johnson said: “The second and subsequent acts are much trickier to deliver and get right. They need to get the balance between preserving those parts of the economy which have a long-term future and helping the transition to a new normal. They also need to actually deliver goods and services and change. That is very dferent from simply disbursing cash.” Mr Sunak admitted there will be dficult decisions ahead as the UK enters a very signicant recession.

The Chancellor faces fury over his pledge to give firms £, for each furloughed worker they donapost sack by January . The job retention bonus was the most expensive single pledge in yesterdayaposs £bn mini-Budget. Yet the governmentaposs own officials and the respected IFS think tank both warn it may not be value for money. Even Mr Sunak admitted today there will be dead weight - money going to firms that would keep or sack workers regardless. The Chancellor said: Without question there will be dead weight - and there has been dead weight in all of the interventions we have put in place. He was slammed by Labouraposs Chief Secretary to the Treasury Bridget Phillipson. She said: The Chancellor just admitted that his job retention bonus risks wasting taxpayer money. It’s not brave to admit plans to waste billions at a time when many are crying out for support. He should be targeting support to those who need it, not handing it out to those who don’t.  Under the scheme, firms will claim £, in February for each previously-furloughed worker they still had on the payroll by January . To qualy, employees must be paid at least £ a month on average between November and January. But even employees who were only furloughed for a few weeks, and are already back, will still qualy. Meanwhile, there is nothing to stop bosses sacking people after January . Treasury officials refused to give the scheme the green light without Mr Sunakaposs personal direction - because they couldnapost guarantee itaposll be value for money.  Permanent Secretary Jim Harra said it was entirely appropriate for the top Tory to make a judgement - but added: The advice that we have both received highlights uncertainty around the value for money of this proposal. I am unable to reach a view that this represents value for money to the standards expected. If every one of the .million workers whoaposve been furloughed at some point stay in a job, it will cost the Treasury £.bn. But IFS director Paul Johnson said probably a majority of the bonus money will go to jobs that would have been ed from furlough regardless.He added: This money will go even in respect of jobs which were briefly furloughed, are already back at work, can expect to be still back at work in January - and the employer still gets £,. IFS deputy director Robert Joyce said it was “inevitable” a lot of the money will be dead weight. “That may well be the inevitable effect of this policy, he said.

With the Government planning to “build, build, build” back from the unfolding jobs disaster, Community, GMB and Unite said British steel could be the catalyst for a boom. Community general secretary Roy Rickhuss said: “If the Government’s plans to aposbuild, build, buildapos are to successfully revive our economy and secure jobs in the UK then they must use Britain’s steel. “With so much at stake as we begin to look beyond this crisis, it’s important that as a country we get this right.“Our message is simple – ‘Britain, we need our steel’. “That means taking every opportunity to use British products, made by businesses in Britain, and the workers on our shores.” GMB national officer Ross Murdoch said: “Steel is a foundation industry that serves and supplies so many other key industries including infrastructure projects, automotive, engineering and construction, the renewables industry and shipbuilding, to name some. “Ensuring a UK steel content to these industries, combined with a UK integrated manufacturing strategy, will bring real prosperity to steel and other manufacturing communities and start the rebuilding process of our UK economy.”  Britainaposs steel industry employs , people and supplies metals to other vital sectors.

One that focussed on jobs and a plan for growth, so we could start to get our economy motoring again. But what we saw didn’t match the scale of the challenge facing the country. For weeks, the government has been promising Britain a ‘New Deal’. But instead we got a Meal Deal. Take the government’s new approach to furlough. The bonus for firms bringing back staff should have been targeted at those who most need the support. Instead, it is being handed over to any business. This potentially puts billions of pounds of taxpayer cash at risk of being wasted. Or take the government’s stamp duty cut. It could have been directed at families looking to get on the housing ladder or up-size. But because what the chancellor announced was so broad, huge chunks of the money will go to landlords and second home owners in the south east and London. At a time of crisis, should this really be the focus  And weaposre still waiting for details of how proposed VAT changes will work and exactly which firms will benefit. Sadly, this is policy-making on the hoof. And it is also policy making to mask failure. The Chancellor himself admitted the other week that the key to getting customers back on the high street is giving people confidence it is safe to do so.  The reason families aren’t going out for meals is not because they are waiting for a tenner off. It’s because the government has botched its public health response. Above all, this is policy-making that isnapost properly aimed at the businesses and people that need it. Again and again, Labour have called for support to be properly targeted, because dferent parts of our economy face very dferent challenges in the months ahead. Again and again, the government has stuck to a one-size fits all approach. one that risks wasting taxpayer money and not providing the most bang for our buck.

Joey Tildesley-Devine, who is now , was at school when he noticed a strange taste in his mouth and told a girl next to him his tongue was tingling. He was reaching to get a glass of water, when he realised heaposd lost the ability to talk or use his right arm. Unbeknown to his family the symptoms were a sign that healthy, happy, clever boy was suffering from a very rare le-threatening condition believed to affect just one percent of the population.Mum Karen Devine, , told the Liverpool Echo : When I dropped him off at school he was his usual self, it was just a normal day.Joey, from St Helenaposs in Merseyside, was rushed to hospital and immediately had scans, which revealed he had an Arteriovenous Malformation- a tangle of blood vessels in the brain which bypasses normal brain tissue and directly erts blood from the arteries to the veins. The schoolboy had suffered a brain haemorrhage, that is thought to only affect one per cent of the population. After the scans, Joey, who has dreams of being an illustrator, was transferred to Alder Hey Hospital for emergency le-saving brain surgery and was placed in an induced coma for three days. Karen said: When they told me Joey might not make it, it was like I was experiencing an out-of-body experience. I remember movement going on around me, but I wasn’t taking anything in. I was in shock and couldn’t believe what was happening.  When Joey woke he had loston his right side and couldnapost walk or talk. It was four months before he was discharged from hospital. A resilient Joey then put himself through intensive and gruelling therapy to learn how those vital skills again as part of his road to recovery which began at The Childrenaposs Trust. The charity runs a range of specialist care, education and therapy services for children and young people who have suffered a brain condition. Joey underwent speech and language therapy, occupational therapy, hydrotherapy and physiotherapy - despite being right-handed he learnt to draw with his left hand and how to walk again.

While the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and other royals before them allowed the press to take photos of them arriving at the church, Meghan and Harry kept the entire day behind closed doors. Instead, they released a couple of lovely photos to mark to occasion - including a gorgeous family shot. It showed the proud parents holding their baby boy surrounding by those who love him, including Kate, William, Prince Charles, Camilla, Meghanaposs mum Doria and Princess Dianaaposs sisters. However the Queen and Prince Philip were missing from the line up, which raised questions among wellwishers. Buckingham Palace announced that the couple unfortunately couldnapost attend as they had a prior engagement. They also missed Prince Louisaposs christening earlier in the year, but attended George and Charlotteaposs celebrations. However new book Royals at War claims that there was more to the non-attendance than first thought.  Journalists Dylan Howard and Andy Tillett write: Pointedly, the Queen and Prince Philio stayed away,reports the Daily Star. They had been generous and understanding at their best. But they simply now felt publicly embarrassed by Meghanaposs controlling behaviour, said a well-placed Palace insider. At the time, there were claims that Meghan and Harry had originally planned to hold the christening on a dferent date before realising neither the Queen or Charles would be able to attend. But by pushing it back a day, Charles couldfrom his week in Wales marking  years as the Prince of Wales and head to his fourth grandchildaposs christening in Windsor.  However the Queen still couldnapost attend as she had already made arrangements to spend the weekend in Sandringham with Prince Philip, having spent the previous week at Holyrood in Scotland. The situation is said to have surprised some staff at Buckingham Palace. Speaking of Meghan and Harry, one employee reportedly said: There is a feeling amongst some that they should have been more accommodating about the date.

Some have claimed it appears the birds run over in a car park in Folkestone, Kent, were aposdeliberatelyapos targeted. However it is not clear whether the road-kill incident was an accident or whether the driver saw the birds standing in the car park. The horrying incident captured on CCTV, said to have taken place yesterday afternoon, ended with the tiny gulls left in a mess of feathers in a matter of seconds. A Twitter user who posted the footage claimed the car involved was an Audi and the seagulls killed were chicks. Some who viewed the footage think the two birds seeing flying toward the dead birds were the parents. In the clip, a motorist in a black car can be seen driving out of a parking space directly toward a small flock of gulls. The driver does not appear to slow as they approach two birds standing in the caraposs path. It is unclear whether they have seen the gulls.  The car can be seen striking the birds, as a flock of startled seagulls zoom into the air then back toward the dead birds. Sadly, the birds appear to have been instantly squashed and the driver does not appear to slow down or stop. The CCTV captures piles of feathers left on the car park as the motorist carries on, making two right-hand turns to drive out of the car park. The footage was posted on Twitter, where people questioned whether the bird strike appeared aposdeliberate.apos Some believed the footage showed the driver going out of their way to run the birds over.  Twitter user Kent  posted the footage and wrote: Two baby seagulls hit by a black Audi in Tram Road car park yesterday evening. Does it look accidental or deliberate  Dr Paula Owens replied: Looks like the parents flew straight down to see what was happening too, horrible  unnecessary act - looks deliberate given speed  space to avoid collision. Unchecked, random acts of cruelty to nature grow  establish unpleasant norms.

She said there would unlikely be three consecutive days of hot enough weather to trigger a heatwave warning.  Weaposre certainly looking at a drier start to next week.

Temperatures could rise to C, or even C in isolated parts in the capital on July . It comes after Brits have weathered largely cool and drizzly conditions with heatwaves in late May and the final week of June.

Mr Floyd, , is recorded saying  times that he couldnapost breathe as officer Derek Chauvin knelt on his neck until he fell unconscious and died on May  in Minneapolis, US. In horric details from the transcript, Mr Floyd also begs not not to be shot, and says repeatedly he is willing to co-operate with the officers. Chauvin has been charged with murder while officers J Alexander Kueng, Thomas Lane and Tou Thao have all been charged with aiding and abetting second degree murder and aiding and abetting second degree manslaughter. Mr Floydaposs death led to anti-racism protests and demonstrations against police brutality across the United States and around the world -  with protesters calling for racial equality and police reforms. Now, the full transcript of the arrest that led to those demonstrations reveals in shocking detail how George Floyd came to lose his le. Here are eleven of the most disturbing moments from the transcript of the arrest. .Officer Derek Chauvin dismisses breathing struggles as George Floyd dies  The recording reveals Mr Floyd was handcuffed and pinned to the ground he told officers “you’re going to kill me, man”. Chauvin then replies: “Then stop talking, stop yelling. It takes a heck of a lot of oxygen to talk. When Mr Floyd appears to become unresponsive, the transcript reveals attempts were made to resuscitate him by Lane. Chauvin has pleaded not guilty to the most serious charges in the case, of second-degree murder and manslaughter..George Floydaposs repeatedly says he is sorry George Floyd repeatedly tells the officers he is sorry during the altercation. At the start of the arrest, Mr Floyd says: Hey man, Iaposm sorry. Apparently confused as to what is happening, Mr Floyd also says: I didnapost do nothing: - before the situation escalates and he repeatedly apologises to officers. He says: Iaposm sorry Mr. Officer, Iaposll get on my knees whatever. I am so sorry, Mr oficer. Dang man. .Officer Thomas Laneaposs aggressive language from the outset  From the beginning of the arrest, and without any apparent indication of threat, Mr Floyd was repeatedly sworn at by Lane. Lane, , who had only been on the force for four days, says: Put your f**king hands behind your back. Put your hands behind your back right now! At another point he said: Put your hand up there. Put your f**king hand up there! Jesus Christ, keep your f**king hands on the wheel. Again at a later point, he says: Put your f**king hands up right now! Let me see your other hand. Mr Floyd says on a number of occasions that he is willing to co-operate, telling officer Lane:Iaposll do anything, Iaposll do anything y’all tell me too man. Iaposm not resisting man. Iaposm not! Iaposm not! You can ask him, they know me. .George Floyd says he cannot breathe  times While pinned to the floor with officer Chauvin kneeling on his neck, Mr Floyd tells police  times that he cannot breathe. He says: Iaposm through, through. Iaposm claustrophobic. My stomach hurts. My neck hurts. Everything hurts. I need some water or something, please. Please  I canapost breathe officer. Youaposre going to kill me, man. . His harrowing calls for his mother during arrest  Mr Floyd made heartbreaking calls to his dead mother as his own le faded away. At one point he says: Momma, I love you,” as heaposs pinned to the ground by the police. Another point shows him shouting Momma, Momma, Iaposm through. Later he repeats Momma, momma, momma, momma. He also says: Canapost believe this. Mom, I love you. I love you. . George Floydaposs cries of Iaposm scared Mr Floyd repeatedly tells officers he is scared during the arrest and ask why they are putting him through the ordeal. He tells officers: Man, Iaposm scared as f**k man. He also tells officers that he isnapost trying to win while begging for his le. Mr Floyd says: Iaposm not trying to win! Iaposll get on the ground, anything. I can‘t stand this s**t man. He  also makes them aware of a previous occasion in which he says he was shot at - while pleading with officers not to shoot him. He says: “I’m sorry, I’m so sorry. God dang man. Man, I got shot. I got shot the same way, Mr Officer, before.  .Bizarre moment cop askshe has a comb At one point several minutes into the fatal incident, Officer Lane asksMr Floyd has a comb on him - as part of a series of questions to establish whether he is armed. Thomas Lane asks: Anything sharp on you  George Floyd replies with no. Officer Kueng then says: Do you have anything sharp on you  Not even like a comb or nothing  George Floyd then says: I donapost have nothing. Why y‘all doing me like this Mr. Officer  Please crack the window for me and stuff. I am claustrophobic for real, Mr. Officer. .George Floyd says heaposll do nothing to hurt officers  George Floyd tells officers during the arrest that he wonapost do nothing to hurt you. Despite his claims, officers continue with their questioning of Mr Floyd before pinning him to the ground and starving him of breath. They askMr Floyd is armed - to which he replies no. Mr Floyd then says: Iaposm not that kind of guy! Iaposm not that kind of guy, man! .Officer Chauvin refuses to put George on his side The transcript shows officer Chauvin repeatedly refusing to turn George Floyd onto his side despite being given the opportunity. While pinning him to the ground with his knee on Mr Floydaposs neck, Chauvin says heaposs staying put. Officer Thomas Lane suggests moving Mr Floyd, saying: Should we roll him on his side. Chauvin then says:No, heaposs staying put where we got him. Lane then says he is worried about the excited delirium - a syndrome that causes agitation, delirium, and sweating. Chauvin then says: Well thataposs why we got the ambulance coming. Lane does not persist in trying to get Chauvin to roll Mr Floyd, and replies with okay, I suppose. .Officer Lane says heaposll apossurviveapos knee scratch as George Floyd dies During the arrest officer Chauvin asks officer Thomas Lane is he is alright. As someone, recorded as aposspeaker apos says: Heaposs not even resisting arrest right...heaposs not even breathing right now bro, you think thataposs cool  you think thataposs cool. As George Floyd begins passing out, Chauvin then asks his police colleagues: You guys alright though  Thomas Lane replies saying: I mean, my knee might be a little scratched, but Iaposll survive. .

You’d be stupid not to.“If you#re not going to buy into it, he#s not going to let you up at the club.“You#ve got to want to win – the gaffer wants to win every week. That#s what we learned. And that#s what we started to do.“I don#t know, whether it#s in his plans to take Dundee United into Europe or somehow he ends up at Rangers or Celtic or somewhere .“He’s worked so hard and wants to be the best in his field, at whatever level he’s at.“He wanted to be the best manager in League Two, the best manager in League One. Now he will want to be the best manager in the Scottish Premiership.“If I’m honest, I think he can go wherever he wants to go.”Norwood – who has scored  goals in  appearances for Ipswich in League One this season – says Mellon created an incredible team spirit at Prenton Park.The ex-Forest Green Rovers forward says expert man-management was the key to the squad’s bond.“Behind the scenes he has been great for me,” he added. “From a personal standpoint, he obviously helped me get to where I am now.“He worked hard with me and was patient – his man-management skills were second to none.“Some people aren’t easy to manage but he finds a way to get the best out of them. I#ve got a lot of fond memories from the three years I spent with him.”Mellon # who has signed a two-year deal with United # is regarded as a promotion and play-off specialist in the lower leagues down south and that success led to interest in his players.Norwood said: “In the summer after the first promotion I had a bid come in and I rang the gaffer.“He said to me, ‘Nors, see this season, play the season, you#re going to score a lot of goals, you#ve got to trust me, and then whatever happens after that happens after that.’“I believed every word that he said. Then  goals later, I got a great move.“So that was me putting my career and my faith in the gaffer’s hands, he did want me to succeed.“He set up a team for me to score goals and we were successful doing that. So I owe where I am now to the gaffer.”He added: “I think the way he ran the team, the way he let the players run the changing room…he was the enforcerhe needed to be, but he very much let the players manage everything.“We became so close knit during those three or four years. He let us do our thing. We would perform on a Saturday and get our rewards.“The success were down to everyone but they stemmed from when the gaffer came in.”Getting the basics right was crucial to Mellon – who gave Leicester City legend Jamie Vardy his break in the professional ranks at Fleetwood Town – in his early days at Tranmere Rovers.Norwood reckons his former boss will be a huge hit in his homeland.The striker said: “He#ll find a way he wants to play at Dundee United and he will be successful with it.“Ultimately,you#re successful, then the fans buy in to it and they love watching the team win.“Hard work, first and foremost, is a given with the gaffer. You don#t need the ability to work hard, and that#s what he#ll say.”Opportunity to manage Dundee United #really special# for new Tannadice boss Micky Mellon\" title\"#Opportunity to manage Dundee United #really special# for new Tannadice boss Micky Mellon# # Evening \" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp dundee-united-micky-mellon-tranmere embed # secretODZdeGcQu\" data-secret\"ODZdeGcQu\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles.Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

There is a loading bay available at Sainsbury#s but can only be used until am which is no use to any business.#It#s just a shame no residents or business owners were consulted over this as surely the people count.#A local gallery owner said he believes there was also a lack of consultation carried out with the local community before the measures were put in place.And Alan Watt, boss at the Belvidere Gallery, fears the communication with local residents was just a #box-ticking exercise#.The city council was awarded a £. million grant from the Scottish Government#s Spaces for People fund to carry out temporary works on streets in May.Works are also being carried out in Culter and Torry.However, shop owners in Rosemount believe the measures could put further pressure on businesses in the area which are already struggling due to the lockdown.#We got through coronavirus, but we#re not going to survive the council#: Aberdeen business owners hit out at #ridiculous# road layout\" title\"##We got through coronavirus, but we#re not going to survive the council#: Aberdeen business owners hit out at #ridiculous# road layout# # Evening Express\" src\"https:www.eveningexpress fp news local we-got-through-coronavirus-were-not-going-to-survive-the-council-aberdeen-business-owner-hits-out-at-new-road-layout embed # secretFxeRYm\" data-secret\"FxeRYm\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"Alan said: #We were told that this was a directive from NHS Scotland to allow social distancing, but cycle lanes have been introduced.#There is no connection between the two.#The council officials said they had consulted us but it seems more like a box-ticking exercise.#Faye Howard, from Wool for Ewe added: #The consultation process was something that needed to be done but all evidence shows that our concerns were not listened to.#As a group we agreed thatRosemont Place were to become one way that the direction of traffic needed to be from Mount Street to Argyll Terrace this would ease the bottleneck in front of Skene Square school and reduce congestion at the Hutcheon Street junction with Berryden Road. This would also allow for access to Rosemount place from the south.#It#s sad to say that although Rosemount is a beloved community it is not the hotspot that the those putting these ridiculous plans in place think it is.#There is no doubt that we need to ensure the safety of those that live in and visit Rosemount, but the shops have put measures in place to do so.#Reduced access, limited bus service and general mayhem to Rosemount place will successfully close many small businesses.#Works in the area began on Monday with Rosemount Place now one way, eastbound, with bus stops on the south side of the road removed between Mount Street and Esslemont Avenue.A bus gate will be put in place between Esslemont Avenue and Albert Street, and a new cycle lane created on the former westbound carriageway. vw, px\"  The parking areas in Rosemount are shown in light blue. The new bus stop on Leadside Road is shown as a red dot.Eight new -minute stay parking spaces have been created as a result of the new road layout.Aberdeen City Council transport spokeswoman Councillor Sandra Macdonald said: ‘We have responded to the concerns raised by businesses and have amended the scheme where it has been possible.#We’re aware we cannot keep everyone happy as something that works for one business may not work well for another.#We will continue to have dialogue with local businesses, stakeholders and residents and to review the measures once they have had an opportunity to get established.”For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. blaize_config   n t t tCancellation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Evening Express website including all Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening Express n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb and ePaper n t t t n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayUnlimited access to all articles on the Evening Express website.

This is a challenging operational environment for our aircrew and an extremely dficult period for our fundraising teams as the restrictions are preventing all the events, talks and activities taking place which are so essential to help support the country#s only charity-funded helicopter air ambulance service.It costs around £ million each year to fund our Perth and Aberdeen-based helicopter air ambulances. Every penny needed to keep these two lesavers in the air seven days a week,  days a year, is donated by the people of Scotland. We receive no statutory government funding.Yet, as I reflect on how the Scottish public has risen to every request we have made of them over the past seven years, I feel confident they will not abandon #The People#s Helicopter# at this particular time of need.Please support SCAAyou can and help us celebrate the seventh anniversary of this lesaving service # your service.John Bullough, Chairman, Scotland#s Charity Air Ambulance, Perth Airport.Sir,Volunteers are always important.

Together they are helping tens of thousands of young people gain skills for le # helping them speak up, play their part and find their place in the world.To keep everyone safe, Scouts aren#t able to meet face to face. But this hasn#t stopped our volunteers from supporting young people. So many of our brilliant leaders are still running meetings online, helping Scouts catch up with their friends and continue to earn their awards.At a time when our children#s lives are so badly disrupted, these sessions are providing a sense of normality and continuity that#s so important for their well-being.

It shows contempt for those in the NHS who have risked their lives to save others. It shows contempt for those who have died without their loved ones by their side. It shows contempt for all of us who have stuck by the rules to protect our lives and the lives of others.Boris Johnson has asked us to #move on# but this issue will not go away.

Days before I went on holiday I’d had a biopsy following referral from my GP. Although there wasn’t a cloud in the sky, my holiday was definitely clouded by impending results#I had chosen to wait until after my holiday to get them.The journey that Monday to go to Gartnavel is one I’ll never forget. My partner Frank didn’t shut up the whole way there, obviously he was nervous. I couldn’t be bothered with the small talk and just wanted him to shut up. Obviously I was nervous and he was just trying to keep my mind off it, but I was too busy silently praying. The number  is something I see all the time so I spent the whole journey looking for the number on someone’s licence plate #I saw it everything would be ok. I didn#t see it. That might sound a bit daft, but fear does crazy things to you.Walking into the consultant#s room and finding a nurse waiting there confirmed my worst fears. #It’s a wee cancer,# said Mr Wilson. The words echoing in my head, I couldn’t hear anything after that. I remember taking a deep breath and looking at Frank. I will never, ever forget the look on his face.My only question that day was #am I going to lose my breasts # The answer was no, and thankfully Frank was there to take in what was being said my head was spinning. The question I really wanted to ask was #am I going to die # I was too scared to ask that question.I didn’t cry until I walked out the hospital, then I bawled. Frank was amazing, and he didn’t talk like a budgie on the way home.The journey home was horrendous. I was terried about telling my mum. How do you tell your mum that her only child has cancer  I hadn’t told her anything about finding a lump. I couldn’t cope with worrying about her worrying about me # butit happens again I#d do it dferently and she’ll be the first to know. By the time I got home I had no more tears left.The relief telling mum was a huge weight off my shoulders. What ensued after my initial diagnosis was two weeks of crying every day. Telling the girls at work was so emotional, and in fact I was exhausted with it all.Once surgery and treatment plans were in place I was in a better place. Time to get the head down and get on with it, and that#s what I did. I was full of positivity and determination, and I think my sense of humour helped enormously.The treatment was bad, but it was necessary. The ongoing treatment is bad but it#s necessary. I’m alive and that’s what matters. My le has changed forever, nothing will be the same. My le has been ided into Before Cancer and After Cancer  I now have a new #normal#.I don’t know what the future holds, who does, but I intend to live my le happily, positively and most definitely to the fullest!I will never forget the support, both physically and emotionally that I received from my nearest and dearest, and of course from the whole community. The strength you have given me continues, and for that I am truly grateful.Please, pleaseyou find an abnormality or you just feel something isn’t quite right, act upon it and seek attention.I know it’s a dficult time with this horrid virus but it’s important to remember that early detection saves lives.Stay safe and take care.Yvie Young, Lochgilphead"},{"url":null,"title":"midweek joy for golfer david","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsDavid Ronald took the honours in the first midweek stableford at Tarbert Golf Club, with a fantastic score of  points.He was on target to break  for the first time but finished with a double bogey for a , still a great score.

The noise is constant and intrusive for  –  hours in a day, the decibel level in excess of  dB where sounds above  dB are harmful to hearing.This is a serious issue for residents who cannot open their doors and windows, cannot use their gardens, pets are terried, it is often impossible to have a conversation, or a phone call. The noise from hundreds of bikes is explosive and destructive.The speeds are terrying, they travel in intimidating packs, the noise is threatening and the bikers have no respect for the communities they are speeding through.

But what we do not want to do is fall back into the same old traps that were so detrimental to the wildle, nature and ecosystems of our planet. Finding a way forward and a new balance is not just crucial for other species but for that of our own children and future generations too.Many will have been shocked at the sudden increase in fly tipping during lockdown plus the thoughtless parking and abandonment of picnic rubbish, disposable barbecues and indiscriminate toileting as lockdown eased.

He hoped High Street would always remain at the heart of the community.Mr Chetty, who has three children and four grandchildren, one of whom was born just two weeks ago, sadly lost his we Moira two years ago. He said he was ldquovery grateful for the support of the community during her illness and when she passed away.In his retirement, he is looking forward to playing golf, tending his garden and travelling, as well as spending time with his grandchildren. He is also hoping to spend time with family in South Africa."},{"url":null,"title":"column-reassuring-statistics---time-focus-economy","story":"Now that we have lessened the risk to health from Covid- for the time being, it is time to start focusing on supporting the recovery of the economy.We have to consider the implications there will be for employees following the end of the furlough scheme, and ensure that both iniduals and employers have the necessary support at this time.I want to ensure that all businesses receive the help that they are entitled to and have the best possible opportunity to overcome this period of crisis.Irsquom always happy to hear from local business owners, whether that be to get an update on the work they are doing or to discuss what I can do to ensure they are being supported.I would encourage local business owners to get in touch to discuss any dficulties or concerns that they might have in this unpredictable period.I canrsquot promise miracles but I will certainly do all that I can to help.It is great to see that retail premises will begin to re-open and I know that this will be hugely beneficial to many small and local businesses across the constituency.Whilst we all enjoy having access to some of our local shops again, I would like to remind everyone to do this in a responsible way by maintaining social distancing, wearing a face covering and following the hygiene advice in place.I encourage you all to make use of the many local shops and businesses that we are lucky enough to have in East Lothian and to do so in a responsible manner that respects any rules shop owners may have put in place to keep us all safe.I would also like to welcome theof horse racing behind closed doors, as Musselburgh Racecourse begins its flat season this week.I have been in regular contact with those from the racecourse throughout the Covid- crisis and I am pleased that they will begin to recover from this unprecedented period of closure."},{"url":null,"title":"column-must-act-now-prevent-lost-generation","story":"Latest official statistics show that the level of --year-olds claiming unemployment benefits has almost doubled between February and May, rising to . per cent.A report from independent economic thinktank the Fraser of Allander Institute said the country was now in its deepest recession in living memory, with a minimum of  months before the economy recovers to pre-pandemic levels.It is deeply worrying that Scotlandrsquos working population is already suffering so much at the very start of this economic crisis.The recently published Higgins economic recovery report reiterated the importance of a Jobs Guarantee Scheme, warning that workers under the age of  are two and half times more likely than those aged  and older to work in sectors that have been shut down in response to Covid-.Scottish Labour has been calling for such a scheme since the start of the crisis.We want the Scottish Government to work with employers and trade unions to develop a jobs guarantee scheme paying at least the living wage and offering a secure job or training place to any worker who has been unemployed for the long term.Young people have been especially hit by the lockdown of the economy, and as we see a fragile recovery we expect more people on furlough will face unemployment.That is why we need to act fast to ensure Covid- does not result in theof mass unemployment and all the damage that does to the fabric of society.We urgently need a plan for the economy and jobs and an industrial strategy with manufacturing at its heart.If we fail to act now we face losing a whole generation to the blight of unemployment.This is not just a question of economics, it is a question of doing the right thing."},{"url":null,"title":"crossing-point-things-keep-awake-night","story":"As I lay there all I could hear was, to borrow the title of a famous song, the lsquoSound of Silencersquo.Not a car drove past. Not even the number  night bus that trundles through Port Seton on an hourly basis.Was it the silence that was keeping me awake  Or was it the fact that, by this time, my mind was racing ahead to the things that I had to do the next day In these recent months, one of the most common things to hear people say is that their sleeping pattern isnrsquot what it once was.I even Googled it and came across an article from a popular news website in which those interviewed recounted how the events of recent months had affected their ability to sleep.It seems that much of this has been caused by the changes to our daily routine.As we have been spending more time at home than usual, wersquore not expending the same energy as we do when times are more lsquonormalrsquo.Even sunny days, when we would normally go out and soak up the sun, are often spent inside the coolness of our homes.And,we are honest, we probably need to add into the mix a certain measure of anxiety.It is not easy to hear even the improving facts and figures that are circulated each day, nor to be reminded that, whilst things might be looking up, such a situation relies on our continued responsible behaviour.As I lay awake, which included thinking about what I would put into this column that you are now reading, I was reminded of the Psalmist in the Old Testament who confesses that sometimes he too lies awake at night, his mind buzzing around from here to there.So, what does he do when he cannot sleep Psalm  and verse : ldquoOn my bed I remember you I think of you through the watches of the night.He turns his attention to God.

As ruins go, therersquos not a huge amount to explore no cramped spiral staircase to squeeze up, or dank cellars to investigate.But for me, such ruins have a dferent appeal. Not based so much on the physical exploration of what remains, but more an imaginative exploration of what we can no longer see.It has really ancient origins, dating back to the ninth century when the first Christian site seems to have been established here. That gives it over a thousand years of Christian connection, and I suspect it may have been a pre-Christian sacred site before that.The first kirk will have been wooden built, but the oldest surviving parts of the stone kirk we see today date from the late th century.On my most recent visit to the kirk, I stood in the nave and tried to imagine what Scotland was like in the s when parts of the walls around me were built. What a totally dferent world from ours, I thought, as I stood in the footsteps of those who stood on the same spot hundreds of years ago.On reflection, perhaps there were more similarities than we may imagine: pestilence, plague and epidemics, injustice and inequality, cruel rulers and pious preachers.There are some information boards with pictorial reconstructions that help us understand what we are looking at, but a ruin like this is the stuff of poetic imagination.Poets such as Shelley were inspired by ruins, and today they are popular visitor attractions all over the world.Compared to the scale of ruins such as the Acropolis or Pompeii, or even compared to nearby ruins such as Dirleton Castle, the old kirk of St Andrew may not impress. I donrsquot think it will ever be a popular tourist attraction.But thatrsquos why I enjoy visiting this place. Itrsquos a ruin with solitude, while ironically being very accessible and amidst a busy part of East Lothian.Over the years I have never personally met anyone  there visiting it. Many people know of it, of course, but because of its unassuming simplicity, I suspect few have got to know it.ldquoTherersquos not much to see, was an honest comment from a friend once. He was right on one level, but I think what we see depends how we look, and how we connect.For me anyway, the magic of this ruined kirk is not in what is visible but in the atmosphere of its story, and its unexpected tranquillity.Once, of course, it was very busy, for it was the place of worship for people from the edge of Aberlady Bay to the fringes of North Berwick, as well as from as far as four miles to the south. Every Sabbath there would have been processions of people from each direction, coming to meet and worship here together.Stand in the nave and you are at the centre of this ancient weekly migration. From here you will see a Norman arch, decorated with chevrons. Although the information board points out the craftsmanship is not of the finest quality, it makes me imagine some poorly paid, yet skilled, local stonemasons doing their best to beauty their kirk and it is certainly good enough.The arch was walled up many years ago, when the chancel became a burial place for the Yule family. So the decorated arch is now embedded in later stone, and looks like a fossil peeking out from a clf face.As I stood admiring it, I thought it had the atmosphere of a walled-up entrance into the past, in which figures from times gone by could emerge or perhaps I could walk through it to another age. Maybe Irsquove been watching too much Outlander .The kirk was used for worship for over  years, and even survived the Reformation. There is an amusing tale of the vicar from that time, which I shared in my first book. I thought of him as I stood in his church.It became a collegiate church in , so prayers were said here constantly by a group of priors to help the soul of the local laird to get into heaven. The prayers were paid for, of course, and one wondersthe laird got value for money.The kirk was finally abandoned around , apparently because of a petition from parishioners.One issue seems to have been the constant covering of sand blown over the kirk and kirkyard by endemic storms. What image does that conjure in our imagination  And what storms must they have been! But also, many people lived miles away from the kirk, as did the laird, and a new, more conveniently situated place of worship was wanted.I can understand this. Itrsquos a fair trek from, say, Dirleton to here, especially on an unpleasant, dark, cold winterrsquos morning. So a new replacement kirk was built at Dirleton, and St Andrewrsquos Kirk fell into disuse. Yet the kirkyard remained in use, and has many of its own tales to tell.I have never been a fan of crowded places, to be honest. Irsquove had my enjoyment of some favourite places ruined by being placed on a tourist lsquomust-seersquo list.I doubt the ruins of the old kirk of St Andrew in Gullane will ever be on a tourist lsquomust-seersquo list unless some celebrity gets married there, or itrsquos used as a movie location.It remains for me a wonderful place to visit, and I always spot small details that I missed on previous visits. My kids are fascinated by the stories told on the gravestones.As the lockdown eases, we are all understandably desperate to get out from our confinement and feel free once again to enjoy places. But then we often too readily build a new prison for ourselves by following the herd to overcrowded places where we are crammed into lsquomust-go-torsquo popular places.Maybe a gt from the lockdown is the discovery of those places nearby, less well known, but in their own way special and magical.For me, East Lothian is full of such small, less-well-known, special places, that will never be a on a lsquomust-seersquo list, but are all the more enjoyable for it. This old ruin is one of them for me.It is such places I look forward to visiting as the lockdown eases."},{"url":null,"title":"farewell-alfred-alf-tesoro","story":"He died suddenly of a presumed heart attack at the age of , as he ed to his home in Eskside West after buying his daily newspaper on June .Due to current Covid- restrictions, a private service was conducted on Monday, June , at Inveresk Cemetery by Father Basil Clark, from Our Lady of Loretto Church on Newbigging, Musselburgh.The funeral cortegravege travelled along North High Street, passing his former cafe premises for the last time, to applause from members of the local community who lined the street to pay their respects.His niece Anita Cullinan said: ldquoOur family were truly touched by all who turned up to witness Alfrsquos last journey through Musselburgh ndash people who perhaps personally knew Alf or who had grown up during the years the shop was open.ldquoWersquod like to thank them for turning out and for the deeply respectful applause as the cortegravege passed by.Alf was born in the house above the shop on  North High Street on July , , the middle child of Edoardo Tesoro and Zelinda Costa Tesoro, whose other two children were Eolanda and Bert.Edoardo started the cafe known as A.Tesoro in , and his brother Emilio also started a Tesoro cafe across the bridge in Musselburgh around the same time. They married the Costa sisters, Zelinda and Carmen.Le was hard as Alfrsquos parents worked in the s through to the late s, with Zelinda looking after the children, maintaining a home and helping in the shop. They would have worked seven days a week, from dawn till dusk.Like most Italian immigrants of the time, they built the business from nothing to create a small ice cream factory behind the cafe.The ice cream was made by hand and boiled in small quantities each day in response to the demand. They didnrsquot have a pasteurising machine until after the Second World War, which then allowed larger quantities to be made and stored.Ice was delivered to the cafe each day and kept in a cool cabinet and the ice cream was then made using a secret family recipe, passing from father to son.The ice cream was then delivered by horse and cart to ious places around Portobello and Musselburgh and also distributed by bicycles with cool boxes in front to keep it fresh.They had young lads helping to distribute the ice cream and family members remember Alf saying that they also attended the Musselburgh Racecourse events and dance halls to expand the business.Alf started a car mechanicrsquos course on New Street, Musselburgh, before the war but hadnrsquot completed it before being called up to serve in the British Army as a private in the Argyll  Sutherland Highlanders Regiment.He served in both France and Germany, arriving in Normandy on June , , and spending the rest of the war in France, Holland and Germany.He ed to Musselburgh with the intention to finish his apprenticeship and learn how to drive but, as was so often the case with the eldest son of Italian families at the time, was asked by his father to run the business.His sister, Eolanda, had finished her secretarial studies after the war and met a young Italian called Ricardo Paganuzzi, who she married and who set up an ice cream business called Dinorsquos Cafe in Perth.His younger brother, Bert, went on to study law at the University of Edinburgh after he finished his national service.He married an Edinburgh girl called Catherine OrsquoDonnell, who studied to be a teacher.Alf therefore found himself the last of the siblings left in the business and stayed to continue work until his retirement ndash around  years.After he retired and, in the absence of successors to run the business, he sold up around  and continued to spend his remaining  or so years living very happily in his native Musselburgh.He travelled to the USA and to Canada but mainly spent his annual holidays with his nephew, Dino Paganuzzi, in Switzerland.He went on numerous trips back with Dino to where their family originated, Beverino, in the region of La Spezia in northern Italy, where relatives still live.He announced very shortly after ing from a family trip to Rome that his travelling days were now over, at the age of nearly .Alf was a member of the hiking club run by Our Lady of Loretto Catholic Church, where he seldom missed a Sunday Mass.He also spent many a Saturday at Easter Road in Edinburgh with his brother Bert, watching his beloved Hibs play football.Alf is survived by his nephew Dino Paganuzzi in Switzerland, niece Anita Cullinan, from Edinburgh, cousin Roland Toma, of the Cafe Continental in Gourock, cousin Elena Grippa in Rome, and their children.Many Musselburgh residents took to social media to pay tribute to Alf. Fiona Rutherford posted: ldquoLoved his cafe.Gillian Duffy said: ldquoAlways used to be the place to hang out at Alfiersquos when a teenager.Alan Fraser said: ldquoBrilliant recognition by the people of Musselburgh.Elaine Black added: ldquoHappy memories.

structural interventions to accommodate the changing uses and processes within it.ldquoThe building is currently only partly used by Pure Malt, who are continuing the nearly  yearsrsquo use of the site in the processing of grains and cereals.ldquoThe remainder of the building is currently unused and has fallen into disrepair.ldquoEssential maintenance works are now required to prevent the building falling into a dangerous state.The planned alterations to the building are to facilitate the upgrading of the existing facilities on the site.Much of the external work includes the installation of roof lights, with two new sections of roof and the re-opening of former windows.Inside, documents show changes planned on ious floors.On the ground floor, three unused malting rooms would be transformed, with a -seat canteen being created, as well as a reception area and changing facilities for men and women.There are also plans for a staff gym on the ground floor.Upstairs on the first floor would be office space, including meeting rooms, with further meeting rooms created on the second floor, as well as other rooms, including a micro lab.Currently, the business has premises on both sides of Whittingehame Drive.No objections were received by East Lothian Council regarding the plans, although no start date has been identied for the work to get under

We may get health advice and government guidance, but ultimately we have to navigate this new, more precarious world on our own.How we do this, and, crucially, how we feel about doing it, depends on many dferent things, of course, not least our age and underlying health, our financial situation and, to a signicant extent, our personality.I know there are some who believe that through lting lockdown restrictions politicians in Westminster and Holyrood are very deliberately handing over responsibility ndash and thus blame ndash to the public for what comes next.

Covid- has starkly revealed that some of our everyday lives have clear measurable impacts. A desire to Build Back Better, to restore our economy but also protect our planet and create green jobs has grown. With a recent BBC poll finding that  per cent of people think climate change is as serious as Covid-, itrsquos vital we listen to what they want.Key workers in recycling and waste management have performed an essential service during the pandemic and now, the sector so vital to driving a better environment, must answer the demand to drive a greener recovery.Even during such a devastating crisis, or perhaps because of it, we must think again about the waste we produce. We must drive resource re-use, end waste exports and ert from landfill to achieve a zero-waste economy.For Viridor, the key to unlocking this change is to see waste as a resource, and not as rubbish turning packaging and products back into new products which are reused here in Scotland. This could create new skilled jobs while driving down waste and carbon emissions. Making sure waste is truly valuable is key to ensuring what we discard does not escape the recycling net, going on to harm our environment.Last week we launched our vision of how we might make build back better a reality in Scotland. A Scottish Circular Economy and Innovation Park. A site dedicated to moving towards a zero-waste economy where our waste is reprocessed into new materials to be reused in Scotland. A site that brings major new investment and green jobs with a better environment. A site that meets the hopes and expectations of the Scottish people.But this vision is far bigger than one company. This is why we brought together  people in this sector, including Scotlandrsquos Minister for Trade, Ivan McKee Sepa CEO Terry ArsquoHearn, Scottish Enterprise, Zero Waste Scotland, Heriot-Watt University and Glasgow Chamber of Commerce. Innovating to make a zero-waste economy, securing Scottish investment, creating green jobs can only be doneeveryone works together.Mr McKee noted the ldquotime had come for Scotland to be clear about the infrastructure investment required to deliver the world-leading circular economy it is committed to. This is crucial. Recycling and reprocessing of plastics, glass, paper and card does not happen without a signicant investment. This sentiment and ambition were matched by the Princess Royal who, in a video message recorded specically for the event, noted that investing in the circular economy is key to ldquogiving our young people the opportunity to play a major role in the world they will inherit.Time and again, people focused the opportunity we have to ensure Scotland emerges from this crisis with a brighter future.

Itrsquos crucial that as we fix the economy, we sow the seeds for a green recovery that creates the jobs and skills of the future and puts Scotland on track to tackle the climate and nature crises.The First Minister talked a good game at the start of the pandemic, repeating her goal to create a ldquogreener, fairer Scotland and tasking a group of experts to consider how the economic recovery can increase wellbeing, fairness and move us to a net-zero carbon society.The expert advisors report correctly diagnoses an economic crisis amidst rising inequality and a rapidly degrading environment. But their proposed remedies look a lot like business as usual. Recommendations on climate and environment are sound but sit alone rather than woven throughout the -point plan.Doing so isnrsquot easy: many low-carbon sectors are small, fragile and dependent on public support to get them into the mainstream. But itrsquos essential: we know that Scotland isnrsquot on track to meet its ambitious climate targets. In this time of heightened awareness of race and inequality we should remember that the climate impact of our high carbon economy is already being felt by the worldrsquos poorest.A green recovery that places carbon reduction and nature restoration at the heart of Scottish Government action makes financial sense. Many studies show how investments like home insulation, electric charging points, promoting cycling and walking, tree planting and habitat restoration provide jobs, address inequality and bring cleaner air and better health.With Government resources stretched by the health crisis, itrsquos more important than ever to use scarce cash to build the greener, fairer society that we need. Governments can borrow cheaply ndash an opportunity to invest in ways that make the economy more productive for everyone.We should seize opportunities for action now: long-term public support for reforestation would give that industry the confidence it needs whilst creating new outdoor jobs in rural communities. We can increase the supply of jobs to young people with training in climate and conservation skills. Scrapping older, more polluting buses for zero emissions versions will reduce air pollution and help the local supply chain survive the crisis.Scotlandrsquos energy efficiency schemes lead the UK.

We will remember the Thursday clap, of course, but thatrsquos merely the symbolism for what lies beneath. There was never a question ofdoctors, nurses and other hospital staff would work, but how they should work, and how they should protect vulnerable, shielding colleagues unable to work. Wersquoll remember the less high-profile key workers, too. The shop workers, the waste collectors, delivery drivers and the other emergency services.For better or worse, we will remember the political leaders. Some will want to write a history scarred by their poor performance, whilst some will want to remember them as statespeople, but thatrsquos politics. We may even spare a thought, when we look back, for the parents who tried to care for and educate their children at the same time as working, running businesses, trying to keep their families mentally, physically and financially afloat.How, though, decades from now, will people remember what our teachers did during coronavirus It is dficult, and I suppose unfair, to single out any particular public service worker as being the most important to our country. ButI was forced to do so, Irsquod pick teachers every time. Of all the services we pay our taxes to receive, the education of children tops the list.Having good teachers in good schools works hand-in-hand with parenting in dictating not only our own personal success, but with it our contribution to the social and economic future of our country. Our own moulding is then passed to our children, and so it goes on.So, for me, teaching is the single most important service that society provides, and that makes teachers the single most important group of public servants we have.Behind all the lazy labelsis a profession which works hard and often long hours for a salary which, whilst much better in recent years, remains relatively low given the relationship between good teaching and national success.They are heroes. And when the movies are made and the books are written they, I suspect in large majority, deserve to be remembered as playing a hero role during coronavirus. The teachers who, knowing the damage that lockdown was doing to the most vulnerable, spent their weeks delivering essentials to kids at their homes. The teachers who waded through the official guidance to make sure they could talk to their pupils over video, whether as a one-to-one chat or for a video lesson. The teachers who put in more time than they ordinarily would have to create, then review and mark detailed lesson plans for children to complete at home.Inidual stories of hero teachers, scattered all across the country. Small acts, making a big dference.I fear, though, that these inidual heroes will not shape the nationrsquos memories of the performance and attitude of the profession as a whole. For the inidual heroes are not the people with the voice. The voice belongs to their representation, dominated by the grandly named Educational Institute of Scotland , which the lay person knows simply as the teacherrsquos trade union.A s trade union trapped in the s, the EIS appears to see its job as to simply say no. No to a nineper cent pay rise, with a recommendation of strike action. No to John Swinneyrsquos school reform plans, despite them being designed to give more power to teachers themselves.And now, it seems, placing hurdles in front of the Scottish Governmentrsquos plans for children toto school full-time next month. This is a union which, it seems, feels free to flex its muscle and expects the government to kiss its feet. The most ludicrous example of this is the apparent determination of the unionrsquos leader, Larry Flanagan, to reject guidance from scientists and epidemiologists on social distancing. Mr Flanagan told the Sunday Times last month that the World Health Organisationhad made a ldquomistake to recommend a one-metre social distance. Itrsquos rather like the WHO telling Scotlandrsquos teachers that they donrsquot believe in cursive writing. Teachers would say ldquowhatrsquos that got to do with you , and theyrsquod be right.Mr Flanaganrsquos voodoo science is the most totemic example of a culture of saying anything you need to say to thwart the wishes and ambitions of, in this case, ministers and parents, and many teachers with them.The EIS may feel it is doing its job, and doing it well. And some teachers may agree. But others will, I am certain, see the dangers in a longer-term corrosion of the bonds of trust between teachers and parents.Everyone wants teachers to be safe, just as we want doctors, shopkeepers and delivery drivers to be safe. But, by August, we will have had a month of being able to go to hairdressers, shop in non-essential, indoor shops, go to the cinema and the pub, and send our children to nursery, after a seismic suppression of the virus.Given thisto relative normality, combined with the ability to offer further protection through PPE and other enhanced hygiene measures, many inidual teachers will surely now be asking themselves whether their trade union is placing them on the right side of history. They will surely now be asking themselves whether,the attitude of the EIS prevails, a lay person would think teachers are playing their part in the national recovery.The time has come for one of two things to happen. Either the other unions such as the SSTA and the AHDS, which have become relatively less influential, need to emerge from the shadows of the EIS and promote a more reasonable, reputationally-enhancing outlook.Or the teachers who are uncomfortable with their portrayal need to come together and build something new.

He has not been shy in grabbing the glory, buthis plans do not produce results, and furlough proves to be a waiting room for redundancy as many fear, Mr Sunak will bear a large part of the blame.Already, some Conservative MPs are becoming jittery over the ever growing cost of this help.

A politician thus far untainted by the mistakes his colleagues in Government made in handling the coronavirus crisis, he would be ideally placed to take over from a tired and discredited Boris Johnson. What seismic changes that could bring about in British politics. Or would it It depends how one reads Mr Sunak and his meteoric rise thus far. To a great extent he is just another off the peg Tory.

Grandparents who came to the UK from East Africa, parents who worked hard as a doctor and pharmacist. Proud to call himself British-Indian. A Hindu. Hersquos endearingly geeky, a Star Wars fan no less, and is iniably described by those who have worked with him as a nice sort.When his potential was first spotted it used to be thought that he was missing the genes for empathy and relatability, but he has made up for that during the virus crisis. Even though he is a stranger to the dole queue, he made a lot of people relieved that they might not be joining it just yet.Before the pandemic hit, Mr Sunak was best known for replacing his party leader on the General Election televised debates circuit. A touch nervous at first, he quickly came into his own. It was clear that fellow debater Nicola Sturgeon rated him. Player recognised player.Imagine what impact a PM Sunak might have on Scottish independence. Though he has insisted a second independence referendum was ldquoabsolutely not our intention, it was once suggested that he thought England would be better off on its own ndash a charge he denied. Keir Starmerrsquos Labour has more to fear from a fresh Sunak administration than an already wobbly Johnson premiership.Impressive as he has been to date, it may be wise to hold off on a big bet on Mr Sunak becoming PM just yet. He is, after all, a man who took the job of Chancellor knowing that Number  would want to pull the strings. There is a long way to go before any of us begin to see the back of this crisis.

This is why handwashing and cleaning are so important.The WHOrsquos technical lead for infection prevention and control, Benedetta Allegranzi, finally conceded yesterday that the organisation cannot rule out evidence emerging of airborne transmission in ldquocrowded, closed, poorly ventilated settings.Just days before, she had downplayed the possibility, insisting it was ldquocertainly not supported by solid or even clear evidence.The change in tone follows an open letter penned by Lidia Morawska, a expert in aerosol science at Queensland University of Technology, and signed by  other scientists.They wrote that ldquohand-washing and social distancing are appropriate, but, in our view, insufficient to provide protection from virus-carrying respiratory microdroplets released into the air by infected people.Researchers accused the WHO of being ldquoslow and risk-averse in updating its guidance and allowing ldquoa few conservative voices to shout down dissent because it could mean more expensive and disruptive control measures.The issue has attracted more attention from scientists as countries ease their lockdowns by re-opening offices, restaurants, bars and nightclubs.It has also prompted questions about what level of ventilation is needed in workplaces, schools and nursing homes, and whether ultraviolet light should be used to kill the virus indoors ndash as sunlight does outdoors.All this really depends on what proportion of cases are caused by airborne spread, and that is hard to determine.Some scientists back a ldquoprecautionary principle : until the level of risk is known, follow a path of maximum mitigation such as making face masks mandatory in all indoor settings.Others are more cautious.Paul Hunter, a professor of medicine at the University of East Anglia told New Scientist that he was worried it would confuse the public into thinking a face mask was a better protection than washing their hands.ldquoI think there probably is some airborne transmission, he added.ldquoThe issue is whether that is important enough to justy additional control measures.: Why GPs in Scotlands most deprived communities fear a tsunami of trouble aheadAll this comes after further doubt was shed on the possibility of herd immunity earlier this week by an updated Lancet study showing that just five per cent of Spainrsquos population has developed antibodies, despite having one of the worldrsquos highest death tolls.Given that seroprevalence of at least % would be required, it was concluded that ldquoherd immunity through natural infection is not only highly unethical, but also unachievable.It is unclear what degree of protection antibodies actually offer anyway, as the study ndash the largest in Europe to date ndash also found that over the course of eight weeks, % of participants who had initially tested positive for antibodies had no trace of them by the end.That is not to say they are not immune ndash they could have cellular immunity instead ndash but it is another of the virusrsquo conundrums.Meanwhile, increasing evidence is also emerging about the long-term consequences of infection with Covid-.Studies have found high rates of lung scarring ndash even those who had mild symptoms ndash and of blood clots leading to strokes, heart attacks, lung embolisms, and limb amputations. Abnormal blood clotting has even been reported in patients who appear to have recovered.Neuropsychiatric complications have also emerged, with a study of  hospital patients in the UK finding that  patients suffered an altered mental state, including encephalitis had a newly diagnosed psychosis and six had dementia-like symptoms such as short-term memory deterioration.

Perhaps Mr Maciver should try it some time. There were a number of statements remarkably free of this approach, Irsquoll confine myself to some of the highlights.He states that Nicola Sturgeonrsquos approach to handling the Covid- epidemic ldquohas been a near carbon-copy of Mr Johnsonrsquos. There were six deaths from the disease in Scotland last week. The number of deaths in England was . Given the proximity of the countries and the fact that Scotland has no control over its borders, this is an extraordinary ergence. How could this be achieved with a ldquocarbon copy approach  Let me help Mr Maciver here: it couldnrsquot. Those outcomes were achieved by the Scottish Government strictly following the advice of its scientic advisory body.Mr Maciver believed in  it would have been an act of self-harm to have voted Yes. While the Scottish Government works hard with limited powers to protect him and his family, in the true spirit of the Scottish Enlightenment, he can reflect on the wisdom of that statement, as a hard Brexit looms on the horizon, threatening to redouble the hardships brought about by the virus.Jim Daly, Edinburgh EH.MARK Smithtries valiantly to make the widespread Scottish desire for independence look equivalent to English nationalism. The first rhetorical trick is to call supporters of Scottish independence ldquonationalists. This sleight of hand is so common as to almost escape notice, but in a professional political commentator itrsquos either sloppy or deliberately slippery. Later, he acknowledges that strident types of English, or Scottish, nationalism have been unattractive to many, but he attributes this cooler view only to those in what he calls ldquothe centre ground. Those who support Scottish independence for reasons of bringing democracy closer to the people, or from dismay and disillusion with the seemingly endlessly dysal and self-absorbed Westminster establishment, or any other rational argument, donrsquot seem to enter his thinking.He also doesnrsquot notice that the question in YouGovrsquos poll that puts Tory support for English independence at  per cent is highly misleading in the context of Brexit. It asks how the the respondent would vote in a hypothetical referendum to the question ldquoShould England be an independent country  It surely should be obvious that for that still very large proportion of English people who have dficulty distinguishing between England and the UK, this is a direct echo of the Brexit referendum, and that they would be likely to answer it correspondingly.That of course is YouGovrsquos survey howler, but Mr Smith should have known better than to build his convoluted argument about ldquonationalisms around it. Neither does he address the fact, inconvenient for his thesis, that English Tories apparently tend toEnglish nationalism but Scottish Tories are quite free of Scottish nationalism. He has started, it seems, from his pre-determined conclusion that wanting independence for Scotland is little more than a sentimental, even strident, patriotic reflex, and therefore the same sort of thing as Little Englandism. He might not approve of Scottish independence himself, but that does not excuse such spurious ldquoanalysis.Lyn Jones, Edinburgh EH.IN response to questions directed at me by John Jamiesonas to why Scotland has ldquofailed to thrive compared to England: first, he failed to acknowledge that in my letter of July  I was answering specic nonsensical claims by a previous correspondent and at no stage did I suggest that Scotlandhad not performed as well as rUK, which indeed it has.The problem for an independent Scotland is that we spend nearly  per cent more on public servicesthan England and because of our geography most of our businesses and economic activity are directed towards England ndash approximately %. In other words, provided we remain within the UK internal single market these anomalies do not matter a jot. However, a Scotland with hard borders and outside the lucrative UK market, with a massive borrowing requirement , dferent currency, and outside the EUwould make the proverbial perfect storm look a squall in comparison.Ian Lakin, Aberdeen AB.IN the midst of this continuing independence debate, I consider two questions remain unanswered and unresolved. Will Scottish-born UK passport holders and British citizens living in Scotland be deprived of those rights post-independence And will English-born, but happily-settled, UK citizens living their lives in Scotland be deprived of their rights to retain their UK citizenship and passport and be forced to accept a Scottish versionthey wish to remain living here It is neither democratic nor fair to deprive so many of their birthrights andindependence supporters ndashSNP or otherwise ndash wish to secede from the UK they may well be entitled to do so, but they do not have the right to make others secede against their will and they might display some social democratic principles by acknowledging and answering the above.Gerald Marshall, Kinnesswood.Read more: Letters: Covid cannot mask indy pitfalls for ever"},{"url":null,"title":"letters-trust-young-fix-future","story":"Hopefully, we can learn from past mistakes, and create an approach for youth unemployment that is fit for purpose.

We have seen this during the Covid- crisis, however it is not about having a competitive edge now, but of doing every conceivable thing to help in the battle against an unseen opponent ndash distillers making hand sanitisers, manufacturers making personal protection equipment and companies partnering with university teams to share their knowledge and access specialist facilities to research future treatments and develop vaccines. The response has been impressive and leaves no doubt about how innovative, adaptable and inspirational our businesses and academics are.Our institutions are the engines of knowledge and growth and businesses are the drivers of that growth. Brought together, businesses, universities and colleges can really power ahead, making signicant impacts on society and economy.To give just one example, a couple of years ago, a company supported by Interface spoke at the Interface Strategic Board to help us understand why they had collaborated with academics. What was said really stuck in my mind.Highland Galvanizers and Colour Coaters, which applies coatings to everything from steel sculptures to roadside barriers, collaborated with a Glasgow Caledonian University graduate to address the problem of pinholing ndash when tiny holes appear in the paint. By finding a solution, the company saved pound,-pound, annually.Apart from the ongoing cost savings, having a technical researcher in the business questioning how and why things were done, led to other employees adopting a new perspective of scanning the operation for improvements, which has ultimately increased performance and productivity.Geoff Crowley, development director at the company, said that innovation is now embedded throughout his company, with all staff encouraged to share ideas to improve processes and products as an integral part of their job. As he put it: ldquoCall it innovation,necessary, but actually itrsquos survival. Do things dferently, better, for less, using less resource.That is already happening in many companies across Scotland as they adapt and ersity and is a valuable message for rebuilding, reconstructing, reimagining and reigniting our businesses and the economy.Anyone can identy efficiencies or how to make improvements ndash and linking with our world-leading institutions to businesses can help reach workable solutions.Professor Donald MacRae OBE is a member of Interface Strategic Board"},{"url":null,"title":"letters-drivers-need-accept-consequences-introducing-lethal-machines-road","story":"Many drivers claim that they always do drive with due consideration for vulnerable road users and are outraged by the suggestion that they should be automatically liable for the consequences of any lapses. Such assertions of innocence are less convincing when one thinks of the young mother doing the school run before racing off for a nine oclock start at her workplace, or the middle-aged businessman late for a meeting at which he hopes to conclude a profitable contract. And how many ldquocareful drivers comply with the mph speed limit which is specically intended to protect vulnerable road users The effect strict liability has on driver behaviour may be debatable, but it provides many more unarguable advantages. Under the present fault-based system months, sometimes years are spent while claimants lawyers and insurance staff wrangle over where liability lies . In the meantime, there is no mitigation of the economic consequences borne by the victim, a serious consideration in our long-standing hostile environment for welfare benefits. And where a lone cyclist has been hit, where is the evidence of fault to come from  If a motor vehicle is involved any passengers will almost certainly support ldquoour driver. Likewise with lone pedestrians: witnesses may become aware of the incident only when they hear the thump and be unable to say whether the pedestrian carelessly stepped off the pavement without looking or how fast the driver was travelling.Under strict liability the legal wranglingcan be dispensed with as fault is established automatically at the point of impact. With that done the lawyers and medics can then be called in to assess the value of the injury suffered by the victim. That may take some time, but even under the present fault-based system instalments can be paid out by the insurance companies as soon as liability is established.When we drivers exercise the privilege of introducing a couple of tons of potentially death-dealing metal on to public roads we should in fairness accept that we are automatically liable for the consequences regardless of fault. And we should remember that every day we ourselves and our families are likely to be vulnerable road users evenwe do no more than step out of our cars to cross the street.William Neilson, Edinburgh EH."},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"July ,  at : pmADVERTORIAL: We currently design and manufacture stainless steel equipment predominantly used in the drinks industry internationally as well as in the energy and renewables industries.

Safety measures to protect staff and customers are being put in place, with people asked to be sensible, continue to follow social distancing messages and stay close to home to support local business.To help people plan days out, the UK Government has launched the Know Before You Go website at visitbritain gb en know-before-you-goHere, we look at what action businesses have taken to ensure we can all enjoy summer safely.The UK Government is helping thousands of pubs, restaurants and hairdressers reopen safely with detailed practical information to help keep staff and customers safe. The new Covid- secure guidance for the hospitality sector and hairdressers meant businesses were able to reopen across England on July , provided they met key criteria. UK Government officials have worked alongside over  key industry stakeholders and trade unions to develop clear plans in line with scientic advice and public health directions, building on existing guidance published in May.The new guidance sets out a range of measures for pubs and restaurants to become Covid- secure, including:Business Secretary Alok Sharma said: “We know this pandemic has been particularly hard for people working in hairdressing and hospitality. Allowing pubs, restaurants and hairdressers to open will be another step in our plan to kickstart our economic recovery in a safe manner.”The guidance that is set out provides clear, practical steps businesses can take to open in a way that is as safe as possible for workers and customers.Separate guidance has been published for hairdressers, which states that a clear visor should be worn by the person providing the service, covering the face and providing a barrier between the wearer and the customer from respiratory droplets caused by sneezing, coughing or speaking.The government is also consulting with industry on how businesses should record customer information to help keep customers and employees safe and support the new test and trace system.Edinburgh Hair and beauty salon That Rosie Glow is preparing to open for business on July  after almost four months of closure due to the coronavirus lockdown. A number of safety measures will be in place to help prevent the spread of Covid- when the business opens. The salon has already installed clear screens between each treatment station, and at the reception desk.Customers and staff will be asked to wear face coverings, and customers will be requested to visit the salon alone where possible, and arrive on time rather than early to reduce time spent in the waiting area. They will have to keep their coats and belongings with them instead of them being hung up by staff, and there will be no magazines or refreshments available.Each station and any equipment used will be thoroughly cleaned between customers, and clean towels or gowns will be used with each one.Salon owner Rosie Fraser said: “We closed on March , but we have kept our social media active and positive, and kept in touch with clients.” Ms Fraser said she has tried to make the new measures as comfortable as possible, including the screens bearing the salon’s name. vw, px\"  She said: “I wanted to make sure the clients and also the staff felt safe coming back, and we also wanted people to feel like it’s a nice experience and not too clinical.“In this new normal we will be coming into we wanted to have safety but with style so that women still feel like they are having an enjoyable experience. Our whole ethos is to make women feel empowered, beautul, confident and glowing not only on the outside but on the inside too. With new measures making our usual level of service and attention to detail looking likely to change we did not want to have cheap looking, temporary fixtures.“We have had bespoke screens made with our logo engraved onto them and frames custom made and sprayed to be on brand.”When lockdown was announced, luxury knitwear company Corgi knew they had the experience to get through the Covid- crisis. The Welsh firm – which has a Royal Warrant from the Prince of Wales – has ridden many an economic downturn in its illustrious -year-old history. Co-owner Chris Jones, who is great-great grandson of the company’s founder, said: “We take a view that you can get through anything. I think it makes it easier because we’ve been through crises before.”It helped that the Ammanford-based firm had been through five fantastic years before coronavirus struck. In March they furloughed  of their  staff but now many are ing as orders begin to pick up.Corgi makes hand-finished wool, cotton and cashmere socks and other knitwear and Chris said: “Normally we run two shts on the sock machine, so we kept going with one. Next week going back to one and a half shts – we’re going to have the other knitters coming in some of the time.”With shops reopening, old customers are beginning to ask for new sales catalogues and Chris expects business to pick up properly in around a month.What has helped the business survive more than anything though was the package of financial help the Government made available. Chris said: “The furlough scheme has practically saved us.ithout it, we’d have been in a lot of trouble or we’d have managed but we’d have had to let a lot of people go.”But Claire, her staff and her customers are delighted that the Lisburn business is reopening after putting safety measures in place.Claire first opened the Barber’s Den four years ago and such was its popularity she also decided to expand to include The Hairdresser’s Den for all the ladies of Lisburn.When they had to put the business on hold due to the Covid- pandemic, it was an understandably worrying time for Claire and her staff.She said: “I am heavily pregnant. I’m  weeks now. When I found out the salon had to close the first thought was stress, panic, and what is going to happen to my clients. We closed early. We have about  to  clients a day so that is a lot of footfall and I had a real concern about safety.”Claire and her team have been busy getting the salon ready to welcome back her valued customers.With the rearrangement of the salon to allow social distancing, the introduction of PPE, risk assessment and team training, Claire is ready for the influx of people who are desperate for a haircut after the long months of lockdown.Claire said: “The guidelines are good. We have posters up with the guidelines on them and I have held a team meeting to carry out a risk assessment and explain to the staff what is expected of them.“Hand sanitisers have been installed and everywhere has been thoroughly cleaned.”The UK Government has published guidance to support businesses to reopen and keep workers and customers safe so they feel confident to .at gov.uk coronavirus-business-reopening.If you run a business and would like to know which of the coronavirus support schemes you are eligible for, you can use the business support finder tool.

Everyone is in the same boat trying to step-up and deliver.“Before anyone had heard of Covid- we were already planning to equip GP practices for appointments and started that in October last year.”On March  national guidance was issued asking boards to accelerate the roll-out of the technology in an effort to curb the spread of the virus across the country.Kenny added: “Ultimately the increase in Near Me appointments has protected both our patients and staff from possible infection. We were looking to gradually introduce it but events over took that. We have trained more than  clinicians in range of specialisms since then.“There are benefits to Near Me over phone consultations and evidence shows visually you can pick-up signs and body language far more than on a phone call. So where it is clinically appropriate to do so we are having as many of these using Near Me as possible.“The initial focus was on enabling GP Practices, attention was shted to Mental Health Services, AHP and other clinical services traditionally delivered from the Balfour as the pandemic response developed. Working closely with service leads, training was delivered, equipment put in place and appointment processes modied to mirror the GP roll-out.“Uptake from both patients and clinicians has been very encouraging. Our Mental Health service has been able to meet the demands within the community at a time of increased anxiety and isolation.”He added that the uptake across the entire Mental Health Team led to them being asked to contribute to a national learning event to share their experiences.“Our maternity service is also doing very well and, despite only recently taking up the use of the technology, was similarly invited to contribute to a future national learning event due to its success,” Kenny said.“GP Simon Kemp from Daisy Villa has been selected, as one of only six practices in Scotland, to be part of a joint project with NHS Scotland and the Royal College of General Practitioners to develop guidance and help embed virtual appointment within GP practices across Scotland.“Near Me isn#t just about a response to Covid- – it was around before the pandemic. The trick for us is going to be to embed it and it can be the new normal in the future as we continue to protect our community.“For Orkney it has many benefits including providing care closer to home and reducing spend in relation to off island patient travel.“Going forward we will be targeting specialities where we have high numbers of patients travelling – sometimes on a three day round trip.

He bought a field from William Isbister of Kethesgeo and hired Samuel Baikie. Baikie’s obituary says that he designed the hotel but the local story was that it had been a show-house at the  Glasgow Exhibition. Perhaps the plans came from the Exhibition.Good though the fishing was, John Mackay wanted to make it even better. He got some trout spawn and put the fry he had hatched in a specially built pond at Stairwaddy. A year later, he had a lot of good- sized fish.The hotel opened in June . It had a coffee room, drawing room, smoking room, fteen bedrooms, lavatories and one bathroom. The Orkney Herald thought for beauty and comfort it could not be excelled in the north. The first phone line in Orkney connected the hotel to the Masons Arms and this featured in the advertising.In , Mackay had an “Illustrated Guide to Orkney” printed. The useful information included the charges for Maeshowe:- sixpence for one person one shilling for more than one, up to four persons and for more than four, threepence per person, up to ten shillings, the maximum charge for one party. In WWI, Houton was the main seaplane base but late in  it was decided to increase the number in Orkney from  to , to fight the threat of submarines, and a camp was built in Stenness. The Admiralty had not listened to the locals but soon found out that they were right, and the loch was too shallow. The planes were moved to Houton but the hotel remained the HQ of the Naval Air Service.At the end of WWI, another long running battle restarted, as John Mackay fought the Temperance movement. Stromness was dry from  to  and campaigners were determined that Stenness would be the same. Successive owners promised not to sell drink to locals, but it was no use, the petitions kept coming.John Mackay died in  and the hotel was briefly owned by Mrs Jessie Smith. The Misses Catherine and Jessie Harper from Thurso took it over in , announcing they were going to bring it up to date.Patricia Long is a tourist guide based in Stenness with a particular interest in social history.

this time to do battle in the Glamaig Stableford competition.Only two played in the competition won by Sandi Beatson # that#s three-in-a-row for her.The boys to come out to play and play they most certainly did in earnest competition for the RNLI Shield.There was a very good turnout on the Saturday of this weekend competition with the weather conditions certainly predicted to favour that particular day#s cohort.Covid  restrictions meant that instead of the normal random #draw# for partners players arranged their own #friendship groups# and appropriate tee times on the required booking sheet.Battle commenced # and what a scrap it turned out to be.Five players reduced their handicaps but there could only be one winner, and that was Robert Macaskill.Off the first tee at am his golf was very steady with  bfs required to navigate the outward nine but a miserly  hits required to conclude his great round.His #touch# round the greens was apparently sensitive in the extreme with a chip-in for par on , #up and down# from Billy the Bunker on , a chip-in birdie on  and several other good chances.All in all just a very good, tidy performance. points then for loop one and  points for loop two and that strong finish was to be the decisive factor as his margin of victory was only decided by virtue of the #better inward half# in a photo-finish with good friend and Vice-Captain Ally Young who was to submit his tremendous score in very inclement playing conditions some  hours later!Ally#s two nines, off his  handicap were  and  with a birdie thrown into each loop for good measure and a stableford points conversion for his halves of  and  points respectively.Incidentally, the putter must have been behaving because it holed a  foot putt on the fourth hole and a  footer on the th for #birds#.NB it was the tool and not the workman.Ally also had the consolation of reducing his handicap by two shots # the biggest reduction among the prizewinners # because of the status of his exact handicap which, like all players is calculated to the decimal point.We had enough jargon last week so we#ll let that slip by unnoticed shall we No question his was the better performance in the respective conditions but it#s Robert who will receive the trophy-and quite properly regain the bragging rights in the house of Macaskill.Two points behind the leaders a trio of players each ed very respectable totals of points.Andrew Long made contact with the ball  times on his outward half with the highlight being a good birdie on the dficult th hole and required but  strokes coming home with a remarkable run of ten straight pars from holes  to .John Maclean played steadily, albeit with early drama in his round # a nasty triple-bogey seven on the second hole.Chapfallen  No chance as composure regained he recorded  for his first lap of the circuit followed by  blows next time round.Ross Cumming#s two nines were  and  off his #mark# so in the company of his #old fella# that day he showed who was #the man#.Ross too suffered an early dig in the ribs with a triple bogey on the second hole but also did well to recover and tickle a touch off the handicap on completion of his round.No midweek competition for the gents this time round but the ‘Trouts’ came out to play in a pop-up Seniors Mixed Stableford competition later that week.With outdoor catering billed as an #attraction# for the silver sharpshooters the beau monde of the area swarmed like locusts to the feast.The format for the day was successful as almost  of the area#s finest ladies and gentlemen golfers paraded their skills on a course displaying promising signs of extremely rude health # apart from the reepach humple on the second fairway # and it was to be an overseas raider who was tohome victorious.Ally #Doc# Mackenzie, now domiciled in Plockton was to be #the man# with an extremely comfortable victory following a rich harvest of points in the forgiving Stableford format.His winning total of  points was four clear of Chris Mackinnon in second place.Alaisdair # a #friend# said his father couldn#t spell # rather limped out in  strokes but a fine  off his  mark coming home garnered a whopping  points to add to the earlier  and his unassailable total.Nothing much of interest in the  but an evil nine and an excellent wee two showed the extremes to which our man travelled on his homeward journey.Rumour has it that #our hero# offered to buy free drinks for everyone # in the sure and certain knowledge that with the lockdown still to be relaxed his money was safe!I also have it on good authority that his often misunderstood droll countenance momentarily offered a fleeting smile of satisfaction in victory before swtly and almost immediately reverting to type.Chris Mackinnon started brightly with only three dozen shots required to pilot his ball round the opening nine holes but  coming home with an horrendous triple bogey  on the final hole may have left a wee bit of a bitter taste in the mouth afterwards.Third place went to Dave Webster who ed a very impressive total of  points off his  handicap mark but a few more performances like that and he could be back playing with the big boys again.The size of the field offers a wee bit more scope for reflection and Donalda Johnston found form and Peter Mackenzie, kin to the winner smoothed in one further point behind Dave Webster.Honourable mention too for George Neill who might have #thought he was Archie# having recorded two birdies in his opening seven holes but sadly thereafter the ba# burst.And finally to the mystery of the #Captain#s eagle#.It#s been dficult trying to untangle the whole story occurring as it did in an unofficial, non-counting charity game but a source, when catechised offered the following description -#a Phil Mickelson-type shot landed like a dislodged swan#s feather on the green with precisely the correct velocity to carry it to the hole with not a millimetre to spare#!What preceded the shot that elicited that magniloquent delineation is still to be ascertained. .

I thought I’d come to terms with the chaffinch, except the one that has chosen the electric transmission line as its favourite perch, just opposite our bedroom skylight.All the while, Janet has been sitting calmly with her tablet, bathed in its blue light, trying to find herbal remedies for high blood pressure and lack of sleep, and has come up with green tea and hawthorn tea.But I’m not having it.At least the nights are drawing in, and as Bob Dylan once said, “It’s not dark yet but it’s getting there.”The West Highland Free Press online shop is taking no new orders until th July .Sorry for any inconvenience this may cause."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/EARIE-QUIRAING-5.jpg","title":"local news playparks re open lochcarron power upgrade edf festival","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThe £. million investment by Scottish and Southern Electricity Networks includes the construction of a new electricity substation, boosting the resilience and strength of power supplies in Lochcarron, Slumbay, North Strome, Ardanaeskan, Strathcarron, Achintee and Attadale.The six-month long programme of works will benefit approximately  properties.SSEN will be installing a new underground cable along the A, and removing the overhead power line through the Tullich Industrial Estate.The company says it will keep disruption to a minimum but customers can register for SSEN’s Priority Services Registerthey require extra assistance during a power cut.Comhairle nan Eilean Siar is to play host to the online festival via its Facebook page.The Comhairle has been broadcasting weekly Cèilidhs on its Facebook page and welcomes the opportunity to host a range of talented artists who have performed at the festival overOrganiser Roddy MacKay said: “This would have been the fth anniversary of the Festival and we felt it was important to find a way of keeping it going despite the restrictions.

foghlam Gàidhlig a fhreumhachadh anns na h-àrd sgoiltean a bharrachd air na bun-sgoiltean.Ach bha a’ cheist riamh romhainn: dè cho làidir agus a bhios mion-chànanas aonais freumhan domhainn làidir anns a’ choimhearsnachd mun cuairt ’.Chan eil teagamh nach eil an riaghaltas agus an raon phoblach air a bhith taiceil dhan Ghàidhlig thairis air na deich bliadhna fichead a chaidh seachad.Tha fhios’am gu bheil nàimhdean gu leòr againn, agus nach eil cuid dhe na rudan sin ach mar aodannain – a’ dèanamh an rud as lugha seach an rud as fheàrr – ach fhathast tha cor na Gàidhlig, gu laghail agus gu foirmeil, air stèidh nas fheàrr na bha e nuair a bha mise beag.Siud àm nuair nach robh a leithid a rud ann ri Foghlam Tro Mheadhan na Gàidhlig, ged a bha h-uile neach anns an sgoil, agus ann an raon-chluiche na sgoile, luma-làn de Ghàidhlig.Gun ghuth a ràdh air na tidsearan a bha làn fhileanta, ach fhathast gar teagasg, anns na h-oilthighean cuideachd, sa Bheurla.’S e a tha air tachairt

a bharrachd gum bu chòir dìochuimhnicheadh mu àiteachan eile.Tha mo chousins ann an Glaschu, agus mo nighean ann an Inbhirnis, agus mo charaidean agus mo theaghlach-cèile ann an Dùn Èideann a cheart

sinn agus mura leudaich sinn na freumhan anns na h-eileanan, cha bhi coimhearsnachd follaiseach làitheil againn, agus caillidh sinn bun-stèidh a dh’fhaodadh a bhith air leth prìseil airson

Tha mi gu math mothachail cuideachd gur e an òigridh, ge brìth ann an Dùn Èideann no ann an Dalabrog, a dh’fheumas an saoghal ùr seo a chruthachadh. Bha mi fhìn òg aig aon àm , agus sgìth gu leòr de dhaoine sean ag innse dhomh gum bu chòir dhomh siud a smaoineachadh agus seo a dhèanamh.Tha grunn dheugairean Gàidhlig anns an taigh agam fhìn agus tha mi gu math mothachail gu bheil na meadhanan ùra mar TikTok agus Snapchat agus Instagram nas freagarraiche dhaibh-san na bhith nan seasamh a’ bruidhinn mu sheann sgeulachdan aig ceann na fainge no aig cunntair a’ bhàr .Bidh an rud a tha didseatach an-diugh dùthchasach a-màireach.Ach math agus gu bheil conaltraidhean air-loidhne , aon uair agus gun crìon cànan làitheil anns a’ choimhearsnachd a tha timcheall ort, tha an t-uamhas air chall.Chan e mhàin blas, ach an rud prìseil sin – na dòighean a bhios daoine cleachdadh son iad fhèin a chuir an cèill gu nàdarra.Na h‑abairtean agus na nòsan a thogas tu, cha mhòr gun fhiosd, nuair a tha daoine a’ bruidhinn cànan sam bithmud thimcheall.Math agus gu bheil e Beurla no Fraingis no Gearmailtis, no ge brith dè ionnsachadh san sgoil, no air cùrsa, no air-loidhne, chan ionnan sin agus an togail ann an Dorset no anns an Dordogne no ann an Dusseldorf.Tha am beartas-cainnt sincho prìseil sa ghabhas, agus sin cho follaiseach do neach sam bith a leughas litreachas.Cainnt ionadal sgìre Dhorset a’ lasadh suas na leabhraichean aig Tòmas Hardy dual-chainnt Niseach a’ lasadh suas na sgrìobhaidhean iongantach aig Tormod Caimbeul cainnt na Maoirne a’ lasadh suas na nobhailean àlainn aig Grassic Gibbon..Tha cànan mar an cruinne-cè: chan eil toiseach no deireadh air ionnsachadh bhuaipe.Gu mì-fhortanach, is e am fiosrachadh a th’ agam gu bheil na Gàidheil air a bheil mi eòlach anns na h-Eileanan Siar, sean is òg, a’ faireachdainn gu bheil na “leasachaidhean” ann an saoghal na Gàidhlig anns na deich bliadhna fichead a dh’fhalbh air a dhol seachad orra-san.Nach buin an saoghal sin dhaibh – saoghal nam plànaichean agus nan ro-innleachdan agus nan aithisgean agus nan sgrùdaidhean agus nan rannsachaidhean agus nam molaidhean agus nan coinneamhan.Gu bheil e coimheach agus Gallda dhaibh – rud ris nach robh iad cleachdte, ged a tha adhbharan mòra eachdraidheil airson sin, le ginealach às dèidh ginealach gun chumhachd agus gun ghuth, ach fo smachd nan uachdarain agus na bàillidhean agus luchd na Beurla.Dè an teansa bh’ agad do thaobh-sa dhen argumaid a chuir, nuair bha a’ chànan anns am b’fheàrr a dh’innseadh tu e air fhaicinn mar rud salach, suarach Bha mi riamh dhen bharail gun robh dòighean eile ann daoine cumanta thoirt air bòrd: coinneachadh riutha aig ceann a’ gheata, no aig ceann an taighe.Bruidhinn riuthanan cànan fhèin.A’ bhith a’ gabhail bhòt airson àiteachan air bùird‑stiùiridh nam buidhnean leasachaidh, leithid MG Alba agus Bòrd na Gàidhlig, seach a bhith air an taghadh le seirbhisich-sìobhalta agus luchd-poileataigs ann an Dùn Èideann.Seòrsa de Magic Roundabout a th’ ann an-dr àsta.Zebedee an siud agus Florence an seo. Bha mi riamh dèidheil air Zebedee.An t-àm a dhol a chadal, chanadh e.Ach cha thachair an cruth-atharrachadh a tha a dhìth oirnn mura bheil “an luchd-leasachaidh” a-muigh anns na coimhearsnachdan fhèin, air an giùlain agus air am misneachadh le sluagh na sgìre.Tha fhios againn uile gu bheil dleasdanas laghail agus moralta air an Riaghaltas againn taic a thoirt dhan Ghàidhlig, ach tha fhios againn uile cuideachd gun dèan Riaghaltas sam bith na dh’fheumas iadseach na dh’fhaodadh iad.Sin carson a tha an deasbad a tha dol an-dràsta cudromach, oir ged a dh’iarramaid a h-uile rud, tha eachdraidh ag innse dhuinn nach fhaigh sinn e.Gheibh sinn siud, ma nì sinn strì agus argumaid air a shon, agus chan fhaigh sinn seo, mura dèan sinn spairn agus iomairt. Sin carson a tha e cudromach cò bhruidhneas air ar son agus as ar leth. Ceist bhunaiteach dheamocrataigeach a tha sin. Tha i doirbh, oir gu ìre mhòr tha leasachadh na Gàidhlig a’ crochadh air airgead poblach. Tha agus rathaidean, ach tha sinn fhathast an dùil gun cùm airgead poblach iad ann an deagh rian. ’ b’e an Riaghaltas agus a’ Chomhairle a bu chòir a bhith air sin a thogail. An aon rud a thaobh togail rathad rèidh na Gàidhlig! Faodaidh sinn uile ar dìcheall a dhèanamh le spaid is bara, ach is e digearan is rolairean mòra laghail an Riaghaltais a tha dhìth airson rathad susbainteach.Chan e gleanns gun shusbainta gheibh an rathad sin dhuinn.Ach aon uair is gu bheil an Riaghaltas an sàs, cleas maighstir sam bith, bidh iad – gun teagamh – an dùil gun dèan am buidheann a tha iad a’ pàigheadh an toil-san. Tha fhios gur e sin pàirt dhen duilgheadas a tha, agus a bhios, daonnan mu choinneamh cuango mar am Bòrd Cò a tha am Bòrd no MG Alba, mar eisimpleir, a’ riochdachadh: Riaghaltas na h-Alba an Dùn Èideann no na coimhearsnachdan Gàidhlig  Esan a phàigheas am pìobaire# Ged a tha mi airson seo a dhèanamh gu math soilleir: gu bheil mi cho moiteil sa ghabhas às gach neach a tha ag obair anns gach buidheann Gàidhliga tha dealasach is dìcheallach a thaobh na cànain agus dhan chultar agus a tha air an t-uàmhas a dhèanamh dhuinn.Gus an tèid urrasan ionadail, mar a tha Soillse a’ moladh, a stèidheachadh anns na coimhearsnachdan, ge-tà, saoilidh mi nach tig an t-adhartas a tha sinn uile a’ miannachadh.  a bhios aca  Ma bhios na h-urrasan air an taghadh gu poblach, cò gheibh bhòt: dìreach daoine aig a bheil Gàidhlig  Dìreach daoine a tha cleachdadh na Gàidhlig gach latha  Cò tha dol a thomhas sin   didsiteach ann gar clàradh, mar ann an saoghal Sheòrais Orwell Am bi bhòt aig a h-uile neach san sgìre, mar a bu chòir, fiù ’s nuair a tha % no % no % dhiubh gun Ghàidhlig agus coma mu deidhinn, no na h-aghaidh An e baile no sgìre no eilean  Mar a thuirt am fear-sgrùdaidh eile, cò tha dol a’ sgrùdadh nan sgrùdairean  No cò tha dol a sgrùdadh nan sgrùdairean a bhios a’ sgrùdadh nan sgrùdairean  Bha an dearbh dheasbad sin gu math fuilteach aig aon àm eadar Lenin agus Rosa Luxemburg anns an Ruis ag àm an Aramach ann an . ’son an rebholution a’ stiùireadh agus a thoirt air adhart.Chaidh ise a mhurt agus ghlèidh esan an latha, agus bha a’ bhlath air a bhuil.Ach mura creid sinn ann an deamocrasaidh ionadail agus anns na daoine fhèin, chan eil dòchas idir ann. An dèan Riaghaltas na h-Alba strì an aghaidh seo, is iad cho dèidheil air cumhachd a thàladh a-steach dhan mheadhan co-dhiù, mar a tha gach poileasaidh aca thairis na  bliadhna mu dheireadha’ dearbhadh Tha ceistean nas fharsainge ann cuideachd: ceistean a tha mi air togail gach dàrnacha seachdain anns a’ cholbh seo. Tha iad sin ceangailte ri fallaineachd eaconomaigeach nan sgìrean. Mura bheil obraichean ann an Uibhist no anns na Hearadh no ann an Leòdhas no eile, ciamar idir a tha thu dol a chumail òigridh  Agus ma tha obraichean annciamar a nì sinn cinnteach gur e Gàidheila gheibh na h-obraichean sin Oir tha gu leòr de dh’obraichean air a bhith air an cruthachadh as ùr ann an iomadh sgìre thairis na fichead bliadhna chaidh seachad, agus gu tric is e an rud a thachras gun tig Gall air choireigin a-steach a dheànamh na h-obrach sin .Chan eil lagh, moralta no eile, an aghaidh a leithid: cha bhuin an saoghal do dhuine againn. Chan eil e furasta, gun ghuth a ràdh air ceist thaigheadas, far nach fhaigh Gàidheil òga fearann no taigh anns am fuirich iad, eadar prìsean àrd agus margaid mhòr Airbnb.Is dòcha gu bheil cothrom aig A’ Ghàidhealtachd agus aig Na h-Eileanan air toiseach‑tòisichidh ùr a dheanamh a thaobh nan gnothaichean sin ri linn a’ Choròna‑Bhìorais. Nuair a dh’fhalbhas etha fhios nach till sinn gu mar a bha sinn – Gàidhealtachd a’ crochadh air aona-ghnìomhachas – turasachd.  chalpachais o aon cheann den chruinne-cè chun cheann eile.Tha fhios gu bheil cothrom an seo cur romhainn dè da-rìreabh a bhios riatanach dhan Ghàidhealtachd. Cosnaidhean uaine maireannach seasmhach. Ath-sgaoileadh dhen fhearann. Agus cho riatanach agus a tha e ar cànan a chur aig teas-mheadhan gach gnothach sin. Tha an dol a mach aig an “t-Sianal Gàidhlig” fhèinle còrr is % Beurla air na prògraman acana fhianais gum faod thu ainm no bratach Gàidhlig a thoirt air rud sam bith, ach fhathast gur e rud Gallda th’ ann. Bha mi a’ coimhead as ùr air na molaidhean riatanach agus dòchasach air làrach-lìn gaidhlig.tv an la roimhe: ’s truagh nach eil MG Alba, le sporan de £ millean, ag èisteachd riutha.Gu mi-fhortanach, chan eil mòran dòchas agam gun tachair adhartas mòr sam bith. The sinn mar sgeir bheag ann an cuan mòr na Beurla. Dè an t-ainm a th’ort  Is mise Ròn. Tha eagal orm gum falbh an Covid agus tillidh na motor-homes agus Airbnb agus thig an sgìre air ais gu default.   Seagh. Oir chan urrainn dhuinn cor na Gàidhlig gu lèir fhàgail aig lagh no aig Achd no aig bòrd no aig buidheann no aig aithisg no aig rannsachadh eile. Tha am Bòrd air a ràdh gu bheil an siostam a th’ ann ag obrachadh. Bu chòir dhuinn a bhith draghail gu bheil iad air sin a ràdh gu poblach. Tha mi faicinn gu bheil am Ball-Pàrlamaid Tòraidheach Dòmhnall Camshron a-nise ag iarraidh ‘Summit’air a’ Ghàidhealtachd, agus mo bheannachd air airson sin a ghairm. Is math bruidhinn, agus chì sinn dè a thig às an sin, a bharrachd air a bhith ag ithe tuilleadh bhriosgaidean.A dh’aindeoin cho duilich agus a tha an suidheachadh againn uiletha fhathast taghadh againn gach latha dè ni sin agus ciamar a nì sinn e. Am bruidhinn mi Gàidhlig leis a’ phàiste seo  An can mi facal Gàidhlig leis a’ chaillich seo ged a tha làn fhios agam nach eil facal Gàidhlig aice  Ach tha coltas blàth oirre. Feuchaidh mi. Halò. Ciamar a tha sibh  Agus rinn i gàire. An sgrìobh mi an dàn seo, no an colbh seo, no an aithisg seo, no an leabhar seo, no an rannsachadh seo, ann an Gàidhligno ann am Beurla  Tha iomadh dòigh ann gus cànain eadar ginealaicha bhrosnachadh, eadar cèilidhean is còmhraidhean, bho litreachas gu làthaireachd.

The Eco-Schools Programme is the world’s largest Environmental Education programme and aims to make environmental awareness and action an intrinsic part of the le and ethos of a school. Its participatory approach and combination of learning and action makes it an ideal way for schools to begin improving the environments of schools and their local communities. Eco-Schools work through a simple seven-step process resulting in the programme becoming central to the schools ethos. Schools can choose from ten eco-topics ranging from litter and waste to energy, bioersity and transport to name a few. Eco-Schools work towards achieving awards - bronze, silver and the prestigious Green Flag.The internationally recognised Green Flag is this highest award given to Eco-Schools and symbolises excellence in the field of environmental activity. Over the past two years, pupils of Buick Memorial have been working hard on many initiatives in order to address their chosen topics of Waste, Litter and Bioersity. Together with Eco Coordinators Mrs Carleton and Miss Stirling, they have produced policies on printing, recycling and litter for staff and pupils within the school to follow. Their continued commitment to regular Cash for Clobber collections enabled the school to purchase a number of new bins for the playground. Thanks to Catherine Hunter, Mid and East Antrim Education Officer, the children were able to give each class a bin for food waste, allowing the Eco Club to produce compost for their many planting activities. A highlight of the Eco-School endeavours is the annual litter-pick with Cullybackey Community Partnership and thanks must be given in particular to Margaret Murphy who is always keen to help the children in any way she can. The school is extremely grateful to Cranswick Country Foods for providing a superb wooden structure for the ‘plastic bottle greenhouse’ project and to Barry Tapster, Mid and East Antrim Recycling Officer, for his guidance. This year has been exceptionally busy, with the introduction of a termly ‘Walking Week’ which the pupils and parents have strongly supported. The Eco Club have spent a lot of time tending to the school pond area building mini-beast and frog hotels, making bird feeders and planting flowers for pollinators amongst many other tasks. None of these opportunities would have run as smoothly were it not for the unwavering input from Mr Fleckand the dedication of Ms Harkin . The positive attitude and increased awareness of environmental issues is evident within the school from Nursery through to P and this Green Flag is a welcome acknowledgement of the children’s efforts.The International Eco-Schools Programme is operated in Northern Ireland by Keep Northern Ireland Beautul and is a free to enter programme.

The Dailyhas reported that firms may receive subsidies from HMRC to help them deal with extra checks as result of the Irish Sea border.It is expected that the payments would last for two years to support businesses with new administrative processes.When the Brexit transition period ends on January  Northern Ireland will remain in the EU single market for goods, while the rest of the UK will not.Earlier this week the UK Government submitted applications to the EU to create Border Control Posts at Northern Ireland#s ports.This will allow products entering Northern Ireland from Great Britain to be checked.There will also be a £m fund to help companies across the UK train their staff and upgrade their IT systems to make them compatible with the Government#s Good Vehicle Movement Service .The system will manage goods moving between Great Britain and Northern Ireland and will be mainly used by lorry and haulage firms.It will involve hauliers entering good#s safety, security, transport and export declarations to generate a code which can then be presented at ports to streamline the process, it will also be used to determine which loads need to undergo checks. The Government hopes to introduce a pilot scheme in November and have it fully operational by January .\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk fbac .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_baa-f--be-dfcf_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk fbac .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_baa-f--be-dfcf_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk fbac .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_baa-f--be-dfcf_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk fbac .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_baa-f--be-dfcf_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk fbac .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_baa-f--be-dfcf_ w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeClose\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk fbac .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_baa-f--be-dfcf_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk fbac .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_baa-f--be-dfcf_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk fbac .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_baa-f--be-dfcf_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk fbac .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_baa-f--be-dfcf_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk fbac .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_baa-f--be-dfcf_ w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"International Trade Secretary Liz Truss  FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappInternational Trade Secretary Liz Truss Meanwhile, International Trade Secretary Liz Truss has said the Government#s Brexit border plan could undermine Northern Ireland#s place in the UK#s customs territory.Business Insider revealed that Ms Truss wrote to Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak and Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster Michael Gove on Wednesday to express four key areas of concern. She detailed concern at how the new border border plans could affect Northern Ireland.“I understand that the digital delivery of the dual tarf system [both EU and UK tarf] in Northern Ireland is a high risk and that HMRC are planning to apply the EU tarf as a default to all imports in Northern Ireland on January , ,” Ms Truss said.“This is very concerning as this may call into question Northern Ireland’s place in the UK customs territory. Failure to deliver the UK tarf digitally in Northern Ireland would have political, legal and reputational risks.”She also expressed concern about a potential World Trade Organization challenge to the UK#s border regime when the transition period ends.“This is especially relevant concerning the implementation of the Northern Ireland protocol and the application of the staged approach,” the International Trade Secretary said.“These measures could signicantly impact on the UK’s reputation at the WTO and I would appreciate your assurance that full border checks for EU-GB goods will be implemented no later than July  and that all messaging will clearly reflect this point.” Belfast Most ReadBelfast City Council chiefs# quit threat over Bobby Storey funeral rowNoah Donohoe dad: The son I never metFear and loathing in Crossgar... but was village#s #local lockdown# really necessary Pastor Halliday charged over Black Lives Matter Facebook post and witness intimidationFor sale!

But the review team said the issues indicated system-wide problems and that the issues uncovered were unlikely to be unique to those three areas. Additional problems, mistakes and tragedies may have occurred in the healthcare system, the authors said. In Northern Ireland around , women have had vaginal mesh implants, and around  of them were involved in the Sling the Mesh campaign.Baroness Julia Cumberlege, who chaired the Independent Medicines and Medical Devices Safety Review, described how women#s lives had been turned upside down by surgical mesh, adding: They told us about experiencing splintered glass inside them, razors inside them, in their bodies. And that gave them permanent, unremitting pain. She added: We travelled around the UK and met over  women and their families and I have to say, it made such a lasting impression on us. And some of those stories, I will certainly take to my grave. Their experiences were harrowing. We learnt about damaged families under immense strain, relationships that have been destroyed and careers broken. And as a result, financial ruin. A number of mesh-injured women said their doctors, surgeons or GPs ignored or dismissed their concerns. Some clinicians# reactions ranged from it#s all in your head to these are women#s issues or it#s that time of le, the report states. For the women concerned this was tantamount to a complete denial of their concerns and being written off by a system that was supposed to care. The review says women have also raised concerns about missing or altered medical records. And many said they were told the treatment was a new gold standard. The treatment has been used in the pelvis for  years, but the review said that its long-term risk profile is still unknown. Mr Swann said the report highlighted failures in the healthcare system, including the need to listen and understand patients# voices and concerns they had raised around certain treatments. While the focus of the report is on the healthcare system in England, it is recognised that many women from here took the time to submit their experience thereby highlighting similar failures within our service, he said.Mr Swann added: I must apologise to these women and others who were similarly affected, on behalf of the system, and I must offer my thanks to those women for taking the time to highlight these concerns to the review.While our healthcare system does treat the majority of patients safely, the message is that we can do better. We will now give this review report the full and careful consideration it deserves within the local and national context.Belfast Most ReadBelfast City Council chiefs# quit threat over Bobby Storey funeral rowFear and loathing in Crossgar... but was village#s #local lockdown# really necessary Noah Donohoe dad: The son I never metPastor Halliday charged over Black Lives Matter Facebook post and witness intimidationParades Commission reroutes Belfast parade due to #potential disorder#,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

There is a potential for public disorder.Read More All eyes will be on us: Loyalists urge bonfire organisers to follow coronavirus regulations The north Belfast parade is one of three to have been so far categorised as sensitive by the commission, which was informed last month by the Attorney General that it had no legal powers to prevent parades from taking place.As the Twelfth falls on a Sunday this year, official demonstrations were due to take place the next day. However, the Orange Order announced in April it would not hold demonstrations due to the pandemic.More than  loyalist bands have made notications to parade between July  and . The watchdog said the Ballysillan notied route includes a parading area with a history of sensitive parades and it had previously received substantial objections to loyalist marches.The parade has been limited to two-and-a-half hours and it is prohibited from certain residential areas, conditions the commission described as proportionate, necessary and fair.It noted the parade organiser had said they were willing to avoid Squires Hill Road and had prepared a banner reminding supporters not to follow the band, adding leaflets echoing the same message had been distributed to households.Meanwhile, the Stoneyford Somme parade has been told by the commission not to enter Stoneyford village on July , and must only last  minutes. The original notication had requested an hour.The same time limit restriction has been imposed on the local Sons of William Flute Band parade, which is to take place on July  and has been ordered to reroute its outward parade, as well as being prohibited from walking itsroute.The commission noted that the respective organisers of the Stoneyford parades had a history of notying paradesthat do not take place, adding both bands have fewany members, and may exist in name only.

Also speaking at Mollys funeral service, Father Michael Canny said she was a person who had time for others and would chat with themthey were feeling down. “Of course, immediate and extended family were important to her,” said Father Canny. googletag.cmd.push “She also was a volunteer at Hillcrest House and involved down through the years in their summer schemes and other things. “The days ahead will be challenging, most of us will go from here but the immediate family will be left on their own to try to pick up the pieces of le again. “It won’t be easy, le will go on, le goes on, but for you le will be much, much dferent. “But at the same time I think you will be able to reflect on Molly and on the dferent rays of sunshine she brought into your lives.” Mollys uncle, Denny Elliott, said she loved giving and receiving hugs. “She was bursting with affection and would give you hugs that you felt the love flowing from her into you. They’ll now stay with us forever,” he said. “She never shut up - ‘wait til you hear’ she’d say and then you’d just listen and not get a word in edgeways. “Those one way conversations will now stay with us forever.” Mr Elliott said his niece was someone who was there for everybody. “Only last week, Mollys best friend felt a wee bit down and did the right thing, reaching out to his best friend Molly, not knowing for the last time. “Come down for a wee chat and a hug, she said. That chat will stay with him forever.” Mr Elliott said Molly loved her family deeply but they were struggling to come to terms with her sudden death. In a direct message to Mollys friends and other young people, he quoted renowned poet Walt Whitman who wrote ‘the powerful play goes on and you may contribute a verse. “What will your verse be ” Mr Elliott asked of young people. “Let Mollys verse be this: No other young person who knew her or reads about her will ever feel the need to end their le but instead reach out all around them and share their fears, doubts and insecurities to their mothers, fathers, siblings, carers and friends and relations.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

On  May, George Floyd - a black man – was surrounded by four white men in police unorms, all with guns. Three of them stood by while one literally squeezed the le out of him – all the time knowing they were being filmed. We watched this video – like many others globally - and imagined it was our son, our husband, our brother, our friend. It was traumatic. The familiarity and the horror of these images demanded that we raise our voices and demonstrate our anger and pain. But that is the US you might think - it is not like that here. There are not so many black people in Northern Ireland, so it is less visible but systemic racism is pervasive. The qualications of many black nurses working in the NHS are not recognised for further post-graduate study. This is discriminatory and obstructs career development and promotion. While around % of nurses and % of doctors in the NHS are from ethnic minorities, none are senior managers. googletag.cmd.push The fact that we don’t actually know how many black people there are in NI is a symptom of this institutional blindness. We are so unimportant we aren’t even counted. We have been calling for ethnic monitoring for years as part of the Racial Equality Strategy but are yet to see concrete action. On  June, we peacefully protested – to show solidarity with George Floyd but also to raise awareness about racism here. Unlike other large public gatherings during the pandemic, all participants wore masks. Hand sanitizer was available and social distancing was enforced. The messaging about the events stressed public health. googletag.cmd.push But when we arrived at the Guildhall what happened to us  We were intimidated. There were armoured vehicles everywhere. I was surrounded by three white men, all in police unorms, all with guns. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK where the police are routinely armed. It is also the only part of the UK where organizers and participants in BLM rallies have been prosecuted and fined. We are hurt and disappointed that the PSNI cannot see this. They seem to be sorry that we are upset but incapable of understanding why we’re upset. In their statement on the protest they describe George Floyd’s death as “avoidable and unnecessary”. It was intentional murder. One week after our events, another protest to “protect statues” was organized in Belfast. There were no fines and no prosecutions. When we have challenged the PSNI and the Justice Minister on this blatant double standard we have received confused, contradictory, and inaccurate information. Last week there was another prominent large public gathering. The PSNI have said they are reviewing evidence. The policing style at both these events was markedly dferent – we will raise this with the Equality Commission for possible breach of our human rights. What made our events distinct  There are no elected black politicians in Northern Ireland. Our community is not represented in power sharing institutions. The PSNI demonstrated that they can show understanding of context and nuance when policing majority groups amid this pandemic. Yet the one visible event organized by black people was criminalized from the outset – with additional enforcement powers added to the Coronavirus Regulations rushed into force at pm on  June.  The PSNI have said they support our aims – but do they  The protests were about police violence and impunity. Have they thought about the way black people have historically been criminalized how they are disproportionately stopped and searched why young black men are perceived as dangerous and young women sexually harassed  We have made three demands to the PSNI: - Rescind the fines - Drop the prosecutions - Issue a public apology The PSNI tell us there is nothing they can do. They are hiding behind process arguing that while there is a review by the Police Ombudsman their hands are tied. They want to move forward but after the way we were treated on  June there is no trust. Cressida Dick of the politan police did not hesitate to apologise for the behaviour of her officers who shared selfies of two murdered black women – “ it is as it appears to be” – even though there is an ongoing investigation. She apologized because she knew it was wrong and how damaging such behaviour by police officers is to public trust and community safety. We truly want to work with the police – it is vital we can feel safe, protected, and equal before the law. But we need actions not words. We need the PSNI to demonstrate they can treat us with the same sensitivity and understanding they treat majority communities.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

I have had several queries from dferent sources about why we can’t just go back to normal appointments. I have prepared a short pieceyou wished to publish in your respective papers. Due to COVID- GP practices have had to adapt like everyone . Despite the wishes of staff and patients that we go back to normal services which includes letting people book their own appointments, it just isn’t possible. googletag.cmd.push We have a duty to all patients as well as our staff. Before any attendance at the practice you will be contacted to make sure you do not have COVID- symptoms. This will be similar for any appointments. We must also remind people not to attend any public placeyou are ill as you should be isolating and getting tested. All services like immunisations, and advice regarding any condition can still be accessed. Practices have become very efficient and even our practice staff are triaging calls to help the smooth and speedy delivery of services. We also have new team members, like physios, social workers, pharmacists and mental health workers. It is vital that you are connected to the correct team member to sort out your problem. googletag.cmd.push The reception staff may ask details regarding the problem to help this process. Practices are still asking people to attend the surgery for tests or examination and to avoid unnecessary trips or exposure we are also using things like video consults. Despite the talk about the ending of lockdown, COVID- is not ending. It is still there and will spread unless we continue to take precautions. This means we cannot have waiting rooms full of patients and allow someone to land in with symptoms and possibly infect a whole waiting room. If you attend the surgery you will be asked to wear a mask. It remains good practice to wash your hands regularly and wear a maskout. Despite the end of lock down, high risk patients remain high risk, and while the government restrictions do not apply, personallyI had been shielding I would continue to limit my contact with crowds during to the risk of infection. We do not have a vaccine yet, and according to figures we are nowhere near herd immunity levels, so any thoughts that COVID- is over are premature. This explains why GPs cannot go back to how things were pre-COVID and may not be able to for some time.We thank the public for their support in this.“ Dr Paul Molloy Western LMC Secretary.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

We have been working with all parties in Londonderry to move this issue forward and make it a reality.

The issue of redeveloping the derelict Meenan Square site has dragged on for a number of years. Controversial bonfires have been built at the site in the past and over recent weeks materials have been gathered and burned on a regular basis. In February, The Executive Officethrough its Urban Villages Initiative said it was working with Apex Housing Association and other statutory agencies to take forward plans to ‘transform’ the site. googletag.cmd.push This would incorporate youth and community facilities, social housing and small commercial units. At that time locals, including workers at Denis’s Wee Shop and councillors for the Moor area confirmed to the Derry News that people had been asked to vacate premises to allow for demolition of the buildings. The Bogside Inn was supposed to be part of the second phase of redevelopment – possibly years down the line. Demolition work has not yet taken place and TEO was asked why there are further delays. A spokesperson for TEO said: “The Meenan Square site is privately owned and the Department understands the owner did ask businesses to vacate the site in recent months. googletag.cmd.push “Work is continuing by the Department’s Urban Villages team and other stakeholders to allow for development of the site, however plans will be subject to business case and other statutory approvals and community consultation before any construction work can commence.” HEALTH HAZARD Sinn Feacutein Foyle MLA Karen Mullan has said there are several long- and short-term issues that need resolved to deal with the re-development of the Meenan Square site in the Bogside which has become a source of anti-social activity.

The issue of redeveloping the derelict Meenan Square site has dragged on for a number of years. Controversial bonfires have been built at the site in the past and over recent weeks materials have been gathered and burned on a regular basis. In February, The Executive Officethrough its Urban Villages Initiative said it was working with Apex Housing Association and other statutory agencies to take forward plans to ‘transform’ the site. googletag.cmd.push This would incorporate youth and community facilities, social housing and small commercial units. At that time locals, including workers at Denis’s Wee Shop and councillors for the Moor area confirmed to the Derry News that people had been asked to vacate premises to allow for demolition of the buildings. The Bogside Inn was supposed to be part of the second phase of redevelopment – possibly years down the line. Demolition work has not yet taken place and TEO was asked why there are further delays. A spokesperson for TEO said: “The Meenan Square site is privately owned and the Department understands the owner did ask businesses to vacate the site in recent months. googletag.cmd.push “Work is continuing by the Department’s Urban Villages team and other stakeholders to allow for development of the site, however plans will be subject to business case and other statutory approvals and community consultation before any construction work can commence.” HEALTH HAZARD Sinn Feacutein Foyle MLA Karen Mullan has said there are several long- and short-term issues that need resolved to deal with the re-development of the Meenan Square site in the Bogside which has become a source of anti-social activity. Karen Mullan MLA said “It’s very apparent that there are short and long-term issues that need to be resolved at this scar site at Meenan Square. “I and Councillor Patricia Logue are dealing with problems around this site on an ongoing basis. “It is a health hazard and an eyesore for the residents of the area who have to look at it daily and deal with the anti-community activity that takes place there. “There must be a collective effort over the summer period to deal with the recurring problems at this site which includes the illegal dumping of materials, the subsequent burning of those materials, the impact it is having in the area and the serious health hazards this throws up.” She added: “There are also child protection issues with some very young children and teenagers being in around a very dangerous site hrs a day. “In relation to any future plans for this site I fully understand the processes involved and that they take time and like everything they have been impacted by the onset of the Coronavirus Crisis and the change of ownership. But all bodies have a responsibility to prioritise this development. “Over the past number of years myself and Cllr Patricia have worked intensely with the owners, the local community, Iona Enterprises, Dove House Community Trust, The Executive Office , Urban Villages and Council to progress the site to development and had hoped that demolition would have taken place before now. “The residents in the immediate area have suffered for too long as this site has been allowed to fall into neglect and dereliction. “I am confident that everyone involved is committed to delivering the proposed regeneration project that we all desire. “I would urge all the stakeholders to redouble their efforts and commitments to ensure that this community gets the facilities and services that the redeveloped Meenan Park will deliver.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

It was scary, even for an introvert like me who didn’t mind staying at home – the notion that there would be no end in sight struck at our collective sense of normality – what was safe, what was normal  Most of the towns bars and clubs took the selfless decision to close from th March and whilst the guidance from governments was just gearing up, Derry slowly went into hibernation. About two weeks in, I thought to myself ‘this must be nearing an end’ but I was wrong, in fact it was getting worse and we all watched with, in my case, genuine fear as the numbers of those infected and those who had sadly lost their lives mounted each night for days and weeks. googletag.cmd.push I should say that my lockdown has been at the lower end of the stress scale. I don’t have children to feed or home school and I can work from home. Whilst having that level of free time, however, I exhausted my in-house options fairly quickly. I painted the house, reconfigured rooms and did someDIY. After about the fth week indoors though, I had a lot more time to sit and observe the lives of others, whether through social media or the news, and I would love to be able to just pause at that point and look at how we all coped. googletag.cmd.push I watched as people drted away from the scornful, reality-tv fuelled selfishness that had increasingly eaten away at that old spirit of community Derry was once famous for. My facebook was overloaded with scenes of kindness and understanding. Neighbours looking out for one another, umpteen tonnes of banana bread being offered as gts and when all the distraction of shopping, going for pints and buying the latest gear was removed, we all reverted to our default settings. Nature was once again our playground, family was again the lynchpin that held it all together and our st century blinkers came off, maybe for the first time in some of our lives. It was the best of us. I say that in no way to gloss over the loss of members of our families and our communities. There will always be a void left by those who we couldn’t mourn properly and lay to rest in our traditional ways. I think we owe it to their memories to try and capture the things that changed us over the last few months and apply it to how we will come out of this. Remember that it was during this time that nurses and doctors, not reality tv wannabes that put their shoulder to the wheel. Remember the gratitude we all shared every day and the fervour we showed in demanding that they be paid better  We shouldn’t forget that just because our amazon deliveries are back to normal, or because Primark has again opened. Hundreds and thousands of meals were prepared for those in need across the city, and whilst at the time I am sure we all thought this was fantastic, look below the surface and ask yourself why in  there are people in our town who can’t afford to feed themselves or their families. Lockdown exposed a lot about the society we live in, good and bad. If we can harness the good, we can take the initiative away from people like bungling Boris and force the issue of looking after our key workers, paying a decent wage and this time, keep that community spirit alive. I thought prior to lockdown that we were too far gone, I learned dferent. I learned what was important and most importantly – who. I didn’t need politicians, I needed the Iceland delivery driver. I didn’t need ‘influencers’, I needed my local chemist and I certainly didn’t need constant social media trolling, I needed my postwoman. Now don’t get me wrong, there were a few days there where I would have done anything for a cold pint, and its only natural that we want to be able to go and do the things we are used to, but there is a real genuine opportunity for us to plot the course out of the pandemic and out of the depressing situation the world is in by just remembering we are all human and we are all caring and responsible people at heart.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

This week I want to highlight the plight of many small businesses across the city and tell you what you can do to help them survive. For the past  weeks many businesses have shut their doors and either furloughed staff or made them redundant. Now, however, is the time to get the economy on this Island back up and running. We cant as a society afford to stay shut any longer. There isnt the option to stay closed and until a vaccine is found. googletag.cmd.push This is just fancul thinking and would bankrupt any economy that attempted this strategy. We must learn to live with the virus within our society and shield the most vulnerable from it. The rest of us must take responsibility for our own protection and follow the guidelines set out by government. Both the British and Irish governments in fairness have risen to the challenge and supported businesses and workers for the last four months. The continuation of this support indefinitely isnt economically sustainable. The cost of the support to date has been largely borrowed by governments and will need to be repaid at some stage by raising taxes. googletag.cmd.push There is no such thing as free money from any government in the world. If you get something from government, it will most certainly will be got back by a tax.  So, lets all accept that we have suppressed the virus and now is the time to re-open our economy and get back to work as best we can in the circumstances. Now let us not forget that many of our local businesses watched in dismay as their income streams totally dried up in March. Over the last three months many have had virtually no income, but bills have still mounted up. Some got reduced rates and rents, however bills unpaid since March are waiting for them now as they open. Landlords will be looking rent again and creditors will be looking paid. The Inland Revenue who has been quiet for a while will be back looking for taxes due for last year and on account for . As these small firms re-open their doors and staff come off government furlough schemes the next few months will either make or break them. They really need our support folks so please support themyou can. Very few businesses havent been affected by this crisis and as the economy begins, the bills may come at them quicker than their customers. There could be a bloodbath in terms of bankruptciesphysical re-opening is ahead of consumer confidence. Many local businesses are opening tentatively not knowingcustomers willin the pre-Covid numbers. For some businesses consumer confidence is their biggest issue. Many customers might shun these businesses for fear of catching the virus. The fear factor is still pretty high amongst some consumer groups, but I hope this is confined just to people that fall into the highest risk of infection . For other businesses like restaurants hairdressers etc. the problem will be the new guidelines and how they effect the delivery of the service and capacity of the business. A good example of this can be seen in the recent price hikes announced by hairdressers in Dublin before they re-opened. With capacity reduced signicantly due to social distancing and the additional costs linked to cleaning hygiene etc. many had to increase prices by as much as %. I dont expect increases of this scale in Derry but I have a lot of sympathy for a business that is forced to increase their prices due to reduced capacity. Its not price gauging and has more to do with the current restrictions and capacity reduction. People shouldnt jump to social media with tales of being robbed or fleeced. Its really a case of pricing to survive for many businesses. These next few weeks will be make or break for many companies re-opening after the lockdown so I believe its our civic duty to do as much as we can to support them. What can we do  The simplest answer is get out there and spendyou can afford it. Put the keyboard down and stop buying online unless you really have to. Book a meal and get out there and enjoy a might out. By doing this you are not only supporting your local restaurant but you’re also helping to preserve jobs. Get up the town and spend a few pound, would be my advice. What we all do over the next few months can make a huge dference and could help save hundreds of jobs in the city. If we dont engage with our local businesses, they will be forced to lay people off. Go out and buy a bed for the spare room. Get that much needed haircut. Take the boyfriend out for that steak dinner. We really have to support local shops, service providers and manufacturers now more than ever. And remember, we can do all of this and stay safewe follow the rules, wear a mask and keep the proper distance. Taking holidays in Ireland or a Staycation will also help. And folks this is not me crying wolf. Huge jobs losses are already occurring across these Islands as we come out of this crisis. Intu Properties, which owns or part-owns  huge shopping centres across the UK and Spain, including the Trafford centre in Manchester, has filed for bankruptcy already last week. It will not the last business casualty of the Covid- crisis. So do your bit folks. Get back out there and spend what you can afford locally, and help keeps jobs in Derry.   --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Allowing pubs, restaurants and hairdressers to open will be another step in our plan to kickstart our economic recovery in a safe manner.” The guidance that is set out provides clear, practical steps businesses can take to open in a way that is as safe as possible for workers and customers. Separate guidance has been published for hairdressers, which states that a clear visor should be worn by the person providing the service, covering the face and providing a barrier between the wearer and the customer from respiratory droplets caused by sneezing, coughing or speaking. The government is also consulting with industry on how businesses should record customer information to help keep customers and employees safe and support the new test and trace system.

But Claire, her staff and her customers are delighted that the Lisburn business is reopening after putting safety measures in place. Claire first opened the Barber’s Den four years ago and such was its popularity she also decided to expand to include The Hairdresser’s Den for all the ladies of Lisburn. When they had to put the business on hold due to the Covid- pandemic, it was an understandably worrying time for Claire and her staff. She said: “I am heavily pregnant. I’m  weeks now. When I found out the salon had to close the first thought was stress, panic, and what is going to happen to my clients. We closed early. We have about  to  clients a day so that is a lot of footfall and I had a real concern about safety.” Claire and her team have been busy getting the salon ready to welcome back her valued customers. With the rearrangement of the salon to allow social distancing, the introduction of PPE, risk assessment and team training, Claire is ready for the influx of people who are desperate for a haircut after the long months of lockdown.  Claire said: “The guidelines are good. We have posters up with the guidelines on them and I have held a team meeting to carry out a risk assessment and explain to the staff what is expected of them. “Hand sanitisers have been installed and everywhere has been thoroughly cleaned. “There are face coverings and shields for the staff and we will provide coverings for the customersthey would prefer to wear them. We also have gloves and aprons for the staff. “We are advising people to make appointments butthere is a ‘walk in’ I have been advised that I don’t have to turn them away.” ‘Clients and staff will feel safe in our salon’ CASE STUDY THAT ROSIE GLOW Edinburgh Hair and beauty salon That Rosie Glow is preparing to open for business on July  after almost four months of closure. A number of safety measures will be in place to help prevent the spread of Covid- when the business opens. The salon has already installed clear screens between each treatment station, and at the reception desk. Customers and staff will be asked to wear face coverings, and customers will be requested to visit the salon alone where possible, and arrive on time rather than early to reduce time spent in the waiting area. They will have to keep their coats and belongings with them instead of them being hung up by staff, and there will be no magazines or refreshments available.Each station and any equipment used will be thoroughly cleaned between customers, and clean towels or gowns will be used with each one.  Salon owner Rosie Fraser said: “We closed on March , but we have kept our social media active and positive, and kept in touch with clients.” The salon, which opened in January , has nine members of staff who are all self-employed. Ms Fraser said she has tried to make the new measures as comfortable as possible, including the screens bearing the salon’s name. She said: “I wanted to make sure the clients and also the staff felt safe coming back, and we also wanted people to feel like it’s a nice experience and not too clinical. In this new normal we will be coming into we wanted to have safety but with style so that women still feel like they are having an enjoyable experience.” ‘Orders starting to pick up once again’ CASE STUDY CORGI When lockdown was announced, luxury knitwear company Corgi knew they had the experience to get through the Covid- crisis. The Welsh firm – which has a Royal Warrant from the Prince of Wales – has ridden many an economic downturn in its illustrious -year-old history. Co-owner Chris Jones, who is great-great grandson of the company’s founder, said: “We take a view that you can get through anything. I think it makes it easier because we’ve been through crises before.” It helped that the Ammanford-based firm had been through five fantastic years before coronavirus struck. In March they furloughed  of their  staff but now many are ing as orders begin to pick up. Corgi makes hand-finished wool, cotton and cashmere socks and other knitwear and Chris said: “Normally we run two shts on the sock machine, so we kept going with one. Next week going back to one and a half shts – we’re going to have the other knitters coming in some of the time.”  LOOKING UP: Corgi co-owner Chris Jones With shops reopening, old customers are beginning to ask for new sales catalogues and Chris expects business to pick up properly in around a month. What has helped the business survive more than anything though was the package of financial help the Government made available. Chris said: “The furlough scheme has practically saved us. Without it, we’d have been in a lot of trouble or we’d have managed but we’d have had to let a lot of people go.” Go to visitbritain gb en know-before-you-go to plan your great days out --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The supermarket giant wants to build a new store in the Buncrana Road area of the city. The company first applied for planning permission for the proposed store on a vacant site at the junction of Buncrana Road and Springtown Roadin .  The Derry News has learned that planners at Derry City and Strabane District Council have recommended that planning permission be granted for the store. The final approval for the development now rests with councillors on the council’s planning committee. If the new supermarket gets the green light from local councillors, Lidl says it will close its current store at Buncrana Road. googletag.cmd.push However, the company would retain its current building for storage purposes. In its planning submissions, Lidl said that they wanted to build a new larger store in Derry because of the lack of expansion space at its present store. The proposed new store would have much more parking facilities. The entrance to the new store would be via the Springtown Road which would reduce the traffic pressure on the busy Buncrana Road. Traffic entering and leaving Lidl’s current store creates a frequent bottleneck on the Buncrana Road. googletag.cmd.push  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Marie Lindsay is to step down as principal of St Marys College. Among those to pay tribute to her work was a spokesperson for St Eugenes Cathedral. A parish spokesperson said Mrs Lindsay had a great impact on the lives of students and staff through her leadership in St Marys College. She has also directly advanced the mission of evangelisation of the Church here in the Diocese of Derry. As an educator and leader, Marie has made an exceptional contribution to Catholic education here in the City and beyond. Marie, on behalf of everyone in the St Eugenes Parish we wish you very well in your retirement, the spokesperson added. googletag.cmd.push Mrs Lindsay joined St Marys in  and taught science for  years before being appointed principal in . During her time as principal, St Marys were involved in the first formal Shared Education Programme with Lisneal College. In , the school was awarded Specialist Status in Science and continues to promote STEM subjects and career paths. In , Mrs Lindsay was named Principal of the Year at the Foyle Blackboard Awards and in April  she was inducted into the Business Excellence Hall of Fame. Derrys Mayor Brian Tierney said Mrs Lindsay had done so much for education within the city. googletag.cmd.push Its with great pleasure that I offer my congratulations to Marie on her retirement, and with great admiration that I look back on everything that she has achieved both as teacher and, later, as a principal at St Marys College. Marie perfectly captured everything that teaching is about as she went above and beyond every day to put the needs of her students first. She was incredibly active within the community, including on our Council Education and Skills working group, to ensure that those not just within her own school, but across the district also,were receiving the best education they could. With two of her daughters recently welcoming a set of twins each Im sure she will certainly be kept very busy, and I look forward to welcoming Marie, her husband Collie and her family to the Mayors Parlour to celebrate her career when the guidelines allow it. I wish Marie a healthy and happy retirement, and offer my sincere thanks to her for everything she has done for theeducation sectorin our district.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Bernadette Radclfe, from the Brandywell, bought a ticket for a competition to win a black Lamborghini Gallardo on a whim when she saw it advertised on social media. Mrs Radclfe had just a one in , chance of winning the prize from Derry company Vogue Competitions She couldnt believe her luck when she got a call from Derry singer and entertainer Micky Doherty who had picked her name out using a computerised random number generator. Micky then paid a surprise visit to Bernadette who was celebrating with a cup of tea at her sister Siobhans house in Galliagh Park. googletag.cmd.push Shes doesnt drink, she doesnt smoke and she doesnt drive so she was celebrating with a cup of tea and a Club biscuit, laughed Micky. Anybody  would be drinking a bucket of vodka. Micky said he was delighted Mrs Radclfe had won the prize because shes a lovely person. Shes from the Lecky Road which is where my mother was from so it was very special to me. At first I didnt recognise her name because I would know her as Bernie, but then I realised that I know her and all her sisters for a long time. Shes a lovely person and a real lady. googletag.cmd.push I always say nice things happen to nice people. Earlier that day Bernie was out handing out candles of Sister Clareand I said a wee prayer to Sr Clare before I picked the winner that I would pick the person that deserved it. She works in mysterious ways. The Lamborghini was part of a three part prize draw that also included a Rolex watch which was won by Niall McDaid from Bishops Street from a pound ticket and a lawn mower which went to Patrick McDaid from Rosemount who purchased a ticket for pound. Blaine Tierney of Vogue Competitions and Vogue Car sales in Springtown has given away a large number of cars in competitions since lockdown began in March. The Lamborghini is our biggest giveaway yet, its an amazing car and it would cost pound, new, he said. Its brilliant to be able to give people le changing prizes and the majority of the prize winners have been from Derry.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

There will be no official Orange Order parades after the organisation announced their cancellation earlier this year. Grand Secretary of the Orange Order, Mervyn Gibson, urged people to stay at home, while the Order have launched a ‘Twelfth at Home’ campaign to urge people to celebrate safely. “This year the Twelfth is about everyone’s health. You have to understand why we cancelled the parades. Parades attract large crowds,” he said. “Bandsmen will simply be going into a village or an estate or a street and playing some music. googletag.cmd.push “We would be saying to everyone to stay at your door, stay in your garden, listen to them and enjoy, butyou see a band, please don’t follow them.” The Parades Commission list for July  includes parades in Maghera, Moneymore, Limavady, Garvagh, Articlave, Tobermore and Magherafelt. Two separate bands will parade in Coleraine, Castledawson and Macosquin, but none will take place simultaneously. Numbers of participants have been capped at , with ten of the thirteen bands applying for the maximum amount, while all but one list the number of planned supporters as . The exception is in Magherafelt, where the Ballymoughan Purple Guards Flute Band have specied an ‘unknown’ number of supporters will be attending the parade. googletag.cmd.push Maghera Sons of William Flute Band said no members of their local Orange Lodge would be parading with the band. “No members of MSOW LOL will be on parade with the band,” they said in a post on their Facebook page. “Social distancing protocol will be followed, and we ask members of the public not to gather around the area of the Orange Hall. “The route is the longest we can do, taking in the majority of the town. We encourage you to stay in your gardens and enjoy the time with your family as the band passes by.” The Ulster Bands Forum, an online  for marching bands, have issued a plea for supporters to protect themselves and the bands. “Bands are going to a lot of effort for you, please afford them the same respect and support,” they said. “Dont follow the band, they will make every effort to come to you. Do not travel outside your local area to see bands. “If you need to use a car to see your local band, stay inside and park safely. Observe social distancing measures at all times. Dont invite all and sundry to your garden. “Lets hold our heads high after this and be able to say we respected and observed our culture whilst staying within the law,” the statement concluded. Mid Ulster District Councillor Paul McLean said the bands have made it clear that everyone should obey safety guidelines. The DUP group on Mid Ulster Council believe bands that have organised such events are clear that they wish everyone to abide by the social distancing regulations and guidelines, he said. They will bring the Twelfth to the community who they ask remain in their homes and gardens and not to participate in the parade.I welcome the bands’ commitment to celebrate proudly and safely and I would ask everyone to do as they have asked. Abiding by the regulations and guidelines ensures our friends, our familIes and our neighbours are protected and demonstrates the ongoing commitment to our NHS.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The markets the fishermen serve have been decimated by the Covid- crisis but Pat Close, Chair of Lough Neagh Fishermen’s Co-Operative Society, said they are hopeful of an announcement soon. “Discussions have been going on for several weeks between Lough Neagh Fishermen’s Co-operative and senior DAERA officials with a view to securing some financial support,” he said. “The fishermen of Lough Neagh’s markets across Europe have been effectively wiped out in recent months due to the impact of the coronavirus pandemic. googletag.cmd.push “A workable scheme which accommodates the unique nature of the industry on the lough is at an advanced stage of drafting and are hopeful Minister Poots will be in a position to announce the scheme in the coming days.” Mid Ulster MLA, Emma Sheerin, welcomed the progression. “Discussions between the Department and the Coop are bearing fruit and we encourage the Minister to ensure financial support is delivered to hard-pressed fishing families,” she said. “Fishing is a labour-intensive industry, which unfortunately sees low s for most even in the best of times. “ has been a challenging year for many sectors, and the impact of the Covid- pandemic on our local fishing communities has been hugely damaging. googletag.cmd.push “The Lough Neagh Eel Fishing Co operative have raised a number of worries for the industry directly with the Minister, most notably the total decimation of the European market for eels. “Most of the eels produced in Lough Neagh end up on the plates of festival-attenders in Holland and Germany, and as lockdown rolled out, this demand obviously disappeared. This happened just as the fishing season began, leaving many fishermen with questions over the viability of their livelihood, and absolutely no income during lockdown.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The scheme is being run in association with Northern Healthy Lestyles Partnership and supported by Causeway Coast Vineyard and Henderson Retail. The kits include a slow cooker, cookbook and recipe ingredients for two meals and it is hoped they will provide a more sustainable option for shielding households to make healthy meals. Mayor of Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Council, Alderman Mark Fielding, said the kits would offer ‘practical support’. “It’s vital that we support the health and wellbeing of those who are shielding and this is a great example of how working with other agencies can enhance the lives of our residents,” he said. googletag.cmd.push “Practical support like this is very important during these unprecedented times, and these kits will make a real dference to vulnerable people across the area.” Michelle Donnelly from Henderson Retail said the initiative was a ‘fantastic idea’. “Since the beginning of lockdown our store teams have been doing all they can for their local communities, from providing home deliveries to the isolated and vulnerable, to helping foodbanks, charities and community groups,” she said. “Providing these ingredients means those who are still shielding can still enjoy a fresh, hot meal without any hassle.

I felt I was just limbering up to a career in writing, cutting my teeth and learning with each page.ldquoWith the books that followed, I grew in confidence and delivery until I felt I could begin to publish them.Kerryrsquos first stories were historical fantasy which she enjoyed working on tremendously, so much so that as more fiction followed, so did the acclaim.She said: ldquoIrsquove been lucky enough to win an ACNI SIAP award in  and then a second ACNI award earlier this year.

which inform drivers about their speed are to be erected in Downpatrick, Newcastle, Killyleagh and Castlewellan by the districtrsquos Policing and Community Safety Partnership.The signs are to be erected at the Strangford Road in Downpatrick, Newcastlersquos South Promenade, Castlewellanrsquos Dublin Road and the Shrigley Road in Killyleagh.A total of seven signs will be erected shortly across the Newry, Mourne and Down Council area as part of the major clampdown on speeders.The move has been welcomed by a number of local councillors including Dermot Curran, Willie Clarke, Billy Walker, Gareth Sharvin and John Trainor who say that the new signs have the potential to save lives by encouraging drivers to slow down in what are heavily populated areas.Cllr Curran said that drivers regularly ignored the mph zone along a large stretch of the Strangford Road.ldquoThis area is densely populated and there are always people walking at this part of the town. A number of accidents at this location have been blamed on speeding, with residents highlighting their concerns about the issue for some considerable time, he continued.ldquoThere is a clear and obvious need for the authorities to get to grips with the speeding problem and the PCSP deserves praise for this initiative. Unfortunately, many drivers think a large part of the Strangford Road is governed by a mph limit which is not case. Residents I have spoken to about the problem say the speed of some vehicles is frightening to say the least.Cllr Curran said that were many housing developments accessed via the Strangford Road which carries a high volume of pedestrian traffic.He added: ldquoWhile welcoming the speed indicator sign, I believe there is a need to move the mph limit back beyond the former Down Council headquarters. Speeders need to slow down before someone is killed.Cllr Sharvin believes one of the real benefits of the announcement is that it has ldquokick-started and energised a conversation among the public about other hot spots for speeding.He added: ldquoI recognise that these signs are an expensive investment but, ultimately, the success of them will be measured in how the public respond to them. If we can begin to see speeds lowered across the district and lives potentially saved, the scheme will have been a success.Cllr Trainor said he hopes the new signs will raise further awareness in driversrsquo minds on the need to reduce their speed along these stretches of road.He added: ldquoWe know that the Strangford Road is a hotspot for speeding traffic and the dangers associated with this. If the new signs reduce speed and help save lives they will be worthwhile, but but road safety is everyonersquos concern.Cllr Clarke said he is ldquodelighted that one of the new signs will be placed at Newcastlersquos South Promenade which carries a huge volume of traffic.He said news of the speed indicator sign will be welcomed be residents who live at this part of the resort and the many pedestrians who walk in the area will be encouraged by the initiative.ldquoI hope that the sign will go some way towards tackling the issue of speeding at this busy part of Newcastle, he said.ldquoThis is a welcome move and something that Sinn Feacutein has been lobbying for over many years to protect residents who live at this part of the resort. The speed sign will also hopefully make South Promenade safer for pedestrians.Cllr Clarke said the PCSP is committed to improving road safety across the district and will continue to work with local communities and local police to make this happen.The Mournes councillor also welcomed the provision of a speed sign at the Dublin Road in Castlewellan which is a main link to a number of towns and villages and carries a high volume of traffic.Welcoming the presence of a new speed sign at the Shrigley Road in Killyleagh, Cllr Walker said that he hopes drivers get the message and slow down.ldquoMany people walk along this particular road and it is vital that everything is done to keep them safe. I hope that thew new sign will act as a deterrent and drivers will ease off the accelerator, he continued.He added: ldquoThe PCSP deserves credit for listening to the concerns of elected representatives and the wider public on the speeding issue. The message must go out that speeders are placing their lives and those of other road users in danger. My appeal to all drivers is to obey the restrictions in place and drive below the permitted level in built-up areas..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th July 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Customers and owners delighted pubs re open  ","story":"PUBLICANS across the district have reported a positiveto opening their doors for the first time since the Covid- lockdown.Bars and restaurants were permitted to open for business last Friday by the Stormont Executive under strict conditions.Customers were only allowed indoors provided they were dining and and non-diners who permitted to drink outside, both socially distanced to m between people.After nearly four months of closure, the reopening was welcomed by publicans and customers alike.Despite being hampered by heavy rain throughout the weekend, publicans reported a generally positive reception by customers experiencing the lsquonew normalrsquo way of socialising.However, several publicans claimed that full compliance to all the drinking regulations was patchy in some towns throughout the district.Stephen Magorrian, owner of Denvirrsquos Coaching Inn in Downpatrick, said while numbers of drinkers and diners were less than normal over the weekend, his customers appreciated the social distancing precautions and measures his team had put in place.ldquoWhile it was probably quieter than I would have liked inside for dining, it was very well received by all our customers who were appreciative of how we had trained our staff and the measures we had in place, said Mr Magorrian.ldquoWe had a lot of very positive comments from customers as they left which we are taking as a good sign.ldquoLast weekend was really about making people feel safe in the hope that they will feel safe for customers and staff and be happy toand word will spread that we are taking their safety seriously.He added that while his team had planned how to cope with larger than expected turnout of customers by hiring a door supervisor, ldquosome other bars really went for it, like it was St Patrickrsquos Day.ldquoWe had no issues with any of our customers who were drinking outside and we were happy to welcome them back.Jack OrsquoHare, owner of OrsquoHarersquos in Newcastle, said he had enjoyed a ldquobusy weekend.ldquoCustomers were delighted to be back and so were our staff.

He said coronavirus restrictions have had a ldquodevastating impact on the railwayrsquos operations and its restoration work and needs financial help.Mr Gardiner also said the railway is likely to remain closed for the remainder of the year due to the restrictions around Covid- and the specic challenges the organisation faces with its trains, infrastructure and operations.ldquoWith no income for the rest of the year, we will face major challenges keeping the railway maintained and ensuring our vital work on our carriages, locomotives, track and stations can continue, he explained.ldquoOur final attempts at securing Covid- support funding from Stormont have failed, so now we reluctantly must turn to our members and supporters to ask for help. We need to raise at least pound, this year just to keep the railway in a good condition and make some progress with essential projects.Mr Gardiner said he could not see now to resume train operations this year in a way that will be safe and, at the same time, not compound the organisationrsquos financial situation by operating trains at a loss.Mr Gardiner said the railway supported the governmentrsquos call for a total lockdown of activities in the fight against Covid-.Even so, he said the lockdown had a ldquomassive hit hit on the railwayrsquos finances, leaving it struggling to keep ready to reopen when it is safe to do so.ldquoWe have just under pound, of bills to pay this year in essential, unavoidable costs alone, to keep the business in mothballs, Mr Gardiner revealed.ldquoWe have been paying these through our savings which were built up over the past few years but were meant for long-awaited essential maintenance, critical repair and restoration work to safeguard the railwayrsquos long term future.ldquoWe have watched as heritage railways across the UK and Ireland launched fundraising campaigns but, at a time when people were worried about basics such as paying their bills, buying groceries and had worries about their jobs and the health of their families, we felt that it just wasnrsquot right to ask for money for a steam railway, so we tried many other avenues of funding.ldquoOur final hope for funding from Stormont was an application for pound, to the Covid- Charities Fund to cover the day-to-day essential costs we have already accrued to date, but we learnt within days of the application being made that it had been rejected.ldquoThis was our last chance with the government schemes as we did not qualy for funding under either the pound, or pound, business support schemes, designed specically for the tourism and hospitality industry as our rateable value was pound, over the pound, threshold. We were also not eligible for the Micro Business Hardship Fund, the Sports and Clubs or voluntary and community sector hardship funds.The chairman continued: ldquoIn short, we have been rejected for support every time because we were too small, too large, or missing a financial threshold by only a few pounds.ldquoSometimes we miss out because we have a small cash reserve for those vital projects, a reserve which is also made up of legacy donations from benefactors who have passed away and wished their donations to go to landmark projects rather than pay day-to-day bills.Mr Gardiner said the heritage railwayrsquos only public funding was what he described as a ldquomodest grant from Newry, Mourne and Down Council and that a question mark hung over this yearrsquos funding.He added: ldquoWe must thank those MLAs, councillors and public representatives who have lobbied and argued our case, even mentioning us in correspondence with NI Executive ministers as an example of an organisation that appears to have fallen through the cracks.ldquoMany of us within the Downpatrick and Co Down Railway feel deep disappointment and frustration, as it feels like every door we try to open is either locked or closed on us. It also feels like, as a business, we are being penalised for good financial governance.Anyone interested in making a financial donation is asked to visit the heritage railwayrsquos website..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th July 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Hopes for restoration of Shrigley clock for its 150th anniversary  ","story":"DETAILS of fresh efforts to restore a historic clock which was once the centrepiece of village le in Shrigley have been unveiled.The iconic Martin Memorial clock, which had its bell and interior mechanism removed over three decades ago and placed in storage, celebrates its th anniversary next year.To mark the occasion, Rowallane councillor Terry Andrews is hoping that Newry, Mourne and Down Council and the Housing Executive will join forces to help put the tick back in the famous clock.He says it is sad to see the historic landmark falling into disrepair and hopes efforts to restore it will be successful to preserve it for generations to come.Designed in  by Timothy Hevey, the clock is constructed of brown stone in three layers, with the base surrounded by iron railings. Originally, there was an elaborate lamp at each corner and also a drinking fountain.While there have been ious meetings over many years to discuss the restoration of the clock, nothing ever happened, something Cllr Andrews hopes that he can help put right.He says while money is tight for many organisations which had to deal with the coronavirus pandemic, he hopes the local council and housing officials will commit to helping restore the famous clock to provide a reminder to current generations of Shrigleyrsquos industrial past.The village was founded by the Martin family, who came from Pott Shrigley in Cheshire in  and who owned the spinning factory in the village.It was powered by water from the nearby Clea Lough and while the mill has long gone mdash it is reported to have employed  people at one time mdash the clock tower erected by the people of Shrigley in  in honour of the Martin family remains.Cllr Andrews believes that residents in Shrigley, Killyleagh and further afield would like to see the clock restored to its former glory and hopes he can secure agreement in principle for this to happen.ldquoWe canrsquot allow the clock to deteriorate further, he declared. ldquoIt is an integral part of Shrigleyrsquos history and it must be preserved.ldquoIn the past it was suggested that a community garden could be developed alongside the clock and perhaps that is something worth pursuing.ldquoI think it is incumbent upon those who can help restore the clock to step forward and perhaps the restoration project is something that the Department for Communities could also lend its support to, given the clockrsquos historic link with the former mill located nearby.Cllr Andrews said that identying funds to finance any restoration work was vital in moving forward, also highlighting the need for an agreed plan to maintain the clock.ldquoThe Martin Memorial clock is at the heart of Shrigleyrsquos history and culture and it must not be lost. It must be preserved and those who can help achieve this must come forward, he continued.ldquoGiven its history, a restored clock could become an attraction for visitors and people researching the arearsquos past.ldquoI hope that I can help harness interest and willingness in number of agencies to weigh in behind a successful regeneration project in the heart of Shrigley.

It turned out it was a good deion!Our motto for the walk, lsquoBe Amazed!rsquo, was inspired by Patrickrsquos Confession in which he recounts his journey to Ireland as a fth century slave before being freed spiritually and physically by God. To be honest I was amazed all seven wanted to do the whole Downpatrick Camino in one day as, for many people, I would recommend two half days. It is not for the faint-hearted!Welcoming everyone, I pointed out the finish time was between pm and pm and the Dean of Down, the Very Rev Henry Hull, kindly turned up to bless us on our way, leading us in the pilgrim prayer, which is found in the new pilgrim passport.ldquoI arise today through Godrsquos strength to pilot me, Godrsquos might to uphold mehellipThe newly produced Pilgrim Passport was to stamped at each point along the way: Saint Patrick Centre, Inch Abbey, Saul Church, Slieve Patrick, Struell Wells, St Patrickrsquos Memorial Church, Downpatrick and St Patrickrsquos Grave.ldquoA wing and a prayer, was how one pilgrim put it.Our journey would usually begin at the Saint Patrick Centrersquos IMAX film which explores the story of Patrick but due to lockdown restrictions we skipped this part and, instead, there was a quick photo-call with the new high viz jackets, sponsored by Phoenix Gas.It was an eclectic group: the aptly-named Hillary who had climbed Tanzaniarsquos Kilimanjaro and another, a journalist, who planned to write about the Way a mother and son with strong links to Downpatrick a married couple, Jim and Marion, from Belfast, who were around retirement age and had walked the Camino de Santiago in Spain and finally their friend, Colette, a casual walker blessed with great faith, a sharp wit and, I recall, a fancy gadget that calculated distance.We set out, climbing St Patrickrsquos Staircase and were headed towards Down Museum when a pilgrim asked me about the building behind us.That panicky feeling from school days when my teacher asked an unexpected question began to rise. My credibility as a guide was at stake. Thankfully I had looked up the school out of curiosity the night before. ldquoOh yes, that school was built about  years ago by the Southwell familyhellipIt seemed to get easier after that as we walked towards the Mound of Down to hear about John de Courcy before marching through the fields towards Inch. We would have to take the Belfast Road, as my dream of having a bridge, or a boat, to cross the Quoile was still a dream.At least the grass was freshly cut and the weather was dry. The Lord was good to us.During the tour at Inch Abbey we met a local man, Roger, who kindly pointed out some little known facts and features including the early ldquospa hot-tub where the monkrsquos infirmary had once stood on the banks of the Quoile.After a break, we set off for the banks of the Quoile River and Saul Hill, the group happily chatting to one another after a lockdown of three and a half months. The Quoile is a gentle part of the walk and as the river flowed, ducklings were paddling behind their mother, like pilgrims on the Way.The Mearne Road was a bit more challenging as the way got steeper but we knew Patrick himself had made this climb on his route to founding the first church on the island. Before long we could see the round tower and had made it in good time, around :pm. A trinity was there to greet us mdash the Centre Director Dr Tim Campbell, pilgrim guide Elaine Kelly and the Dean of Down, who recounted the history of Saul Church.When we arrived at The Barn at Saul, just yards away, we were all ready for the pilgrim welcome, the pilgrim washroom and the pilgrim lunch mdash soup and sandwiches, tea and coffee with carefully observed social distancing.They were a happy bunch as I bade them farewell and offered a lt back to anyone who wanted it. But all agreed they wanted to continue with Elaine to Slieve Patrick and then on to Struell Wells via the Lecale path, what I had dubbed the Way of Tranquility until I fell flat on my face in the mud, going over a stile the week before.Hours later, back at the centre, we waited for the pilgrims to . Around pm a message came through that the mother and son had to leave for an appointment and one of the walkers had hit her wall just before the ancient ones at Struell Wells. I put the kettle on and was relieved to see Colette, the walker from Ballymurphy, coming towards the centre, half an hour later.She was exhausted but in good humour as she regaled us with her observations, including the need for a toilet at Struell Wells. ldquoPilgrimrsquos Pain, she declared, and jokedthat she had less suffering during the Troubles in Ballymurphy.Slumped in her chair with her tea at the St Patrickrsquos Centre, having completed % of the walk, she insisted that the Way was way more than  miles . She referred to a fancy gadget ndash which actually turned out to be accurate. Our five-mile estimate for the morning was closer to six miles and the afternoon closer to ten. So a sweet  miles altogether. What would the other pilgrims say when they got back Like an expectant mother and father, Dr Tim Campbell and I waited. I was looking at my watch and nervously flicking at the kettle switch until we caught the reflection of the high-vis jackets in one of the shop windows.

George and Casehill Woods near Dinas Powys, has resulted in success.National Resources Waleshad proposed constructing a dam m wide and .m high in the meadow at the Woodland Trust site in Dinas Powys.NRW proposed the dam as one option to alleviate potential flood risk.More NewsVale nurse developed coronavirus symptoms after sitting with patient, inquest toldMillions become unpaid carers due to coronavirus crisisPenarth RNLI station marks  years despite current coronavirus lockdownThe campaign by the Save Dinas Powys Woods and Protect Homes from Flooding group was launched in March  after the Woodland Trust said NRW was proposing to build a dam within its site of Cwm George and Casehill Woods.The group said the proposals would involve cutting down  square metres of trees including  square metres of ancient trees and regular flooding upstream during high rainfall would result in further destruction of ancient trees, hedgerows, wildle, and plants.Dormice and other protected species like bats were at risk, the group said.The woods, much-loved by the community, attracts visitors from other areas and is the Woodland Trustrsquos most visited site in Wales with more than , visitors.Hundreds of people took part in marches in  to oppose the dam.NRW released its draft Outline Business Case in February  and a consultation period with the local community took place.Hundreds of people attended a meeting in February to oppose the dam and they wrote to NRW, with their views, during the coronavirus lockdown.Chairman of Save Dinas Powys Woods  Protect Homes From Flooding, Peter Smith said the group welcomed the announcement that NRW will not develop a dam in the Dinas Powys Woods.ldquoLocal people recognise the flood risk in the village, but are overwhelmingly in favour of a natural flood management programmein the Cadoxton River and Eastbrook catchments, plus improved channel maintenance andrequired local hard defences, rather than an environmentally unfriendly dam, Dr Smith said.ldquoOur proposals will slow the flow of the rivers upstream thus reducing the risk of flash flooding, and by removing obstacles improve flow downstream.ldquoWe now look forward to working with NRW and The Woodland Trust to design an effective NFM scheme.ldquoBoth have expertise in this area, and, having made funds available for NFM projects, we know that the Welsh Government is keen for Wales to become an exemplar of good practice. community involvement and support will remain key features of our campaign.He added: ldquoWe are grateful to people far and wide who have supported our campaign, including the Woodland Trust, our local community councils, and county councillors.ldquoWe extend our particular thanks our local MS, Jane Hutt, for her advocacy and support.Community councillor, Chris Franks said NRW must not now ignore any problems.ldquoClearly over the years there has been reduced spending on maintenance of the stream through Dinas Powys and towards Barry, he said.ldquoThe public has said that the NRW must improve monitoring of flows on the Cadoxton River, implement natural flood management measures and improve flow at Cardf Road bridge where the stream passes under the A to reduce flood risk.Vale MS Jane Hutt said: ldquolsquoFollowing our meeting on May  Sir David Henshaw chairman of NRW wrote to me on May  to say that NRW received almost  responses to our consultation on the Outline Business Case with the vast majority being opposed to the upstream storage option on the Cadoxton Brook.NRW chairman, Sir Henshaw said: ldquoWhen we consider the marginal case for this option, it is therefore clear that we will not be pursuing an upstream storage scheme. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url

has spoken of the plight of rural communities during lockdown in Uganda.Three months ago, Jenipher Wetaka Sambazi, a Fairtrade coffee farmer from the Mt Elgon region in Uganda, was sharing her experiences of the benefit of Fairtrade in Penarthrsquos Tabernacle Baptist Church.More NewsVictory in campaign to save Dinas Powys ancient woodland as dam plan is abandonedVale nurse developed coronavirus symptoms after sitting with patient, inquest toldPenarth RNLI station marks  years despite current coronavirus lockdownNow she and her family, like communities around the world, are under lockdown.In March, campaigners, businesses, supporters, and students from around Wales heard Jenipherrsquos story, face to face.Now she is unable to travel or even meet with her neighbours.This means the coffee picked at the end of the last harvest remains on the mountain and Jenipher and her fellow farmers are prohibited from travelling to gather it for processing under the current lockdown rules.There are currently several hundred known cases of covid- in Uganda, but none in the Mount Elgon region and no fatalities in Uganda as yet.Farmers want to keep it this way, but lockdown is causing other concerns such as limiting access to food and healthcare.This is the time of year when there is the least amount of food available, and the closing of markets and freedom to travel for farmers to source food and water means that times are exceptionally hard.Jenipher as vice-chairwoman of a Fairtrade coffee cooperative, is responsible for many who rely on the cooperative for work.The expert hand-sorters who are seasonal workers and rely on this part of the coffee chain to feed their family at this time, have no coffee to sort.While they may have some spare eggs, vegetables or matoke to trade, the threat of soldiers prohibiting them from doing so is too much for them.Farmer co-operatives, an essential element of Fairtrade, enable and encourage communities to work together.Fairtrade also requires an extra amount of money, the Fairtrade premium, to be paid to producers.Fairtrade farmers like Jenipher are struggling, but they have the benefits of a strong local community as well as the backup of the Fairtrade premium.Fairtrade International have announced a .m euro Fairtrade Producer Relief fund targeting the immediate needs and Resilience Fund to help producers rebuild their businesses after Covid-.Jenipher Wettaka Sambazi said: ldquoLe is hard.ldquoThe markets are shut so there is nowhere to sell or earn money, or to buy food and basic essentials.ldquoLocal health centres have been shut to reduce the chance of spreading the virus, but since all transport is banned, those who need operations, treatment or antenatal care need to walk  km to the nearest hospital.ldquoTwo women and their unborn babies have died on the way.\"Roger Casey, who attends Tabernacle Baptist Church said: ldquoIt was wonderful to meet Jenipher and hear her story.ldquoWe get through a lot of coffee in our office and meeting a real coffee farmer from Uganda makes you think about the real people and real lives behind that Fairtrade logo.Vale MS Jane Hutt said: ldquoMeeting Jenipher during her visit to Wales earlier this year was inspiring.ldquoThe increasing dficulties facing rural farming communities because of the pandemic has shown how important Fairtrade cooperatives continue to be and I am glad that leaders like Jenipher continue to promote the benefits of Fairtrade and to support communities.National co-ordinator of Fair Trade Wales, Aileen Burmeister added: ldquoFair Trade producers are being impacted by covid- restrictions.ldquoGlobal stock markets are falling, meaning that farmers and workers are receiving far less for their produce.\"It is in these times that we can really see how important the Fairtrade minimum price is. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey

It centres on long-standing racism and disadvantage, and the lack of BAME representation within decision-making processes,\" said Professor Ogbonna, who is also a trustee and vice-chair of Race Council Wales.ldquoThe coronavirus pandemic is, in some respects, revealing the consequences of a lack of action on race equality.ldquoMany of the issues wersquove highlighted have been identied and discussed previously, but they havenrsquot been addressed in any systematic and sustained way.Analysis of Covid- related deaths across England and Wales by ethnicity showed that people from a black ethnic background are at a greater risk of death involving COVID- than all other ethnic groups.The Office for National Statistics study showe that the risk for black males has been more than three times higher than white males, and nearly two-and-a-half times higher for black females than white.Adjusting for socio-economic factors and geographical location partly explains the increased risk, but there remains twice the risk for black males and around one-and-a-half times for black females.

have seen a massive increase in areas such as recycling and waste.The other area of increased spending is in social services, which normally spends around  per cent of our budget.\"That is going to go up dramatically because people are getting frailer and succumbing to covid- and we are also supporting people in care homes and providing PPE for our staff and the care homes.Overall the virus is

while the council takes steps to mitigate further issues.A meeting with residents and the local community council was held on Tuesday, June  to explain the steps the council would be taking, in the

But officials could not immediately provide the proportion of tests completed within Mr Johnsonrsquos target.Baroness Harding, the executive chair of the NHS test and trace programme to stem the spread of Covid-, said they remained ldquocommitted to continually improving the programme.Mr Johnson made the commitment in response to Mr Hunt, who chairs the Commons Health and Social Care Committee, during Prime Ministerrsquos Questions amid concerns that not enough people were being tested for Covid-.The PM said: ldquoI can undertake to himnow to get all tests turned around within  hours by the end of June except for dficulties with postal tests or insuperable problems like that.The missed target comes as Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer called on the Government to ldquoopen the books on its testing figures so the public can have confidence in the system. vw,vw,px, px\"Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has called for greater transparency with the UKrsquos testing figures Sir Keir was commenting after Sky News reported that the number of people who have been tested for coronavirus in the UK might never be known due to inadequacies in data recording while officials looked to ramp-up testing numbers.The news outlet quoted one senior official as saying that in its early months, both the testing system and the data produced by it were simply ldquonot fit for purpose as efforts were put into meeting Health Secretary Matt Hancockrsquos target of testing , people per day.Only last month Sir David Norgrove, chair of the UK Statistics Authority, wrote to Mr Hancock to warn that ldquothe figuresare still far from complete and comprehensible.Sir Keir, speaking during a visit to Harlow, said: ldquoIrsquove seen this report from Sky on testing and itrsquos very concerning. I think there was an internal audit.ldquoWhat I have said to the Government is: open the books.ldquoWe know that there has been double counting, we know that some of the tests that have been sent out have never made it back and we havenrsquot had the number of people tested every day published for over a month.ldquoThis has got to be cleared up.

The co-consecrators along with myself will be the Bishop of Meath and Kildare and the Bishop of Derry and Raphoe. The preacher will be the Rt Revd Kenneth Clarke, formerly Bishop of Kilmore, Elphin and Ardagh.“Because it is likely that churches will still be operating under strict rules of social distancing in September, attendance will be limited to the family, close friends and colleagues of the bishop-elect, with an opportunity for a more expansive liturgical event at a future date in Belfast Cathedral. However, the service in Armagh will be streamed and recorded.“I would ask you to keep the bishop-elect and his family in your prayers as he prepares for his episcopal ordination.”Speaking in February, Mr Davison said: “The members of the Electoral College for the Diocese of Connor have done me a great honour in electing me to serve as the next bishop of the diocese. \u2028I am very conscious of the great responsibility that is being entrusted to me.”The bishop-elect succeeds the Rt Revd Alan Abernethy who retired at the end of December. Mr Davison was ordained in  and began his ministry in the Diocese of Armagh as Curate of St Mark’s, Portadown . He has served as Rector of Carrickfergus since  and Archdeacon of Belfast since .Meanwhile, the Archbishop of Armagh also announced the Episcopal Electoral College for the Diocese of Clogher will have its first meeting on Wednesday, September , in St Macartin’s Cathedral, Enniskillen, commencing with a service of Holy Communion at .am.--A message from the EditorThank you for reading this story on our website.

From this date, passengers travelling on most bus, train and ferry services in Northern Ireland will be required to wear a face covering. Face coverings will also be required in public transport stations. There will be exemptions for those who are not able to wear a face covering for health and medical reasons, and for children under the age of . Outdoor areas of a ferry where social distancing can be maintained will be exempt from the requirements, along with school transport.  The Executive has agreed that the cross-departmental group that has been established to consider face coverings will engage with the tour coach and taxi industry to explore extending the requirement to these transport modes. Making the announcement, Minister Nichola Mallon said: “As we move through the Executive’s recovery plan, more and more of the economy and society is opening up. Wemust remember however that Covid- is still with us. We need to remain vigilant and continue to play our part in controlling the virus to protect ourselves and others. “As restrictions on our movement are eased, the safety of passengers and staff remains my priority.The evidence suggests that you can reduce the risk of spreading the virus by wearing a face covering. That is why, with the support of my Executive colleagues and the unions, I am announcing that face coverings will be mandatory on public transport, from Friday July th. “The requirement will apply to passengers and also staff in public areas who are not protected by a screen. However, there will be exemptions for those who are not able to wear a face covering for specic health and medical reasons.” A face covering is a covering of any type which covers a person’s nose and mouth it does not have to be a surgical face mask. While face coverings can offer protection to others, they are not a substitute for other protective measures and it is important that people continue to follow social distancing and wash or sanitise hands regularly. Minister Mallon continued: “We are asking you to take personal responsibility and do the right thing to protect the health and well-being of others. The fact of the matter is you can spread the virus to other more vulnerable people without even knowing you have it. By wearing a face covering you are showing your support and consideration for other passengers and staff. “It is important to be aware that wearing face coverings will not be suitable for all members of the public and we need to be sensitive to this and know that reasons for not wearing a face covering may not always be visible. “Advice will be available on nidirect and social media channels. Translink staffwill begin preparing commuters for the requirement to wear face coverings. “It is also important that you do not get a  sense of security about the level of protection a face covering offers. They are not a substitute for social distancing or good hand hygiene. While I know many will find it challenging in the coming days and weeks to keep up compliance with the rules, I want to applaud the public for their leadership. The public have done the heavy lting and kept us all safe. You have been the leaders in Northern Ireland fighting Covid- and I am asking you to keep it up and we will beat this together. “By acting together and thinking of each other we can reduce the risk of transmission.”  addthis, Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_cfecfd   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_fbdaefdbabd   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]  []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"},{"url":"http://www.tyronecon.co.uk/resizer/258/172/true/GN4_DAT_3132859.jpg--.jpg?1589969356000\\","title":"castlederg security alert ends ","story":"A security alert at Millbrook Gardens in Castlederg has ended, and a suspicious object which was examined at the scene, declared a hoax.
