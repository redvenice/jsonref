He also has twin sisters in London. Attorneys for the rapper said on Monday that he had been arrested based on incorrect information about his criminal record and should be released while awaiting court proceedings.On Tuesday, campaigners from Black Lives Matter said his arrest is part of an epidemic of \u0027racist\u0027 arrests by ICE and their Free 21 Savage petition has been signed by 115,000 in 24 hours. His fans are in shock because they believed he was born and raised in Atlanta - due to his thick accent and the fact that he has never denied claims he was a native of the city.An ICE spokesman said: \u0027His whole public persona is false.

When your life has been blighted by this scandal and you are still living this nightmare daily, and you hear what she is saying, it is just not acceptable.          Joanne Darbyshire (pictured) claims she was mis-sold her home in Bolton because of hidden ground rentsThey have since been given a quote of between £23,000 and £33,000 to buy their home in Lostock, Bolton, outright.They have been offered an RPI-linked ground rent contract by Taylor Wimpey but say this would still mean paying £10,000 to buy the freehold.Mrs Darbyshire, right, says: \u0027There\u0027s no end in sight. People say to me you should have read the small print but none of these things were in there.\u0027Andrea Harris bought a three-bedroom terraced house from Taylor Wimpey – but says she wasn\u0027t told about ground rent.The 39-year-old purchased the property for £160,000 with her former partner in 2008.          Andrea Harris (pictured) also claimed she was not told about the ground rent However, she was then hit with an annual ground rent bill of £200, which doubled to £400 last year. In another ten years it could double again to £800. Miss Harris, who lives in Radcliffe, Greater Manchester, now says she cannot sell the house and cannot afford to pay down the mortgage or buy the freehold.She says she is stuck making mortgage interest payments on a home she fears she\u0027ll never be able to pass on to her daughter Gabriella, eight, pictured left with her mother.Miss Harris said: \u0027I wanted this to be a family home that I could pass on ... but now I will never be able to do that.\u0027The Government isn\u0027t doing anything to help people like me – we\u0027re still stuck with crippling ground rents every year.\u0027                                                    Home Secretary Sajid Javid vowed when he held the housing portfolio to outlaw the use of leaseholds on newly-built homes in December 2017, branding the practice \u0027feudal\u0027.But more than a year later, campaigners say those trapped in toxic contracts are no closer to escaping them.Despite many leaseholders claiming they were not made aware of the full terms of their contracts, and suggestions it was similar to the PPI scandal, Mrs Wheeler said she did not agree it was an example of mis-selling.The 59-year-old, who owns her constituency home in Burton-on-Trent outright according to the Land Registry, previously sparked controversy when she tweeted that the \u0027British Empire\u0027 came first with 396 medals in the Rio Olympics, referring to Britain and countries that were formerly its colonies.Mrs Wheeler told MPs the comparison to PPI was difficult \u0027because in effect with PPI you were sold something you really didn\u0027t need, whereas this is completely different\u0027. She added: \u0027There is a contract, there was legal advice but perhaps people are caught up in the moment because it is their first purchase and it is incredibly exciting.\u0027\u0027We\u0027ve been fleeced for years and it\u0027s come to an end\u0027:...Wimbledon tennis chiefs are on the brink of buying...Fleeced on their leases: The families being hit with soaring...Flat owner who had new kitchen and bathroom fitted has...Share this article"},{"url":null,"title":"YouTubers buy ticket Australia create Earth sandwich","story":"      Jay Swingler (pictured) was filmed placing another slice of bread in front of iconic Australian landmark the Sydney Opera House          British YouTubers Jay Swingler and Romell Henry placed a slice of bread in a London garden, documenting their efforts \u0027Only the dead should be buried\u0027: Daredevils slammed for...\u0027I don\u0027t care… It\u0027s not like I\u0027m a drink driver\u0027: YouTube...Share this articleIn the video, the pair film themselves making the loaf from scratch after buying a new bread machine.It also shows them booking expensive first-class return flights, which cost more than £14,000 ($25,000) in order to carry out the stunt.

forerunner of a US-led invasion and says he will therefore not let the shipment enter from Colombia          A wider view of the Tienditas Bridge on the border between the Colombian city of Cucuta and Tachira, Venezuela show where the blockage has been set upThis comes as Venezuelan army continues its blockage of a bridge on the border with Colombia ahead of an anticipated humanitarian aid dispatch. Maduro claims humanitarian aid is a forerunner of a US-led invasion, and defended his decision to order a barricade of the bridge by saying that \u0027no one will enter, not one invading soldier.\u0027 Opposition leader Juan Guaido, now recognised as interim president by the West and the US, claims that up to 300,000 people face death if the aid being blocked by Maduro\u0027s army is not delivered. The opposition-dominated National Assembly, led by presidential challenger Guaido, had warned the armed forces that blocking aid would mean crossing a \u0027red line\u0027.\u0027You

lawmaker from the border state of Tachira, told AFP that troops from the armed forces were blocking the crossing.The aid delivery was being coordinated by Guaido, who has declared himself interim president of the oil-rich country and now enjoys the backing of some 40 countries as Venezuela\u0027s legitimate leader.Maduro, 56, has repeatedly accused the United States of fomenting a coup. His blockage of food, medicine and necessities to hundreds of thousands of starving Venezuelans came as weapons were discovered in cargo which the government claims was sent from Florida. The weapons, including  19 rifles and high-calibre ammunition, were found at an airport in the city of Valencia, having been transported on an Airbus jet that flew in on Sunday, the Interior Ministry wrote on Twitter.It is not known who the intended recipient of the weapons was. The US, which has not ruled out a military intervention in crisis-wracked Venezuela, was the first to recognize him as acting president, followed by a dozen Latin American countries.In his State of the Union address Tuesday night, President Donald Trump reaffirmed US support for Guaido, saying \u0027we stand with the

That\u0027s how diplomacy works,\u0027 the pope said on the plane bringing him back from the United Arab Emirates. Eurasia Group analysts say the humanitarian crisis \u0027represents a lose-lose gambit for Maduro\u0027 who will either have to allow the goods to enter the country, further bolstering Guaido, or force the military to block their entry, risking a backlash in the streets.Maduro, though, remains steadfast.          Supporters wave the Venezuelan flag as  Maduro speaks during a meeting with representatives of the transport sector in Caracas\u0027Venezuela doesn\u0027t have to beg to anyone,\u0027 he said. \u0027If they want to help, then end the blockade and the sanctions.\u0027Under Maduro\u0027s stewardship, oil-dependent Venezuela has plunged into an economic crisis, suffering from hyperinflation and shortages of food and medicine.Eurasia said US oil sanctions are \u0027set to have a broad impact\u0027 with the government facing \u0027the prospect of running out of gasoline, which could serve as another social catalyst.\u0027 Guaido branded Maduro illegitimate over his reelection in May, which the opposition boycotted after several of its leaders were either jailed, barred or forced into exile.The US and EU dismissed the elections as a fraud.Maduro has flatly rejected demands for new elections, telling Spanish television he would not \u0027cave in to pressure.\u0027He has supported plans for a meeting of Latin American and EU states in a \u0027Contact Group\u0027 in Montevideo on Thursday, though.The United Nations said 40 people were killed in clashes with security forces in a week of protests last month, coinciding with Guaido\u0027s self-proclamation as acting leader.

It is just born and the leopard is just licking at it\u0027.           All over: As soon as the baby impala realises the danger, it starts to run and the leopard gives chase          No chance: The baby leopard effectively sealed its own fate when it tried to outrun the predator in the Sabi Sands Game Reserve in north-east South Africa          Easy win: Video footage captured during a safari trip shows the leopard kicking the baby\u0027s legs out from under itHowever after a very long minute checking each other out the baby impala makes the fatal mistake of trying to run away which activates the leopards hunting instincts.The leopard immediately follows the baby impala and trips it up three times with its paw before the doomed antelope makes a brave but hopeless bolt for the bush.The leopard which can hit speeds of nearly 40mph is far too quick for the newly born and quickly pulls it down and grabs its neck in its jaws. The leopard then walks past their safari truck with the baby impala no more than an hour old hanging by its neck from his jaw to find a quiet place to feed.Mr Muller added: \u0027We were on an elephant drive when we stumbled on a female impala which had given birth in what I estimate to be the last hour and it was still wet.          Done dinner: The leopard captures the baby impala and carried it off by the neck\u0027Female impalas generally leave the herd for the birth and the mother and new born were alone and we watched for five minutes as the new born clumsily begin to stand.\u0027Then all of a sudden there was a commotion and Dewane, an old dominant male leopard, who must have been stalking the mum and baby emerged towards them both.\u0027The mother instinctively ran leaving Dewane alone with the baby and I began filming.\u0027I think the way Dewane behaved towards the baby at first in not killing it was caused by the confusion of the impala not running away and it supressed the trigger instinct.\u0027The leopard simply became curious about the new born impala and nuzzled up to it. They were licking each other. It is extremely rare but you know it will not end well.\u0027When the impala ran you know that it is going to die and you have mixed emotions witnessing it but it is an inevitable part of nature even if it is pretty emotional.\u0027The leopard killed the impala quickly and the circle of life continues\u0027 he said. Unbelievable!

He grossly exceeded them when he filled the plane with four large men and also filled his fuel tanks \u0027to the brim.\u0027The effect of this, Mr Blackshaw said and in combination with taking off from a short, wet grass runway was for the plane to have insufficient speed and performance to be able to climb safely away from the aerodrome and it fell out of the sky.          Robert Murgatroyd tried to claim he was \u0027hero\u0027 and should be featured in a Hollywood movie, a court heard          The plane took off from City Airport in Manchester (pictured) before having to make a U turn on the M62\u0027It was sheer luck that the plane did not catch fire on impact\u0027, he added.\u0027Had it done so there is a likelihood that the passengers would not have lived to tell the tale. Likewise, had it crashed onto that busy motorway there would have been a significant risk of death or serious injury to the road users on it.\u0027And why was he prepared to take such risk with all of those peoples\u0027 lives? Greed. The prospect of making £1000 from a day\u0027s work, which was only payable if he could get these men to Barra and back.\u0027\u0027He painted a picture of himself as the hero of the moment for executing a \u0027forced landing under power\u0027 in difficult circumstances and he disputed that he had crashed, stating that his definition of \u0027crash\u0027 only extended to hitting \u0027an object.\u0027Mr Blackshaw said that the defendant resented that he had been arrested when in fact he should have been given a commendation.\u0027Indeed, joking no doubt, he said Warner Brothers had been in touch with a view to remaking \u0027Miracle on the Hudson\u0027 as \u0027Miracle on the Ship Canal\u0027.\u0027He accepted that he had not weighed the passengers or asked them for their weights. But he worked on the principle that if they fitted through the door then they could fly with you.\u0027The accident occurred after Murgatroyd who obtained his pilot\u0027s licence in 1986 and who had 15,000 hours of flying experience was asked to fly the bird watchers to Scotland so they could join 110 other Twitchers to see the American Red Start which had been spotted on Barra - the first time it had seen in the UK since 1985.He quoted £500 per passenger for the Piper PA-28 aircraft which can carry a maximum weight of 55 stone including fuel but the court heard the three bird watchers Alan Whitehead, Adam Archer and Ray Harrington had a combined weight of 45 stone and arrived with luggage including cameras and binoculars which they had to keep on their knees.Murgatroyd who himself weighed 14 stone then filled the plane with 100 litres of highly flammable petrol-type fuel which was above the recommended level of a half-full tank for four passengers.He initially attempted a \u0027practice take-off\u0027 along the 641m grass runway which had puddles along it but despite the plane showing no signs of lifting off the ground during the acceleration test, he taxi-ed the aircraft into rough grass at the start of the runway and then went for actual take-off.Firefighters at the airport were so concerned they put on their protective clothing in anticipation of an emergency.One of the passengers Alan Whitehead who was sat in the front passenger seat said: \u0027The pilot pulled the throttle and off we went. He didn\u0027t say what to do in an emergency or in a crash, no life jackets or procedures were given. Visibility was very poor, it was raining heavily and it was a small tiny windscreen.\u0027We were in the air and all of a sudden the plan banked to the left, it tilted, I looked below and I could see the motorway. I few more seconds went in and then I heard the comment: \u0027not enough power\u0027. It wasn\u0027t very reassuring.\u0027Then I heard it hit something which sounded like the top of a tree then we crashed in the field. I banged my head. At first I didn\u0027t know where the blood was coming from and I was panicking. I was covered in blood and I could then smell petrol. It was all a bit of a blur.\u0027Adam Archer who was in the back said: \u0027When the plane was in the air, it wasn\u0027t too long before it sounded like when a car goes up a hill on a low gear and it\u0027s making a lot of noise, there seemed to be a loss of power on the aircraft - but there was no discussion or talking about it.\u0027We just seemed to lose power and I remember seeing pylons in the distance and I thought if we didn\u0027t get anymore power we\u0027re not going to make this. The plane banked sharply and we hit the top of the trees going over the motorway then we landed with a sudden jolt. There was a really strong smell of fuel and a lot of blood from Alan\u0027s injuries.\u0027As we hit the deck Alan and the pilot hit their heads on the dashboard of the plane. Alan was in quite a bad way and he was shouting: \u0027you have killed us! What have you done to us?!\u0027 When I smelt the fuel, I thought there was a chance it could burst into flames.\u0027Murgatroyd claimed he had allowed the bird watchers on his aircraft under a \u0027cost sharing\u0027 scheme despite rules saying the pilot cannot own the plane and said the overloading of the aircraft was an \u0027oversight.\u0027He denies endangering the safety of a person and an aircraft, flying without the relevant licence, failing to comply with insurance regulations plus three other charges under the Air Navigation Order 2016.The trial continues. "},{"url":null,"title":"Work begins remove enormous fatberg bigger six double decker buses","story":"    South West Water director of waste, Andrew Roantree, with the first piece of the Sidmouth fatberg todayWork has begun today to remove a huge fatberg longer than six double-decker buses from under a British town.The 64-yard mound of hardened fat, oil and wet-wipes in Sidmouth, Devon, is thought to be one of the largest ever found in the UK.The revolting task of removing the colossal blockage is now underway - but it could take up to eight weeks to clear.Specially trained staff with gas masks will descend down the sewer to tackle the disgusting mess.Then, using high-pressure jets, they will break up the congealed mass and other waste until it can be sucked up to the surface.The fatberg was discovered in a sewer near a children\u0027s play area last month.On Monday, final preparations were made to pump out the water to clear the path for waste workers to go in and start tackling the berg today.The sewer workers have to approach the berg in full breathing apparatus to protect them from the potentially poisonous gases.Using special sewer jetting equipment and hard manual labour, they will hack away at the mass.          The 64-yard mound of hardened fat, oil and wet-wipes in Sidmouth is thought to be one of the largest ever found in the UK.

But there are a few signs of the promise Koons showed before he embraced BanalityMuch taller and more bulbous than I am, Jeff Koons’s Balloon Venus reflects the viewer on every bulge and curve of its magenta-coloured, mirror-polished stainless-steel body. The reflections are meant to make us feel somehow included, though all those twists and eruptions remind me of strangulated hernias or a monstrous yet cutesy haemorrhoid.Making a balloon sculpture from the late paleolithic stone statuette known as the Venus of Willendorf – an object that could sit comfortably in your hand – then using a CT scanner to fabricate this vastly enlarged version strikes me as excessive. The original tender stone-age figure, rediscovered in Lower Austria in 1908, sits in a museum in Vienna, while Koons’s Balloon Venus is exhibited in the middle room of his show at the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford.Balloon Venus stands among larger-than-life polychromed stainless-steel ballerinas – all based on east European porcelain figurines – whose makers might, just might, have once glimpsed a reproduction of a Degas dancer. Their execution is a marvel. I would call them breathtaking but for the queasiness of their belated rococo frivolity. The eye slithers over their shiny surfaces. I can imagine Hermann Göring loving them.Various classical floozies look out from a number of paintings. Their photographically derived forms are overdrawn with blownup graffiti riffing on Courbet’s 1866 L’Origine du monde – which is to say, scribbled vulvas. One large image depicts actor Gretchen Mol riding an inflatable dolphin, while ogling a blowup monkey toy. Koons says he realised at some point that the monkey was Eros, and that Mol, in her acting role as 1950s pinup model Bettie Page, was the goddess Aphrodite. Ah! Antiquity!Dizzy with the air-headedness of it all, I can’t even get into Koons’s sexual politics in this room of female fancies – never mind the skills and the quality of craftsmanship involved in every stage of their misconceived execution.I like the basketball in the aquarium best. It greets you as you walk in. Hovering in midwater, this is the earliest work in the show. Koons’s One Ball Total Equilibrium Tank from 1985 is a reminder of the promise he once had, before he embraced Banality. Then came the inflated silver bunny, the carved kids and the happy pig, the blue gazing ball in a pristine birdbath. The first room in the exhibition takes us from 1985 to 2013 in four easy steps, providing a precis of his ascension into decline.But maybe his art was always iffy, as we critics have it. According to the catalogue entry to the basketball piece, Koons had the help of “Nobel prize-winning quantum physicist Richard P Feynman” in devising a method for keeping the ball hovering at the right depth (the trick involves distilled water and salt). Whether he needed the brainpower of Feynman to get the job done is questionable, but anything that adds extra oomph and glamour, or a flashy backstory, is fine by Koons. As the late singer-songwriter Reg Presley recommended in the notorious Troggs Tapes, a sprinkling of bastard angel dust over the fucker always helps.In the last room, Koons’s version of Titian’s painting Diana and Actaeon is a remarkably accurate transcription of the 16th-century original, right down to the pattern of cracks in the surface, although I haven’t counted the number of arrows in Actaeon’s quiver, or the leaves on the trees. It is but a few centimetres smaller than the original. What really gives the game away, apart from the lack of Titian’s impasto brushwork, is the large blue blown-glass ball resting on a little shelf affixed to the lower part of the canvas.A further transcription, of Géricault’s Raft of the Medusa (1818-19), is a great deal smaller that the French artist’s original, and appears to have been copied from a digital image that shows the original painting prior to its most recent cleaning. No matter. All this is interesting, but only insofar as Koons, or rather his army of assistants, should have devoted so much time, skill, technology and, most of all, money to the devoted reproduction of these and other paintings and sculptures. “Every brushstroke is applied by hand,” the wall text tells us, and “each glass ball is hand blown, and for each one that is sufficiently flawless to be used in an artwork, around 350 end up being rejected.”The works in the last room of the exhibition, with their references to Titian and Rubens, to French Romanticism and classical sculpture – the Belvedere Torso, Praxiteles’s Silenus with baby Dionysus, appended with these perfect blue balls, fulfil an art historian’s fantasy of the continuity of tradition – and a secret desire for the end of art.One cannot compare the stupendous lengths Géricault went to in creating the Raft of the Medusa (storing body parts, including severed human heads, in the studio as models for his emaciated figures) with Koons’s mostly fiscal labours, in keeping his show on the road. Koons’s art is too expensive to fail, I have heard it said. It will survive as a paradigm of folly and excessiveness, less to be looked at, more to be gawped at."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8fd7009f39bc16c0b0e12f99a4b46c60c8e2be75/0_2607_7620_4573/master/7620.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=00537fb47d6b8e13345c30d3cdb9d43b","title":"michael spencer jones oasis definitely maybe album cover","story":"‘Halfway through the shoot, a Lambretta scooter arrived for Liam and he took off up the street with me shouting after him: “Come back!”’One of the first jobs I did was the cover for All in the Mind by the Verve. That one photo got me a lot of work – and on to Noel Gallagher’s radar. You already knew the Gallaghers were going to be stars. Some bands act really relaxed, but when you pick the camera up you’ve got four blocks of wood. Oasis weren’t like that. Their confidence was incredible.I went to have a recce and thought: “What are they going to be doing at the table? Playing cards? Having a seance?” There was no way I could see it working. Then I thought: “Well, if we have to do it in Bonehead’s house, let’s shoot in the lounge towards the bay window.”It’s a tiny room. I had to whack in a wide-angle lens just to get everyone in. But Bonehead had stripped floorboards – and with that lens, it looked like an advert for Ronseal varnish. It was a real problem. I’d not long ago been to the Egyptology section of the Manchester Museum and it came to me to have Liam lying on the floor in a kind of transcendental state with his eyes closed, like he’s not of this world. Is he alive, is he dead? I thought it’d be pretty surreal and also solve the problem of filling that space. I was nervous about mentioning it to Liam. Asking the lead singer to lie on the floor: a lot of bands wouldn’t have gone for that. But Liam was up for it straight away.The shoot was littered with Red Stripe cans, but there was no way I was having them in the shot, because it would just look like product placement. They wanted some reference to alcohol in there, though, so I said: “Let’s get some wine.” It’s actually Ribena in the glass, though. The urban myth is that it’s because they couldn’t afford wine, but that’s complete rubbish. When I was at art college, I learned that when you photograph “red wine”, you always use diluted Ribena, because wine just comes out black.Noel brought that Burt Bacharach photo, on the left, which is actually the inside of a gatefold sleeve. On the TV, Noel’s favourite film – The Good, the Bad and the Ugly – is playing. One of the roadies brought in this inflatable globe, and I got a thread and hung it from the ceiling. Noel liked that. “Yeah, global dominance,” he said. Since I was going to use a long exposure, I thought: “I know, I’ll spin it and it’ll blur.”Liam had ordered a Lambretta scooter. Halfway through the shoot, there was a knock on the door and the scooter arrived. Suddenly everyone went out into the street and Liam was off on the scooter with me shouting: “Come back!”I knew it was a big gig. I’d heard the album and knew it was going to be massive. So I was totally focused – you have to treat some album shoots like the singles final at Wimbledon. Once I’d got everyone positioned and the globe was spinning, I looked through the camera and I was buzzing. I knew I’d got it.I get so many emails from Oasis fans. I went back to the house recently and spoke to the people living there now. Apparently this guy from South America had just turned up at their door wanting a look at the living room.

Driving down a road one night, a young woman throws herself in front of his car in an apparent act of suicide. When he goes to the body, however, he realises she is still alive. Fearful of the consequences, he takes the girl back to his hotel. She awakes with severe amnesia, remembering nothing of her previous life. Daniel then becomes obsessed with her, instilling himself as her boyfriend and the central character in her new life. But, as he delves deeper into her forgotten past, he discovers the real, shocking reason she threw herself in front of his car.Grisly, grim and weaving from noir into horror, this is a very effective and highly creepy novel.Isabelle Leinster has been reading and “loving” Once Upon A River by Diane Setterfield:I have no connection to the River Thames but her description of the many stages of the river and the folk who live along its banks is captivating.

Of all of her books, this one felt most like a collection of folk tales, run through with mysticism, and strange natural phenomena- for all its modernity it felt like discovering an ancient text.Yosserian has just finished Patrimony: A True Story, by Philip Roth:A memoir about his father, Herman Roth, and his death from a brain tumour. Roth has a straightforward way of telling the story of father and son, eschewing prose fireworks, as so far has all of his books I’ve read. It is poignant, and at times wryly funny. A commenter on Goodreads said that Roth showed how to be a good son. That despite Roth junior, or perhaps because of, being so keen to leave home and Roth senior, and establish his independence, he is able to loop back, and be there for his father later in life.Finally, a (beautifully written) confession by nosuchzone:I quite like being the last possible reader of a paperback - I bought the orange-banded Penguins that Margery Allingham wrote during wartime (it was a sudden interest) and, like the blitz-zones of London, Coventry, etc, they cracked at the spines, shedding pages, or clumps of them, as the reading progressed. The desiccated glue, that powders your fingers as you brush it’s scales aside, has a faintly seaweedy smell, I noticed. They’re still on a shelf, albeit lain flat (they wouldn’t hold together stood upright - ah, it comes to us all).Me, I buy second-hand cloth-bound hardcovers if I can and almost always throw the dust jackets away at once. What I like to read most is an old hardback that’s long lost it’s jacket, and has, at some point in its long life, been left skew-whiff on a pile near a window for a summer or two - so that the sun-bleaching of the cloth on the front cover is a rhomboid ghost-margin to its darker interior. Preferably in Trafalgar Blue, as it was called. It adds a spiritual dimension. Well, I find it does.You throw the dust jackets away?! Makes me wonder what else people do to their poor books.If you’re on Instagram, now you can share your reads with us: simply tag your posts with the hashtag #Books, and we’ll include a selection in this blog.

He’s also a Breton. So when he decided to leave his top ision team to join a small team based in Brittany for the 2018 season, most of his countrymen offered understanding Gallic nods. After all, cycling is in the blood of residents of this north-west region in France. Neighbouring Normandy isn’t far behind in its love of all things two-wheeled. And it’s little wonder – there are few areas better suited to exploration from the saddle.With hundreds of kilometres of voies vertes – greenways accessible only to those on two wheels, two feet, or a horse – there are plenty of options for families as well as Lycra-clad fanatics.Each of these routes is easily accessible from Cherbourg, Le Havre or Caen. So grab your bike, hop on the ferry, and get ready for some truly memorable cycling adventures.Cherbourg to Querqueville and back (nine miles14.5km)Best for: families looking for a safe and easy route to peddle.Highlights: stunning views out to sea.Start near La Cité de la Mer – Cherbourg’s maritime museum and well worth a visit – and take the cycle path alongside Boulevard de La Saline towards Querqueville. Enjoy the beach, and then head back the way you came.Ouistreham to Caen (10 miles16km)Best for: those who want to get on their bikes as soon as they get off the ferry.Highlights: the Musée Mémorial Pegasus commemorating the British soldiers of the 6th Airborne Division. Their capture of a bridge over the canal was a crucial strategic victory during the Normandy landings.This path is entirely along a signposted greenway, from Caen’s ferry port into the city itself, and will only take an hour or two to cover. It forms the opening portion of La Vélo Francette cycle route, which runs to La Rochelle.Caen to Bayeux via Juno beach and Arromanches (28.5 miles46km)Best for: the more confident cyclist, as much of the route is along shared roads.Highlights: arromanches 360° circular cinema, which tells the story of the Battle of Normandy.From Caen, take the cycle path north to Langrune-sur-Mer. Then head west along the coast towards Courseulles-sur-Mer, home to Juno beach on which Canadian forces landed during D-Day – a museum there commemorates their heroism. Then it’s the D112B south towards Crépon, then north towards Arromanches. From there, take the D87 to Bayeux – home to the famed 70 metre-long Bayeux Tapestry, and only seven miles away.Cherbourg to Carentan (34 miles55km)Best for: cyclists who are growing in confidence.Highlights: the wildlife-filled marshlands of the Parc naturel regional des Marais du Cotentin et du Bessin.This is an established and well-signposted route, with no shortage of history along the way. It takes in the medieval cobbled town of La Haye-du-Puits and the châteaux ruins of Brix and Bricquebec.Ouistreham to Domfront (62 miles100km)Best for: confident cyclists, thanks to some steep sections.Highlights: the gorges of the Orne Valle, which offer multiple photo opportunities.This is the first full section of La Vélo Francette and offers its share of undulating terrain. From Caen it’s on to Thury-Harcourt, then the riverside village of Pont-d’Ouilly, Flers – home to a very pretty château – and finally on to historic Domfront, with its 11th-century castle.La Véloroute du Littoral de la Côte d’Albâtre: Le Havre to Le Tréport (about 100miles160km)Highlights: the stunning coastal views.This route follows the Alabaster Coast, with glorious views rewarding those confident enough to take on its undulations. It passes through Étretat – which provided inspiration for impressionist painters including Claude Monet – as well as Fécamp, home to a Benedictine abbey and a useful option for an overnight stay.Tour de Manche: Cherbourg to Roscoff (440miles708km)Best for: experienced riders who want a multi-stage adventure.Highlights: Mont St-Michel, Parc naturel regional des Marais du Cotentin et du Bessin and the waterfalls in Mortain are all glorious.You may not quite be ready for the Tour de France, but how about the Tour de Manche, a cycling adventure that links France and England? This 754mile1200km circular route includes parts of Dorset and Devon, or try the French section running from Cherbourg to Roscoff. It is split into stages – Cherbourg to Carentan is the first portion, and uses quiet roads and greenways."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9ac75f457503a87ad7074e8eaa2c2e0d74cb972c/0_0_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b9005c36c281f0bd3f1514afc1e902cd","title":"the best food and where to find it in normandy and brittany","story":"Famed for their cider, cheese, seafood and charcuterie, Normandy and Brittany are two of France’s premier food regions. Foodies read on …MarketsAcross France, Normandy is esteemed for its abundance of quality produce and rich gastronomic history. Dozens of traditional markets showcase the best of these, with further specialist markets dedicated to fish, organic produce and local crafts. Whatever the day of the week, wherever you happen to be, you’ll never be far from one.Perhaps the most picturesque of these is to be found in the medieval “halles” in Dives-sur-Mer on a Monday. You can wander around the 14th-century half-timbered building, which is packed to bursting with stalls, and chat to dozens of local producers. Sundays in Trouville-sur-Mer are equally popular with locals and visitors looking for top-notch fresh bread, cheeses, meat and charcuterie – local farmers lay out their vegetables and homemade preserves, vinegar and pickles, too.In the surrounds of glamorous Deauville, regular gourmet food markets take place at Place du Marché (Tuesday, Friday, Saturday) and the abundant high-end restaurants and Parisian-style cafes are ripe for celeb-spotting during Deauville’s American film festival in September. If poisson is your passion, Trouville, the adjacent 17th-century port town, boasts a daily market on the quay with numerous terrace cafes and grills for feasting on seafood.Rouen and the Seine valley are renowned for the quality of their markets. For cheeses, fish and seafood, and local specialities such as pressed duck, check out Clos Saint-Marc (Saturday), Vieux-Marché (Sun-Fri and brocante or flea market on Saturday) and les Emmurées (Tuesday, Saturday) and the 250-stall Sotteville-les-Rouen (Thursday, Sunday).Regional specialities and where to sample themDairy herds were introduced to Normandy by the Vikings and the region has long produced world-class cheeses for the Paris market. You can buy camembert, Livarot, Pont-l’Evêque and Neufchâtel in shops and supermarkets, but to try small-batch artisan cheeses, head for the markets and specialist fromageries – notably in the Pays d’Auge and smaller Le Pays de Bray regions. At Isigny sur Mer, west of Caen, you can also enjoy a tour and tasting at Sainte Mére cheese factory.As you’d expect, the coastal towns and villages are awash with fabulous fish and seafood. Inland, look out for exceptional beef and veal, and the duck – canard de Rouen – appears on lots of menus.If you’ve a sweet tooth, don’t visit the region without trying a traditional tarte Normande, a rich shortcrust pastry tart filled with creamy egg custard and almonds, and topped with slices of caramelised apple. RestaurantsSmart, family-friendly eateries serving simple, seasonal produce are plentiful in Normandy. For fresh “surf and turf” with a sensational sea view, Hôtel des Isles in Barneville-Carteret, just south of Cherbourg, offers a land and sea starter buffet with seafood platters, grilled or plancha-seared fish and traditional stewed meats for main.If you’re after a traditional experience inland, try Brasserie Paul in Rouen where fresh regional specialities such as rabbit pâté, Normandy snails, local farm chicken and fine cheeses are on the menu.Rouen also offers stylish two-Michelin-starred dining at Gill – pigeon is a speciality – or the more affordable but still sleekly decorated sister restaurant, Gill Côté Bistro.DrinkingCalvados (apple brandies) and cider are the region’s two signature drinks. Three controlled appellations produce the former, one of which is Pays d’Auge, where copper alembic pot stills are used. On the 25-mile (40km) cider route east of Caen, you can visit more than 20 establishments producing one or both of these, as well as pommeau – made by mixing apple juice with brandy. Many of the distilleries and cidermakers occupy picture-postcard houses set amid apple orchards and lush pastures.MarketsFrom the bustling Sunday market at Carnac to Vannes’s fish market (four days a week, as well as a traditional market on Wednesdays) to the astonishing 20 neighbourhood markets that are spread around Rennes, Brittany is a region brimming with food and produce, crafts and culture. Whether you’re looking for crisp apples and freshly picked strawberries or more gastro items such as rare poultry and artisanal butters, you’ll find them on a stall – Breton chefs do their shopping here … and they know a thing or two.At charming Pontivy, by the river Blavet and the Nantes-to-Brest canal, you can drop in at the Monday market before exploring the medieval castle and the maze of winding streets. The town also has a thriving antiques trade and there are regular flea markets.Quaint Bécherel, between Saint-Malo and Rennes, has a buzzing Saturday food and household goods market and is also one of France’s best-loved book towns. There are more than a dozen bookshops, a book market on the first Sunday of the month and a lively schedule of literary events, including a fête du livre (book fair) every Easter.In the summer months, you can find night markets in Carnac and Quiberon, and enjoy classic Breton musical entertainment with bombarde (woodwind) players while you browse.Regional specialities and where to sample themIf you’re self-catering in Brittany you’re in luck. With 1,740 miles of coastline, you can pick up some of the best fish and shellfish in Europe. Brittany is the powerhouse of France’s oyster trade, providing one-third of the nation’s yield – Cancale is its capital. Look out, too, for delicious mussels, scallops, clams, lobster, and langoustines, as well as more exotic items such as organic abalones.Breton producers are very proud of their pork – saucissons of all kinds abound, while audouille – a sausage made from smoked chitterling – has its semi-official capital in Guéméné-sur-Scorff. Across the region, look out for local onions and organic honey.If you’re big on pastry, kouign amann – which translates as “butter cake” – is a Breton speciality. Created in 1860 in the town of Douarnenez, this gooey, layered confection is sold by weight in traditional patisseries the very definition of “naughty but nice”.RestaurantsIf ever you’re in need of a tasty snack between meals, a regional comfort food is the crepe, both the sweet kind and savoury galettes. They are served in restaurants and occasionally on the street. At the Creperie Ti Saozon, in Roscoff, chef Estelle Combot prepares sublime crepes with fish, as well as dessert crepes that get even the locals queuing around brunchtime.Seafood restaurants dot the coast. La Côte, close to Carnac’s famous menhirs, occupies a large, old house in a delightful setting, with a terrace overlooking a carp-filled pond. Try the squid with pig’s trotters or the lobster.L’Amphytrion in Lorient has two Michelin stars and a chic ambience. Acclaimed chef Jean-Paul Abadie creates fine art with spider crab, mackerel, sea urchins and local fish such as red mullet.DrinkingCider is the “wine” of Brittany. Cornouaille was the first French cider to be recognised with an appellation controlee label. Look out for the 10 AOC cider-makers and six non-AOC producers listed on the CIDREF website. Le Sistrot in Quimper stocks a wide range of craft and farm ciders.There’s also a long tradition of beer brewing in the region. Brasserie Lancelot was founded in 1990 and occupies the site of a gold mine in Roc-Saint-André, Morbihan. Seven unpasteurised beers are made here, each one named after a figure from Breton history."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8c727f1f392c7574c612ffe4153fd3f0a4d2d744/104_76_3396_2038/master/3396.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1e5488ae006fe40a728007a2313b7d0d","title":"royal bank scotland sued newham council lobo loan terms","story":"Newham council is suing Royal Bank of Scotland over the terms of about £150m in complex bank loans, making it the latest UK bank to face a lawsuit over lending terms that critics say piled undue pressure on local services.The east London authority filed a high court claim against RBS earlier this week, the  can report. The claim centres on terms of its lender option borrower option loans, known as Lobos, which proved popular with local councils in the early 2000s. One of the main attractions were the Lobos’ teaser interest rates that kept costs low in the short term but later proved expensive as austerity and spending cuts took hold.Lobos have attracted criticism by campaigners and the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, who has called for a government investigation and action to restore any historic losses to the public purse.The east London authority took out about £578m in Lobos between 2003-10, according to data compiled by the campaign group Debt Resistance UK. About £150m of those loans were provided by RBS, making it the second largest lender of Lobo loans to Newham aside from Barclays.Newham’s legal team filed a separate legal claim against Barclays over its lobo loans last year and proceedings are understood to be ongoing. Barclays declined to comment.A spokesperson for Newham council confirmed that the claim had been lodged against RBS but declined to comment further given it is a live legal matter.An RBS spokesperson said: “No claims have been served on the bank at this time.” While a filing has been made at the high court, it is understood that the bank does not yet have the specifics of the claim.It follows a similar lawsuit launched against Barclays in recent weeks by seven local councils including Greater Manchester and Leeds over the terms of nearly £573m in Lobo loans taken out between them.Their own high court claim centres on how interest rates on those loans were influenced by the London interbank offered rate (Libor). Barclays is among the lenders that have been fined for Libor rigging since the banking crisis.The loans gave banks the power to raise interest rates at certain points over their lifetime, accounting for the “lender option” of the loan agreement.Although borrowers had the option of rejecting those terms, it would trigger a clause forcing them to immediately repay the loan in full.The seven councils say the bank knew customers would rely on Libor rates, which Barclays was accused of lowballing, when deciding whether to enter into contracts. Barclays then has the power to raise interest rates over the lifetime of the Lobo loans as part of the central terms.This week marks six years since RBS was fined a total of £87.5m over Libor manipulation by the City watchdog in 2013.Research for Action, a research cooperative that involves members of Debt Resistance UK, said the anniversary meant the six-year time limit for potential claims linked to Libor manipulation was also coming to a close.The research group claims that 42 local authorities in the UK have suffered losses on about £1.4bn of RBS-issued lobo loans due to Libor manipulation. The organisation says it has sent letters to the chief executives of all the potentially affected councils to notify them of the deadline."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f900118a59d780579a9118fd216efa424b2080c0/0_44_5360_3217/master/5360.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7454e4e5f1ee930f704a4c2cfd9ef549","title":"in the 80s it had life and energy readers react to sheffields struggling high street","story":"Last week, a  Cities article explored the steep decline in shops in Sheffield city centre and asked who was to blame. Reader reaction was swift and impassioned.So why is the problem particularly acute in the steel city? Readers had many thoughtful comments.Meadowhall, an out-of-town shopping centre which opened in 1990 and offers free parking, has long been cited as a contributing factor to the demise of shops in the heart of the city. Some blame the rise in online shopping, others a lack of vision by the city council. Local retailers, meanwhile, point squarely at high business rates.Of the many thoughtful comments below the piece, here are some of the best – and some potential solutions.Sheffield council seems in denial about Meadowhall. It’s huge and always busy so surely must generate the same amount of money as a thriving city centre destination like Leeds or Manchester? In that case why not just accept that Meadowhall is Sheffield’s ‘retail quarter’ with all the big chains, and invest in supporting independent businesses in the city centre with schemes to help pay business taxes. It was always the independent stuff that made Sheffield city centre an exciting place to visit - worth a detour after buying the boring bits at Meadowhall. Now there’s barely any of that left it’s just another soulless identikit place.You can drive to Meadowhall, park for free within a short walk of a comfortable air conditioned environment. Sheffield City Council have presided for decades over a policy which makes driving and parking expensive and difficult. A policy which effectively promotes Meadowhall to the disadvantage of the city centre.High Street shopping areas need to become smaller, more compact and more specialised - and business rates need radical overhaul. You can see this in big cities as well as smaller provincial towns such as mine. Our long high street is peppered with empty units and charity shops, yet cafes and restaurants are appearing and apparently doing ok. There is no future for big brand stores on most high streets, the answer is in more local, inidual, specialist outlets - but rates need to come down to allow them to thrive.So sad, when jobs go so does that sense of community. During the 80s I would work in Sheffield and like other similar cities, Nottingham, Leicester, Derby it seemed to have its own life and energy, it was a colourful, dynamic place, and I loved working there.A few years ago I visited Magna, a terrific place but there are many things this government needs to address if it is prepared to challenge the malaise rotting the heart of our communities. Perhaps I’m getting old in the tooth but something tells me it has neither the vision, the heart or the stamina.If it weren’t for John Lewis many people wouldn’t visit Sheffield at all. The tram to Meadowhall started the death of the city centre - Manchester made the right decision not to take the tram to the Trafford centre. It’s such a shame to see what’s happened to Sheffield. What I don’t understand is why it’s always so difficult to park - if no-one\u0027s shopping there, why are the car parks always full?Sheffield should take note of the successful case of Altrincham, Manchester. The centre was seriously depressed until one bold renovation project created a giant new restaurant. It proved so popular that people got fed up waiting in the queue and started using nearby eateries instead, where they could get quicker service.....England\u0027s Best High Street award shortly followed.There’s a lot of city centre living in Sheffield now, although there is an argument that flats attract a more transient population. It’s a strange city in that it has vibrant suburbs all around the immediate outskirts, so the main shopping centre can feel a bit underwhelming. Overall, a great place to live and socialise. Like most places outside London, it could do with more employment (meaning real businesses moving into the area, as opposed to everyone riding around on bikes delivering pizzas to each other).I keep seeing the arguments to try and ‘save’ high streets when what they really need is to change to become more service based and reflect what people want rather than hope to look like something ‘typical’jark44Sheffield City Council - yes they have had massive cuts to deal with but this is significantly exacerbated by poor and authoritarian leadership, a total lack of vision, seeming incompetence and very fraught local LP politics. They have completely lost the faith of most voters in the city.Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/49578ffc13fd1681c711f2b7b8750ef39b9e461c/0_296_1863_1117/master/1863.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0b3962a95126a7b6c04761ff6c0a169b","title":"cambridge university benefactors david harding","story":"The announcement that the University of Cambridge is receiving a £100m gift from the billionaire financier David Harding left me perplexed: why on earth does the wealthiest university in the country need a donation of this size?As a recent graduate, I can confirm that Cambridge can be very generous. The university famously doesn’t allow its students to have jobs during term-time, instead offering financial support to anyone who may be struggling. There are numerous hardship funds, college bursaries, and university-wide grants on offer – most of which I made use of during my three years as an undergraduate.That isn’t simple praise for Cambridge in helping its poorer students – this should absolutely be expected from any institution with £11.8bn in assets. But most universities don’t have funds anywhere near that level, so could never come close to matching the financial support both Oxford and Cambridge can provide. The Harding donation only furthers the monetary gap between Oxbridge and other universities, exacerbating the ide within British higher education.News of Harding’s donation comes in the same week as Sir Nicholas Serota, head of Arts Council England, stated that “social pressure” should be used to encourage the wealthy to be more charitable, adopting a more American approach to altruism. Harding’s gift is certainly closer to the American style of educational philanthropy, where it is common for people to regularly donate substantial sums to their former universities. In 2015, John Paulson gifted $400m (about £300m) to Harvard, a year later Phil Knight gave the same amount to Stanford – and last year, former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg handed over $1.8bn (£1.38bn) to John Hopkins University.The writer Malcolm Gladwell has railed against donations being made to institutions that already have substantial wealth, branding it a “moral crime” to choose to donate to a richer university over one with significantly fewer assets. An episode of Gladwell’s podcast Revisionist History looked at the late Hank Rowan, an American philanthropist who, in 1992, donated $100m to Glassboro State College, a small public college in New Jersey, instead of the private universities he attended. The money was enough to allow the institution to survive and advance to university status (it’s now called Rowan University).Yet Rowan’s legacy failed to set any sort of precedent within the wider field of philanthropy. Instead, wealthy benefactors, such as Harding, continue to prioritise their alma maters over institutions where the money could be put to tangible, transformational use.Birkbeck gives £1,000 bursaries to all its undergraduate students from low-income backgrounds. It also runs a refugee scholarship programme, offering full tuition and further monetary support to 20 asylum seekers each year, allowing forced migrants to pursue higher education without burdening themselves financially. When I think about Cambridge’s £100m gift, I wonder what somewhere like Birkbeck could do with that money. These schemes could have been funded countless times over, offering life-changing educational opportunities to many more disadvantaged students.Birkbeck, meanwhile, went into deficit last year, alongside a number of other universities, and is one of a handful of higher education providers looking at making staff redundancies. Harding’s donation, split across these establishments, could save hundreds of jobs, while considerably strengthening the sector overall. Instead it is going towards recruitment drives at one of the most oversubscribed universities in the world. As we become increasingly aware of the ide between rich and poor in society, we also need to look at the widening gaps between our public institutions.As Serota suggests, wealthy people should be socially pressured into making large charitable donations – but those donations should be grounded in a wider sense of social responsibility. Donors need to consider whether they are contributing towards improving higher education as a whole, or simply exacerbating isions within an already polarised sector.• Marthe de Ferrer is a freelance journalist and school governor based in Manchester"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4c1f8fb66796eb4d6a9e26e00dfa6ad2acea281a/0_422_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=99dfb4f45946b9164dc2abc2dc745fc8","title":"children skipping school ruining planet strike climate change","story":"Stop criticising pupils striking about climate change. The so-called adults are the ones leading us into a catastropheIf there is one political subject that remains neglected and underestimated because of how we have for centuries run our societies, economies and families, then it is children. Although the experience and process of growing up has in many ways profoundly changed through history, our understanding of children has failed to keep pace.Nothing makes this clearer than the children’s climate strikes. These protests, involving school-age children refusing to attend class to focus the attention of political leaders on the global climate crisis, have spread from Australia to Germany, from Sweden to Belgium the first strikes in the UK take place this Friday and in the US later this month. But instead of taking themseriously, many “adults” (usually, though not exclusively old men in leadership positions) are still dismissing them with the utterly paternalistic argument that all these protests are nice and cute, but skipping school? Why can’t the children protest in their “free time”, instead of endangering their own education and their future which we, the adults, supposedly have provided for them.The most absurd reaction has emerged from Belgium, where an environment minister, Joke Schauvliege, has been forced to resign after claiming that the Belgian children skipping school were being directed by unnamed foreign powers.Schauvliege suggested that the protests were a “set-up” and she falsely claimed that Belgian intelligence had knowledge that the children’s actions were “more than spontaneous actions of solidarity”.There was a paternalistic dismissal of the school protests too from the Australian resources minister, Matt Canavan, who said in a radio interview that the action was setting the children up for failure: “Walking off school and protesting, you don’t learn anything from that.”Meanwhile, consider an interview the German news magazine Der Spiegel did with Greta Thunberg, the 16-year-old Swedish mastermind of the school strikes movement, who travelled 32 hours by train to get to Davos while the “adults” who were supposed to meet to talk about climate change there arrived in 1,500 private jet flights.The Spiegel journalists flew (although at least not by private jet) to Sweden just to meet Greta and their most pressing question was: who is really behind the girl who’s become an inspiration for children across the world?So, after suggesting to the child that her speeches seem a bit too good to have been written by a kid, they then asked her directly: “Who stands behind Greta”? She patiently answered that she herself is “behind Greta”, and added an important lesson to the journalists and adults: “Some people claim that my parents have brainwashed me, but it was the opposite: I brainwashed my parents. I convinced them not to fly any more and to stop eating meat”.When the journalists asked her whether she found it acceptable that tens of thousands of children were skipping school, Greta, fully aware that the school strikes are the only effective but also somehow “traumatic” part for most of the adults (or world leaders) who are otherwise fine with co-opting the children’s leader as a sort of entertainment at Davos, simply answered: “You have to stop destroying our future.”Faced with the same paternalistic complaint that children shouldn’t be skipping school, 13-year-old US pupil Alexandria Villasenor, who has started walking to the UN in her own climate strike every Friday, speaks in blunt terms: “If we’re not going to have a future, then school won’t matter any more.”She couldn’t be more right. While in Belgium tens of thousands of children have been skipping school to join demonstrations for action against climate change, at the same time, in another corner of Europe, the children of Macedonia have been forced to skip school because of air pollution. This shows that some children are denied school because of the way “adults” manage the world. What the children’s protests are bringing back is a sort of universalism (children in Belgium are also protesting about the future of the children in Macedonia), but a much-needed debate about the very notion of a common future. For this reason we have to understand this wave of children’s disobedience (even skipping school) as an attempt to literally take back time (the future) from a system that is founded on extraction not only of natural resources, but of time and the future itself.There is a wonderful children’s fantasy novel published in 1973 in German with the full title Momo, or The Strange Story of the Time Thieves and the Kid Who Brought Back Stolen Time to Humans, which deserves new recognition. Not just because it actually imagined such children’s protests, but because it offers a much-needed inversion of “adults” and “children”.It was written by Michael Ende, the author of the more famous The Neverending Story. Momo is not just a surprisingly accurate depiction of the world of acceleration and indebtedness in which we are living today, but a rallying call to resistance to young people. Now it seems, the children’s climate strikes are precisely an answer to the events that started to be unleashed in the 1970s and were best summed up by the famous Sex Pistols song from 1977 No Future.In an interview on German television in 1993, Ende predicted that the world was headed toward either an economic or an ecological catastrophe, that we are, in fact, waging war against our children. The first war against our youngest citizens is the destruction of the planet, which is the theft of their future the second war is the overreaction to the current children’s protest. It reflects our western cultural tendency to simultaneously treat children like pets – sentimentalising and infantilising them while at the same time dismissing their concerns. The billionaire business leaders of Davos applauded the Swedish girl at Davos, but from the outside it looked like a sideshow, a piece of ersion, rather than anything that would really cause them to change direction.But what if the children today were considered the true grownups, and the “adults” who are leading the world into an ecological catastrophe – as they fly into an Alpine resort in 1,500 private jets to pay lip service to climate change – were considered the spoiled and dangerous children?If we want to have a future at all, the children of the early 21st century have to be taken seriously – and the adults should join their protests.• Srećko Horvat is a philosopher from Croatia and one of the founders of the Democracy in Europe Movement"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0c8aaaf3f74bb25f5e42a92235f07593ffa1ab18/0_315_1376_826/master/1376.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3b61d09226cbd208de3ff610cd6ec131","title":"john humphrys leaving today at last why dont feel triumphant","story":"The presenter has announced he is leaving the Radio 4 show later this year. Now that he’s going, I remember what I liked about himI woke up to the news in stereo: John Humphrys on the radio, being infuriating, and John Humphrys in the Daily Mail, making the announcement that he is to leave the Today programme, possibly as soon as this autumn. Harrrumph, I snorted. Only someone who is a thousand years old could call autumn “soon”.Railing against Humphrys has become the engine of my mornings, a tea tree shower gel and ginger juice bomb combined. On particularly bad mornings – when he is telling Jacob Rees-Mogg chummily that he knew his father – I have to get out of bed and fetch my laptop, because tweeting on my phone just isn’t fast enough. It is often hard to disentangle what I am angry about, between Humphrys, the Today programme and the BBC generally, but I don’t care. I have enough fury for all of them.Anyway, now he’s leaving, I don’t feel triumphant at all. I am thinking about the old Humphrys, the one who used to enjoy a bit of mischief, the one who wrote a sensitive and unexpected book about assisted dying, and I miss the political culture that made that Humphrys.

Who could be mad enough at him that they want vengeance, given that he is, at most, fairly politically inactive as a corpse? The perpetrator is believed to have used a hammer, not even paying him the respect of also using a sickle, so they must really hate the guy.During Marx’s lifetime he made a lot of enemies, even leaving aside the whole “giving birth to communism” thing.He sponged money off Engels for decades, something which probably didn’t endear him to Engels, as he was forced to steal petty cash to give to Marx, which Marx would then blow on ale. One day, after getting his housemaid pregnant, he made Engels take the blame so that his own wife wouldn’t find out. And that was his best friend.A friend he was less close to he let fight a duel on his behalf, which saw him get a bullet in the head – all because Marx had been mildly insulted in public.Strangers had reason to not like Marx, too. With a massive beard he refused to get cut and underpants he refused to change even once a week, it’s fair to say barbers and people in the general vicinity were also not fans. By the end of his life he had been expelled from at least three countries.So it would be understandable if his grave had been trashed when he was alive, but it’s a bit weird now that he’s dead. Who would do such a thing? Well, let me take you through the obvious suspects.Motive: Marx has been sponging off our cemetery reparation fund for over 100 years now and his name sounds sort of foreign. He’s taking the place of a British person who could easily do the job of being notably dead. Why not make room for proper British thinkers, like Kerry Katona or Lee Hurst?Means: There is literally zero chance one of these creeps isn’t friends with a gravedigger.Opportunity: If you saw John Redwood in a graveyard you’d assume he’s there in his capacity as the vampire who turned Rees-Mogg.Motive: Marx wrote a full three volumes of books about capitalism before concluding it was bad, the telltale sign of a Blairite centrist melt.He also famously wrote “workers of the world, unite” in the Communist Manifesto, which sounds suspiciously pro-freedom of movement, something Corbyn is not necessarily on board with. Marx has frequently been found out of line with true lefty ideals, which as we all know is whatever Corbyn is thinking of this week. Time to alienate this centrist commie’s corpse from its grave.Means: Solid and dependable, hammers are a tool for the many, not the few.Opportunity: Nobody would raise an eyebrow when a guy with a “Corbyn in a Che Guevara hat” T-shirt goes to Marx’s grave for a bit of a cry.Motive: They tried hashtags, further hashtags, some emojis and singing songs while dressed in a sexy Batman outfit and nothing has worked: Corbyn still won’t give them a #peoplesvote #waton #revokearticle50.If you look at the grave you’ll notice the notch-marks are tiny. Why smash the grave with such a small hammer? Yep, that’s right, they were trying to chip out another hashtag (#followbacksmashmarx) in the one place Corbyn is guaranteed to take notice – his precious grandad’s grave.Means: If you’re upper-middle class you can probably hire somebody with a hammer.Opportunity: They just quit their job to “fight Brexit” by tweeting at it, and the graveyard has excellent wifi.Motive: Fresh off their famously edgy slogan “socialism sucks”, everybody’s favourite new edgelords needed another belter, but all they could come up with was their derivative secondary slogan “big government sucks”.Fearing they were losing their reputation as the badasses of people who happen to still have nannies, the group clearly sat down and thought “what’s edgier than being a Ukip member at the age of 10? Trashing gravestones, that’s what.”Sadly they later found out that they were merely acting out the truest spirit of Marx himself by getting drunk and smashing up private property.Means: One of their bigger friends says they can do a push up. If he’s not lying (like he did about having that Canadian girlfriend from another school) then there’s a good chance he can swing a hammer.Opportunity: They’re at that age where they start to go on field trips.Motive: Chequers has become a bit boring as an away day. Why not spice things up by having a team building exercise where they smash up the graves of famous communists? Besides, if anyone needs a distraction it’s a government that can’t even try to inspect a port without being banned from entering Calais.Means: Let’s face it, if anyone is going to trash history on purpose only to do a slightly shit job of it and then flee, it’s the cabinet. They’ve spent three years doing precisely this: it’s the only thing they’re good at at this stage.If it turns out the reason the hammering was so crappy is because someone had accidentally brought along a Phillips-head screwdriver, then this plan has Chris Grayling written all over it.Opportunity: If anyone asked why they were there, Theresa May could chisel “fit for work” on the nearest grave – and not a single person wouldn’t believe they were there on behalf of the DWP.• James Felton is a TV and radio comedy writer"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c60f55f2ad38d6d6254b4c623392ca8407c02e80/0_335_5000_3002/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0c0c6d262328f229a1040a7caed7a7c3","title":"brighton pavilion exhibition showcases 40 years hats stephen jones","story":"Royal Pavilion exhibition has at its centre a display of hats created for 26 famous faces As far as dinner parties go, it doesn’t get much more eclectic than Rihanna, the Duchess of Sussex, Joan Collins, Boy George and Skepta. They are just a handful of the 26 famous faces who have been brought together by the milliner Stephen Jones around the grand banqueting room table at the Royal Pavilion in Brighton, each represented by the headpiece the designer created for them.It forms the focal point of the designer’s new exhibition, Stephen Jones Hats, in which more than 170 hats from his 40-year career have been whimsically positioned in every room of King George IV’s famous pleasure palace.In the great kitchen, a beret made in 2005 depicting a full English breakfast sits next to a fascinator composed to resemble a French onion soup, made for Schwarzkopf in 1985. In the music room, a three-tiered cymbal creation made for the 2015 exhibition China: Through the Looking Glass at the politan Museum of Art in New York hangs from a chandelier.While Jones’s 2012 collection Chinoiserie-on-Sea greets visitors as they arrive, bridging the gap between familiar landmarks of the seaside town and the monarch’s preferred interior style, blending the Regency aesthetic with details inspired by creations from east Asia.Jones says he was keen to stage the exhibit in the pavilion, which began construction in 1787, because of the similarities between the monarch’s interiors homage to the region and the imagination employed by fashion designers. “Even before I was a milliner, I loved the pavilion because it’s a total fantasy place, a land of make-believe which is so fashion – it’s all a wonderful fake and that’s the great thing about it,” he told the .As well as his private commissions, Jones’s long-term collaborations with fashion houses such as Schiaparelli, Marc Jacobs, Giles Deacon, Comme des Garçons and Christian Dior are also documented. The latter is represented by two haute couture dresses presented on mannequins along with the hats Jones created for their catwalk debut. A capsule collection for Harvey Nichols, which is sponsoring the exhibition, is to follow in the coming weeks.Jones is also happy to ert attention away from London towards “the richness of Britain’s regional museums”. “I know about the V\u0026ampA and the main museums but actually the smaller museums are extraordinary,” he said.As his own tribute to Brighton, Jones has celebrated its status as the centre of gay culture in the UK with a selection of the rainbow creations he made for his 2002 collection, High, dotted along the sideboards of the faux bamboo-clad long gallery."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/df69fd81ac91e4dfa56b7eef4aa9bae27d24dca7/0_448_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=36148ff42fdc68b5b5c8a64c083278b9","title":"skin deep why alexandria ocasio cortezs beauty regime split the internet","story":"Last week, towards the end of her first month in office, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez posted a five-page Instagram story on her skin routine and it split the internet.It wasn’t the use of retinol that sent critics into a spin. Ocasio-Cortez’s double cleansetonermoisturisesunscreenvitamin Cdo-not-sleep-in-your-makeup, six-step regime is not exactly anomalous for a 29-year-old woman with an income. Nor is it a surprise that a woman working in the public eye washes. After all, we live in a world in which communication is visual and where a woman in lipstick in a political space will still turn heads. (AOC should know: in June, during the New York primary campaign, she tweeted the shade of her Stila lipstick and there were similar repercussions.)What seemed to pique her detractors’ rage was that in spite of a record number of women serving in Congress, and in spite of AOC being a woman who took a man’s seat, the politician had dared to admit a base level of vanity. And she wore sunscreen. In contrast, last week, the New York Times finally rumbled Donald Trump for allegedly wearing fake tan and “a little powder which the president applies himself before television appearances” and no one batted an eyelid.But what the congresswoman’s post shows is how in the past two years the concept of skincare has changed beyond all recognition. Where once we were told to cleanse, tone and moisturise (and later discouraged from over-exfoliating), the kind of multi-step Korean-influenced beauty routine that Ocasio-Cortez subscribes to has taken on near-religious power. In fact, AOC’s “face layering” regime looks positively spartan in comparison to the laborious regime of about 10 different steps adopted by some women in South Korea and Japan. The industry exploded globally a couple of years ago, but it has already moved from novelty to backlash (last January, the Outline described it as “a con”, while in October women in South Korea destroyed their makeup as part of a movement called “escape the corset”). AOC’s endorsement simply shows it has gone mainstream, appearing as a regular topic in the New Yorker and Atlantic, well outside of the beauty blog bubble.Along the way it has also normalised some pretty weird vernacular, from snail slime and donkey masks to “mules” (people who are paid to bring things back from abroad) and “dupes” (products that mimic expensive products for half the price). And then there’s the money. Newish companies that specialise in multi-step products such as The Ordinary and Drunk Elephant have successfully rebranded “anti-ageing” products as “millennial” ones, and in turn, sent revenues hurtling towards the billions. According to Kotra, the South Korean government agency for trade promotion, $4,536,943 (£3.47m) worth of K-beauty products were legally exported to the US in 2018, up almost a million on the previous year. Who knows how much comes through more nefarious channels. Multi-step beauty is not simply an arm of the industry, it is its own economy.For many of us, the idea of AOC double cleansing is both fascinating and reassuring. Fascinating because in dark political times, there are few better balms than reading about the routine of a politician, and reassuring because it proves that AOC is one of us. Lisa Niven-Phillips, the beauty editor of Vogue, saw her endorsement as pivotal to her success as a politician: “The thing with AOC is that she doesn’t think it’s too trivial to talk about, which is honest – and promotes the idea that people can be multifaceted. I love the transparency that’s how she got millennials on board, isn’t it?”Niven-Phillips came across the regime in Seoul six years ago and has since upped her skincare count to six steps. Like AOC, she double cleanses (a thick one to take off makeup, less thick to actually wash) uses a vitamin C serum, a hydrating serum, a little moisturiser and, twice a week, an exfoliant. If going to a party, she uses a sheet mask: “They’re good for immediacy, rather than any long-term benefits,” she adds. And, for anyone asking, the whole thing takes five minutes, and means she wears less makeup as a result. “That was always the idea – to improve your skin first so you didn’t need to then cover it in makeup.”Anita Bhagwandas, the former beauty editor of Stylist, agrees. She has seven or eight steps – including the double cleanse – and more in the winter. “I always thought the multi-step regime was a myth,” she says. “Now it seems perfectly normal. I don’t know why there is so much fuss and mystery surrounding it.” The whole thing takes less than 10 minutes, and she, too, wears less makeup as a result. “The natural skin look on Instagram has definitely replaced the contouring one.”In truth, it is not solely about creams and oils. Skincare has always been about putting money on your face, but while a lot of it is probably snake oil and a financial drain, it is no coincidence “face layering” has risen in popularity with self-care, another catch-all phrase which has been buzzing around over the past few years. Its meaning has become amorphous – we now think of it as me-time, or candles in the bath – but it was originally a medical concept applied to mental and emotional health. At a certain point, it even became a political act, reclaiming health and wellness from the white patriarchy who kept it to themselves. The African American writer Audre Lorde described it in 1988 as “not self-indulgence” but “self-preservation, and that is an act of political warfare”. That AOC is a woman, a millennial and also a socialist, has arguably redirected self-care back in that direction.So maybe it is no coincidence that self-care mushroomed in the wake of the US election and the EU referendum. According to Slate, in 2016 Americans Googled the word self-care twice as often as they ever had before. Skincare and self-care are not the same – but there is an overlap. Niven-Phillips, Bhagwandas and I can all vouch for that. Layering six creams is clearly about cocooning your skin, but also yourself. The beauty writer Rio Viera-Newton, a follower of the multi-step regime whose Google doc of routine products led to her becoming a contributor to New York magazine, agrees. “I’m always taken aback by the assumption that skincare is something that’s in service to a person other than yourself.”So whether a 10-step regime actually works is besides the point. “I don’t think skincare needs to be excessively complicated with a large number of steps, nor do I think it needs to be expensive,” says Dr Anjali Mahto, a consultant dermatologist. Sure, there is some science to it “and we can all benefit from the basics of cleansing and moisturising, but many of the ingredients in high-street or drug-store skincare products are exactly the same as in luxury brands”. Her own routine includes the famous double cleanse – “I remove the day and all of my makeup with a micellar water, followed by an AHABHA foaming cleanser” – but she agrees it is as much about “the whole experience – choosing the product, its smell, texture, packaging and feeling of wellbeing it can create (even if it’s for a short period of time)”.In many ways, skincare in 2019 is not solely about vanity and the reversal of time. It is also about female anxiety and the pressure to care but pretend you don’t. While perfect skin does not exist, the pursuit of it does and for some women, talking about that can be empowering. As Naomi Wolf outlines in The Beauty Myth, “women can tend to resent each other if they look too ‘good’ and dismiss one another if they look too ‘bad’”. As AOC can attest, you’re damned if you double cleanse and lazy if you don’t."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/031079c32ab0548656496a7cb65037c19723ab28/502_108_3158_1896/master/3158.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=349101966560281ca2411ef639af24d2","title":"black sheep guardian film nominated for best short documentary oscar","story":"Ed Perkins’ film about a young black boy’s response to a racist gang after he moves out of London is up for an Academy awardBlack Sheep, a film commissioned by the , has been nominated for best short documentary at the 2019 Oscars.Directed by Ed Perkins, Black Sheep tells the story of Cornelius Walker, a black 11-year-old from London who moves with his family to a housing estate in Essex after the murder of schoolboy Damilola Taylor in 2000.

One of the world’s most high-end foods colliding with the most basic to produce a strange, shape-shifting vision of fluidity in food form. It’s so on trend. And with its breaking down of barriers, its radical invention and its kicking down of the door to a whole new universe of possibilities, it quite possibly offers us a chance to taste the infinite. Either that or it’s just a marketing gimmick from Heinz (it’s celebrating 150 years of its inimitable red sauce). One way or another, I had to find out.Thanks to the ’s deadlines, the only night available for me to sample ketchup caviar was on my birthday. And so instead of eating a favourite meal, I got to eat a favourite meal that featured tomato ketchup in a starring role. That slightly limited the options, it has to be said, especially as I’m not one of those Trumpian monster who eats their fillet steak with lashings of Tommy K (although ketchup caviar is the kind of thing you would expect a Trump establishment to serve … in fact you can already hear him calling it “a very elegant food”).In the end I plumped for fish fingers, chips and peas. Spooning the tiny red balls on to my breadcrumbed fish certainly added a jolly interactive element to what was already quite clearly a pre-school meal. The finished plate looked ridiculous, but at the same time you could definitely imagine Heston Blumenthal sticking it on a £600 tasting menu, serving it with a children’s bedtime story printed on rice paper and watching as diners weep uncontrollably with childhood nostalgia.Of course there are other caviars on the market that don’t contain any caviar (cavi-nahs?). Ikea sells seaweed pearls made largely of kelp, while Holland and Barrett stocks a similarly vegan caviar. Condiment caviars, however, don’t seem to be available elsewhere and if Heinz ketchup caviar is anything to go by, there may be a reason for this: it doesn’t taste very nice.Yes, the balls keep their shape (although maybe a little too well – making it hard to coat anything in the sauce until it’s in your mouth). But the ketchup caviar is sadly thinner and more acidic than regular Heinz, and tastes more like an own brand sauce rather than the deep, rich delights of proper glass-bottled Heinz. To get the full effect of its globular nature you have to eat it on its own, and who eats ketchup on its own? (Maybe don’t answer that.)It’s a game attempt to reinvent the food landscape. But if you really want to enjoy a truly luxurious meal, then stick to eating fish fingers and chips with some proper tomato ketchup instead."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f1264e5bf005ffae1f4e326cd201e198f13f43a5/495_268_1560_936/master/1560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3b2019d9c4ba4c65c3b735c1550273f7","title":"yasmin khan cookbook zaitoun recipes from the palestinian kitchen","story":"Khan uses her newest cookbook, Zaitoun: Recipes From the Palestinian Kitchen, as a window into food in a place of conflict Most cookbooks begin with the promise of transporting the reader to a happy place. Yasmin Khan’s new cookbook, Zaitoun: Recipes From the Palestinian Kitchen, begins by transporting the reader to the Tel Aviv airport interrogation rooms where Khan, a Briton of Iranian-Pakistani heritage, was questioned for several hours after flying into Israel.“I just decided I needed to tell the truth,” Khan says about her cookbook’s introduction. “I thought it was important for me to start the book with that because we do live in context while Israeli food is booming, this other side isn’t represented.”Zaitoun, which was published yesterday in the US, is the newest of a recent crop of Palestinian cookbooks attempting to remedy that, including the London-based Palestinian chef Joudie Kalla’s 2016 Palestine on a Plate and The Palestinian Table, a 2017 volume from Reem Kassis, a Philadelphia-based Palestinian cookbook author. It reads as much as the story of the Palestinian people as their food, interweaving the anecdotes of home cooks and professional chefs with more than 80 recipes.The book’s chapters are organized by course, interspersed with stories about Palestinian culture. In the first chapter, Khan explores mezze, the vivid, often plant-based dishes associated with the Galilee it includes three recipes for hummus, a rich shakshuka, various flatbreads, and a salad that teams salty halloumi with orange, dates and pomegranate seeds. From the West Bank, Khan showcases gutsy stews, breads, and meat dishes influenced by both Bedouin and Jordanian cooking the main courses chapter includes a recipe for mussakhan, a concoction of roast chicken seasoned with sumac and served with caramelized onions over taboon flatbread, one of the national dishes of Palestine. The food of Gaza, which Khan couldn’t visit due to the blockade that cuts it off from the rest of Palestine, is meanwhile bright with fresh dill, green chilies and garlic, all of which find happy expression in a spicy shrimp and tomato stew recipe.But for all of its vibrancy, Gazan food is also in danger of extinction: the blockade, as Khan writes, has plunged the region into food poverty and is eradicating its once-thriving fishing industry.Writing about Gazan cooking was just one of the challenges specific to writing about food in a place of conflict it is impossible to talk about Palestinian cuisine, Khan learned, without acknowledging the effects of the Israeli occupation. As one woman angrily told her: “We are not clowns in a circus for you to come and watch and make research notes about and then make your name from writing down our suffering.”“It was just really hard,” Khan, 37, says of figuring out how to strike a balance between depicting Palestinian food and the realities informing it. “I had this idea of, OK, I’m going to go write a cookbook and describe the situation, but it had been five years since I’d been and had forgotten the intensity and the trauma.”After her first research trip in 2016, Khan came back “completely unsure if I could do the book”, she admits with the thoughtful candor that characterizes her writing. “I didn’t know how I could accurately represent the really painful situations I’d witnessed. Writing a cookbook felt so trite.”But not long into the almost year-and-a-half-long process of researching and writing Zaitoun, Khan realized that she could use the book as a window into what she had seen. “I felt it was quite important to include these challenging voices,” she says. “It was very important to me to have Palestinians in their own voices sharing how their lives are, but it was challenging.”Khan covered similarly daunting territory with her first cookbook, The Saffron Tales. Published in 2016, it is a vibrant compilation of recipes and stories from another widely misunderstood place: Iran, the country where Khan’s mother grew up and many of her relatives still live. “I came to realize after the success of The Saffron Tales that there was a powerful role that food could play in exploring countries in the Middle East,” Khan says. “And I also think I stepped into more what I think is now my mission of challenging stereotypes of the Middle East.”It’s a mission that Khan has on some level been preparing for her entire life. Born in London, she was just three months old when her mother, who was working on her PhD in nutrition, took her to Iran to conduct field research. Then the Iran-Iraq war happened, and the borders closed. She and her mother stayed in Iran for a few years, before reuniting with her father in the UK. The family settled in Birmingham when Khan was six.At various points during the eight-year war, Khan returned to Iran with her mother despite the tumult there. “It was a very intense time, but we kept going back,” she says. She had close family members who were jailed or executed, and remembers sneaking snacks to her imprisoned uncle on Nowruz and then milking cows on her grandparents’ rice farm.“A psychologist probably wouldn’t take much to realize that my childhood, and seeing the backdrop of Iran and the horrors unfolding there led me to do a law degree with a view to being a human rights lawyer,” Khan says with a laugh. She became a human rights campaigner for a decade, eventually succumbing to career fatigue in 2013. As she pondered what to do next, she got the idea to write what would become The Saffron Tales, funding her first research trip to Iran through a successful Kickstarter campaign. “There was a huge gap in the market for Iranian cookbooks,” she says. “But more than that, there were no nuanced depictions of Iran other than what you’d see in the news.”As The Saffron Tales earned critical acclaim, Khan quickly came upon the idea for her follow-up. During her last few years in the non-profit sector, she had traveled throughout Israel and the West Bank as part of her NGO work on Israeli-Palestinian relations – “It probably caused my burnout,” she says wryly. But the food and flavors were familiar to her, and Khan saw an opportunity to explore another place that, like Iran, “is often narrowly seen through a political prism”.Khan’s heritage and human rights work have earned her the respect of a number of Palestinian chefs, many of whom have had to endure their share of stereotypes, even as they have watched attitudes towards Palestinians begin to shift over the years. In 1998, when Rawia Bishara opened Tanoreen, her Middle Eastern restaurant in Brooklyn, “there was this overwhelming idea that all Palestinians are terrorists and they carry the guns”, says Bishara, who immigrated to the US from Nazareth in 1974. When she told her early customers she was from Palestine, many of them thought she was from Pakistan. “Every time I said ‘Palestine’, they said, ‘Pakistan’,” she recalls.“I think talking about the conflict is not a bad thing,” Assil says of Khan’s decision to juxtapose it with beautiful photos of delicious food. “When you talk about the conflict you talk about the resilience of people. I’m speaking as a Palestinian now – when we talk about any subject related to our culture or upbringing, for better or worse the war and all these things are so normalized.”Khan, she adds, “is going in there and keeping people’s memories fresh and alive, and talking about the origin and evolution of the food is part of that. We don’t have to shy away from politics. As a reader, you’re partaking in that by buying the book and cooking that food.”Khan herself has been pleasantly surprised by the book’s reception in the UK, just as she was by The Saffron Tale’s. “A few people have written saying they’ve been moved to tears by the book, which I think is unusual for a cookbook,” she says. “That’s one of the things I’m most proud of.”Last September, Khan posted photos to Instagram from another place shaped by conflict: a refugee camp on the Greek island of Lesbos. When asked if her visit had anything to do with an upcoming project, she demurs. “I can’t really talk about my next book publicly yet, but you can take from that what you want,” she says. “But I think going forward I’m really committed to continuing to do what I can to use the power of story and cookery to shine a light on places of conflict.”Serves 4 as part of a spread8oz (250g) halloumi cheese1 orange1 tbsp  olive oil or any neutral oil (optional)2oz (50g) medjool dates, pitted and finely sliced2 tbsp  pomegranate seeds2 tbsp  extra virgin olive oil1 tbsp  unsweetened pomegranate molassesSmall handful of mint leaves, finely choppedSlice the halloumi into 14 in, 1cm-thick slices.Remove the segments from the orange: slice the top and bottom off the fruit, cutting deep enough that you see a wheel of orange flesh on both sides. Place the fruit on one of its flat ends, then slice off the remaining peel and pith, following the contour of the fruit. To remove inidual segments, insert your knife as close as you can to the inside membrane of each segment and cut to the core. Do this on both sides of the segment it should release with no pith.Heat a large frying pan over a medium heat. Add the cooking oil if you need to this will depend on the quality of your pan. Cook the halloumi on both sides until golden brown, then transfer to a serving plate.Scatter the orange segments, dates and pomegranate seeds over the warm cheese. Mix the extra virgin olive oil and pomegranate molasses in a small bowl and drizzle this over before finishing with a smattering of mint.

The judge at Chelmsford crown court, Christopher Morgan, dismissed submissions in mitigation that the group should receive conditional discharges for the direct action protest, which briefly paralysed the airport, saying they did not reflect the danger that had been presented by their actions. He said such action would “ordinarily result in custodial sentences” but that they “didn’t have a grievous intent as some may do who commit this type of crime”.Ag McKeith, whose daughter May received a 12-month community order, was pleased at the relatively lenient sentence. But, she said she felt they ought not to have been convicted at all: “Despite the judge’s stern account, it’s simply not true that they endangered anybody at the airport. The only people who were in danger were the people on the plane. I watched the trial all the way through and watched the prosecution trying to spin straw into gold, and they didn’t convince me.”Graeme Hayes, reader in political sociology at Aston University, who observed the entire trial, said: “Although the defendants have not got the custodial sentence the bringing of a terrorism-related charge against non-violent protesters is a very worrying phenomenon. It’s so far the only case in the UK and points to a chilling of legitimate public dissent.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/216e32f499a051d804cce6a522ab0829845bec1b/0_107_2784_1670/master/2784.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e83a1b5573d873d426c170853b497841","title":"john humphrys should left today programme years ago bbc radio 4","story":"Departing host of Radio 4 show says he will miss listeners most – even if many ‘hate his guts’John Humphrys has said he should have left the Today programme “years ago” but stayed on because he enjoyed hosting the flagship BBC Radio 4 show so much, as he confirmed his departure after 32 years.The presenter said he would be quitting the show in the autumn and that his greatest pleasure was forming a relationship with listeners, even though many “hate your guts”.Humphrys’ former colleague Sarah Montague, host of World at One, doorstepped the presenter in the Today programme studio and convinced him to confirm the news.“As you know, when you do this programme it dominates your life, not just because you have to get up in the morning so many days a week, but all the time, you have to be obsessed – I think that is the right word – with what’s going on out there,” Humphrys said.“You have to read everything and listen to everything and all the rest of it. There are so many things you think, ‘Oh I could have done this, I could have done that, and I’m never going to do them if I stay on this programme’.”Humphrys said he had decided to leave the programme on previous occasions but “lost his nerve”. “I worry about missing the programme, and I do now. I genuinely worry about what it is going to be like not doing the Today programme – 32 years is a very long time.”He also said he ignored criticism of his interviews on social media: “I suppose the honest answer is I really couldn’t care less … I’m not sure I’d like me if I was listening to me. There’s no law that says you have to be liked in this business, as long as you’re doing your job competently.”Humphrys was asked what he would miss most about the programme: “This is unspeakably corny but it’s not the politicians, it’s not even the interviewees, it’s the listeners. You genuinely feel after you have done this programme for long enough that you have – now I’m not going to say ‘friends’, you can’t say that as a lot of them aren’t your friends, they hate your guts – but you do feel that you have a relationship with a huge amount of people … It’s a relationship with millions of listeners, that is a huge privilege.”Asked what he would do with his spare time he said: “I like trees, I want to get more involved with trees.” He suggested he would like to make a programme about arboriculture.The Today programme editor, Sarah Sands, paid tribute to Humphrys, calling him “Gandalf” and describing him as “still the little boy who throws stones”.The 75-year-old will not be retiring from broadcasting as he will continue to present the quiz show Mastermind. On Wednesday the BBC confirmed it had signed a new deal to produce 82 episodes of the show and its celebrity spin-off, with Humphrys contracted to remain as host until at least 2021.BBC Studios, the corporation’s in-house production company, lost the tender to make the quiz show to a joint bid by the independent companies Hat Trick and Hindsight. They have promised to move production and filming to Northern Ireland and to refresh the format, returning the programme “to its roots, in a dramatic and pressurised setting”.Fran Unsworth, the BBC’s director of news and current affairs, also paid tribute to Humphrys on Wednesday. “It’s hardly an exaggeration to say that anyone who’s played a key role in the political events of the last three decades has been interviewed by John. But most importantly, he has always been a champion of his listeners, holding the powerful to account on their behalf,” she said.“John will be sorely missed by audiences and his colleagues when he leaves the programme this year, if perhaps less so by the politicians he interviews.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3d2ea5cf531c958f56f21104188ab4c3607c7c6f/1682_751_1590_954/master/1590.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e65011cf1e82fd2f32f3ce6770c7c306","title":"salif keita interview democracy is a not a good thing for africa","story":"The ‘golden voice of Africa’ has just released his final album. And though he is visibly tired, he is still in love with his guitarSalif Keita, Mali’s most famous musical son, is going home. “I’m returning to the land,” he says. “I was a farmer’s son. I am a farmer’s son. Now, I will go back to the country and cultivate.” Cultivate what? I ask, not for the first time. Keita does not answer, not for the first time. He closes his eyes and falls silent. When he does speak, it is bursts of a few words and short, stilted answers.I am in a modest hotel suite in the north of Paris with one of the greatest musical talents the African continent has ever produced. Keita, known as the “golden voice of Africa”, has enjoyed a career ning more than half a century. Now nearly 70 years old, he is known not just for his extraordinarily powerful and passionate voice, but for the genetic condition he has called albinism that has made him, he says, “white of skin and black of blood”. He has sung for Nelson Mandela, and in aid of Ethiopia. He continues to sing to highlight the desperate plight of those with albinism across Africa, giving his time and talent to raise funds.Keita is eating breakfast, a plate of fried chicken and onions, chunks of crispy baguette and milky tea. His answers are brief and so softly-spoken it’s a struggle to catch the occasional word in between the food and the clatter of cutlery. More than once, he stops eating, looks pained, and rubs both his hands vigorously over his face.He is in Paris to promote his 14th album Un Autre Blanc (Another White), the title a reference to his struggles as a singer-songwriter with albinism. Keita says it is definitely his last. “I will do some concerts and perhaps some tours. Nothing major and not another album.” He shakes his head. “Too much work. I am going to rest.”Going “back to the country” means returning to the village of Djoliba, 23 miles south of the Malian capital Bamako, which takes its name from the local Mandingue language for the river Niger on whose banks it sits. Keita grew up here, during the last years of French colonial rule – Mali became independent in 1960 – as one of 12 children in a family directly descended from the warrior king Sundiata Keita, the 13th-century founder of the Mali empire. They were aristocratic, but dirt poor.The musician has said his father was shocked but not entirely surprised when he was born with albinism, a condition caused by the absence of melanin pigmentation in the skin. There had been others with the condition on his mother’s side of the family. “It is a problem in places where cousins marry, a problem of culture,” he explains.As a child, Keita’s family kept him out of the fields, where working under the fierce sun was out of the question, but they were unable to protect him once he started school. “There were 500 students and I was the only white. Of course, I realised I was different and they didn’t let me forget it. I was bullied. Physically. It was not easy. I learned quickly how to defend myself.”“I didn’t want to be a musician. I am from a family of nobles. In Mali, nobles don’t make music – that’s for the griots,” he continues, referring to West African troubadour storytellers. “But I had no choice. I could be a musician or I could be a delinquent, a criminal, a thief, a bandit.”I am curious as to why these were the only options. “I am an albino. What else could I do? There was nothing else. My family didn’t want me to be a musician. They tried to stop me. So I left,” he says.Keita went to Bamako, and began singing in cafes and restaurants. He taught himself to play guitar, first joining the Rail Band, entertaining guests in the hotel restaurant at the railway station, then the Ambassadors, who were based at a hotel with an international clientele.“I decided to learn the guitar and do some music. It was just something to do while waiting to find another job. I didn’t think I would be a professional musician but in the end I never had another career. It was a surprise to be so successful.” Success also brought reconciliation with his family. “Later, when they saw that I was famous, they accepted it more.”In the 1980s, Keita moved to Paris where he released his first album Soro, and in 1988 he was invited to join the anti-apartheid Nelson Mandela 70th birthday tribute at Wembley stadium, an event relayed to 67 countries with an audience of 600 million. London does not appear to have made a huge impression on the singer, then or since. “It’s always raining.”As he travelled, he picked up different musical influences including Cuban salsa and European bands like Led Zeppelin and Pink Floyd, taking “bits and pieces here and there” and creating the afro-pop sound he is credited with founding. “But I never wanted to go far from my traditions. There is a melody, a heart, to Malian music that’s almost oriental,” he says.He becomes more animated when asked whether he will use his retirement to become more involved in politics. Mali, one of the world’s poorest nations, has been in turmoil since Tuareg rebels and loosely allied Islamists took over its north in 2012 and sparked the overthrow of the president. French forces intervened to push them back the following year but Islamists have since regained a foothold in the north and centre, exploiting ethnic rivalries to recruit new members.“It’s hard to be a good person when you are corrupt, and our politicians are always corrupt,” Keita says. “Mali is the most corrupt country in the world after Cameroon.Close to his heart is an ongoing campaign to raise awareness of albinism and help sufferers. Across the continent, folklore and superstitions mean sufferers are shunned or worse, beaten, killed and dismembered for their body parts credited with magical powers.Last November, Keita organised a benefit concert to raise awareness of the problem after a five-year-old girl with albinism, Ramata Diarra, was ritually killed and beheaded in the town of Fama, 80 miles west of Bamako. “Never again,” he said at the event. “I have the strong hope that people will understand that we are born in the same way and we have the same rights as everyone else.”He now oversees two foundations – Salif Keita Mali and the Salif Keita Global Foundation, based in the US – to continue this campaign. As well as combating prejudice, it offers practical help for sufferers, distributing suncreams to lessen the risk of skin cancers, and spectacles.“We have to speak out. People with albinism are killed because of old beliefs that say their limbs have powers. This kind of belief is not finished in Africa,” Keita says. “It is true that people who are different are badly treated all around the world. It is different for me now – people hardly notice I am an albino. If you are famous, you pass unnoticed. But this work is a duty, a duty to give something back. If I am popular, I must serve others and this is how I do it. What I am saying is that the colour of your skin is not a handicap … and it’s not very important either.”It is the most he has said in one go in the last hour, but now our time is up. Keita has a busy schedule of interviews before he returns to Africa with his “wife”. I am about to ask when he nods to two black guitar cases propped against the wall.“My guitar is my wife. A good wife. If I leave her there she is still there and still the same when I come back to her. We will always be together … but now I’m going back for a rest.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f6f84e733526d67ba0ae91daa75d92f76e25032c/0_153_4060_2436/master/4060.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a383a839d61adf38b632ac036a5c4c50","title":"is climate change way worse than we realise today in focus podcast","story":"David Wallace-Wells, the author of new book The Uninhabitable Earth, depicts a world ravaged by climate chaos.

Standing in for Corbyn was Emily Thornberry, the shadow foreign secretary.Thornberry used all her questions to probe Lidington on what she said should be a “sensible, grownup discussion” about the next steps forward on Brexit. Their exchanges were notably more polite than the usual barbs exchanged by the prime minister and Labour leader.Thornberry was nonetheless scathing about May’s hopes of securing sufficient changes to the Irish backstop to assure her backbenchers during talks in Brussels later this week, saying she was running out of time.“I hope he will understand the concern all of us have, not just in this house, but across the country, that we have a government treading water in the Niagara River while the current is taking us over the falls,” she said.Thornberry began with a joke about Lidington’s role: “As the newspapers always call him, he is ‘effectively the deputy prime minister’, surely the only occasion these days when the words ‘prime minister’ and ‘effective’ are used in the same sentence.”After questioning Lidington about when MPs would next get a meaningful vote on any Brexit plan, Thornberry said it appeared this would happen only if and when May secured concessions on the backstop from the EU.She said: “Does the prime minister seriously think that she will get anything different than the responses we have heard from the EU over recent days? Because none of them have given any encouragement that they are willing to reopen the withdrawal agreement unless the prime minister is willing to reconsider the red lines on which the agreement is based.”The only “sensible, cautious thing to do at this late stage” was to seek an extension to article 50 to delay Brexit, she argued.Lidington rejected the idea, saying it “would simply defer the need for this house, including the opposition frontbench, to face up to some difficult decisions”.The mooted extension to the transition period is a new idea being put forward by the EU to help Theresa May square the circle created by the written agreement last December and the draft withdrawal agreement in March.\u0026nbspThat committed the UK and the EU to ensuring there was no ergence between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.\u0026nbspBut it also, after an intervention by the Democratic Unionist party, committed the UK (not the EU) not to have any trading differences between Northern Ireland and Great Britain.\u0026nbspThe problem is that these are two irreconcilable agreements. They also impinge on the legally binding Good Friday agreement, which brought peace to Northern Ireland and in some senses pooled sovereignty of Northern Ireland giving people a birthright to be Irish or British or both.\u0026nbspIf the UK leaves the EU along with the customs union and the single market then the border in Ireland becomes the only land border between the UK and the EU forcing customs, tax and regulatory controls.\u0026nbspThe backstop is one of three options agreed by the EU and the UK in December and would only come into play if option A (overall agreement) or option B (a tailor-made solution) cannot be agreed by the end of transition. The Irish have likened it to an insurance policy.\u0026nbspThe new EU idea is to extend the transition period to allow time to get to option A or B.\u0026nbspBut an extension is problematic for Brexiters and leave voters, who want the UK to get out of the EU as soon as possible.\u0026nbspThe Irish and the EU will also still need the backstop in the withdrawal agreement, which must be signed before the business of the trade deal can get under way. Otherwise it is\u0026nbsp a no-deal Brexit.\u0026nbspExtending the transition into 2021 would mean another year of paying into the EU budget. Britain would have to negotiate this but it has been estimated at anywhere between £10bn and £17bn.\u0026nbspStaying in the EU for another year would also mean continued freedom of movement and being under the\u0026nbspEuropean court of justice, which Brexiters would oppose.\u0026nbsp“It is the answer that is staring the government in the face. If they backed it, it would command a majority in this house. It would avoid the mayhem and the chaos of no deal, and it would protect the jobs at Nissan, Airbus and elsewhere which are currently at grave risk. So can the minister explain why the minister is so dead against it?”A customs union on its own would not be enough, Lidington responded, saying it would not cover areas such as common regulatory standards for goods or the movement of food and livestock.Thornberry praised Lidington as the minister who understood Europe “better than any of his cabinet colleagues”, but said not even he had been able to properly explain the government’s plans.“The truth is there are no answers,” she said. “Plan A has been resoundingly rejected by parliament. Plan B was ruled out by the EU months ago, and the government is in danger of sleepwalking the country towards leaving with no plan and no deal at all.“So with just over 50 days to go, can I give the minister a final opportunity to tell us whether there is a better plan than this, or for goodness sake will he let parliament take charge instead?”Lidington said the answer lay in part with Labour. “If they are worried about no deal they have to vote for a deal, and every time they vote against a deal the risk of no deal becomes greater,” he said. “It really is time for the opposition frontbench, for once, to put the national interest first, do the right thing and vote for a deal.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/91a7c7c140696a0039866a7fa5b7eee31c0841bf/0_58_2108_1265/master/2108.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=79e02cc584892b59d660c7ee566fc6f8","title":"brexit latest news developments pmqs theresa may faces further backlash after backstop comments in belfast speech politics live","story":"Comments come as David Lidington and Emily Thornberry deputise for party leaders at PMQsI do genuinely feel that in 2019 the skies have darkened. I endorse absolutely everything that has been said about Brexit, about the way it hangs over the work that we do.The way in which it is getting in the way of our ability to focus the type of future we would like to create in our public services here in Wales. And the absolute imperative that a deal is struck so that we do not face the catastrophic impact that there would be here in Wales on leaving the European Union without a deal at all.That’s all from me for today.Thanks for the comments.This is from Sky’s Beth Rigby.Here is some more reaction from MPs to the Donald Tusk comment.From Nick Boles, the remain-voting ConservativeFrom Kate Hoey, the Brexiter Labour MPAnd this is from Arlene Foster, the DUP leaderResponding to the JunckerVaradkar press conference, Downing Street insisted the EU would have to give ground in order for a deal to be agreed. The prime minister’s spokesman said: Leo Varadkar said that they want the UK to leave with a deal, Donald Tusk said earlier today their priority is avoiding no deal.The fact is that the deal that was on the table has been rejected by 230 votes. So if, as they state, they wish for us to leave with a deal there are going to have to be changes made in order to address concerns which MPs have on the backstop.Here are the main points from the press conference given by Jean-Claude Juncker, the European commission president, and Leo Varadkar, the Irish prime minister.We cannot accept the idea, which is circulating around, that the withdrawal agreement could be re-opened. The backstop is part of the withdrawal agreement. We cannot re-open the discussion on the backstop ...So-called alternative arrangements can never replace the backstop. We need the bacsktop. We need the withdrawal agreement. And, when it comes to future relations, we can have a look into alternative arrangements. But they can never replace the backstop. There is no way to have unilateral jumping out of the backstop because the backstop is needed as a guarantee. A safety net is not a safety net if it can be destroyed by the unilateral action of one of the parties. But a unilateral withdrawal mechanism is only one of the two legal options that May is exploring as means of ensuring the UK does not get trapped in the backstop. The other is a time limit. Juncker did not explicitly rule out adding a time limit to the backstop, and some journalists think that might be significant.I do have a concern about this idea around alternative arrangements. We need to bear in mind that this majority that did exist in the House of Commons for “alternative arrangements” probably only existed because “alternative arrangements” can mean whatever you want whatever you want them to mean. I don’t believe that would have passed if people actually had to get into the detail of what alternatives might mean or might not mean.Sajid Javid, the home secretary, has declared Donald Tusk’s anti-Brexiter comment “out of order”.(Maybe it’s just me, but isn’t there something a bit dispiriting about the home secretary spouting demotic like a pub landlord? Even on Twitter, he could have put it a bit more eloquently.)Here is the quote from Jean-Claude Juncker on Donald Tusk’s “special place in hell” comment.The Commons has adjourned for the day. Today’s business was especially light. Apart from the usual (questions, adjournment debate etc), all MPs had to do was pass two social security motions.This might seem odd, given the Brexit crisis. But the government cannot bring any of its main Brexit legislation to the Commons until it knows whether or not there will be a deal and, if there is a deal, what it will entail.Varadkar said he will meet Theresa May for talks in Dublin on Friday night.Q: What did you make of Angela Merkel’s comments this week about the possibility of a deal if people are “creative”?Varadkar says he cannot interpret Merkel’s comments. But all politicians are creative.We have been creative all along. Perhaps it is for those who created this problem to be creative now."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fbe107be5453e7f8d17950fa1d22a2a2952bda33/221_236_5001_3001/master/5001.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0cd7fa11588b7c5761eae2d7a051b96b","title":"christian horner liberty media underestimated f1 red bull","story":"Christian Horner, Red Bull’s team principal, believes Formula One’s owner, Liberty Media, has seriously underestimated the challenge it faces in running the sport. Horner also questioned the company’s attempt to use a US-based approach to F1 and said he does not expect rule changes imposed for the new season to be effective.Liberty, a US-based media group, took over F1 in 2017 and has been clear in its intent to adapt the sport to increase its popularity. However, it inherited the current formula and commercial deals from the former CEO Bernie Ecclestone and real change has been slow in forthcoming. It is still facing the serious task of reaching a settlement with the teams for new regulations for 2021 alongside a new concorde agreement – the commercial contract with the teams and the FIA – for the same year, the complexities of all of which Horner believes it may have misjudged.“I think they absolutely under-estimated what they were taking on,” he said. “They probably thought there was some very low-hanging fruit and it has proved an awful lot harder than they thought. They remain determined and convinced that the potential of the sport to take it to the next level is there.”Liberty’s management of F1 was recently criticised by the Formula One Promoters’ Association and although Liberty and the FIA imposed new front-wing design rules for this season to try and improve overtaking, after a winter spent developing the new Red Bull Horner is not optimistic they will make a difference.“They will accept it was a mistake to rush through the front-wing change for this year,” he said. “They have cherry-picked something in isolation from a future concept and rushed it through on to the current car, but there is no silver bullet, so taking a front wing and saying it will make racing better is quite a naive and ultimately expensive approach.”Formula One’s chief executive officer, Chase Carey, formerly president of Rupert Murdoch’s News Corporation and current vice-chairman of 21st Century Fox, has expressed his desire to increase the exposure of F1 in the US, with more grands prix and to make race meetings like Super Bowl weekends. Horner, who alongside other team principals met with Liberty recently, is not convinced it was the right approach.“There is that constant comparison of American sport and franchises versus Formula One,” he said. “American sport works in America and it doesn’t work globally. Formula One has a different appeal. It is one of the biggest sports in the world and you can’t just apply a US-sports approach to something that has been established for 60 or 70 years as a global world championship.”Difficult negotiations with teams and promoters lie ahead, with proposals such as a budget cap and a fairer distribution of prize money still far from settled. Horner has been outspoken in the past that F1 needs to focus on presenting a better show and remains convinced that goal should be driving Liberty. “You can window-dress and promote a movie as much as you like, but if the film doesn’t have the substance or isn’t exciting, people won’t watch it,” he said. “Am I convinced they are the right people? Only time will tell. They will be judged on what Formula One becomes from 2021 onwards.”Looking to the new season, which begins in Australia on 17 March, Horner was bullish that his driver Max Verstappen will be able to challenge Lewis Hamilton and Sebastian Vettel for the title. “Max has evolved so much,” he said. “He is a much-more rounded inidual, through experience, and he has got all the tools and skill to take the fight to Lewis or Sebastian. I don’t think he lacks anything that they have if we provide him with the tools to do the job and he is probably is the driver that they fear the most.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/495ca49fc4dac8bde0c2604dcfa1686933d41f35/61_17_3358_2015/master/3358.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=41686c5ad4c429c5b17ce1896bc3b0be","title":"england st lucia first ever test cricket andrew flintoff pedalo","story":"Not for the first time England find themselves in a bit of a pickle in St Lucia. They have never played a Test here but they have been involved in two significant World Cup matches on the island with contrasting outcomes.In 2007 England were comfortably beaten by New Zealand by six wickets in their first 50-over game. Well, that happens and it is a match long since forgotten unlike the immediate aftermath of that defeat, which involved Freddie Flintoff, a pedalo and the subsequent headline “Prats of the Caribbean”.Flintoff had just led England’s Ashes expedition, losing the Test series 5-0, yet was a key member of the side that won the one-day series. He had been drinking excessively on that tour to the extent that Duncan Fletcher, head coach at the time, had to abandon one practice for fear of injuring his still-inebriated captain with another skier.In the West Indies, Flintoff was vice-captain to Michael Vaughan. In their first match of the tournament Flintoff had been dismissed first ball – though he had subsequently taken a brilliant catch and bowled a very economical spell. Afterwards his determination to stay in his room at Rodney Bay, where England are staying now, wilted.By 1.30am he was well lubricated and he subsequently revealed – to Piers Morgan on TV – that he then decided to get on a pedalo in search of the boat Ian Botham was staying on in order to share a nightcap with him. This ambitious plan did not work out quite as hoped and the following day a hungover Flintoff was hauled into a meeting by a furious Fletcher and then into a press conference for a public shaming.So England will prefer the current sort of crisis in which they find themselves in St Lucia, which stems only from bad play rather than bad behaviour. There is no need to recall the cricket director Ashley Giles, chief executive Tom Harrison or chief selector Ed Smith to the Caribbean to sort it all out since the problems are merely cricketing.Trevor Bayliss and Joe Root can deal with them. This should be of some comfort to the England setup, though there is an alternative view: this squad is as conscientious as they come they train with a dedication that occasionally verges upon obsession. They are not malingerers. And yet they are still playing so poorly.Back in 2007 the World Cup expedition was doomed, as Andrew Strauss recalled: “The negative publicity that surrounded that week with camera phone pictures being sold to the newspapers sounded the death knell for what was already a futile bid to win the World Cup. We performed pitifully in every respect throughout the tournament.”In 2010 the situation was rosier by some distance. England played the World T20 semi-final at what was then the Beausejour cricket ground – it has been renamed the Darren Sammy National Cricket Stadium in honour of St Lucia’s only Test cricketer, one of just three West Indies players born on the island – and they strolled to victory against Sri Lanka by six wickets. They went on to win the tournament in Barbados three days later after defeating Australia just as comfortably.Can this England squad take any solace from that? Before the tournament there was a problem at the top of the order, a familiar headache, and it was resolved rather brilliantly by tossing the wildcards, Michael Lumb and Craig Kieswetter together. And somehow this worked with Kevin Pietersen, the man of the tournament, batting superbly at No 3.If only it was so easy to resolve England’s current difficulties. In the short-form game it is possible to carpe the diem, to ride on the crest of a wave for three weeks and end up as world champions, which is what England managed so well in 2010. The demands of Test cricket are more rigorous there is so much more time for structural weaknesses to be revealed there is no hiding place. It is possible – just – that Rory Burns and Joe Denly will morph into a substantial opening pair but they will need more than a surge of momentum to do that.They will be assisted by the fact that the West Indies attack will be weaker in St Lucia because of the suspension of their captain, Jason Holder, a decision that makes the game look ridiculous. There are those who proclaim “them’s the rules”. Would they say the same to a motorist speeding towards a hospital with a sick child in the back seat? It’s all about context, or it should be, rather than a rigid application of the regulations. The match in Antigua finished on the third afternoon with more than two days to spare. If any spectators were short-changed it was because of the ineptitude of the England batsmen rather than the slowness of the West Indian over rate.We all prefer brisk over rates. But the simple truth is that in the vast majority of cases the days when overs are left unbowled have produced riveting cricket because of the comings and goings of batsmen on drab 260 for two days the over rate is usually more than acceptable.There are enough officials at a Test to distinguish between a deliberate slowing of over rates in an attempt to save a game and a fall in the rate as one side press for victory with pace bowlers. The latter might lead to a substantial fine, if necessary, the former to a suspension. It is not difficult for an old cricketer to make that judgment. Holder’s absence diminishes England’s first ever Test in St Lucia, a gross injustice at Gros Islet.

While the application was heard in private, such an adjournment is normally given for health reasons or in exceptional circumstances.Freeman, who faces a series of serious allegations including that he ordered banned testosterone for an unnamed rider while working for Team Sky and British Cycling, was not present when proceedings began in Manchester on Wednesday morning.However Freeman’s legal representative Mary O’Rourke, who acted for Dr Eva Carneiro in her claim for constructive dismissal against Chelsea Football Club, immediately requested an adjournment.After a two-and-a-half-hour delay the tribunal chairman, Stephen Mooney, granted the adjournment – and warned that it was likely that another one would be sought on Friday morning.“The reasons for the adjournment cannot be made public at this time,” he said. “But I can say this, there is likely to be a further application on Friday morning which will involve legal argument and it is very likely to be held in private as well.”Earlier Mooney had opened the tribunal by saying: “There are parts of this process which, on occasion, will be confidential. They could relate to an inidual’s health. This is such an application.”Responding to the news, a British Cycling spokesman said: “It is in the public interest and in the best interests of the sport that the allegations against Dr Richard Freeman are heard and examined by the Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service. We continue to support the General Medical Council’s work as historic questions need to be resolved.”Freeman is due to face an allegation that he ordered 30 sachets of Testogel, which is on the World Anti-Doping Agency’s prohibited list, in May 2011 to be sent to the Manchester velodrome to “administer to an athlete to improve their athletic performance”.The 57-year-old is also accused of lying to other members of British Cycling about ordering the drug, saying it was a mistake by the Oldham-based supplier Fit4Sport. Then, five months later in October 2011, he is alleged to have asked Fit4Sport “for written confirmation that the testosterone had been sent in error, returned and would be destroyed, knowing that this had not taken place”.It is said that when questioned by UK Anti-Doping in February 2017 Freeman changed his story to say that he had ordered Testogel for a non-athlete member of staff but later returned it. But it is alleged that he “made untrue statements” to Ukad when he made these claims, and that his conduct was “dishonest”.The 57-year-old, who denies any wrongdoing, is also alleged to have provided inappropriate treatment to non-riding staff aknd of haphazard record keeping."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fefb79b6f7268433c5857ff5fb855eb85eb8cf02/124_474_5185_3110/master/5185.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bd1371698f0bd7baedfdcaf04edb0f54","title":"france building rugby force england six nations","story":"Les Bleus have learned from their mistakes and the team of tomorrow could be forged at Twickenham on SundayIn the aftermath of France’s second-half implosion against Wales, there was an explosion of a lazy stereotype with “typically French” uttered loin et large across TV, radio and social media to explain away the national team’s performance.Having spent the past 18 months working in French rugby such pigeonholing sits uncomfortably. Surely no one can have been referring to an inability of French sportsmen and women to deliver when it matters? The current French football world champions, who won the most competitive, pressurised tournament in the world, might disagree they bottled it for a start. It does not apply in French rugby, either. The U20s won the most recent Junior World Cup and their U18s won the first Youth Olympics’ Sevens Gold medal. The national women’s XV side, meanwhile, are the reigning grand slam champions.So where can we find the reasons behind what happened in Paris? Before jumping straight to other over-simplified answers such as a lack of concentration or confidence, it is important to unpick this properly.A lack of control, which became apparent during the second half, was rooted in a lack of consistency in their preparation. I don’t mean the fortnight before. It started to happen in 2004 after the Kolpak ruling that French clubs pounced on and the erosion has been left unattended until recently.The success of the French age‑group sides has shown that when the FFR has a good level of control over its players they compete with the best consistently. Now, this might sound disingenuous but take away the Irish central contract system and the English elite player squad agreement and you might begin to show some sympathy to the current crop of players and coaches playing for France where the clubs have held sway.At first the influx of overseas players had no impact on Les Bleus but this could not last. The consequence has been national teams with a lack of experience, skill sets and trusted combinations as well as reduced levels of conditioning.At one point every Top 14 team were running their own version of fantasy football and talent ID was done with a chequebook. The structures that were being built in England around strength and conditioning, sports science and academies were not being replicated in France. Toulon were spending millions on players but their coaches were hatching plans in temporary buildings. Some overseas players such as Jonny Wilkinson added immense value some of the others appeared to do just enough to get their retirement plans in order.I know of world-class players who, if they had picked up a man of the match award on the Saturday, wouldn’t rock up until midweek at the club and no one seemed to care. Eventually this affected the national team. Conditioning was lamentable and by the time players got into national camp with very little preparation time – the staff at the FFR felt that they could only paper over the cracks – the players collectively didn’t have the foundations to cope with the intensity of workload required.Cue Bernard Laporte. His election as president of the FFR in late 2016 was built around making the leagues French again. The quota of French qualified players is being increased each year and league points will be deducted if teams fail to comply. Stronger relationships are being formed with clubs and the age‑group sides have an even greater onus on them.The national centre just south of Paris, Marcoussis, was nicknamed Marcatraz by the players as it felt remote and isolating. They have begun to address that with more fluid cycles of training, the use of GPS to allow players to do training sessions remotely while having their data tracked, and scrapping the residential all‑year programme they had at U19 age group and putting youngsters back into the clubs where they get more game time at “espoirs” level and build better relationships with the clubs.Marcoussis is a brilliant facility and one they now realise they don’t have to use 247 to get the best out of it. They have learned from their mistakes while creating a better pathway from club to country. France have the players, the resources and the know-how. Soon they will have the results, too.Where the youthful Romain Ntamack and Demba Bamba made their Six Nations debut last weekend, others such as Jordan Joseph, Cameron Woki and Pierre Louis Barrassi will soon follow. And while this Six Nations might come too soon for this French renaissance, they do love playing at Twickenham and if anything it will be a relief to play away from home at a stadium that has had more than the odd majestic French victory.They could cause more than a few problems if they can get the quick attacking ball they enjoyed in the first half against Wales with Louis Picamoles and Morgan Parra pulling the strings, and if England’s kicking game is not on the money then expect counter-attack – the back three won’t be afraid to have a crack.If anything else is needed to fire them up then the vocal criticism of the team by the French media this week will have done that, too. They have a few injury concerns but again – depending on how radical they want to be – selection could tilt towards youth and the beginnings of the team of tomorrow could yet be forged this Sunday in TW1.

Since it shows two people locked in sexual power games, it reminds one of Martin Crimp’s When We Have Sufficiently Tortured Each Other, currently at the Dorfman. I was reminded even more strongly of Sarah Kane’s Blasted in that a hotel room becomes a refuge from external cataclysm. It’s an odd, unsettling play, yet for all its parallels, this is clearly the work of an original writer.The form itself is striking: with 80 scenes in 75 minutes, Cougar offers a series of impressionistic snapshots. The relationship also reverses the usual roles. Leila, in her mid-40s, is an environmental expert who travels the globe lecturing CEOs on the profits to be made from sustainability. John is a barboy in his mid-20s who comes to her rescue during a violent row and ends up as her kept lover. Their life together is limited to luxury hotel rooms, but the growing crisis in their relationship is mirrored by escalating disasters in the outside world.Lewenstein writes perceptively about a hermetic affair in which money bestows power and in which John’s need for love is countered by Leila’s emotional impenetrability. I believed totally in the illicit thrill of their unequal relationship. However, in suggesting that we are all caught up in the spiral of short-term consumption, the play strains for effect. It was hard to credit that an ecological campaigner like Leila would be so casually dismissive about her carbon footprint.Although stronger on sex than social critique, the piece is played at breathless pace in Chelsea Walker’s co-production for English Touring Theatre and the Orange Tree, and Rosanna Vize’s design ends up memorably despoiled.The performances also have the right intensity. Charlotte Randle’s Leila combines the omnivorous authority of the moneyed with a hint of some inner vacancy, and Mike Noble as her peripatetic paramour mixes gaucheness with a growing assertiveness.They play off each other well and, even if you question the action after you’ve left the theatre, the immediate impact is both visceral and disturbing."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ecc40422a30287d4a8d686f646f2e612fe705e52/0_403_2487_1492/master/2487.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=797c27441c5de656d85b765816652f37","title":"ibsen oslo home the lady from the sea rehearsals","story":"The Lady From the Sea, a powerful drama about loss and longing, is being rehearsed at the very flat where Ibsen ended his years in exile. Our writer pops byOn Oslo’s Victoria Terrasse there’s a white door marked 108. Behind it was once an office in the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, but before that, late in the 19th century, these rooms were occupied by a figure who has done more for Norway’s reputation abroad than all of its foreign ministers put together.This was the apartment of Henrik Ibsen, generally regarded as the second-greatest playwright ever, and the second most-performed dramatist in the world. In both these criteria he is bested only by Shakespeare.Ibsen’s living quarters have now become a significant venue in his thriving theatrical afterlife. For a week in January, two of Norway’s leading classical actors – Kåre Conradi and Pia Tjelta – were rehearsing here with a cast of Norwegian and UK-based actors for a bilingual production of Ibsen’s 1888 play The Lady from the Sea, which premieres this week in London.This cross-country staging is produced by the Norwegian Ibsen Company, founded by Conradi. The actor got government permission to rehearse The Lady from the Sea in the dramatist’s old flat, and hopes in the future to stage productions in its rooms, and a courtyard below. The company also hopes to tour Ibsen around the world, much like the Royal Shakespeare Company, with this London run a declaration of intent.“Ibsen is Norwegian by birth but in spirit international,” says Conradi, showing me around the rooms. What was once the Ibsens’ kitchen is now a government broom cupboard.The dramatist lived above Victoria Terrasse from 1891-95, a period that represents much of his creative life in Norway. Ibsen had left his homeland in 1864, disgusted by its politics and cultural conservatism. He exiled himself for 27 years to Italy and Germany, during which his dim view of Norwegian taste seemed to be confirmed when Ghosts, which dared to use inherited venereal disease as a metaphor for the damage families inflict, was rubbished on publication. His plays appeared in book form first and were not performed in Oslo until years later.“When he finally came home, it was to this flat,” says Conradi. His reception from Norwegians, he adds, was “so ecstatic that he wrote a poem that includes the line, ‘Perhaps I should have come sooner.’”In Oslo, Conradi has the level of fame and admiration Ralph Fiennes might have in Britain. Conradi also gets stopped and selfied by tourists, since he starred in the Netflix Viking drama Norsemen, and played Jens Smit, a Dutch PR visionary, in W1A.At the the read-through in Ibsen’s old living rooms, Conradi, Tjelta and another Norwegian actor, Øystein Røger, sit alongside four British performers. The Norwegian director, Marit Moum Aune, has boldly cast young performers with minimal stage experience.Molly Windsor won a Bafta for Three Girls, about the Rotherham grooming scandal Edward Ashley is soon to appear with Timothée Chalamet in The King and Marina Bye has featured in movies including Breathe. Even the most theatre-experienced, Adrian Rawlins, has recently spent most of his time on screen, including playing Harry Potter’s father, James.The Lady from the Sea dramatises the marriage between Dr Wangel, a widowed GP, and Ellida, reluctant stepmother to Hilde and Bolette, daughters from his first marriage. In this production the Wangels – played by Rawlins, Windsor and Bye – are expats from England, drawn to the north-west coast of Norway by the doctor’s relationship with Ellida, the part taken by Tjelta.Ashley plays Lyngstrand, a local artist. Conradi is Arnholm, Bolette’s former tutor, who visits the troubled family, with Røger as the Stranger, a sailor and fugitive from justice, who may have been Ellida’s lover. The play is about the carnage caused by partings. Ellida is haunted by a lost child, a lost lover and her stepdaughters’ lost mother, and is forced to decide between two versions of her life.In this dual-language production, the Wangels mainly speak English to each other, while Ellida talks Norwegian to Arnholm. In London, the Norwegian will be subtitled on the rear wall. For realism, the anglophone members of the Wangel family have to be able to speak the native language to locals, and to Ellida. Because the Stranger appears only late in the play, Røger has been using rehearsal breaks to tutor the visitors.“They record me, and then go away to practise,” he says. “I show them how you form your mouth to get the Norwegian sounds, which are different.” The letter O, which has four differently accented versions in Norwegian, is generally longer and rounder than the English equivalent.In return, because the Stranger is said have spent a lot of time sailing transatlantic routes, Bye, who has an American mother, has been teaching Røger US vowels. Rawlins and Tjelta have also worked on the way in which bilingual partners switch languages. “Mixed-nationality couples,” says Tjelta, “will change in the middle of a sentence, or suddenly use single words from the other language.”One of the Oslo rehearsal days ends early, so that the cast and production team can take a late-afternoon ferry around four nearby islands. This is not recreation but research: true to its title, the work had a water birth.Michael Meyer, the influential English translator and biographer, explains in a preface to his version of The Lady from the Sea that when living in Italy Ibsen used to complain that the Mediterranean was not a “real sea”, pining for Norwegian harbours, lakes and fjords. In 1885, two decades into his exile, he came home for a brief holiday, seeking the sort of Norwegian water he remembered from a childhood in seaside Skien.The writer travelled to Molde, a town on Norway’s north-west coast (whose football club has just lent its manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjær, to Manchester United). Ibsen reportedly spent much of his time in Molde staring lovingly at fjords and out at the crashing Atlantic waves. Locals told him stories of a woman persuaded by a charismatic sailor to leave her husband, and of a husband, presumed drowned, who returned years later to find his wife remarried. From those anecdotes – and the surroundings – the playwright seems to have begun to conceive a drama about people confined and defined by the sea.Two years later, during another seaside break in the Danish resort of Sæby, on the Jutland coast, the 59-year-old Ibsen developed one of the crushes on much younger women that marked his later years. He formed an intense friendship with Engelke Wulff, a 19-year-old, whose dreams of escaping the small town for large achievements elsewhere seem clearly to have helped him develop Hilde and Bolette Wangel, the yearning teenage sisters in The Lady from the Sea.Another source was Agnete og Havmanden, an 18th-century Danish folk-ballad about a wife who is seduced by a merman, with whom she has a sub-aquatic family, and forced to choose between her wet and dry lives.I had hoped that one of the Norwegian members of the company might sing me Agnete’s song on the ferry, but none knew it. As we stand on the deck to watch the spectacular russet sunset, mummifying my face with a scarf to protect against the freezing sea fret, I remember that Tennessee Williams, whose plays were set in the American south, once told a London cast that his work made sense only if the cast and audience understood the effect on the characters of the searing daily heat. When an English actress asked Williams why the women were so “languid”, he explained that, in that climate, it could sometimes be a struggle to breathe or move.Contrastingly, it struck me on the ferry deck that the plays of Ibsen are clarified by an understanding of how dark and cold it is in Norway most of the time, and especially in the north of the country, where The Lady from the Sea takes place.Gesturing at the Oslo dusk, Røger tells me: “If we were in the north now, this is as light as it would ever get during the day. You can see a little light from the sun but you can’t see the sun.”Back on land, we walk through Oslo, past the National Theatre. Above its door are carved in stone the names of the first three dramatists staged there during the gala opening week in 1899: Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson, Ludvig Holberg and Ibsen. Although they were seen at the time as a theatrical holy trinity, two of them are rarely performed in Norway now, while the play that represented Ibsen at the premiere – An Enemy of the People – seems, in its depiction of an expert clashing with populist opinion, to become ever more politically topical. And revived in this London production 130 years after its opening night in Denmark, The Lady from the Sea still feels timely in its presentation of women’s choices.“Someone once asked me, ‘So you’re an Ibsen expert?’” says Aune, who has directed most of the major plays, and is about to revive her ballet of Ibsen’s Hedda Gabler in Oslo. “And I said, ‘No, I’m Ibsen-experienced.’ I don’t think you can ever become an expert on him. There’s so much to find.”• The Lady from the Sea is at Print Room at the Coronet, London, 8 February–9 March."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cb2dd3953ae0dfe85bfb729ce8e2afc80bb17ca5/0_1_5354_3211/master/5354.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f7d36dfdd5ee885101b6eca900d5ea39","title":"jennifer aniston cried lap inside story friends","story":"Friends is the world’s most streamed show – 25 years after it first began. We know what happened to the stars, but what about Fun Bobby, Jack Geller and the other characters?In May 1994, a then-unknown actor called Jennifer Aniston ran into a studio set made up to look like a Manhattan coffee house, and flopped on to a sofa. She wore a white wedding dress, her hair was wet from the rain, and she had just run out on her wedding. Around her, a group of relatively unknown actors – Matt LeBlanc, David Schwimmer, Lisa Kudrow, Matthew Perry and Courteney Cox – gawped. And so began the first episode of a sitcom about six friends, written by New York City playwrights David Crane and Marta Kauffman.Twenty-five years on, Friends is still one of the most successful television shows of all time. After it arrived on Netflix on New Year’s Day 2018, it became the most-streamed show on the internet. And, despite the fact that the final episode was broadcast in May 2004, long before the vast majority of them were born, it is the favourite TV programme of the UK’s five- to 16-year-olds.The show’s stars are now exceedingly famous and obscenely rich. By the final series, they were each being paid $1m an episode, making Aniston, Cox and Kudrow the highest-paid female TV actors of all time.But before Friends became a cultural phenomenon, before the “Which friend are you?” quizzes, the layered haircuts and the cries of: “We were on a break!” – and before the show became a trusted companion on hungover days spent in bed – Friends was just another television pilot being tested for NBC executives in the hope of being picked up.May 4, 1994: the Friends pilot is filmed on the Warner Bros lot in Burbank, California. In it, five friends – Monica Geller, Phoebe Buffay, Chandler Bing, Joey Tribbiani and Monica’s brother, Ross – are hanging out at their favourite coffee house when Rachel Green runs in. Ross has just separated from his wife, Carol, who has gone off with another woman. And Rachel has just stood up her fiance, Barry, at the altar and is in need of a place to stay. By the end of the episode, Rachel has moved in with Monica and started working at the coffee house.Mitchell Whitfield (Dr Barry Farber, Rachel’s orthodontist ex-fiance): It sounds a little egomaniacal to say that I’m the reason the show exists. But when you look at the pilot, with Rachel dumping me at the altar and coming in to meet everybody, that moment was the impetus for the show.Christina Pickles (Judy Geller, Ross’s and Monica’s mother): I knew Jennifer Aniston would be a huge success from the moment I saw her in rehearsals. But I didn’t know that the show would be. I’ve done so many pilots I thought were good that didn’t work, and so many that I thought were bad that did work. I just knew I was witnessing a really special actor at work.Mitchell Whitfield (Barry Farber): Back in the day, there used to be something called pilot season. Everyone wanted to test their pilots to see how audiences reacted to them. Actors would fly in from Chicago or New York and live in LA for the three months of pilot season, and audition every day, just hoping to get into one of those shows that would get picked up and made into a series. I got the script for Friends in the middle of the season. The second I read it, I called my agent and said: “We have to make this happen.”Vincent Ventresca (Fun Bobby, Monica’s on-off boyfriend in seasons one and two): I was so young and full of myself, and I’d just done a pilot for Fox’s new medical show. I thought I was the coolest person in the world. I was at home, and my agent said: “Hey, do you want to go and audition for this new show?” It was a really small part, so, of course, I’m whining like a little actor. But something inside me told me, just do it. So I went in and cried in front of Marta Kauffman, and she was like: “Great!”Directing the pilot is James Burrows, co-creator of Cheers.Elliott Gould (Jack Geller, Ross and Monica’s father): I wanted to work for Jim. I’d heard a lot about him: that he knew what he was doing, and he was smart. And he understood what was funny. At one point, I actually called casting because there were some people who said: “No, no, no. Friends is not enough money for you.” But I wanted to work and meet new people.Christina Pickles (Judy Geller): Burrows was instrumental in creating the atmosphere of Friends. He took the six leads to Vegas before they started working, and they all had a good time together. That was probably very helpful in cementing a sweetness about them.Casting for Friends takes months, and executive producers Kauffman and Crane, and fellow producer Kevin S Bright, see hundreds of hopefuls.Mitchell Whitfield (Barry Farber): I was brought in to audition for Ross and Chandler. I went back multiple times, and then they realised Ross was the role for me. I got down to the very end, and was testing for the show. At the last minute, they said: “We’re bringing in one more guy to read.” That guy turned out to be David Schwimmer.Mike Hagerty (Mr Treeger, the building superintendent): I knew Matt Perry socially a bit, years before. When he was a kid, he used to come into the Formosa bar on Santa Monica, which was a famous Hollywood hangout. I was a patron, and we’d chat. He was a really precocious kid – but very interesting. He’d done lots of pilots already, and was on the cusp of becoming a star.Cosimo Fusco (Paolo, Rachel’s Italian boyfriend in season one): They were all very normal. All of them had a great human side. They were very humble – and really trained. They’d spent years trying to get the right jobs.Christina Pickles (Judy Geller): At the beginning of Friends, Matt LeBlanc was anxious. Every time he did something, he would look for approval to the director, the producers or the writers if they were around. There would be a look of: “Am I doing this right?” He ended up being amazing. He was so perfect as Joey. He slowly built that character into a wonderful, real person.Mike Hagerty (Mr Treeger): Those kids were just ready to pop they were all good enough to have their own shows. And the casting people somehow put them together at the time, and they were all just ready to have something wonderful happen – and it did.After the pilot is taped, NBC orders a further 12 episodes.Cosimo Fusco (Paolo): When I taped my first episode, no one had seen it on TV yet. While we were filming, they announced the show had been commissioned for 12 episodes. Jennifer Aniston basically cried in my lap because nothing like that had ever happened to her before.Larry Hankin (Mr Heckles, Monica and Rachel’s irritable downstairs neighbour): I was there before it all started. I got there early and was watching rehearsals, and the show hadn’t been on the air yet, but I remember thinking: “These young actors are really talented.”Mitchell Whitfield (Barry Farber): There was this excitement. There was no ego on set. People had a sense of how good the project was.Jane Sibbett (Carol Willick): My son was born on 10 September 1994. The next day, my agent called and said: “Friends has come back around again they’ve let go of Anita Barone and would like you to take over the part tomorrow.” I said: “Wow, I’m kind of sore! I don’t think so.” But my agent said: “Jane, this is a huge offer. They’ve said they’ll go easy on you, and you can bring your nanny.” I said: “I don’t have a nanny! I’ve got my mom.” “So bring your mom!” So I sat down and nursed my son, and watched the pilot episode. And the moment I saw David Schwimmer do the longest take ever, I was hooked. I knew I had to work with him.Vincent Ventresca (Fun Bobby): I was starstruck by David Schwimmer. Of course, the girls were incredible and you sort of fell in love with them. But David was the one I desperately wanted to like me and he was the one most not interested in meeting anyone.Mitchell Whitfield (Barry Farber): Towards the end of the first season, I started getting people saying: “Oh, you’re that jerk on Friends.” That’s when I thought: “This thing is definitely starting to take off.”Friends airs on 22 September 1994. The initial critical response is lukewarm, but viewers like the show, and ratings are solid. By the end of the 1994-1995 season, Friends is the eighth most-watched show on air.Larry Hankin (Mr Heckles): I went home, and the show didn’t air for months, so I forgot about it. And then it came out, and it was a hit.Mike Hagerty (Mr Treeger): They weren’t stars when it all started. They were becoming very popular, and probably working on their contracts, but it wasn’t like you were walking into a room full of superstars. That came a bit later.Vincent Ventresca (Fun Bobby): I taped the first season, and there was a comic warming up the studio audience, and the energy was good. By the time we filmed the second year, it was like a circus. I remember metal detectors. The studio was packed with people. That was around the time that the Rolling Stone cover came out with all six of them – May 1995.Cosimo Fusco (Paolo): In season two, there was a change in everything. You’d notice it in the cars they would drive, or they’d talk about buying this or that. There was wealth coming in.Jane Sibbett (Carol Willick): Because I was part of the early days, they weren’t so private around me. But other guest stars would complain about how they didn’t have access to this or that area. They had to clamp down on security and be much tighter about who went up into the dressing rooms, and that kind of thing.Cosimo Fusco (Paolo): You know, someone’s life changes when they get a big paycheck. The money starts rolling in, and you’re obliged to spend it. They would be recognised and followed, and there would be paparazzi. It wasn’t easy for them to just have a coffee at the corner any more. But as people? They didn’t change. Not with me.Vincent Ventresca (Fun Bobby): The first season, they had a show that was doing pretty well on the air, and it looked like they were going to do more, but they weren’t the Beatles. And then they came back the second year, and they were the Beatles.By season three, the cast have made the decision to negotiate their contracts as a group, even though this means some members will take a pay cut. They continue negotiating as a group for the show’s entire run.Mike Hagerty (Mr Treeger): As a group, they decided it was time to get more of a share of the profits. It was quite a risk. They were putting it all on the line.Marlo Thomas (Sandra Green, Rachel’s mother): It’s unusual to do contracts together, and I think they set a standard for a lot of other shows to follow. When the network is negotiating against you, one at a time, things can become adversarial. But they all realised, to their benefit, that it took every single one of them to make the show that good.Jane Sibbett (Carol Willick): I was on the lot this one time. I’d just had lunch. And I came around the corner, and I see Jen, Lisa and Courteney. It had just rained, which is a rarity in LA, right? And they’re splashing in this puddle outside the sound stage. I was so struck by it because there was no one else around, and they were just falling around laughing with one another. That was the lightning in the bottle because they captured that joy of being friends, and that playfulness, and it was magic. The love this group had for one other was extraordinary.Christina Pickles (Judy Geller): They were a united group. They would watch each other’s work. If someone had a scene they weren’t in, the others would watch it and laugh. It’s very unusual to be so supportive of each other on set.Paget Brewster (Kathy, Joey and then Chandler’s girlfriend in season four): They would make fun of each other. If someone made a joke and it didn’t work, they’d all turn on the person and be like: “You blew it, Lisa!” They would bust each other’s balls. And they started adding this thing into the script that they did to each other in real life: one of them would be talking, and they’d all pretend to fall asleep.Vincent Ventresca (Fun Bobby): You’d do a pass of a scene. If the audience didn’t laugh, we’d huddle together and Matthew Perry would say: “What if we tried this?” And Matt LeBlanc would say: “Yeah!” And we’d break again and do the scene. It was like being at a football game.Paget Brewster (Kathy): Matthew Perry always had to have the last bit. If it was the end of the scene, he would consistently pitch something. They’d make fun of him for literally always wanting to have the last laugh.Christina Pickles (Judy Geller): Everything begins and ends with the writing. David and Marta didn’t write every show – they hired a lot of good writers – but they had the final say, and they had impeccable taste.Alexandra Holden (Elizabeth Stevens, Ross’s girlfriend in season six. She was one of his students, and Bruce Willis played her father): We’re in the cabin in one episode, and Ross and I are making out on the couch. He says: “I can’t stop thinking about your dad.” The writers stopped and said: “After he says that, why don’t you say: ‘Whatever works for you?’” We added the joke in at the last minute, and it was so funny. They could just come up with stuff like that on the spot.Christina Pickles (Judy Geller): David and Marta would come down from the office to watch the run-throughs, which was terrifying. They’d sit in a row of chairs, with the writers and NBC executives. And you could see they were thinking, and they’d give comments and then go back upstairs and change it all. David and Marta were the giant stars of the writing team.Jane Sibbett (Carol Willick): There was one joke we kept changing. We couldn’t get it right. It was the episode where Susan and I are celebrating our anniversary, and Ross comes over at an inopportune moment, and I had to telegraph to him that it isn’t a good time. So I removed a little pube from my tongue. That was the only time I pitched something that was really outrageous, and it actually got on air.With Friends’ increased popularity comes intense media scrutiny. But on set it’s business as usual.Aisha Tyler (Dr Charlie Wheeler, Joey and then Ross’s girlfriend): I remember walking into Monica’s apartment, and looking out of the window to see if I could see Ugly Naked Guy, but of course it’s just a hallway back there.Paget Brewster (Kathy): I was terrified of those guys. I hid in my room because they were so famous. It was the biggest show in the country.Aisha Tyler (Dr Charlie Wheeler): It was a very intimidating set to walk into. I think the cast had had some pretty notable experiences with guest actors coming in and struggling because of the pressure of having to be funny on the Friends set.Marlo Thomas (Sandra Green): It’s not always easy to walk into a show that has already been established and where everyone has their characters, and they’re a tight-knit family. Sometimes, it’s not roomy enough for a new person to come in. But they made it very roomy.Alexandra Holden (Elizabeth Stevens): I got called in to do a “chemistry read” with David Schwimmer. It was terrifying because the producers told me to come in looking “as hot as possible”. I didn’t know what to do with that information. It sent me into a tailspin. I stayed up all night trying to figure out what to wear … Now that I’m older, I wouldn’t be happy getting that message.By the time Friends wraps its final season in 2004, the lead actors have become some of the highest-paid TV stars of all time, earning $1m an episode.Mitchell Whitfield (Dr Barry Farber): My wife, she cringes a little bit because if I had ended up getting the part of Ross, I’d have made tens of millions of dollars. But I never think about that.Jane Sibbett (Carol Willick): I’m quite content. Obviously, I didn’t get paid the million-dollar paycheck, but I’ve had the best of Friends. I was able to raise my children and I got offered some really sweet projects.Cosimo Fusco (Paolo): I have a little bit of regret I feel like I could have capitalised more on the success of the show. I was having a orce, and was distracted by my personal life. I didn’t get a publicist, which I should have done.Mike Hagerty (Mr Treeger): People have a tendency to pigeonhole you a little bit, but it’s always good to have something that people can recognise you from.In the two and a half decades since Friends first aired, the show has been continually rerun. In recent years, critics have re-evaluated the show’s legacy, identifying problematic storylines and criticising Friends for its lack of ersity.Cosimo Fusco (Paolo): Today, one of the six would have to be black, of course.Aisha Tyler (Dr Charlie Wheeler): My character wasn’t written on the page to be a woman of colour, and I auditioned against a lot of other women of different ethnic backgrounds, so I like to think they picked me because I was the right person for the role. But I knew it was something new for the show, and it was really important because, the fact of the matter was, it was a show set in Manhattan that was almost entirely Caucasian. It was an unrealistic representation of what the real world looked like.Cosimo Fusco (Paolo): There was one scene where I was getting a massage, and I had to be this greasy guy who was touching Phoebe’s ass. I had a problem with how it portrayed me, as if guys from Italy are like that. What they wanted me to do was quite disrespectful. But I remember we were able to find a compromise, so I felt comfortable.Paget Brewster (Kathy): It’s so bizarre to compare the show at that time to what’s happening now on social media. No one can do anything right, ever. That’s basically where we are. Everything is people being questioned or attacked. Yeah, if you look at the world today, and you look at Friends, you go: “Oh, wow, there were gay jokes and they don’t have friends of colour.” But that’s what it was then.In 2018, Netflix acquired the rights to Friends in a $100m deal. Thanks to streaming, the show has become known to a new, younger audience.Vincent Ventresca (Fun Bobby): As an actor, you want to be a part of something: your work will be here when you’re gone. And you get an insight into that when a show that is 25 years old gets reissued on Netflix, and a whole new audience discovers it.Alexandra Holden (Elizabeth Stevens): My 12-year-old niece just asked me for a T-shirt with “Central Perk” on it. That’s so bizarre to me. She wasn’t even alive when I worked on the show.Christina Pickles (Judy Geller): Kids come up to me and recite the script.Paget Brewster (Kathy): People in their 20s recognise my voice. They turn around in supermarkets and say: “You’re Kathy!”Mitchell Whitfield (Dr Barry Farber): “Dude, what was it like? You got to kiss Jennifer Aniston!”Elliott Gould (Jack Geller): I met Taylor Swift, and she said: “I know you! I’m a Friends freak! You’re Mr Geller.”Cosimo Fusco (Paolo): I can work in the most exquisite film, but the minute people find out I was Paolo, they’re like: “Oh my God!”Now, 25 years since the show first aired, Friends is the most-streamed show in the UK, and perhaps even the most beloved TV show of all time.Paget Brewster (Kathy): A show like Friends was one in a million. Normally a pilot doesn’t go, or it goes and you shoot three episodes, or you make a year and it’s gone.Aisha Tyler (Dr Charlie Wheeler): There have been other shows that have advanced that concept of friends as chosen family, but Friends was just a perfect encapsulation of that idea.Marlo Thomas (Sandra Green): They’re independent, their parents aren’t telling them what to do, they’re making their own decisions, they’re making their own mistakes – and they’re succeeding at it! That’s aspirational for young people to see.Alexandra Holden (Elizabeth Stevens): Television was a very different thing back then. I don’t know if there will ever be another show as successful as Friends. I feel like there’s too much content out there now, and too much variety.Vincent Ventresca (Fun Bobby): I was so young. I was 27. I don’t remember feeling young then, but now it’s like looking back in time. But I love looking back at it. It’s a good memory, and it’s a reminder that time is passing. Not a lot of people get to look at where they were half their lifetime ago.Alexandra Holden (Elizabeth Stevens): It feels like a different life. When I watch Friends now, I think: “Was I really there? Did that really happen? Was I really part of this thing that’s become such a huge influence all these years later?” It’s kind of surreal.Marlo Thomas (Sandra Green): Everything you do is part of the tapestry of your career, and your life. Every little thread gets pulled in some way. And the Sandra Green thread is certainly a colour in my tapestry that people remember and have some affection for, as do I.Vincent Ventresca (Fun Bobby): When someone comes up to you and says: “Hey, you were good on Friends,” it connects you with them in a way. You were part of a thing that meant something to them, and that means something to me. It makes you feel like: “Maybe you didn’t really waste your life.”Elliott Gould (Jack Geller): I saw Matt LeBlanc at the studio recently, and we embraced. Without being pretentious, we’re all a part of each other.Vincent Ventresca (Fun Bobby): Things don’t change as much as you think they do. What’s important to us: friendship, family, community and laughing at silly situations. That’s what Friends is all about. And that’s timeless."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/73b8bea5617554aea0944aea0cb5f711545c8d94/0_262_2965_1778/master/2965.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b2675730f3b16c3deb6ad1504a8f2371","title":"spoiler alert ross and rachel date teens on why they love friends","story":"The Central Perk gang are still a hit with under 18s. Young readers reveal why they adore it – from the sarcasm to the timeless love stories ... and Fat MonicaA new survey into teenage media habits done by Childwise shows that the New York-based comedy is the favourite TV show of viewers aged five to 16 in the UK. It’s a remarkable statistic, given that the majority of those surveyed would not even have been born when the series ended in 2004. We asked you to tell us why you love Friends. Here’s what some of you said:It gives us all hope that everything will work out. In real life, friendships don’t happen like they do in Friends and neither do relationships, but I think everyone who watches it wishes they did. I also think people love the idea of always having someone to talk to and share things with.My favourite character is Chandler. I think he is underplayed: many people like Joey and Phoebe because they are seen to get all the best lines, but Chandler has a different type of humour – one that I appreciate! His relationship with Monica is perfect, too, and they balance each other out.My favourite episode has to be The One with Five Steaks and an Eggplant. It’s a bit of an odd choice as the gang are at ends with each other, but I love how they do everything they can to work things out. This is really rare nowadays, when a tiny disagreement can end friendships. Molly, 15, HertfordshireI watch Friends almost every day and when I finish the 10th season I rewatch it. I find out a lot of things about life from the show. I like being treated like an adult when I hear people talking about it and I can join in. I have only been allowed to watch it since May as I’m nearly 12.I don’t have a favourite character – I have a list. My top favourite is Fat Monica. Second is Rachel and third is Chandler. Chandler is funny because he’s sarcastic and I like sarcasm.I like all the flashback episodes, but my favourite is where Rachel and Monica watch the Thanksgiving tape and see Ross about to take Rachel to prom. Leah, 11, EnfieldFriends is relatable to nearly every person, as well as being funny. It involves scenarios people my age are starting to go through, but instead of taking them seriously, it manages to make a joke of every single one. It’s based on everyday lives, and most people can relate to one of the characters. My favourite character? That’s a tough one. I’d have to go with Phoebe, because of how she deals with everything that comes her way. She gets herself into situations that are just hilarious.There are too many good episodes to choose from, however one of the best would be The One with Chandler and Monica’s Wedding: Part 2, when Rachel’s pregnancy is revealed to Monica and Phoebe. When Phoebe finds the pregnancy test she assumes it is Monica’s. When Phoebe realises that it is in fact Rachel’s, instead of revealing it, she says she is the one who is pregnant with James Brolin’s child and that she needs to call and let him know! Sam, 16, LeicesterI love Friends because it’s one of the first series (in another language) I ever watched. When I watch episodes again, it’s like going back to my comfort zone.If I had to choose a favourite episode it would be the one when Phoebe and Ross discover that Monica and Chandler have been going out. It’s SO funny … but I think I watched it too many times. Sol, 16, Rosario, ArgentinaFriends has surprisingly been a conservation-starter with a few of my friends. It’s like the glue that sticks us together. Plus, the show stands as the epitome of how friendship should be. Whenever I watch Friends, I fantasise about a friendship circle I would like to have. The silly jokes and the awkwardness between the characters are bonuses.My stand-out character is Phoebe because she is silly but smart and knowledgeable. For a person who you might think would have anger bottled up, she seems pretty calm. She takes control of her own life and she is not abashed about what she does and what she thinks. Hal, 17, IndiaFriends handles issues such as orce, unemployment and unrequited love in an excellently comedic way. It perfectly captures sibling rivalry between Ross and Monica that is surprisingly relatable. It looks at the difference of class and intellect between the friends and you get to know each one personally until you realise there is more to them than meets the eye.My favourite character has to be Chandler. His witty lines, physical comedy and mannerisms just turn him into a super lovable character. Also he’s kinda fit (good looking)! I think everyone has parts of all the characters in them, no matter how much you try not to. (Ross is my least favourite character. He’s so ANNOYING).All the episodes are really funny! If I had to choose a favourite, it would either be the one where Chandler hooks up with one of Joey’s sisters but can’t remember which one, or (spoiler alert) the one where Ross and Rachel finally start dating.

Start at the officeA few years ago, James Levine, a doctor of endo­crinology at the Mayo Clinic, sparked a radical change in America’s office furniture. His research had inspired a pile of viral stories cataloging the negative effects of sitting at a desk: leg muscles shut down, blood pressure increases, good cholesterol plummets, your children starve. OK, I made up that last one, but the real takeaway was no less dire. “Excessive sitting is a lethal activity,” Levine, who has studied sedentary behavior for nearly 20 years and is the most widely quoted expert on the topic, told the New York Times in 2011. And the solution – at least the one people heard – was to start standing.Cue the office makeovers. Over the next several years, workers all across America embraced stand-up desks. At Outside’s headquarters in Santa Fe, New Mexico, our building manager furiously reconfigured work spaces. Desks were removed from their shelving brackets, raised a foot and a half, and remounted. Walking the hallways, I’d do double takes every time I realized that another editor had taken a stand against sitting. Close to half our offices were eventually con­verted. Good science had spurred a small change that was dramatically improving our health. We were literally rising from the dead!Or were we? The stand-up revolution was followed by another wave of stories reporting that being on your feet in the same place all day has its own downsides, including increased risk of cardiovascular problems. What’s more, at least at Outside, few people’s habits really changed. This morning, I took a tour around our building to assess our commitment to stand-up desks. In 14 of the converted spaces, editors were either hunched over on stools or perched on chairs that they had elevated to meet the new level. They were still sitting, only higher. In a half-dozen other cases, people had simply lowered their desks back to their old positions.When I called Levine and told him what had happened at Outside, he let out the sigh of a man who’d heard all this before. “It’s not the furniture that makes the difference, it’s the behavior,” he said. “The desk without the behavior doesn’t help you.”In other words, we missed the larger point that Levine and his colleagues were trying to convey. The solution to sitting isn’t to stand, though it helps. In fact, according to the findings of a 2015 consensus panel on the topic, we need to be on our feet two to four hours while at work. But the real solution is to move. All day. The stillness is what’s killing us. We should be pacing the hallways and climbing stairs and squatting and lunging and stretching.Now that requires a radical change, one exponentially more difficult than putting your desk on stilts. But aiming for more movement might also be the most important habit you adopt from an issue of Outside packed with 72 pages of fitness advice. This is especially true if, like me, you exercise vigorously each day and therefore consider yourself healthy. Researchers have shattered that idea. I might run for an hour every weekday morning, but studies show that if I then go to work and sit at my desk for epic stretches, which I do, I am no more immune to the side effects of sedentary living than the prototypical couch potato.When I accepted this scary conclusion, I realized how difficult moving really is. I’m not like my ancestors who worked on a farm where motion was an all-day requirement. My job seems specifically designed to keep me wasting away in a chair. A phone and a computer allow me to communicate and conduct business with nearly any writer on earth without leaving a two-foot radius.Still, I was determined to be the guy who changed his behavior. (Writing this article was a great motivator.) It didn’t go so well at first. I arrived at work determined to move more, but once I sat at my desk, old habits glued me to the computer and I forgot all about my intentions. So I placed a sticky note on my office door that said FARTHER, a little prompt reminding me to use the facility most distant from me every time I needed a drink of water or bathroom break. I also connected my computer to the printer downstairs and across the building. And rather than sending ­e-mails or using the phone, I tried to go directly to colleagues’ offices.Once I had those tricks nailed, I got some digital help. There are dozens of fitness wearables that can remind you to move, from the basic step counter to the fully loaded Apple Watch. Instead, I went with a free phone app called Move. It buzzes every 45 minutes and assigns me a random exercise: say, 20 body-weight squats or 15 push-ups. These alerts initially drove me crazy. (Again?!) And their commands can be cloyingly phrased: “It’s time to move it, move it.” But eventually I welcomed the interruptions. I noticed that I felt refreshed when I returned to my desk, like I’d rebooted my clogged circuitry.And the embarrassment? I haven’t exactly been a bold office revolutionary. Instead, I’ve meekly learned to be a stealth mover. Now I either find ways to look like I’m doing something perfectly normal or I make sure I don’t get caught. I do push-ups with an ear cocked toward the door, listening for approaching footsteps. I do wall sits in a corner that no one can see from the hallway. While I’m on the phone, I pace as if I’m carefully deliberating vital magazine business. At my desk, I do inconspicuous yoga poses with names like seated eagle and hip opener. I do laps around the building carrying papers to look as if I’m going somewhere, when all I’m really doing is walking in a large, 223-step circle back to my office.

Any con­clu­sions I draw from my exper­iment would be based on anec­dotal evidence, the enemy of real research. But here’s what’s certain: if I continue to squeeze in an extra hour or two of movement each day, I’ll be significantly healthier in the long run.

Only 20 to 30 of more than a thousand safety deposit boxes held by the bank had been emptied by the time police arrived to find bars of gold left on the vault’s floor.The gang, two of whom were said to have spoken in broken English, had leased the basement flat from where they dug their first tunnel under the name Mark Buchman. Police found a pile of bags of sand in the bedroom.The bank is on the edge of a square mile that is the largest diamond district in the world, boasting an annual turnover of £42bn. It was the scene of the “heist of the century” in 2003, when more than £75m in jewels was stolen from a vault."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8531808c87cb4eb53be54ca6fc81efccddc48791/0_85_640_384/master/640.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=54b46408977c72b8652e688f1e36a4a4","title":"friends of uk football fan detained in uae call for his release qatar","story":"Official denies British tourist Ali Issa Ahmad was arrested for wearing Qatar shirtFriends of the British football fan arrested and detained in the United Arab Emirates have called on the Gulf state’s government to allow him to return home safely to the UK after officials suggested he beat himself up.They are appealing to the Foreign Office to advocate for the freedom of Ali Issa Ahmad, 26, an Arsenal supporter from Wolverhampton, through diplomatic channels.Ahmad travelled to the UAE for a holiday in January. While he was there he got a ticket for an Asian Cup match between Qatar and Iraq on 22 January. The tournament took place in the UAE between 5 January and 1 February and was won by Qatar.He wore a Qatar shirt to the match unaware that doing anything that could be interpreted as promoting Qatar in the UAE is an offence punishable with a large fine and an extended period of imprisonment.He was later arrested and detained by the UAE authorities. He was allowed to make one phone call and in a distressed state contacted a British friend Amer Lokie.He told Lokie he had been arrested and beaten following the match and accused of promoting Qatar by wearing a football shirt bearing the Qatar logo. He said that when he went to report the assault he was held over claims that he had made false allegations about security officials.Initially, the UAE embassy told the  it was investigating the circumstances of the arrest. But after other media picked up the story it issued a further statement saying that Ahmad went to the police station in the emirate of Sharjah last month claiming he had been harassed and beaten up by UAE national football fans for cheering the Qatar team at the Asian Cup.A UAE official said: “The police took him to hospital where a doctor who examined him, concluded that his injuries were inconsistent with his account of events and appeared to be self-inflicted. On 24 January 2019 Mr Ahmed was charged with wasting police time and making false statements. We are advised that he has since admitted those offences and will now be processed through the UAE courts.”The official added: “He was categorically not arrested for wearing a Qatar football shirt. This is instead an instance of a person seeking media attention and wasting police time.”Lokie said: “There is no way that Ali would have beaten himself up and then gone to the police station seeking media attention. When I spoke to him on the phone he sounded in a bad state and he was asking us to get him released, out of UAE and safely back to the UK. We are trying to raise the profile of his case in the hope that it will lead to his release and safe return to the UK.”The FCO website in its section containing information for travellers to the UAE warns: “The UAE authorities announced on 7 June 2017 that showing sympathy for Qatar on social media or by any other means of communication is an offence. Offenders could be imprisoned and subject to a substantial fine.”The sanctions for “promoting” Qatar are linked to the breaking off of diplomatic relations between the two countries in May 2017. The UAE accused Qatar of undermining security and stability in the region by funding and hosting terrorist groups.An FCO spokesperson said: “We are providing assistance to a British man arrested in the UAE and are in touch with the local authorities.”David Haigh a former managing director of Leeds United FC and founder of campaigning group Detained International, who was himself detained in UAE, called on the foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, and FCO officials to “act fast and tough”. “The Dubai jails are a cesspit of torture, injustice, discrimination and abuse,” he said.Radha Stirling of the campaign group Detained in Dubai said: “Because of the limited communication allowed by the UAE to those in custody, the exact details of what happened to Ali Issa Ahmad remain vague … What we know is that the UAE does prosecute anyone who expresses sympathy for Qatar in any way.”She added that if Ahmad had been forced to recant the allegations he made to the police and was now being punished for having reported them in the first place, it was “extremely concerning”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4f612fb2648462f31eb254b74b8eab25459ead43/0_97_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8c1bbba5301a75c791021becf244e6df","title":"italys deputy pm luigi di maio meets senior gilets jaunes figure","story":"Five Star Movement leader’s meeting in Paris is likely to increase tensions with France Luigi Di Maio, the Italian deputy prime minister and leader of the anti-establishment Five Star Movement (M5S), has met a senior figure from the gilets jaunes (yellow vests) movement – a meeting slammed as an unacceptable provocation by the French foreign ministry.Di Maio and Alessandro Di Battista, a prominent M5S member, met Christophe Chalençon, as well as candidates the protest movement has put forward for the European elections in May, on the outskirts of Paris on Tuesday. Posting a photo of the group on Facebook, Di Maio described it as a “beautiful” meeting.“The wind of change has crossed the Alps. I repeat. The wind of change has crossed the Alps,” he wrote.“This new provocation is not acceptable between neighbouring countries and partners in the European Union,” a French foreign ministry spokesman responded in a daily online briefing. “Mr Di Maio, who holds government responsibilities, must take care not to undermine, through his repeated interferences, our bilateral relations, in the interest of both France and Italy.”Di Maio had previously expressed his admiration for the gilets jaunes, who have been holding at times violent anti-government protests each week across France for the past few months. He urged the movement not to “give up” and said the demonstrations reminded him of the spirit that gave birth to the M5S in 2009.On Tuesday he said the two groups shared “many common positions and values that focus on the battles for citizens, social rights, direct democracy and the environment”.Chalençon said while both sides “practically agree on everything”, there was no talk yet about whether they would form an alliance for the elections to the European parliament. Italian media reported that Ingrid Levavasseur, who heads the gilets jaunes’ list of 10 candidates for the elections, would meet M5S officials again in Rome next week.The meeting follows a series of verbal attacks from Di Maio and his co-deputy prime minister, Matteo Salvini, on the French president, Emmanuel Macron, in recent weeks and is also seen as an additional tactic by M5S to regain some of the popularity lost to Salvini’s far-right League since the coalition government came to power last June.“M5S is weak right now,” said Massimiliano Panarari, a politics professor at Luiss University in Rome. “They are losing traction in their traditionally antagonistic contingencies and they need to find every antagonistic issue to demonstrate that they are strong. Macron is also the perfect target for populist movements.”Panarari said the meeting with the gilets jaunes was also a way to tell Italian voters that M5S still had its “anti-establishment soul”, as well as to attract similar groups with whom they might be able to build a coalition after the EU elections.M5S launched its European election campaign in January, with Di Maio and Di Battista travelling to the European parliament in Strasbourg and denouncing the institution as a “waste of money”. At the time, Di Maio said he was preparing an election manifesto with other European populist groups.Opinion polls in France have suggested that the main impact of one or more gilets jaunes candidates standing in the European elections would be to reduce support for the far-right party of Marine Le Pen and the far left, led by Jean-Luc Mélenchon.“A gilets jaunes party would likely mobilise people who do not usually vote, but also take votes from the National Rally and France Unbowed,” Emmanuel Rivière of he pollsters Kantar Public France told Le Monde. “Paradoxically, the principal beneficiary would be the party of the president.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/73d5cf89660c2a844e4fab5edb26be62a12ecece/0_139_3102_1861/master/3102.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=38f3e2beb90ff1c2f22ef6fa5c1ee886","title":"taliban say they have no plans to seize afghanistan by force","story":"Insurgents attend landmark Moscow peace talks, but Afghan president is excludedA senior Taliban official has said the insurgent group has no plans to seize the whole of Afghanistan by military force, speaking at peace talks in Moscow that have brought together many of the country’s powerbrokers.Sher Mohammad Abbas Stanikzai, who has led the group’s negotiating team, told the BBC that a push for total military domination “will not bring peace to Afghanistan”.He spoke as Donald Trump signalled greater determination to end the US military presence there after more than 17 years, which has made Afghanistan America’s longest war. “Great nations do not fight endless wars,” he said in his State of the Union speech on Tuesday.The Moscow meeting comes after US and Taliban negotiators spent six days last month hammering out a framework draft of a peace deal in Qatar.The Taliban refuse to meet the Afghan government, which they denounce as a puppet government, and the latest rounds of talks have left the Afghan president, Ashraf Ghani, uncomfortably isolated.The delegation around the table in Moscow included some of Afghanistan’s most wealthy and influential men, warlords and others who wielded power in civilian governments. Several had formed part of Ghani’s own government until recently.There were only two women, who called for women’s rights to be at the heart of any settlement and protected by the international community.Leading the delegation was the former president Hamid Karzai, who is still a formidable powerbroker. He shrugged off charges of hypocrisy to attend as president himself, he had denounced any efforts to talk to the Taliban that excluded his own government.Other attendees included Hanif Atmar, until recently Ghani’s national security adviser, and Atta Muhammad Noor, one of the most influential men in northern Afghanistan.Ghani denounced his exclusion in an angry interview on Afghanistan’s Tolo TV channel. “At the end of any peace deal, the decision-maker will be the government of Afghanistan,” Ghani said. “Rest assured that no one can push us aside.”After Trump’s speech, he also called the US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, apparently trying to wrest back control of the political narrative. He said on Twitter that Pompeo underscored “the centrality of the Afghan government in the peace process”, and reiterated US support for presidential elections set for July.There is speculation that any peace deal could include a delay in the elections, or some kind of interim government.The Moscow talks are officially being organised by members of the Afghan diaspora. But there is little question of official support, not least because the Taliban delegation given visas to travel are all still on a terrorism watchlist. The meeting was held at a Kremlin-owned hotel."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3184486453202a4724643187ef6478676f258b5e/0_204_4674_2804/master/4674.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=65ab2742110cda0eb717fe8001ce187e","title":"venezuela faes special forces nicolas maduro barrios","story":"Activists suspect Nicolás Maduro has tasked Faes with pacifying the city’s barrios in bid to snuff out protest in areas once considered the cradle of ChavismoA flickering candle and 19 rose petals – one for every year he lived – adorn a shrine in what used to be the home of Alixon Pisani.“We love you,” reads a note beside a black and white photograph of the recently killed teen.It was 10pm on the night of 22 January when friends arrived outside with the news that Pisani was dead gunned down as he demonstrated against Nicolás Maduro’s teetering regime in Catia, a traditionally working-class area of western Caracas.“He was still just a boy,” said the woman who raised him, his aunt, Nivea Pisani.“They are murderers … demons,” she said of her nephew’s killers. “He just went out to protest because we are going hungry. How many more will die if we carry on like this?”Pisani, an unemployed 45-year-old, is still waiting for an official explanation about who shot her nephew and why. His death certificate states he died from a firearm injury but offers no hint of the weapon used – or the motive.But she believes his killers were from Faes, a shadowy and fearsome special forces unit activists suspect Maduro has tasked with pacifying the city’s impoverished redbrick barrios in a bid to snuff out protest in areas once considered the cradle of Chavismo.“The poor areas are where most people live – and since we don’t support them any more I guess they want to kill us all,” said Pisani, who says witnesses told her Faes agents arrived at the protest shortly before her nephew was shot in the arm and chest.Hugo Chávez first took office in January 1999 – just a few months before Alixon Pisani was born – vowing to blaze a Boilvarian trail for Venezuela’s long-forgotten poor.In his first post-election speech, the comandante promised he would not rest while there were still children in the streets and families going hungry. “Today a new battle starts for the salvation of Venezuela,” Chávez said.In the early years of Chavismo, its leader won global accolades and a cult following for his crusade to help Venezuela’s poor. Social projects known as misiones brought healthcare and education to millions of disenfranchised citizens.But two decades after Chávez’s rise to power, Venezuela is on its knees, and many who were once loyalists have lost faith in his successor. And, increasingly, they are taking to the streets to demand change.“We’ve never had protests here in Catia – this is new,” said Pisani, attributing the shift to the country’s economic and social collapse under Chávez’s heir.“Before, I’d open my fridge and see ham, cheese, eggs, meat, chicken. These days there’s nothing but water – and sometimes we don’t even have that. It’s insanity – we never thought we’d be living like this,” she said.The day he died, Alixon Pisani – who worked in a local bakery – had gone out to protest the “beggary” into which their oil-rich nation has been plunged. “It’s as if there is no government in this country,” Pisani complained. “How can you not go out to protest?”Across town, in a sprawling eastern neighbourhood called José Félix Ribas, Venezuela’s special forces have also made their deadly presence felt in an apparent bid to crush dissent.“It’s the first time they’ve attacked with so much force,” said one local woman, too scared to be named, as she and other residents described a series of war-like operations in the days after opposition leader Juan Guaidó sparked the current political crisis by declaring himself Venezuela’s rightful president on 23 January.A second woman recalled balaclava-wearing, rifle-toting troops swarming into the labyrinthine community like an army of “little black ants”, kicking down doors and shooting.“We heard the bangs: tacka-tacka-tacka-tacka-tacka. It was horrible,” said the woman, whose home was stormed.“Even the Chavistas around here don’t agree with Nicolás Maduro,” said her 18-year-old son, who described narrowly escaping death during one operation, sprinting over rooftops and down alleys as the agents opened fire.The teenager, who now sleeps in another part of Caracas for fear of being killed, agreed the repression was designed to dissuade the urban poor from leaving their hilltop homes to join the revolt. “If the barrio goes down it will be like a nuclear bomb.”Things were not always thus, a group of locals explained as they sat around a wooden table in a kitchen equipped with nothing but a broken stove and an almost bare pantry.“Chávez would go into the barrios, into any house, and whichever house Chávez went into they’d say: ‘Have a little cup of coffee, my presidente,’” said the 18-year-old. “They adored him. They loved him.”And what if Maduro came calling today?“I’d hit him with a chair,” he replied.“We’d keep him here for a week eating what we have to eat – lentils and beans – to see if he liked it,” his mother chuckled sarcastically.“Without any salt,” chipped in a third woman.Faes – the special action force – has earned notoriety since the uprising against Maduro began last month. Graffiti artists have daubed Caracas’ walls with messages denouncing its operatives as “murderers of the people”.But little is known about the elite group’s inner workings or even who exactly commands it. In a recent report, the Venezuelan human rights group Provea said Faes was created by Maduro in 2017 to fight “organized crime and terrorism” and was part of Venezuela’s national police force, although some stories in state-run media outlets describe it as being under the command of the Venezuelan military. By last year it boasted almost 1,300 agents.In a recent post on its Instagram account the group said its role was to “guarantee security, tranquility and peace” for all Venezuelans.But activists say it has taken on an explicitly political role since the most severe challenge to Maduro’s rule erupted last month.In one Instagram video, a Faes commander urges troops to show “absolute loyalty to Maduro” given the “extremely difficult moments” his administration was facing. “As soldiers who are faithful to the revolution, let’s go for it, let’s really go for it – without hesitation,” he says.Provea’s coordinator, Rafael Uzcátegui, said: “What the government is trying to do is contain the discontent, to contain the anger – not by addressing the citizens’ concerns but by instilling terror and fear.”Uzcátegui said his group had counted 43 killings linked to the protests. It had not been possible to identify the perpetrators of each death but he believed Faes was the number one culprit, followed by the pro-government paramilitary groups known as colectivos. Faes’ role appeared to be “neutralizing the greatest possible number of people”, not bringing criminals to justice.Asked about alleged Faes killings on Venezuelan television last week, the attorney general, Tarek William Saab, said the criminal responsibility for such acts was “inidual. Those who commit violations ... will be prosecuted, whichever part of the police they are from.”On Monday, as she prepared for the last of nine evenings of mourning, Pisani said she felt uneasy about the prospect of foreign military intervention to unseat Maduro, but was adamant he had to step down.“I want him to go. He must realize this country is a disaster,” she said.Most of all, though, she wanted answers about the masked gunmen who had condemned her nephew to an unmarked concrete grave.“Why did they kill him? What for?” she asked. “His life had hardly even begun.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e9bb7caff362af4cb96195c6848c5ed7aaea3dd8/60_0_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=811fe9d5de7f84bb9ab8d4ff1f20cb9c","title":"tell us about the issues men face today","story":"From mental health to relationships, we’d like to hear from men of all ages about what they are really thinkingThe debate around modern-day masculinity has intensified in the wake of the #MeToo movement, and we are asking men to tell us what they are really thinking.As the role of men and women in society continue to change, so too do the dynamics from the workplace to the bedroom and everywhere in between.

File photograph: Hannah McKayAs the countdown clock continues to tick down to the UK’s departure from the European Union with no agreement in place, the chances of Brexit being delayed to buy Britain more time have increased.There are a number of options that London could pick from to avoid the heavy economic cost that would come from crashing out of the EU without a deal, though none is straightforward.Delaying BrexitUnder Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty - an EU member state’s exit mechanism from the bloc - the UK could seek an extension to the process for a specified period of time but only if each and every one of the other 27 EU member states agrees at the European Council, the group of EU heads of state and government. It is possible that member states might allow an extension but only for a short period of time and in exceptional circumstances, for example, to allow both sides time to make better preparations for a no-deal scenario. The European elections on May 23rd complicate any timeline and MPs must vote to change the “exit day” in the UK’s withdrawal act, which may also spell trouble. The EU is unlikely to allow the UK to delay Brexit for an unspecified period to permit continuing political uncertainty around unspecified alternative arrangements to the contentious backstop to avoid a hard Irish border.Cancelling BrexitThe UK can cancel Brexit unilaterally, without seeking the permission of the other 27 EU member states, according to a ruling of the European Court of Justice last year. If this happened, the UK’s relationship with the EU would remain on the same terms, as it was prior to the Article 50 process. The revocation must take place before the March 29th exit date, must be “unequivocal and unconditional.” In other words, the UK must make it clear it wishes to retain EU membership. Under the ruling, the UK must meet its own constitutional requirements and follow a democratic process. This has been interpreted that the UK would need an act of parliament to revoke Article 50 which could throw up political and even legal challenges given the likely opposition from pro-Brexit MPs. Cancelling Brexit seems the least likely option given that both the two main parties at Westminster have ruled out reversing the UK’s vote to leave the EU.Postponing BrexitThere is nothing, at least no official obstacle, to stop the UK using the revocation of Article 50 to cancel Brexit and then reapplying to leave again at a later date. There is, however, the European Court of Justice’s ruling that revocation must be “unequivocal and unconditional.” This makes it clear that the UK can only revoke to remain, not to buy more time in order to leave on more favourable terms or to avoid a no-deal scenario. The court’s advocate general said prior to the court ruling that revocation could not be an “abusive process” and that it must be done in good faith but there is nothing to stop the UK from deciding to leave at a later date. This tactic would not win the UK many friends in Europe and the EU may be able to veto any revocation if it believes the UK is only playing for time. The court could also render the application to leave void if it believes Britain is revoking with the intention to extend rather than to stay.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Photograph: Brian LawlessPA WireBritish prime minister Theresa May heard two emphatic and opposing positions when she met the North’s five main parties on Wednesday – that the backstop must stay, and that she must renegotiate a new withdrawal agreement with the European Union. Mrs May was meeting the North’s five main parties at Stormont as the President of the European Council, whom she is meeting in Brussels on Thursday, was wondering in a tweet “what that special place in hell looks like for those who promoted Brexit without even a sketch of a plan how to carry it out safely”.This prompted the DUP Brexit spokesman Sammy Wilson to tweet a response describing Mr Tusk as “arrogant” and as a “devilish trident-wielding euro maniac” who has “contempt for the 17.4 million people who voted to escape the corruption of the EU”.Sinn Féin president Mary Lou McDonald, after meeting Mrs May, was supportive of Mr Tusk. “I think Donald Tusk is reflecting the real sense of frustration that people now feel,” she said at Stormont.Public opinion“It is an absolute outrage that the British government believes that it can jeopardise the future of millions of people right across the European continent but in particular the future of the population of this island,” she said.“President Tusk was quite right to point that out I don’t believe his commentary was overly strong at all. I think he is accurately reflecting where public opinion is now,” said the Sinn Fin leader.Ms McDonald was critical of M´rs May and the British government, particularly especially over the prime minister’s decision to support an amendment endorsed by the House of Commons last week to seek an alternative to the current backstop designed to avoid a hard border.“The British prime minister has come here with the same old rhetoric, with no plan, no credibility and frankly no honour,” she said.“We have told her the British strategy of running down the clock and playing a game of chicken with Ireland and Irish interests is profoundly unacceptable and wrong. We have told her that the days of Britain dictating to Ireland and the Irish people are over and will not return,” she added.Ms McDonald told Mrs May the “backstop is the bottom line, the bare minimum requirement to meet Irish interests and protect the Good Friday Agreement” and to avoid a hard border.She said she also told Mrs May that in the “event of a Tory crash” over Brexit, that she should “begin preparations for a referendum on Irish unity”.Ms MacDonald repeated that Sinn Féin’s seven MPs would not sit in the House of Commons to participate in critical Brexit votes.FlawedMeanwhile, DUP leader Arlene Foster said her meeting with Mrs May provided “another useful opportunity to press for a deal which works for the entire United Kingdom - we want a deal which respects the union and the referendum result.“The draft withdrawal agreement is flawed because the backstop would undermine the economic and constitutional integrity of the United Kingdom. The backstop is the main problem,” she said.“It is welcome that the prime minister is travelling to Brussels to seek changes but she must stand strong and by the commitments she made to the House of Commons,” added Ms Foster. “We want a deal, one that works for us as well as our neighbours in the Republic of Ireland. But we must face reality. There is no ‘agreement’ unless it is able to command the necessary support in parliament,” she said.SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said he told Ms May there were no alternatives to the backstop and that the EU would “not budge” from its current position. “The bottom line is this: for the people of Northern Ireland, for our peace process, for all of our political progress, we need to remain within the customs union and single market in order to avoid a hard border,” he said. “I think that will begin to be understood at all levels in the British parliament because they don’t have an alternative. They talk about vague alternatives but there aren’t any alternatives,” added Mr Eastwood. Creeping borderismThe SDLP leader said that Northern Ireland must not be put into a different trading relationship than the Republic of Ireland. “That would lead to creeping borderism and we are not prepared to accept that,” he said. “The bottom line is this: we do not trust this government or any future British government to protect us in a future relationship that’s why we need the backstop, that’s why we need protecting and that has to happen up front,” he said. Mr Eastwood added that there were “no magical technological solutions” to the Brexit problem. The Ulster Unionist Party leader Robin Swann told Mrs May that if the UK exits the European Union on March 29th as scheduled, she should bring back direct rule from Westminster on March 30th. Mr Swann also complained of Irish Government “intransigence” in the Brexit negotiations. Mr Swann said they also discussed how to restore the Northern Executive and Assembly but that the main focus was on Brexit and the UUP delegation had to “drag her to a place where we actually started talking about how to get these institutions back up and running”. He said it was not possible to have meaningful discussions on Brexit without working institutions at Stormont. “If Northern Ireland leaves the European Union with no deal there is only one option for us in Northern Ireland and that is to move directly and straight to direct rule because come the 30th of March Northern Ireland needs political guidance and leadership,” said Mr Swann. All-weather backstopThe UUP leader told Mrs May that the common travel area to allow people move freely between Britain and Ireland could be extended to include good.The Alliance leader Naomi Long after meeting Mrs May said a time-limited backstop could not work and what was required was an “all-weather permanent backstop” to avoid a hard border. Ms Long said that while there may not be cross-party support for a backstop there was certainly cross-community support for such an arrangement and this was demonstrated by how business, farming and other sectors in Northern Ireland supported the backstop. “It is time to reach out to pragmatists and get a pragmatic way forward,” said Ms Long. She added, “This is not about political philosophy, this is about people who live in Donegal and work in Derry, this is about people who live in Newry and work in Dundalk. This is about people being able to do their jobs, it’s about workforce planning in our health service, in our schools, it’s about all of those things. It’s not about philosophical debates in parliament.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches. See more here.

Photograph: Clodagh KilcoynePA Wire.Theresa May’s speech in Belfast on Tuesday will not have reassured those in Northern Ireland who are angry over last week’s apparent abandonment of the withdrawal agreement she negotiated with the European Union. But it marked an important shift in Britain’s official position on the backstop as she prepares to meet Jean-Claude Juncker and Donald Tusk in Brussels on Thursday.The amendment tabled by Conservative backbencher Graham Brady and backed by a majority of MPs last week called for “the Northern Ireland backstop to be replaced with alternative arrangements to avoid a hard border”. But the prime minister said in Belfast that “it would mean replacing the backstop with another arrangement which avoids a hard border or making legally binding changes to the backstop to introduce a time limit or create an exit mechanism”.Answering questions after her speech, May said she remained committed to an “insurance policy” to prevent a hard border and there was no question of a Brexit deal that did not include it.“I’m not proposing to persuade people to accept a deal that does not contain that insurance policy for the future. What parliament has said is that they believe there should be changes made to the backstop,” she said.Ministers and officials continue to meet the Conservative MPs behind the so-called Malthouse Compromise, which envisages replacing the backstop with a tariff-free trade area and technological and administrative measures to reduce customs friction. But the prime minister has now made clear she believes the House of Commons could approve her Brexit deal if the backstop is changed rather than replaced with “alternative arrangements”.Time limitBrussels and Dublin have ruled out reopening the text of the withdrawal agreement and have rejected proposals to include a time limit or a unilateral exit mechanism in the backstop. These proposals are unacceptable to the EU but they are negotiable, unlike the Malthouse ideas which are viewed on the European side as frankly ridiculous.DUP leader Arlene Foster on Tuesday signalled a willingness to be flexible, telling the BBC she would not insist the backstop should be removed from the withdrawal agreement.“I think it’s for the prime minister to negotiate in relation to these matters,” she said.Some of May’s own Brexiteer backbenchers will be less understanding if she appears to drop the Malthouse proposals and Downing Street insisted on Tuesday ministers were pursuing all three options - a time limit, an exit mechanism and “alternative arrangements” - with urgency.The prime minister cannot expect much comfort or encouragement from Juncker and Tusk, who will repeat that the withdrawal agreement is not up for renegotiation. But in stating that legally binding changes to the backstop would be enough to win a majority at Westminster she has moved her negotiating position back into the realm of the possible.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Photograph: Francois LenoirReutersThose who promoted the idea of Brexit without any sense of what was to come next face “a place in hell”, the president of the European Council Donald Tusk said on Wednesday.“I’ve been wondering what that place in hell looks like for those who promoted Brexit without even a sketch of a plan for how to carry it out safely,” he said after a meeting with Taoiseach Leo Varadkar ahead of Thursday’s visit to Brussels by the British prime minister Theresa May. At a later press conference with European Commission President Jean Claude Juncker, Mr Varadkar said he will meet Mrs May for talks in Dublin on Friday.The common message of the meetings in Brussels - from Mr Tusk, the European Parliament’s leadership and later Mr Juncker - was firm, unambiguous, and uncompromising. Above all, it was reassuring to a Taoiseach who has been told repeatedly by the British press that Ireland is now facing pressure to give on the backstop. The EU remains resolute on its Withdrawal Agreement and, as the Taoiseach put it, determined to do right by Ireland.Mr Varadkar warned that the European Parliament also had to ratify any agreement and had made clear t it would not pass any deal that saw backsliding on Ireland.“We will not gamble on peace or put a sell-by date on reconciliation. And this is why we insist on the backstop,” Mr Tusk said, alluding clearly to British demands for a backstop exit mechanism. “The EU 27 will not be making any new offer.”Long-term relationshipHe, Mr Juncker and Mr Varadkar vigorously insisted that the Withdrawal Agreement can not be touched but that there remains room for discussion on the joint political declaration if the UK changes its approach to the long-term relationship. “Ireland will not be left alone” Mr Juncker said at a press confrence with Mr Varadkar after they held talks. He said the backstop is needed for “obvious, vital” reasons. “The backstop is a guarantee for Ireland and it is a guarantee for the European Union because the Irish border is a European border,” he said. Mr Juncker said the EU “could not accept the idea which has been circulated around that the Withdrawal Agreement could be reopened”. The Taoiseach expressed skepticism about the House of Commons’ resolution committing the prime minister to promote “alternative arrangements” to the backstop. It had probably been passed, he said, because the phrase “can mean whatever you want it to mean.”Mr Varadkar also met the President of the European Parliament, Antonio Tajani, and its chief Brexit spokesman, Guy Verhofstadt. Irish Commissioner Phil Hogan and chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier joined the meeting with Mr Juncker.Much of the discussion between the Taoiseach and Mr Juncker is understood to have focused on no-deal preparations in Ireland, an eventuality that appears here by the day to loom larger. Fully committedMr Varadkar did not elaborate on what measures would have to be taken on the Border, beyond acknowledging an Irish obligation to protect the single market and an insistence that the Government is not making any preparations. He paid tribute to the continued solidarity of the 27. “As a leader of a small country that is fully committed to the EU, this solidarity resonates deeply in Ireland, but not just in Ireland, in all small member states,” he said.Mr Varadkar said of the continued necessity for the backstop “I think the events in London and the recent instability demonstrate exactly why we need a legal guarantee.” Mr Tusk insisted he still believed a compromise is possible: “I hope that tomorrow we will hear from Prime Minister May a realistic suggestions on how to end the impasse .... “The top priority for us remains the issue of the border on the island of Ireland and the guarantee to maintain the peace process and the Good Friday Agreement.”Mr Tusk said that with British departure only 50 days away “I know that there are still a great number of people in the UK and on the continent and in Ireland wish for a reversal of this decision. I have always been of that view with all my heart but the facts are unmistakeable . “At the moment the pro-Brexit stance of the UK prime minister and of and the leader of the opposition rules out this question. Today there is no political force and no effective leadership for remain. ... you can’t argue with the facts.“Today our most important task is to prevent a no-deal scenario.”At the end of the press conference as Mr Tusk and Mr Varadkar shook hands, microphones picked up the Taoiseach telling Mr Tusk: “They will give you terrible trouble in the British press for this.” Mr Tusk laughed and nodded. DUP MP Sammy Wilson tweeted a response to “the devilish, trident wielding, euro maniac, Donald Tusk”. “It is Tusk and his arrogant EU negotiators who have fanned the flames of fear in an attempt to try and overturn the result of the referendum,” he said.

It came as Topshop was forced to cancel a launch party for its latest collection after designer Michael Halpern pulled out.Ms Miller declined to comment on Mr Bercow\u0027s refusal but, writing for The Daily , highlighted the Commons\u0027 own use of NDAs, on which it spent £2.4million between 2013 and 2017. Perhaps Parliament would be better placed to challenge this abuse of the law if it weren\u0027t also caught up in the use of NDAs, she argued.There have been more than 50 severance agreements, most including confidentially clauses, relating to House of Commons staff alone over the past five years. Last week, Ms Miller called on Mr Bercow to resign over a report into bullying in the Commons, something he himself has been accused of. Andrew Bridgen, one of Mr Bercow\u0027s most vocal critics, said: He should recuse himself from any further participation in the House\u0027s response to the culture change required. In fact, the best thing he can do is stand down as Speaker.A spokesman for Mr Bercow, who has denied bullying or any knowledge of pay-offs to alleged victims, said it might be thought premature to grant an urgent question on NDAs given the Government\u0027s response to Ms Miller\u0027s committee\u0027s report on misconduct in the workplace was expected shortly.Ms Jones said her committee would love an NDAs debate but could not sanction it unless a petition was lodged on Parliament\u0027s website. The impact of the scandal on Sir Philip\u0027s retail empire began to emerge last night after Mr Halpern withdrew from a launch party for his line. He is understood to have felt unable to attend after Sir Philip was named as the businessman behind an injunction preventing The  publishing allegations against him of sexual harassment and racial discrimination. A fashion insider said: His brand is about female empowerment. That\u0027s his ethos. He couldn\u0027t go ahead with this, it wouldn\u0027t be a good look. It would be awkward. I can\u0027t imagine celebrities would want to be associated with Philip Green. He\u0027s in a tricky situation.

Investigators had accused Mr Christensen, whom riot police seized in a raid on a prayer meeting in 2017, of holding fund-raisers and attracting new followers with religious pamphlets.Mr Christensen told the court last week that he was being persecuted “for being a religious believer who loves his neighbour as himself”.“It is sad that reading the Bible, reaching, and living a moral way of life is again a criminal offence in Russia,” said Yaroslav Sivulsky or the European Association of Jehovah\u0027s Witnesses. The nearly 622 days Mr Christensen has already spent in confinement will reportedly count for about half of the six-year sentence. The Jehovah\u0027s Witnesses will appeal the ruling. The conviction of Mr Christensen, who has lived in Russia since 2000 and has a family with a local woman, is part of a nationwide crackdown on the sect. While it is a far cry from the mass deportation of Jehovah\u0027s Witnesses to Siberia in Soviet times, the growing number of believers here have faced raids, arrests and bans by local courts in the past decade.In 2017, the supreme court declared the group an “extremist organisation” like neo-Nazi and Islamist groups, banned its activities and ordered its 395 branches in Russia shut down. Some 100 Jehovah\u0027s Witnesses now face extremism charges carrying prison sentences of up to 10 years, more than 20 are in custody and 160 have fled abroad. The organisation says it has 170,000 members in Russia. Vladimir Putin and Russian Orthodox Patriarch Kirill appear in the Kremlin last month to celebrate 10 years since the patriarch\u0026#39s enthronementWhen asked about the ban on Jehovah\u0027s Witnesses in December, Vladimir Putin said it was “complete nonsense” to “label representatives of religious communities as members of destructive, even terrorist, organisations”.But he said it was also “necessary to take into account the country and society in which we live”.The Russian Orthodox Church considers the group a dangerous cult promoting false teachings. A church spokesman said last year the Jehovah\u0027s Witnesses were a “totalitarian sect, whose activities are based on the manipulation of consciousness,” adding that they “could not be called Christians”.The group\u0027s pacifist beliefs and refusal to serve in the army have caused friction in a country where most men are required to spend a year in the military.Human Rights Watch has called on Russia to stop persecuting Mr Christensen and other Jehovah\u0027s Witnesses, and Amnesty International said his case was “emblematic of grave human rights violations, including the rights to freedom of expression, peaceful assembly and religion”. Some 150 Russian activists and journalists signed an open letter against the crackdown.Oryol, the city where Mr Christensen was arrested, unveiled a monument to Ivan the Terrible in 2016 despite pickets against itThe European Court of Human Rights found in 2010 that the Moscow branch of the Jehovah\u0027s Witnesses should not have been banned.

Yellow weather warnings for wind have been issued to the entire south of England and Wales from Wednesday afternoon through to Saturday evening. The Met Office has warned residents to prepare for power cuts, travel disruption and an impact to services as two separate weather fronts cross Britain.The first, on Wednesday and Thursday, means that everywhere south of Manchester will be subject to the yellow warning. A second warning comes into place at midday on Friday and lasts until Saturday at 6pm and covers all of Britain south of Dundee. Northern Scotland has been issued its own yellow warning for rain. Meteorologist Sophie Yeomans said: It\u0027s going to be the south west which will be hit the worst, across parts of Devon, Cornwall, moving along the west coast.As you go into the early hours of tomorrow morning, the strongest winds will be in the east of England.It\u0027s only really the north of England which will avoid the worst of it.Ms Yeomans added: The strongest winds will be up to 60mph, and even 70mph. This will begin to move northwards from the early hours of tomorrow morning.Be aware, this may cause longer journey times, so expect some delays to road, rail and air travel.These gales will continue through the night until 9am, so commuters should be wary of minor delays as a result.The yellow warning for wind says: Some delays to road, rail, air and ferry transport are likelyDelays for high-sided vehicles on exposed routes and bridges likelySome short term loss of power and other services is possibleIt’s possible that some coastal routes, sea fronts and coastal communities could be affected by spray andor large wavesThe latest bad weather has not yet been upgraded to a storm, which requires the weather warnings to be at least amber or red.Although cold, January 2019 was a very dry month for much of the UK with many places seeing less than half the expected rainfall.The end of the month saw a cold spell that brought widespread ice and snow.Brexit latest news: Donald Tusk\u0026#39s claims of a \u0026#39special place in hell\u0026#39 for \u0026#39no plan\u0026#39 Brexiteers prompts British fury Comment: Here are five ways Brexit Britain can enjoy a great trading future even without a dealLoch Lomond hires full time member of staff to tackle growing littering problemComment: No Mr Tusk, \u0026#39hell\u0026#39 is being trapped in the wretched European UnionScottish hermit rescued from remote forest will be \u0026#39desperate\u0026#39 to return to his isolated cabinHunt wild boar with bows and arrows, Italian region proposesComment: How socialism – not sanctions – destroyed VenezuelaComment: It was a brave move - but Emily Thornberry is right to challenge her leader\u0026#39s foreign policySuspects hand themselves in at hospital after teenager is stabbed to death in Battersea Jehovah\u0026#39s Witness in Russia sentenced to six years amid crackdownOcado cancels orders after fire rips through its Andover warehouseEbola\u0026#39s lost blood: row over samples flown out of Africa as \u0026#39big pharma\u0026#39 set to cash inHow Juncker\u0026#39s \u0026#39monster\u0026#39, Martin Selmayr, could still terrorise Britain after Brexit UAE denies arresting British football fan for wearing a Qatar shirtComment: Overpaid and out of touch?

He was boosted on Saturday by the defection of a top air force general.His fledgling alternative administration will hold talks in Washington February 14 on responding to the largest hemispheric humanitarian crisis in modern history.Maduro disclosed on Monday that he sent Pope Francis a letter seeking help in mediating the country\u0027s crisis. The pope told journalists Tuesday that this would require agreement from both the government and the opposition.The United Nations said 40 people were killed in clashes with security forces in a week of protests last month, coinciding with Guaido\u0027s self-proclamation as acting leader. Local NGO Foro Penal said almost 1,000 people were detained between January 21 and 31.Please review our commenting policyRolf Harris\u0026#39s prison release reviewed after he wanders into primary schoolBrexit latest news: Donald Tusk\u0026#39s claims of a \u0026#39special place in hell\u0026#39 for \u0026#39no plan\u0026#39 Brexiteers prompts British fury Comment: Here are five ways Brexit Britain can enjoy a great trading future even without a dealLoch Lomond hires full time member of staff to tackle growing littering problemComment: No Mr Tusk, \u0026#39hell\u0026#39 is being trapped in the wretched European UnionScottish hermit rescued from remote forest will be \u0026#39desperate\u0026#39 to return to his isolated cabinHunt wild boar with bows and arrows, Italian region proposesComment: How socialism – not sanctions – destroyed VenezuelaComment: It was a brave move - but Emily Thornberry is right to challenge her leader\u0026#39s foreign policyUK weather: Winds up to 70mph to batter Britain for four daysSuspects hand themselves in at hospital after teenager is stabbed to death in Battersea Jehovah\u0026#39s Witness in Russia sentenced to six years amid crackdownOcado cancels orders after fire rips through its Andover warehouseEbola\u0026#39s lost blood: row over samples flown out of Africa as \u0026#39big pharma\u0026#39 set to cash inHow Juncker\u0026#39s \u0026#39monster\u0026#39, Martin Selmayr, could still terrorise Britain after Brexit UAE denies arresting British football fan for wearing a Qatar shirtComment: Overpaid and out of touch?

DHS has known his address since the filing of a US visa application in 2017. He has never hidden from DHS or any of its agencies. Mr Abraham-Joseph is not subject to mandatory detention under federal law and is eligible for bond.By statute, bond should be granted by ICE when there is no flight risk or a danger to the community... we are unaware of why ICE apparently targeted MR Abraham-Jospeh, but we will do everything possible to legally seek his release and pursue his available relief in immigration court.At the time of the arrest, ICE claimed in a statement that 21 Savage “initially entered the US\u0026nbsplegally in July 2005, but subsequently failed to depart under the terms of his nonimmigrant visa and he became unlawfully present in the US\u0026nbspwhen his visa expired in July 2006.Created with Sketch.

She regularly appeared at its global launch events, and was often touted as a potential successor to Tim Cook.She had been paid millions of dollars to move to California from London to join Apple from Burberry. After her arrival, she led a major change in the way the stores worked, redesigning its businesses and moving towards seeing them as town halls.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialBut she will now be replaced by\u0026nbspDeirdre O’Brien, a longtime Apple executive who also runs the company’s human-resources department.

That issue has become a problem now that customers are holding onto their current iPhones longer instead of buying the latest models.

To lure her away, Apple gave Ahrendts company stock valued at $70 million in 2014. In her last full year at Apple, she received a compensation package valued at $26.5 million, according to filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\u0026nbspAhrendts’ arrival at the Cupertino, California, company coincided with the rollout of the Apple Watch, which the company designed to be a fashion statement in addition to a wearable piece of technology.\u0026nbspWhile at Apple, Ahrendts engineered renovations of high-profiles stores in San Francisco, New York, Chicago and other cities in an attempt to transform them into hip places to hang out while shoppers checked out the company’s latest innovations. Her lofty description of the stores as the equivalent of “town squares” became the subject of derision among some analysts and media commentators.Additional reporting by Associated PressBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The difficulty ranges from simple phrases like woman kicking the football, to more complex concepts like celebrating a festival.Crucially, the AI has never seen these phrases before and must either guess them from images drawn by the human player, or convey them to the human through its own series of images.The difficulty in teaching artificial intelligence common sense has proved to be one of the key stumbling blocks in developing chatbots and voice assistants that are genuinely multi-purpose.This is a first step toward exploiting common sense, said Aniruddha Kembhavi, a computer scientist who worked on the project.Fellow computer scientist Ali Farhadi added: We wanted to build an AI system that can collaborate with human beings, and at the same time is learning about how humans think, how they act...

It made McQueen the first black British producer to ever receive the award.Michael Keaton may have missed out on Best Actor, but Birdman won the main prize.Spotlight was the first Best Picture winner to win fewer than three Academy Awards since The Greatest Show on Earth in 1953Barry Jenkins\u0027s drama became the first film with an all-black cast, the first LGBTQ film and the second-lowest-grossing film domestically (behind The Hurt Locker) to win the Oscar for Best Picture.9090 The Shape of Water (2017)Guillermo del Toro\u0027s The Shape of Water is the second fantasy film to win Best Picture alongside The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King.Cooper had been nominated for Best Director at the Golden Globes, and was among those nominated at the Directors Guild of America Awards.However, whereas\u0026nbspSpike Lee (BlacKkKlansman),\u0026nbspYorgos Lanthimos (The Favourite),\u0026nbspAlfonso Cuarón (Roma) and\u0026nbspAdam McKay (Vice) all went on to pick up Oscar nominations, Cooper lost out to\u0026nbspPawel Pawlikowski with Cold War.Everything we know about the 2019 OscarsThe greatest Oscars injustices ever – from Citizen Kane to Crash10 forgotten Oscars winners, from Mira Sorvino to Paul HaggisDespite A Star is Born being a success, both critically and commercially, Cooper admits that loosing always hurts.“The truth is you feel like a loser when people treat you like it afterwards,” he said of awards shows. “That’s the only downside. The award show ends and first of all, they avoid you a little bit and then they do say, ‘It was a good movie.’ Thanks, thanks.”Follow all The Independent‘s coverage of the Oscars here.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

These are major differentials.”Meanwhile, tenants in Manchester pay an average rent of £496, against £1,053 in the capital. One chart that shows why Londoners are the poorest workers in the UKLondon is over. I\u0027m so glad I leftRenters are leaving London in record numbers. Where are they going?A new survey has revealed what Britons hate the most about LondonThe cost of living in every part of the world in one infographicThe ‘Northern pound’ is “essentially a difference in the cost of living”, Mr Johnes said, and the fact that money goes further outside the capital explains why more than half (53 per cent) of Londoners said they would move away from the city and accept a lower salary elsewhere, while just 31 per cent in the North said they would consider moving. This benefits both jobseekers and employers, Mr Johnes said, because companies will find it easier to hire staff and workers will find their money goes further, even if they are being paid a smaller amount. “So it’s a win for consumers and a win for businesses,” he said. Martin Talbot, director at Totaljobs, added: “Gone are the days where a salary is enough to secure the best talent today’s jobseekers are increasingly valuing work-life balance and their wellbeing above all else. “Northern cities are seeing a rise in job opportunities as UK companies no longer think the capital is the be all and end all. Many northern cities offer lots of other advantages too, from a shorter (and cheaper) commute, great cultural scene, and a more affordable social life. “No matter where they’re based, it’s key for businesses to highlight not just their employer brand, but the lifestyle their local area can provide existing and potential employees.”However, the researchers noted that London is unlikely to be abandoned by UK workers. “London will be fine, London is still a great place to live.

Choose from Public, Friends, Only Me and Custom in the dropdown menu.Annoyingly, changing this has no effect on who’s able to see your past Facebook posts. Instead, on the Privacy page, you have to click on Limit Past Posts, then select Limit Old Posts and finally hit Confirm on the pop-up.39 Make yourself harder to findYou can stop completely random people from adding you by selecting Friends of Friends from the dropdown menu in the Who can send you friend requests? section of the Privacy page. It’s also worth limiting who can find your Facebook profile with your number and email address. 49 Control access to your TimelineYou can limit who gets to post things on your Timeline and who gets to see posts on your Timeline too. In Settings, go to Timeline and Tagging and edit the sections you want to lock down. When you block someone, they won’t be able to see things you post on your Timeline, tag you, invite you to events or groups, start conversations with you or add you as a friend. To do it, go to Settings and Blocking. Annoyingly, you have to block people on Messenger separately. One of Facebook’s handiest privacy features is the ability to review posts you’re tagged in before they appear on your Timeline. They’ll still be visible on the News Feed while they’re fresh, but won’t be tied to your profile forever. In Timeline and Tagging, enable Timeline review controls. 79 Clean up your appsYou can view a list of all of the apps you’ve connected to your Facebook account by going to Settings and Apps. The list might be longer than you expected it to be. It’s worth tidying this up to ensure things you no longer use lose access to your personal information. 89 Change your ad preferencesYou can view a list of everything Facebook thinks you’re into and tinker with your ad preferences by going to Settings and Adverts.

There will be an option to report people to avoid users sending then removing harmful messages, for instance.It mirrors a tool that is available in other apps including Facebook\u0027s own WhatsApp. On that app, messages can be deleted for much longer after they are sent, allowing people more than an hour – though it was much shorter initially.Mark Zuckerberg tries to defend Facebook on its birthdayMark Zuckerberg has also had access to a similar feature for some time. Facebook claims the boss\u0027s messages disappear over time to ensure they are kept safing, citing security issues such as the major Sony hack.But users complained that it appeared to be unfair that only they were given the option of deleting messages after the fact. When it became clear Mr Zuckerberg was receiving special treatment, the company announced he would have limited access to the feature that and that such a tool would be rolled out in the coming months.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

William Cook travels to Brussels to meet the famous duo, who have\u0026nbspturned their lives together into a perpetual, seamless artworkClick to followThe IndependentGilbert and George outside their house in Spitalfields: ‘We really believe that Fournier Street is the centre of the world for us’In a dilapidated old arsenal on the industrial edge of Brussels, Gilbert and George are singing the music hall song that made them famous. Their audience seem a bit bemused, and who on earth can blame them? “Underneath the Arches” is as British as warm\u0026nbspbeer or test match cricket, and equally incomprehensible to European punters. First performed by a very different duo, Flanagan and Allen, way back in the 1930s, it was already a golden oldie when Gilbert and George started singing it in art galleries 50 years ago.Half a century later, it’s become the theme tune for their lifelong career as Living Sculptures. No wonder these continental liggers are nonplussed. To anyone who isn’t steeped in British culture, with its weird passion for nostalgia, Gilbert and George must seem very odd indeed. “We never wanted to be weird because all artists like the idea of being weird, and we never wanted to be normal because everybody’s normal,” says George, by way of explanation. “We like to be weird and normal at the same time.”Gilbert and George are here in Brussels to open Brafa, one of Europe’s most prestigious art fairs. Each year, a famous artist is invited to be Brafa’s guest of honour. Last year, it was Christo. This year, it’s Gilbert and George. Their big bold artworks are scattered around this huge hall, an incongruous contrast to the antique paintings that surround them.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialThis juxtaposition is surreal – and here in the Belgian capital, the city of Magritte, that’s really rather fitting. For Brexit-obsessed Britons, Brussels may be synonymous with the European Union, but for Europeans it’s always been synonymous with surrealism – and what could possibly be more surreal than Gilbert and George?Despite their matching suits, and shirts and ties, they’re easy to tell apart. George looks like Eric Morecambe. Gilbert looks like Ernie Wise. However, unlike Eric and Ernie, they’re more than just a double act. They live together, they work together, they always appear in public together. This has been their way of life since they met, in London, in 1967, at St Martin’s School of Art (now Central Saint Martins). Their artworks are striking, and often bizarrely beautiful, but they’re a sideshow compared to their greatest work of art: themselves.Created with Sketch.Gilbert and George: portraits and works Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Gilbert and George in their local cafe in Spitalfields, 2017Gilbert and George outside of their favourite restaurant, Mangal II, a Kurdish restaurant in Stoke Newington 2017 Portrait of Gilbert and George RA after receiving their medals at the Royal Academy of Arts on May 2, 2017Portrait of Gilbert and George RA after receiving their medals at the Royal Academy of Arts on May 2, 2017Gilbert and George, 2015Gilbert and George in their younger yearsGilbert and George - SFG (2013)Gilbert \u0026amp George, White Cube and Albert BaronianGilbert and George - HANDBALL (2008)Gilbert \u0026amp George, White Cube and Albert BaronianGilbert and George - TEACHER STRAIGHT (2011)Gilbert \u0026amp George, White Cube and Albert BaronianGilbert and George - BEARD RAIDS (2016) Gilbert \u0026amp George, White Cube and Albert BaronianGilbert and George - BEARD MAD (2016)Gilbert \u0026amp George, White Cube and Albert BaronianGilbert and George, 2017Early morning.

Everyone assumes so, but no one seems to know for sure, and their public life is far more intriguing than whatever they might get up to in private. Young men feature prominently in their work, women are conspicuous by their absence, but you wouldn’t call these pictures homoerotic. Indeed, there’s something strangely sexless about them, like artworks from another planet.Their\u0026nbspDirty Words\u0026nbspand\u0026nbspNaked Shit\u0026nbsppictures caused a predictable furore (the titles are self-explanatory) but most of their work isn’t overtly controversial. The most radical thing about them isn’t their art, but the way they’ve merged their inidual identities into one.‘Fake’ Hitler paintings seized by German police in BerlinThey’re reluctant to discuss the details of their lives before they met, but their backgrounds are fascinating. When pressed, they stress the similarities – they were both war babies from provincial, lower-class, unartistic families – but the differences are far more notable, and the most notable difference is that one half of this very British duo wasn’t originally British at all.Gilbert Prousch was born in a small village in the Italian Dolomites in 1943. His father was a shoemaker, like his grandfather, great-grandfather and great-great grandfather before him, but after the war mass-produced shoes became much cheaper and so Gilbert’s father struggled to make a living. Inspired by Michaelangelo, Gilbert studied art in Salzburg and then in Munich, where he heard about St Martin’s. He travelled to London and wangled a place on its internationally renowned advanced sculpture course. He didn’t speak a word of English. He still speaks with a strong Italian accent today.George Passmore, conversely, speaks like a BBC newsreader from the 1950s. He was born in Devon in 1942. His father left home soon after George was born, possibly before. His mother was uninhibited, and George had a succession of “uncles”, which must have exposed him to gossip in postwar Totnes. At state school he showed a talent for art, which eventually won him a place at Dartington Hall, a private school renowned for its progressive attitudes. Inspired by Van Gogh’s letters, he went on to art school, and ended up at St Martin’s, on the advanced sculpture course, with Gilbert Prousch.“George took an interest in me,” says Gilbert. They became friends – and then lovers? Last time I met them, in their home in London, I asked them if it was love at first sight. “No,” said George. He described their relationship as something that happened gradually, “like an atmosphere or a cloud”. Do they ever wonder what might have happened if they’d never met? The idea clearly seems inconceivable to them. They believe they were destined to be together. “It was fate,” says Gilbert.The sculpture course at St Martin’s was (in)famously laissez-faire. Students could do whatever they wanted, which suited Gilbert and George just fine. “St Martin’s was the best art school in the world,” says Gilbert. “This was a school that said to an artist, ‘Anything goes. You are free to think in different ways.’ No other art school did that.” His art training in Munich had been traditional and academic. “St Martin’s was different – anything could be art.”Their fellow students included Barry Flanagan, Bruce McLean and, most notably, Richard Long, who turned walking into an artform. Gilbert and George went even further. They turned their lives together into a perpetual, seamless artwork. As Gilbert says, “We were the centre of our art.”While Long set off into the wilderness, Gilbert and George wandered around London’s East End. It was here, in a Dickensian junk shop, that they found an old record of “Underneath the Arches”, and came up with the idea of singing along to it, for hours and hours on end. They called this artwork The Singing Sculpture. “We felt we were doing something different,” says Gilbert. Like all the best ideas, it was both in keeping with, yet contrary to, the spirit of the times. Conceptual art was all the rage, but most of it was terribly earnest. Their Singing Sculpture was full of fun.Brafa, one of Europe’s most prestigious art fairs\u0026nbsp(Fabrice Debatty)“For the artists who were showing in those galleries, colour was taboo, figuration was taboo, sex was taboo, feeling was taboo – and these were all of the things we were interested in,” says George. Other artists got drunk in the evening, then went back into the studio in the morning to make sombre, sober art. Gilbert and George turned their drunken revels into art.They couldn’t get any public subsidy, and they had no family money to support them. Looking back, they now believe this gave them an advantage. “We could feel more free – we didn’t have to fit in in any way,” says George. “Middle-class people are more constrained.”They got their big break at a group show in London called When Attitudes Become Form. When the curator declined to include their work they gatecrashed the private view, and stole the show with their Living Sculptures, standing in the middle of the gallery like showroom dummies. Konrad Fischer saw them at this show, and asked them to perform in Düsseldorf. In Düsseldorf they were seen by Illeana Sonnabend, who invited them to New York. Fischer and Sonnabend were two of the world’s most influential art dealers. Gilbert and George had arrived.Around the same time they moved into a Georgian townhouse in Fournier Street, in London’s Spitalfields. They’ve lived there ever since. It was a poor area when they moved in. It’s got a lot smarter since, but it’s still a tough old place. The tramps that used to live there have been replaced by drug addicts, but they don’t mind this shifting cityscape – they embrace it. “We are very optimistic people,” says George. “We are never against anything.”Like a lot of their boldest statements, this is only partly true. They were certainly against the artistic orthodoxy of the 1960s and 1970s. In their suits and ties and starched white shirts they stood out a mile. “To be an artist you had to be critical. You had to be against the bomb, or against America, or against the Conservatives or against Labour,” says George. “We thought, ‘How marvellous it would be if we didn’t have to be Anti!’” It’s a philosophy they maintain when people bring petitions to their front door. “If it’s for something, we sign it. If it’s against something, we don’t sign it. We must have signed for some horrible things, but at least we were for.”Living in Spitalfields has been absolutely central to their art. “We really believe that Fournier Street is the centre of the world for us,” Gilbert tells me. “It’s an amazing mixture of different kinds of people.” Spitalfields has long been a refuge for arriving immigrants: Huguenots, Jews, Sikhs, Muslims… “The East End of London is a mixture of so many countries, a mixture of so many different people.” This is just the way they like it. “You face the modern world whenever you step out of the front door,” says George.They’ve exhibited all around the world, but though their pictures attract a lot of interest, wherever they go the main attraction is always Gilbert and George. It’s the same story here in Brussels. It’s like attending a press conference with Quentin Crisp and Oscar Wilde. Sure, it’s the same show every time, more or less, endless variations on a single theme, but it’s still more entertaining and enlightening than talking to any other artists I can think of.They set off for a walk around Brafa, followed by a swarm of hacks. “Our motto is ban religion,” says Gilbert, as they pause for photos in front of one of their monumental pictures. Religion loomed large in both their childhoods: Gilbert was raised a Catholic George’s brother became a vicar. Their artworks are oddly reminiscent of stained glass windows, but they’re both devout atheists. “We don’t believe in God,” says Gilbert. “All the gods are manmade. We are in charge of what we are doing in this world.”“We’ve always firmly believed that the national galleries of the world should remove all of the Christian art and hand it back to the Church,” says George. “They can look after the insurance and maintenance and conservation, and give over the national museums to humanist art, not Judeo-Christian voodoo.” George tells a story about an elderly vicar who knocked on their front door. “I thought it was marvellous that you said Ban Religion,” he told them. “My congregation come to church every week, and they’re all very religious. But I don’t want them to be religious. I want them to be good.”“We believe in the enlightenment, when people became human for their own sake,” adds Gilbert. “They didn’t need God anymore to make themselves human.” Their heroes are Charles Darwin and Alan Turing.We stop in front of a montage they made from tabloid posters, which they stole from outside newsagents. “It’s not a very easy thing to do because the shopkeepers don’t like you to do that, so one of us would go into the shop to distract the shopkeeper while the other stole the poster,” confesses George. “After three and a half years we ended up with more than 3,700 posters, and then we ided them into subjects – the ones which said Rape, the ones that said Murder, the ones that said Mugged, and ended up with a very big group of pictures.” They only got caught once. “We were very polite and gave it back to the shop, but we went the next night and stole it again.”‘Honest posters’ take down this year’s Oscar nomineesMan mistaken for employee strolls out of art gallery with $1m paintingThe rise of graphic novels, from To Kill a Mockingbird to SabrinaDespite these rebellious attitudes, they’re reassuringly old-fashioned. They don’t use the internet, or mobile phones. The only time they use the telephone is to book a table at the local restaurant where they’ve eaten for the past 20 years. After 50 years in the spotlight, they still maintain they’re outside the art establishment.Maybe they were, once upon a time (when they met, in 1967, homosexuality had only just been decriminalised) but that time has long since passed. Today they’re Royal Academicians who’ve exhibited in virtually every major gallery across the globe. If they were ever anti-establishment, the establishment has long since absorbed them. Yet for all their success there’s still something discreetly anarchic about them, a hint of danger behind their impeccable manners and immaculately tailored suits.They’re now lionised by the art world, but they don’t like hobnobbing with other artists. “We had friends in London, Paris, Germany, New York, a huge group of friends – drinking, celebrating, parties – and then one day we cut it off, we stopped,” says George. “We realised it was all to do with gossip and business – the nightmare of a world that has nothing to do with being an artist.” “We wanted to be free of gossiping,” says Gilbert. “We have friends, but we don’t want artist friends.” Though the art world has appropriated them, and sanctified them, they’re still outsiders at heart.So what advice would they give to an aspiring young artist starting out today? “Tomorrow morning, when you wake up, sit on the edge of your bed, keep your eyes closed, and don’t open them and stand up until you have decided, ‘What do I want to say to the world today?’” says George. Gilbert’s advice is a lot more succinct: “Fuck the teachers.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It’s been cancelled now, but that doesn’t mean you can’t catch up with it, and then write Netflix a strongly worded email.220 Money Heist (TV series, one season, 2017–)Known as La Casa de Papel (House of Paper) in its native Spanish, Money Heist is Netflix’s most streamed non-English language show. The bank heist is a tired dramatic trope these days, but don’t let that, or the show’s bland English-language title, put you off – creator Álex Pina has made something special. The heist here, led by a mysterious man known only as The Professor, involves breaking into the Royal Mint of Spain and printing off €2.4 billion. There are even more twists in the show’s 15 episodes than there are hostages. 320 One Day at a Time (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)In stark contrast to the off-beat, low-key comedy that currently rules TV – the kind that provokes a wry smirk rather than a hearty laugh – One Day at a Time is a big, bright sitcom filmed in front of an interminably enthusiastic studio audience. You wouldn’t have thought that the story of a Cuban-American army veteran  nurse  single mother – who suffers from PTSD and depression – would fit into this format, but it does so beautifully, tackling issues of sexuality, racism and sexism in the process.  Based on writer  director Tamara Jenkins’s own fertility struggles, Private Life stars Kathryn Hahn and Paul Giamatti (both giving brilliant performances) as a spiky, loving middle-aged couple desperate to have a baby. They even rope their enthusiastic but irresponsible niece Sadie (Kayli Carter) into the mix, much to the horror of Sadie’s mother (Molly Shannon, turning a potentially repellent character into one worthy of empathy). It’s subtle, restrained and beautifully realised.520 Big Mouth (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)Crude, rude, and rife with surprise emissions and bodily functions, animated sitcom Big Mouth is also a sensitive, nuanced deep e into the various horrors of teenagehood. When 12-year-old Andrew Glouberman (John Mulaney) is visited by the hormone monster (Nick Kroll, who voices many of the show’s best characters), he finds his life irreversibly – and seemingly disastrously – changed. Unlike many other puberty-centred comedies, Big Mouth makes as much time for its confused female protagonists as its male ones Maya Rudolph is a delight as the female hormone monster, and look out for Kristen Wiig’s wonderful turn as a talking vagina.  620 Easy (TV series, two seasons, 2016–)Joe Swanberg’s style of defiantly undramatic mumblecore isn’t for everyone, but if you enjoyed his earlier films, Drinking Buddies and Happy Christmas, you’ll find plenty to admire in this anthology comedy-drama series. Big-name stars such as Orlando Bloom and Aubrey Plaza crop up, but Jane Adams – who you might remember from Todd Solondz’s chronically depressing 1998 film Happiness – is the show’s heart, and Marc Maron is its jaded soul.Community’s Gillian Jacobs is brilliant as the prickly, magnetic recovering addict Mickey, who forms an unlikely – and arguably deeply unwise – relationship with her nerdy neighbour Gus (Paul Rust). Despite Gus’s pathological need to be the nice guy, we’re never quite sure who or what we’re rooting for – which is what makes Love such complex, compelling viewing.  In 2016, comedian Patton Oswalt’s wife, the true crime writer Michelle McNamara, died suddenly in her sleep. That subject matter doesn’t exactly scream “stand-up special”, but out of his devastating loss, Oswalt managed to craft something funny and profound. Over the course of an hour, he processes his grief onstage, managing to find humour in the struggle to raise his grieving six-year-old daughter alone.920 Santa Clarita Diet (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)Granted, this horror-comedy – which stars Drew Barrymore as a neurotic real estate agent who suddenly develops a taste for human flesh – is really silly, and really, really disgusting. But it’s also strangely charming, and funny. Timothy Olyphant is excellent as Sheila’s frazzled husband Joel, and the pair’s idiosyncratic but respectful relationship with their smart teenage daughter Abby (Liv Hewson) isn’t quite like anything else on TV right now.1020 Dark Tourist (TV series, one season, 2018–)New Zealand journalist David Farrier is an unlikely TV presenter in the same way that Louis Theroux is – in just about every scenario in which he finds himself, he’s a little bit awkward. But as with Theroux, Farrier’s weakness is actually his strength, allowing him to endear himself to the many unusual people he meets on his journey through the world’s most questionable tourist destinations. Farrier’s stops include the site of the Fukushima nuclear disaster, the road where JFK was assassinated, and the Milwaukee suburbs where serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer murdered his victims.1120 Sacred Games (TV series, one season, 2018–)Based on Vikram Chandra’s epic 2006 novel, Netflix’s first Indian original series is a slowly unfolding gem. The first season of Sacred Games – which follows a troubled police officer (Saif Ali Khan) who has 25 days to save his city thanks to a tip-off from a presumed dead gangster – only covered one quarter of Chandra’s 1,000-page novel. As the show itself declared when it announced the forthcoming second season, “the worst is yet to come”.When the trailer for Dumplin’ first landed, it seemed all the ingredients were in place for a film that was at worst tone-deaf, and at best vaguely patronising. Thank heavens, then, that the trailer did Dumplin’ such a disservice. Starring Danielle Macdonald (who broke out in the excellent 2017 film Patti Cake$) as Willowdean, a self-described “fat girl” who enters a local pageant to annoy her former beauty queen mother (Jennifer Aniston), Dumplin’ is as funny, warm and sensitive as its protagonist – and with a killer Dolly Parton-laden soundtrack to boot.1320 Dark (TV series, one season, 2017–)This sci-fi thriller – which features disappearing children, a mysterious local power plant, and scenes set in the Eighties – has, for obvious reasons, drawn comparisons to Stranger Things. But Dark is even more beguiling and (true to its name) less family-friendly than Stranger Things.1420 The Death and Life of Marsha P Johnson (Film, 2017)Though it’s been somewhat tarnished by claims that director David France appropriated the work and research of trans film-maker Reina Gossett, this documentary is nonetheless a loving, respectful tribute to gay rights activist Marsha P Johnson. One of the key figures in the Stonewall uprising (though her involvement was almost entirely eradicated in 2015’s critically hated Stonewall), Johnson modelled for Andy Warhol, performed onstage with drag group Hot Peaches, helped found the Gay Liberation Front, and then died under suspicious circumstances in 1992.1520 On My Block (TV series, one season, 2018–)This coming-of-age series might not have found as many eyeballs as it deserved last year, but those it did find were glued to the screen. In fact, it was the most-binged show of 2018 – meaning that it had the highest watch-time-per-viewing session of any Netflix original. Created by Awkward’s Lauren Iungerich, On My Block follows a group of Los Angeles teens as they navigate both the drama of high school and the danger of inner-city life.Two beleaguered assistants (Zoey Deutch and Glen Powell) conspire to get their over-demanding bosses (Taye Diggs and Lucy Liu) together in order to get their lives back in this winning romantic comedy. Set It Up is responsible not only for coining the term “over-dicking” (it’s much more innocent than it sounds), but for rejuvenating a tired genre.Martin Freeman stars as the father struggling to protect his young daughter from a zombie epidemic spreading across Australia. So far, so overdone. But this drama thriller, directed by Ben Howling and Yolanda Ramke and based on their 2013 short of the same name, throws a handful of unpredictable ners in the works.    1920 Godless (TV series, one season, 2017–)With shades of John Ford\u0027s The Searchers, this languorous western was critically acclaimed but swiftly forgotten after it landed on Netflix in 2016. Set in 1884, it\u0027s about Frank Griffin (Jeff Daniels) and his notoriously ruthless gang of outlaws’ pursuit of their injured former ally Roy Goode (Jack O’Connell), who is hiding out in a small town populated solely by women after a mining accident killed off all its men. A gun-toting Michelle Dockery, clearly relishing the change of scenery after years of Downton Abbey, and a taciturn Jack O’Connell, are on brilliant form.2020 Atypical (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)This coming-of-age series about a teenage boy with autism was sweet and well-intentioned from the start, but its first season was criticised for a handful of inaccuracies, and for its lack of autistic actors. Rather than drowning in a sea of defensiveness – as too many shows tend to do – it listened, and brought in autistic actors and writers for its excellent second season.120 American Vandal (TV series, two seasons, 2017–2018)Part satire of true crime documentaries such as Making a Murderer, part carefully observed portrayal of teenage life, American Vandal was criminally underappreciated during its two season run. It’s been cancelled now, but that doesn’t mean you can’t catch up with it, and then write Netflix a strongly worded email.220 Money Heist (TV series, one season, 2017–)Known as La Casa de Papel (House of Paper) in its native Spanish, Money Heist is Netflix’s most streamed non-English language show.

As the show itself declared when it announced the forthcoming second season, “the worst is yet to come”.When the trailer for Dumplin’ first landed, it seemed all the ingredients were in place for a film that was at worst tone-deaf, and at best vaguely patronising. Thank heavens, then, that the trailer did Dumplin’ such a disservice. Starring Danielle Macdonald (who broke out in the excellent 2017 film Patti Cake$) as Willowdean, a self-described “fat girl” who enters a local pageant to annoy her former beauty queen mother (Jennifer Aniston), Dumplin’ is as funny, warm and sensitive as its protagonist – and with a killer Dolly Parton-laden soundtrack to boot.1320 Dark (TV series, one season, 2017–)This sci-fi thriller – which features disappearing children, a mysterious local power plant, and scenes set in the Eighties – has, for obvious reasons, drawn comparisons to Stranger Things. But Dark is even more beguiling and (true to its name) less family-friendly than Stranger Things.1420 The Death and Life of Marsha P Johnson (Film, 2017)Though it’s been somewhat tarnished by claims that director David France appropriated the work and research of trans film-maker Reina Gossett, this documentary is nonetheless a loving, respectful tribute to gay rights activist Marsha P Johnson. One of the key figures in the Stonewall uprising (though her involvement was almost entirely eradicated in 2015’s critically hated Stonewall), Johnson modelled for Andy Warhol, performed onstage with drag group Hot Peaches, helped found the Gay Liberation Front, and then died under suspicious circumstances in 1992.1520 On My Block (TV series, one season, 2018–)This coming-of-age series might not have found as many eyeballs as it deserved last year, but those it did find were glued to the screen. In fact, it was the most-binged show of 2018 – meaning that it had the highest watch-time-per-viewing session of any Netflix original. Created by Awkward’s Lauren Iungerich, On My Block follows a group of Los Angeles teens as they navigate both the drama of high school and the danger of inner-city life.Two beleaguered assistants (Zoey Deutch and Glen Powell) conspire to get their over-demanding bosses (Taye Diggs and Lucy Liu) together in order to get their lives back in this winning romantic comedy. Set It Up is responsible not only for coining the term “over-dicking” (it’s much more innocent than it sounds), but for rejuvenating a tired genre.Martin Freeman stars as the father struggling to protect his young daughter from a zombie epidemic spreading across Australia. So far, so overdone. But this drama thriller, directed by Ben Howling and Yolanda Ramke and based on their 2013 short of the same name, throws a handful of unpredictable ners in the works.    1920 Godless (TV series, one season, 2017–)With shades of John Ford\u0027s The Searchers, this languorous western was critically acclaimed but swiftly forgotten after it landed on Netflix in 2016. Set in 1884, it\u0027s about Frank Griffin (Jeff Daniels) and his notoriously ruthless gang of outlaws’ pursuit of their injured former ally Roy Goode (Jack O’Connell), who is hiding out in a small town populated solely by women after a mining accident killed off all its men. A gun-toting Michelle Dockery, clearly relishing the change of scenery after years of Downton Abbey, and a taciturn Jack O’Connell, are on brilliant form.2020 Atypical (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)This coming-of-age series about a teenage boy with autism was sweet and well-intentioned from the start, but its first season was criticised for a handful of inaccuracies, and for its lack of autistic actors. Rather than drowning in a sea of defensiveness – as too many shows tend to do – it listened, and brought in autistic actors and writers for its excellent second season.Those hoping for a return to the mystical island filled with hostiles, hatches and Hurley may have to wait a bit longer, although Cuse and co-creator Damon Lindelof have previously said they expect a reboot to occur at some stage in the future – but they won’t be attached.In 2017, Cuse was reported as saying: “Damon and I are pretty adamant about the fact that we don’t have any intentions of rebooting Lost. I know that there are a lot of shows that have been rebooted lately, but we are not on that path.“Independent Minds Q\u0026ampA session on the Middle East, Trump, Syria and IsisCuse wrote Lost alongside co-creator Damon Lindelof until its series finale in 2010. Lindelof went on to oversee HBO’s little-seen standout The Leftovers which drew to a conclusion in 2017 after a season many hailed as one of the greatest in recent memory. He’ll next tackle an adaptation of Watchmen for the premium cable service.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The craft even did some science of their own: WALL-E took its own photos, and EVE did some simple radio science.Nasa\u0027s Mars InSight lander sends back stunning first selfieBecause the technology was experimental, Nasa weren\u0027t relying on either of the CubeSats working at all. If they had broken on their way – as engineers suspected they might – the data would still have been sent back but it would have taken much longer to receive it.After their work was done at Mars, they carried on off into space. WALL-E hasn\u0027t sent a message since 29 December, and is thought to be more than a million miles past Mars EVE is even further away, at about two million miles, and hasn\u0027t spoken to Nasa since 4 January.Researchers don\u0027t know exactly why the pair have lost touch. WALL-E has a leaky thruster and might be wobbling so that it can\u0027t send commands. The sensors that allow them to charge their batteries from the sun might also have broken.They will continue flying away from Earth as February goes on, making sending any data\u0026nbspever more difficult and so meaning that Nasa don\u0027t expect to ever hear back.This mission was always about pushing the limits of miniaturized technology and seeing just how far it could take us, said Andy Klesh, the mission\u0027s chief engineer at JPL. We\u0027ve put a stake in the ground. Future CubeSats might go even farther.Nasa hopes to use the same technology – which allows spacecraft to be launched cheaply and easily – to venture off elsewhere in the solar system in future missions.There\u0027s big potential in these small packages, said John Baker, the MarCO program manager at JPL. CubeSats - part of a larger group of spacecraft called SmallSats - are a new platform for space exploration that is affordable to more than just government agencies.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

These are major differentials.”Meanwhile, tenants in Manchester pay an average rent of £496, against £1,053 in the capital. One chart that shows why Londoners are the poorest workers in the UKLondon is over. I\u0027m so glad I leftRenters are leaving London in record numbers. Where are they going?A new survey has revealed what Britons hate the most about LondonThe cost of living in every part of the world in one infographicThe ‘Northern pound’ is “essentially a difference in the cost of living”, Mr Johnes said, and the fact that money goes further outside the capital explains why more than half (53 per cent) of Londoners said they would move away from the city and accept a lower salary elsewhere, while just 31 per cent in the North said they would consider moving. This benefits both jobseekers and employers, Mr Johnes said, because companies will find it easier to hire staff and workers will find their money goes further, even if they are being paid a smaller amount. “So it’s a win for consumers and a win for businesses,” he said. Martin Talbot, director at Totaljobs, added: “Gone are the days where a salary is enough to secure the best talent today’s jobseekers are increasingly valuing work-life balance and their wellbeing above all else. “Northern cities are seeing a rise in job opportunities as UK companies no longer think the capital is the be all and end all. Many northern cities offer lots of other advantages too, from a shorter (and cheaper) commute, great cultural scene, and a more affordable social life. “No matter where they’re based, it’s key for businesses to highlight not just their employer brand, but the lifestyle their local area can provide existing and potential employees.”However, the researchers noted that London is unlikely to be abandoned by UK workers. “London will be fine, London is still a great place to live. It has been and will continue to be a centre of gravity,” said Mr Johnes. The survey also revealed that Londoners have different priorities for spending, with 16 per cent of people living in the city taking five or more holidays per year, compared with 9 per cent in the North.cost of livingOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But what about the impact on firms that only sell in the UK? Ben Chu looks at the possible consequencesClick to followThe IndependentSupermarkets may sell only to British-based customers but around 30 per cent of our food is imported from the EUThe Brexit media spotlight has, for understandable reasons, tended to shine on exporting firms and major manufacturers with just-in-time supply chains, such as Nissan.These businesses are clearly at severe risk from the impact of a no-deal Brexit because they would suddenly face EU tariffs or import delivery problems that could shatter their ability to function.But what about UK firms that don’t export or manufacture? What about those companies that simply serve the domestic\u0026nbspmarket? What about smaller companies? What might the impact on them be?For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialThe answer is (as so often): it depends. If these firms rely on imports for their stock they too are severely exposed to any problems at the border. Think of supermarkets and grocers. They may sell only to British-based customers, but around 30 per cent of our food is imported from the European Union.Retailers that source “fast-fashion” clothing items from developing countries\u0026nbspcould also be adversely affected. That applies as much to small independent shops as it does to department stores.Created with Sketch.Brexit and travel: all you need to know Show all 14Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.British passports that expire after 29 March 2019 will continue to be valid as UK travel documents, but will lose the power that comes with being a European Union passport – notably the right of free movement within the EU27.You will still be able to travel to the EU with your pet after Brexit, but it could well get more complicated depending on the status that the European Union decide to apply.

In theory, mobile phone firms can impose whatever fees they think the market will bear.The impact on domestic manufacturers that mainly sell in the UK will depend on the share of the raw materials they import.Another likely problem for these domestic-focused importers is the pound. Most analysts expect a no-deal Brexit to result in another major fall in the value of sterling versus other currencies.How UK businesses are preparing for BrexitThis would push up their import costs. Some may have taken out hedges against such currency volatility. But those that haven’t will find their costs rise sharply. Smaller firms, in particular, are much less likely to have hedging protection.Liam Fox, the trade secretary, has this week floated the idea of the government abolishing all import tariffs entirely in a no-deal scenario. This could (notwithstanding delivery delays) mean a surge in the availability of cheap manufactured or produce imports from around the world. Even firms that only serve the UK domestic market and don’t import at all could struggle to cope with this sudden burst of cheaper competition.Another factor for domestic-focused firms to consider is the macroeconomic impact of no deal. If this inflicts a severe shock to the overall UK economy – resulting in lower consumer spending and a slump in investment spending by firms – that would probably hit the sales of most domestic firms, regardless of any border or tariff issues. If a no-deal Brexit harms the financial sector, domestic firms may find it harder to access bank borrowing.These firms could also be hit by a shortage of workers if a no-deal scenario results in an exodus of EU workers. Almost a tenth of workers in the construction sector – 200,000 – are EU-born. In retail, hotels and restaurants the share is 25 per cent.The important thing to remember about the UK economy is that everything is connected – no firm, whatever its main market, is an island.Got an unanswered question about Brexit?

Thus, the post-crash recession of 2008 was less severe than it might have been.Under the Maastricht Treaty of 1992, the UK and Denmark were the\u0026nbsponly EU member states relieved of the requirement to join the euro once certain economic conditions were in place, for example on government borrowing and inflation (the “convergence criteria”).For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialThat treaty was eventually subsumed into the Lisbon Treaty of 2007. The European Commission states: “The treaty does not specify a particular timetable for joining the euro area, but leaves it to member states to develop their own strategies for meeting the condition for euro adoption. Seven of the 13 member states who joined the EU since 2004 have already joined the euro area, most recently Lithuania on 1 January 2015.” The UK and Denmark’s “opt-outs” are still in force.The question now arises, then, of whether this special situation would continue of the Brexit process, under article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty, were now paused or revoked (ie reversed).What’s behind the latest Brexit row over Gibraltar?The short answer to that is yes. The UK would remain, as now, a member state under existing terms. Including the euro opt-out.However, if the UK were to formally leave the EU at any point, even under a “soft Brexit” and remaining in the European Economic Area, the single market or customs union, it would still need to reapply for membership in the usual fashion if it wanted to return. Just as, say, Albania or Serbia are now, the UK would become a “candidate” for accession.This would require acceptance of the “acquis communautaire” – all the rules, regulations and laws of the EU as they currently stand. Any exceptions would have to be agreed by the EU.Created with Sketch.

A distinctly 21st century image of friends hanging out. They will talk to each other, of course, in between these scenes of mobile gazing, but their phones will lead the conversations and their screens will set the agendas.  A sign sums up three aspects of the modern British high street: despairing indifference from the bottom up against the status quo the rapid emergence of betting on the future and a simple message of family togetherness.Civilians look on in support of uniformed marchers – men, women and children – returning to the car park at the back of Iceland to finish the Armistice Day ceremony.A lady stops to read a sign of solidarity with victims of suicide in the UK. The bearer of the sign completed a 32-minute silence to show her support for the 32 people who, on average, take their own lives in Britain every day.A counter-attack on the dominant Armistice Day narrative of peace. It’s a risky and rare question to ask the high street in a city so adherent to the story of sacrifice. The heresy blends – or disappears – within a blur of urban reflections and the giddy faces of Christmas capitalism. Not quite the changing of colour that the charity sign has in mind, but I am thankful for this fleeting glimpse of a “green” landscape, bringing colour – momentarily – to an otherwise grey concrete and overcast city. Fairground rides are assembled at the end of the high street in preparation for the turning-on of the Christmas lights. In the process of construction, when all the parts aren’t put together and fully formed, the ride and the flag and the worker look pathetic and comical. There are gasps from the crowd as a veteran and a boy scout faint during the two-minute silence at the cenotaph on Armistice Day. They are cared for – in silence – as the ritual continues.The devil draped in the St George’s cross barks from behind the window at a father and son on the street. Engraved on the plinth is a message fitting for an English hell – “The Devil’s Den awaits the virtuous for conversion” – where the good are corrupted in the process of assimilation. Polish graffiti in support of the football team Legia Warsaw. I wonder about its intended audience. It can’t be for the non-Polish reading British majority, so it must be a territorial message for other Polish immigrants in the city. I speak with the lady in the picture and she presumes it’s Czech, because, as she told me, there are a lot of Czech people sleeping on the streets in Plymouth.Outside the Old Duke, three parts of three human bodies occupy different roles in the scene: one sits and smokes one drinks and watches music one sleeps on a picnic bench outside. A family leaving the Armistice Day ceremony. The father holds his hand out to his boys, asking for their bond and union, and the elder boy, not wanting to leave his younger brother behind and imitating his role model, repeats the gesture. A genuine, unstaged, unposed human moment on a day so well-rehearsed.A view of the Tinside Lido from the Hoe, deserted in late autumn, its pastel blue submerging into dirty water, darker than the sea, muddier than the hills. But it is still beautiful, not only geometrically with its lines and curves against the fluidity of the ocean, but also as an emblem of a British seaside culture slowly fading.An urban fox uses the public toilets at Bristol Temple Meads train station, adapted to human civilisation, more confident now, wine under arm, dressed up, ready for the Saturday night ahead. A distinctly 21st century image of friends hanging out. They will talk to each other, of course, in between these scenes of mobile gazing, but their phones will lead the conversations and their screens will set the agendas.  A sign sums up three aspects of the modern British high street: despairing indifference from the bottom up against the status quo the rapid emergence of betting on the future and a simple message of family togetherness.Civilians look on in support of uniformed marchers – men, women and children – returning to the car park at the back of Iceland to finish the Armistice Day ceremony.A lady stops to read a sign of solidarity with victims of suicide in the UK. The bearer of the sign completed a 32-minute silence to show her support for the 32 people who, on average, take their own lives in Britain every day.A counter-attack on the dominant Armistice Day narrative of peace.

There the Bank of England would be represented along with the other central banks.In due course, when the convergence criteria had been met, the UK would then join the euro and abolish the pound, first in bank deposits and then in notes and coins. However, it is interesting that Sweden maintains that it is not obliged to join the euro, and would only do so after a referendum. It has been an EU member since 1994 and still uses the krona.The UK joining the euro would be a controversial question, as it was when it was a live issue in the 1990s.If history is any guide, and with acknowledged flaws in the eurozone’s governance, joining the euro would be a significant obstacle to the UK rejoining the EU, if the EU insisted on enforcing it. Critics would claim it would mean bailing out Greece or Italy at great costs. Supporters would point to how it would make cross-border trade and price transparency much easier.Got an unanswered question about Brexit?

But if we are able to make progress sooner, then that might not be necessary.“We can’t know at this stage exactly which of those scenarios would happen.”There is\u0026nbspgrowing concern\u0026nbspamong ministers that there is not enough time to pass the necessary legislation before exit day,\u0026nbspamid reports that the February recess could be cancelled to give Ms May more time to win over the EU.Mr Hunt said a solution had “not been properly worked up” to replace the\u0026nbspIrish backstop – which aims to prevent a hard border on the island of Ireland.\u0026nbspMPs backed a bid to\u0026nbspreplace it\u0026nbspwith “alternative arrangements” in a series of crunch votes on Tuesday.He said it was “difficult to know” if negotiations would run to the end of March, but added: “Whereas a week ago none of us really knew whether this was going to be possible, we are now in a situation where it clearly is possible.“There are lots and lots of hurdles –\u0026nbspno one is saying this isn’t going to be very challenging –\u0026nbspbut we do now have a consensus in parliament.“Providing we can do that, which I think we can, then I think there is a way through.”However his Austrian counterpart, Karin Kneissl, said it would be “very difficult” for the Brexit timeframe to be extended and warned that Britain could be heading for a no-deal exit.She said: “According to the Article 50 procedures, the deadline is 29 March,\u0026nbspso there is a time pressure because what couldn’t be reached by negotiation over the last years, it’s very difficult to imagine that there can be a tremendous breakthrough – a magic solution – in the next few days in order also to have this ratified in due time for the remaining EU members.”Created with Sketch.

The Treaty of Canterbury between the UK and France governs the Channel Tunnel link and operations will continue – subject to any local disruption at Folkestone andor CalaisMotorists, whether taking their own cars or hiring abroad, are likely to need to obtain an International Driving Permit or two different EU countries are signed up to different treaties, so for a trip embracing Spain and France you would need both types.Even in the event of a no-deal Brexit, flights will continue to operate between the UK and European Union.The network of flight links between Britain and eastern Europe could be affected by any reduction in the number of workers from those countries. Not only do they use the flights – so do their families and friendsCurrent European passengers’ rights rules, known as EC2612004, stipulate high payouts for delays and cancellations that cannot be attributed to “extraordinary circumstances”. Buried in a document called Beyond the Horizon: The Future of UK Aviation, the government says “the UK will not fall below current standards of protection when we leave the EU”814 Entry regulations to the European UnionFrom 11pm GMT on 29 March 2019, UK travellers will become “third-country nationals” when travelling to Schengen countries and subject to the standard rules of admission for citizens of nations such as the US, Japan and Australia. That means there must be at least 90 days (roughly three months) left on your passport beyond your intended date of departure.914 Online registration prior to travel – ETIASFrom 2021, non-EU nationals who do not require a visa to enter the Schengen area – including British travellers – will need to request prior authorisation to visit Schengen countries.A large number of travel providers – even including National Express coaches – have added “Brexit clauses” to their terms and conditions. These generally specify that they will not be liable for “consequential losses” as a result of Brexit-related issues1114 ‘Fast track’ lanes for passport control entering EU countriesBritish passport holders will not be able to use them, and must join the queue for third-country nationals.The ferry industry insists vessels will continue to sail. The UK Chamber of Shipping says: “Unlike the carriage of cargo, trade deals do not have a significant effect on the cruise and passenger ferry industry. The explicit standardisation of commodity codes and tariffs associated with trade deals have little relevance to holidaymakers.”The EU says: “If you fall ill or have an accident during a visit to another EU country, as an EU citizen you have the right to receive the necessary public healthcare in any EU country under the same conditions as people in the host country.” The EHIC also works in Iceland, Norway, Switzerland and Liechtenstein. From 30 March 2019, the law banning mobile phone firms from charging extra for calls and data in Europe will cease, though operators have yet to set out exactly what will replace it. In theory, mobile phone firms can impose whatever fees they think the market will bear.Earlier, there were rumours that the government might try to wriggle out of the commitment – amid fears it would open up another opportunity for parliament to “take control”.Mr Lidington insisted the prime minister had been “completely clear” that the votes would be on 14 February, if it was too soon to stage a second ‘meaningful vote’ on the deal by that date.After the EU’s refusal to renegotiate the withdrawal agreement, it appears certain the “legally binding” changes Ms May is seeking cannot be agreed by next week.Ms Thornberry said the answer was “staring the government in the face”, which was to accept Labour’s call for a permanent customs union, something the Commons would support.‘Special place in hell’ for pro-Brexit campaigners, Tusk saysRight-wing think tank issued with formal warning for Brexit report‘We’re totally in the dark’ – Belfast locals on Brexit“Plan A has been resoundingly rejected by parliament, plan B was ruled out by the EU months ago and the government is in danger of sleepwalking the country towards leaving with no plan and no deal at all,” she warned.“So, with just over 50 days to go, can I give the minister a final opportunity to tell us whether there is a better plan than this or for goodness sake will he let parliament take charge instead?”Ms May’s official spokesman said afterwards: “The very clear position of the prime minister is that there will not be an extension of Article 50.”The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

In his first interview since announcing his run for prime minister, he cited the dismantling of settlements in Gaza in 2005 as an example that could be replicated in the West Bank.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trial“All sides had a lot at stake and the state managed to do it without tearing the country apart. It was done legally, carried out by the State of Israel and the IDF, and even though it was very painful for the settlers, it was handled well,” he said.“We must take the lessons of the disengagement and implement them in other arenas.”Many Israelis consider the Gaza disengagement under then prime minister Ariel Sharon a historic mistake that emboldened the Islamist group Hamas.Created with Sketch.Palestinians await Israeli demolition of their homes in the West Bank  Show all 7Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Children play as their parents prepare for their homes to be destroyed (Bel Trew)A toddler plays in the dirt of Khan al-Ahmar village (Bel Trew)Palestinian flags festoon the Bedouin village of Khan al-Ahmar as they await eviction (Bel Trew)Children play as their parents brace themselves for the bulldozers (Bel Trew)Iman, 7, says she does not want to leave her home (Bel Trew)The demolition order includes the village’s school, which provides education for some 170 children from five different Bedouin communities.\u0026nbsp(Bel Trew)The playground of the school which will likely be demolished in the coming days (Bel Trew)Children play as their parents prepare for their homes to be destroyed (Bel Trew)A toddler plays in the dirt of Khan al-Ahmar village (Bel Trew)Palestinian flags festoon the Bedouin village of Khan al-Ahmar as they await eviction (Bel Trew)Children play as their parents brace themselves for the bulldozers (Bel Trew)Iman, 7, says she does not want to leave her home (Bel Trew)The demolition order includes the village’s school, which provides education for some 170 children from five different Bedouin communities.\u0026nbsp(Bel Trew)The playground of the school which will likely be demolished in the coming days (Bel Trew)But the continued growth of settlements in the West Bank is seen as one of the greatest barriers to an eventual peace deal between Israel and the Palestinians. More than 400,000 Israelis live in the territory, and a further 200,000 in East Jerusalem, both of which were captured by Israel in the 1967 Arab-Israeli war.Most of the international community views settlements as illegal – in 2016 the United Nations Security Council passed a resolution that described them as a “flagrant violation” of international law. Palestinians argue they harm the chances of a two-state solution by taking land that would eventually make up a Palestinian state.Settlement construction has surged under Donald Trump, who has taken a more relaxed approach to the issue than previous presidents. Data compiled by Peace Now, an advocacy group in Israel, found that construction had risen 20 per cent in the first nine months of 2018, compared with the year before.Speaking on Tuesday, the UN secretary general\u0026nbspAntonio Guterres\u0026nbspdescribed settlements as “a major obstacle to peace”, which should be “halted and reversed”.“Ongoing settlement construction and expansion in the occupied West Bank, including East Jerusalem, is illegal under United Nations resolutions and international law,” he said. “A two-state solution is the only way to achieve the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people and secure a sustainable solution to the conflict.”According to current polling, Mr Gantz is expected to win about 24 seats in the Knesset, trailing Mr Netanyahu’s Likud\u0026nbspby six seats.The former general,\u0026nbspfrequently described as “charismatic” in profiles,\u0026nbspwas the Israeli army’s chief of staff during the 2014 Gaza war, codenamed Operation Protective Edge. Mr Gantz has highlighted his role in the war in promotional material for his campaign.Israel launched the military operation in the Gaza Strip following the kidnapping and murder of three Israeli teenagers by Hamas members. The subsequent war left more than 2,200 Palestinians dead.“Sixty-three per cent, or 1,391, did not take part in the fighting, including 526 minors,” according to Israeli human rights group B’Tselem. “It is estimated that 18,000 homes were destroyed or severely damaged and that more than 100,000 Palestinians were rendered homeless.” \u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

You have to beat them with a totally dferent game.Nearly  per cent of her donations were small inidual contributions, while less than one per cent of Crowleys contributions were.The Ocasio-Cortez campaign spent , as opposed to the Crowley campaign of . million.Ocasio-Cortez has not previously held elected office, and her campaign video began with her saying Women like me arent supposed to run for office.Ocasio-Cortez has won a spot on the prestigious House Committee on Oversight and Reform.It has the power to investigate Trump, but before that she will get to question Michael Cohen.His anticipated testimony before Congress is scheduled for February , and she will get to question any Trump administration official that will be investigated by the .Cohen agreed to go before the committee before he beings this three-year prison stint next month.Trumps former fixer was convicted after the FBI raided his offices in April  and seized document relating to payments to porn star Stormy Daniels. The Democrat confirmed her position on Twitter.Donald Trump shut the  US government down on December  after the Democrats refused to approve funding for his promised wall.Ocasio-Cortez suggested that Congressional salaries should furloughed along with federal workers.She tweeted: Next time we have a gov shutdown, Congressional salaries should be furloughed as well.It’s completely unacceptable that members of Congress can force a government shutdown on partisan lines  then have Congressional salaries exempt from that decision. Have some integrity.On December  she added: The GOP had control of the House, Senate, AND the Presidency + STILL couldn’t keep gov open.That ineptitude means k fed workers won’t get paychecks, and have to negotiate with landlords + creditors over the holidays. This isn’t how you treat people.When it comes to policy, she recently suggested a  per cent tax on the super wealthy to fund her Green New Deal.She explained her idea to Anderson Cooper in a  Minutes interview and defended her income tax rate and said: There’s an element where yeah, people are going to have to start paying their fair share in taxes.”Ocasio-Cortez has come under fire for floating the idea.Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee tweeted: Im just fine w  Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez dancing Im NOT fine w  her tax proposals.

The Tories need to show they’re above that.We don’t agree with much of Nick Boles’s plan for a Brexit so soft as to be barely Brexit at all. This week’s amendment, co-signed by Boles and Yvette Cooper, could have holed the whole operation below the waterline.But that does not mean he should be deselected. The Tory party has always been a broad church and it serves as a better party of government when pragmatism is its guiding force.For the first time in months, the Conservatives have shown the sort of professionalism and unity that the public expects of them.They must keep it together.IT is an outrage that speedboat killer Jack Shepherd continues to claim legal aid despite refusing toto Britain.Justice Secretary David Gauke cannot simply put his hands in the air and claim he’s powerless to do anything.Everybody has a right to a fair trial, and that often means help with legal costs.

So why lie Some people have been asking this weekjail is the best punishment for a speeding fine. But let’s be clear: She is not going to prison for speeding — she is going to prison for perverting the course of justice by lying about who was driving her car.That would be bad enough for an average citizen. But Onasanya is not an average citizen. She is a solicitor — and also an MP.An MP is known by the title ­“Honourable” for a reason: There is a code of conduct outlined for MPs which includes, among other things, integrity and honesty.Any MP has even more obligation than the average person to set a good example and to take responsibility for their actions — both of which she has failed, spectacularly, to do. She has acted asshe is above the law, which is simply not acceptable for someone whose job is to uphold the law.She no longer deserves the privilege of representing anyone in the legal or parliamentary system and it is clear to any right-thinking ­person that she should be struck off as a solicitor — and resign as an MP.It is her refusal to do this immediately which is the most astonishing thing about this story.That, plus Corbyn’s lack of ­leadership in not insisting she resign as soon as she was found guilty.By all accounts, it sounds like she was out of her depth as an MP from the get go. For a start, constituents complained she was uncontactable.She also spent £, of taxpayer’s money in seven months on “expenses” and was caught on video ­pretending to snort “cocaine”, which isn’t exactly a great look for an MP.The trial judge concluded the “truth comes a very distant second to your personal ambition, doesn’t it ”Whether or not that’s true, it is hard not to conclude, in the face of the evidence against her, that her refusal to resign as an MP is rooted in the £, salary it yields.But how is she going to help her constituents from prison One argument being made about her being sent to jail is that she is clearly not a danger to society, which is true. But the problem for the courts is thatyou take an oath to tell the truth, then fail to do so, it has to be considered a serious offence — and punished accordingly.Without a deterrent to stop people lying through their teeth, the justice system would collapse.Let’s face it, there is nothing about this story that makes Onasanya look good.She is going to have an ­electronic tag when she comes out.No doubt she is massively regretting not owning up to speeding in the first place — and taking the consequences.Her le is now in tatters.But resigning as an MP now might help her claw back a tiny bit of respect for finally doing the right thing. As a solicitor and an MP, she needs to take full responsibility for her actions.IT’S shocking that Bonita Baxter, a heavily pregnant woman with a serious heart condition, was forced to sit on an AE floor at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham for five hours after patients and visitors refused to give up their seats.Clearly, manners are no longer important to this nation.But the real issue is that the hospital was so overcrowded that, given the five-hour wait, no one was going to give up their seat.AE departments continue to be overcrowded in part because we continue to abuse the NHS, turning up to AE for anything from drunkenness to a broken fingernail.Anyone who has ever had to pay for their healthcare, as they do in North America, would respect our health service much, much more.In the meantime, we need to put measures in place to make sure that people start valuing what they have.There should be fines for people who don’t attend GP and hospital appointments.And AE should start turning away anything other than genuine emergencies.T’S heart-breaking, isn’t it, ­listening to Vicky Pattison blaming herself for the fact her fiancé, John Noble, had “grown close to” other women during a boys’ trip to Dubai “When something like this happens, you blame yourself and I did question myself. MaybeI was thinner he wouldn’t have done what he did,” she said on TV on Wednesday.Apparently, this charmer actually blamed her – and her size – saying that he was “set up” to cheat because of it. Vicky, darling,you are reading this: It’s not your fault he cheated. And no amount of dieting would have stopped him.A cheater’s always going to cheat.You need to take some time out to focus on yourself and decide not to be around people who make you feel bad about yourself. There is so much pressure on women today.There is so much emphasis on how they look and how other people see them, rather than a focus on real values, like the size of your brain.So I suppose it’s easy to understand how Vicky concluded that her appearance might be the “problem”.When the reality is just that she picked an a***hole to go out with.I ABHOR fat-shaming, and rudeness. And I have zero sympathy for the woman who refused to sit between two overweight passengers on a United Airlines flight from Las Vegas to New York.She caused a horrible scene and loudly called them “big pigs”, which is truly shocking.But luckily the shame was all hers, as her tirade went viral on social media – and she was thrown off the flight.It’s also true thatyou book a flight then you are entitled to the seat you’ve booked, andsomeone is taking up half of yours that’s not fair.But this issue should be dealt with by the airline, not passengers.Many airlines have an “obesity policy”. American Airlines, for example, requires passengers to purchase a second seatthey need a seatbelt extension and their body “extends more than one inch beyond the outermost edge of the arm rest”.I can imagine it’s a dficult and embarrassing rule to enforce – but it’s better than people taking matters into their ownhands.For once, I can say I did not stray, not even so much as once.THE Europeans screaming that the Irish backstop must remain are deluded.No Deal will affect Europe as much as – and in some cases, more than – the UK.And when the French farmers realise they can’t get their cheese across the border before it rots, and the Spanish – who sell more goods and services to the UK than it buys – are stranded with decaying goods, and when German car sales slump because tarfs make them too expensive, I predict riots across Europe.And then Michael Barnier will have a small dose of the pain he has inflicted on our PM.The reality is that citizens of these European countries, whose jobs will be under threat by No Deal, will not give a hootthere is or isn’t a hard border in Ireland.And frankly, all companies collect VAT for the Government and PAYE for them, so why not let them do the same for tarfs and be their own custom offices The Government can audit them once every three months, then the problem is solved.APPARENTLY, dog-walking in Tehran has been outlawed by the Islamic government in a crackdown against pet ownership.Dog owners will even face penaltiesspotted carrying their pets in a car.Tehran’s chief of police, Brigadier-General Hossein Rahimi, said the ban had been introduced because dogs “create fear and anxiety” among members of the public.Ironically, my experience is that dogs create exactly the opposite reaction.But what do you expect from a country that doesn’t allow women to initiate orce, dance or report a rape .Our country might be crazy at the moment, but let’s all breathe a sigh of relief we live here, rather than there.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Here, leading Conservative Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg offers his view:THE EU has taken an almost religious approach to Britain’s latest move towards securing a Brexit deal.The compromise put forward by my fellow MP Kit Malthouse has been immediately dismissed and any prospect of further negotiation turned away. The mighty EU has spoken and will not be gainsaid.In negotiating the compromise, both Leavers and Remainers made concessions. This has led to criticism from their supporters, as I found in my weekly radio show on LBC.Callers felt that I had become a “snowflake” in my willingness to see £billion of taxpayers’ money spent without giving us any advantage in future negotiations.The legal basis for the EU demanding money is weak. A House of Lords report came to the conclusion that while there could be a moral obligation, under UK, EU and international law there was no valid or forceful claim.The only motive for paying is to secure a good future deal, rather than to pay a ransom for our freedom.Yet I have come to the conclusion that leaving on March  is at risk and exiting the EU is a prize worth paying for and on which thewill be great.Unfortunately, in spite of the Referendum result, the majority of MPs are reluctant to see the UK part from the EU and at the least want terms that mirror our membership.This may well not be the view of most voters, who seem to welcome the clean break and are not fearful of the scare stories.It is, therefore, crucial to ensure the fears of those who are far from enthusiastic Brexiteers are assuaged. This is where the Malthouse Compromise comes in.By offering money and making the prospect of a No Deal Brexit unlikely, possible moderate former Remainers are willing to avoid Parliamentary tactics that would frustrate our departure.They can accept the replacement of the backstop, which could keep us tied in to the EU’s rules and courts forever, with a routine trade agreement based on existing processes commonly used around the world.This would not hamper the development of a future relationship which would be discussed once we have left. Although in these discussions we would lose the leverage of cash, we would not be squeezed by the backstop.The second stage of the compromise is that the implementation period could be extended by one year. Currently the withdrawal agreement proposes a maximum of two years.In this time we would remain subject to EU laws and what follows, but it makes the prospect of not finalising a future relationship less likely, which gives comfort to those who are determined to avoid No Deal.In my view, an extra  months of vassalage after  years is an unwelcome but not unaffordable price to pay. Critics may ask why Brexiteers want to lessen the chance of a No Deal departure — and the reason is simple.Regardless of the folly of Project Fear, which becomes more preposterous by the day, the Parliamentary arithmetic means we must either lessen the prospect by compromise or it will be done by sharp practice in the House of Commons.This could lead to delay or even no Brexit at all. This would destroy any remaining trust of politicians in our constitutional settlement, it would show reckless contempt for voters, yet the Brexit-denying amendment put forward by Yvette Cooper last week was only defeated by  votes.As with all compromises, Malthouse is not perfect but is enough for each side of the argument in the UK to accept.The question remains, will the EU response be positive  So far, it has not.This has always been at the heart of the debate, and in a way a compelling reason for going. Is the EU a Mafia-style organisation that has to punish countries that do not subscribe to its religion Their response to the Malthouse Compromise and the PM’s request to re-open the text will answer this question. It must be clear to the EU that the current withdrawal agreement will not do.Defeated in the Commons by the largest margin ever achieved in the lower house on Government business, it is simply too one-sided and allows too great a triumph to the EU.If the EU were to insist on its inalterability requiring the punishment of a recalcitrant, freedom-loving nation then it will reveal its true and barbarous colours. It would be evident on its own that we are right to leave.How much better it would bethis were wrong and that in fact the EU is the civilised organisation it claims to be — respecting democracy, the nation state and constitutional procedures.

Mrs May has no intention of playing this ace — and never had.There are other worrying signs.This showdown with EU hardliners requires fresh thinking and shrewd advice from seasoned players. Crawford Falconer, an ex-World Trade Organisation ambassador, was recruited by the Brexit department for precisely these skills.Indeed, he is the ONLY person in the Government machine who has ever negotiated a trade deal.Yet bafflingly, Mrs May is keeping this star player on the sidelines.Instead, she will fly to Brussels with Whitehall mandarin Olly Robbins, the pro-EU fanatic who plunged Britain into the backstop trap she is now under pressure to escape from.Robbins hates Brexit and has privately warned the PM this is Mission Impossible.Mrs May — herself a Remainer who has never grasped the case for Brexit — will be joined by trusted “deputy PM” David Lidington, a dyed-in-the-wool Brussels worshipper.In such company, even the inclusion in her team of a thundering Brexiteer Attorney-General Geoffrey Cox is only mildly reassuring.Mrs May is notoriously stubborn. She can also be devious.After nearly three years, even her closest political colleagues — who can be counted on one hand with a couple of missing digits — have no idea what her Brexit might look like.Voters are increasingly irritated by this foot-dragging.Why should we remain part of an organisation that wants to punish us by stealing Gibraltar, Northern Ireland and our car industry Nobody who watched the brutal humiliation of poor little Greece will be surprised. This tragic and insolvent nation should never have been admitted to the EU, still less the Eurozone.Only with the assistance of US banking giant Goldman Sachs — “The Vampire Squid” — got them in under the wire. Once inside, they launched a borrowing and spending binge which ended in tears in the  crash.Greece might have flourished as a cheap but lovely tourist economy. Instead, it is now being cruelly tormented by Brussels and lumbered with multi-billion euros debts it can never repay.Greece symbolises all that is wrong with arrogant Brussels — the catastrophic Euro, inflexible economic policies and mass unemployment for under-s.Above all, there is the sneering contempt of unsackable Eurocrats for the million people they rule from subsidised ivory towers.Theresa May is a poor negotiator who never truly believed No Deal is better than a bad deal.Without this implicit threat, Brussels will give little and demand much in . It would be a pleasure to eat my words and watch Mrs May play a blinder.She can use her good luck to land a historic victory. Or she can blink and condemn Britain to colony status, paying billions more into EU coffers while being led by the nose on trade deal promises that never materialise.In which case, forget about that snap election fantasy.The Conservative Party would never be forgiven by the .million voters who voted Brexit — or those who wish they had.SECURITY CHIEFS are dusting off Cold War plans anticipating a Soviet nuclear strike to whisk the Queen to safety in the event of . . .  er . . . a No Deal Brexit.Presumably The Mall will be cleared of traffic and used as a landing strip to fly Her Maj out before revolutionary Remainers string her up for supporting Brexit.The only question is whether she will go quietly.The royals refused to leave London even after Buckingham Palace was bombed during the Second World War.This Project Fear nonsense is even more insane than the idea that thousands will die of fruit shortages.To quote Corporal Jones: “Don’t panic!!”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It’s the wild exaggerations of Project Fear II about No Deal anarchy.It’s the Remainer MPs who voted to trigger Article , then lied to voters about respecting the referendum result even as they plotted to reverse it.It’s the brass-necked Tory MP who claimed “Brexiteers were lying when they said Nissan was going nowhere” — long after it was clear the war on diesel was really to blame for the U-turn on the new model in Sunderland.Next to all that, an over-optimistic prediction or two and a slightly inaccurate bus slogan look small beer.Lies  Remain ultras should look in the mirror.TO Corbyn’s disgust, the Government has recognised a new leader in Venezuela instead of the hard-left loon Maduro who has let millions starve.What’s Jezza’s alternative  Do nothing.

Please stop victimizing me through the media.A pal said: After she and Harry got back from honeymoon, Meg sat down and wrote Thomas a long letter.She told him she loved him, she was heartbroken and wanted to put everything behind them.She forgave him for everything that had happened previously and just wanted to repair their relationship.Meg asked him to stop victimising her through the media and talk to her, not them.He replied in a very long letter, saying he loved her and wanted to make amends.But he finished the letter with the suggestion that the two of them should pose for a picture or stage a picture to show the world theyd made up.She was absolutely devastated.It was posing for pictures that had started this mess, and now he wanted to do the same thing with her She just couldnt believe it so she didnt reply.He has her number, she hasnt changed it. But hes never called or texted, despite what he says.The friends, said to be in Meghans inner circle, told the publication that the former actress had even called her dad on the morning of her wedding, saying: I think she will always feel genuinely devastated by what he has done.It come after Thomas Markle claimed he had not had any contact with Meghan since she married Prince Harry last May.He was left embarrassed after it emerged he had staged photographs with paparazzi in the lead up to the Royal Wedding.Friends said Meghan had asked her dad about the story before it was released, with the recluse swearing up and down it wasnt true.They said: The next day, the pictures come out.Thomas last year claimed he feared he had been ghosted by Meghan - begging her to text him.But Meghans friends said she had been a rock for everyone in her family, saying: The fact that this could be flipped around, that she was acting out or not caring for him, is preposterous.Sticking up for Meghan, the group of friends also hit out at claims she was dficult -  as well as speculation she had clashed with sister-in-law Kate Middleton.They said: She is the same person though everything around her has changed.There is nothing behind the feud with Kate. Its completely untrue.Pals also hit back at the abuse that the -year-old had faced since marrying Prince Harry - with it this week revealed that Kensington Palace were having to spend hours moderating and deleting abusive comments.Friends said: We want to stand up against the global bullying were seeing .Kensington Palace declined to comment."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/NINTCHDBPICT000466943782.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"no deal brexit would be fault of stubborn eurocrats playing hardball top brexiteer storms","story":"Chris Grayling launched a barnstorming attack on Brussels sayingwe left without a deal they would be entirely to blame, and not us.Just hours before it was revealed that Theresa May will dash to Brussels this week for talks with the EU over her deal, he said that Britain was doing all it could to try and reach agreement.But he warned in an interview with The Daily :  If they are not willing to compromise,theyre not willing to work with us to find common ground - it will be down to themthere is no deal.And he added: We want to work with the EU to reach a deal butthey are not prepared to do that - they will have to take responsibility that we are heading towards a no-deal exit.The EU have repeatedly insisted that they wont budge on the Irish border - saying the deal is done and dusted.He insisted Mrs May would be tough in the upcoming talks, but that there would be no chance of Article  being delayed at all.Ive been in every Cabinet meeting and theres been no conversation about delaying post-March , he said.We are not delaying Article .And Mr Grayling also slapped down scaremongering reports of food shortages after we leave the EU by saying: No, Im not stockpiling.Trade would continue to flow freely after we leave no matter what happens, we insisted.So its not a case that once we leave the EU that food supplies will suddenly dry up.His comments were echoed today by ex-Brexit boss Dominic Raab.In an interview with ConservativeHome this morning he said that: It will be important for people to see thatthe EU remain stubbornly intransigent, they are the ones courting the WTO exit.People understand that we need to leave on th March. Whether they voted Leave or Remain, the one thing you hear is get this thing done and dusted.Leaving without a deal wouldnt be the end of the world, but it wouldnt be a walk in the park, he said, which is also the view of Roberto Azevedo, the Director of the World Trade Organisation.Mr Raab even hinted that Britain could be SAFER after Brexit - because well be able to refuse entry to anyone that border officials are worried about.Britain is due to leave the EU on March  no matter what happens, but the PM has promised to go back and ask for changes to the hated Northern Irish backstop.Mrs May is still clinging to her deal, but accepts that MPs dont want it in its current form.She will come up with the plan to take to Brussels later this week which involves major changes to the Northern Ireland border."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/NINTCHDBPICT000285380856-e1549401659345.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"brexit secret high tech irish border","story":"Officials from DexEU have been quietly working on the blueprint – drawn up by Japanese firm Fujitsu – for  months.But, it has been rapidly dusted down in the last week after MPs voted to replace the current Irish backstop with a dferent one that could involve “alternative arrangements”.An  page briefing on the explosive Futitsu plan has been leaked to The Sun.Named the ‘Drive Through Border Concept’, it ensures there is no need for any physical checks on the border or hard infrastructure.Instead, a tracking system monitors vehicles on designated routes as they cross from Northern Ireland to the Republic via GPS as well as number plate recognition cameras.Brexit Secretary Steve Barclay is studying the plan closely.It has also been circulated among a working group of senior Tory Leavers and Remainers who have come together to propose a new backstop based on stand-off customs checks, dubbed the Malthouse Compromise.EU critics of the alternative arrangements to change the backstop have claimed the technology doesn’t yet exist to police the border and are years away.But The Sun’s revelation today heaps more pressure on PM Theresa May to agree to push the border plan during talks in Brussels tomorrow.The Sun has also learned that the working group has also been briefed on a goods tracking system in Africa that has used the same technology for the last  months.Designed to ward off bandits and hijackers, the Regional Electronic Cargo Tracking System operates across borders between Kenya, Rwanda and Uganda.A Tory minister involved in the talks told The Sun: “Given that we can land a probe the size of a fridge on Mars, it can’t be beyond us to devise an imperceptible system for a  mile border”.Fujitsu have promised DexEU that proof of concept trials on the border with  hauliers testing their system will be ready by March .Marked ‘Restricted – Commercial in Confidence’, the document also reveals the plan allowsProof of concept ready for a trial by March ,  hauliers to test itThe only infrastructure needed to run the system are number plate recognition cameras on approach roads to the border itself.But that could anger nationalists who will say it break Mrs May’s promise of no infrastructure at all.The Fujitsu system could also be rejected by the Northern Irish, who have a deep dislike of state surveillance that dates back to the Troubles era.A DExEU spokesperson said: Throughout this process the Government has explored options with firms and experts for proposals to solve the issue of the Irish border.As the Political Declaration makes clear, the UK and the EU have committed to exploring what alternative arrangements to the backstop might look like. We are also clear that those solutions can not include new border infrastructures.”THE French last night told Transport Secretary Chris Grayling he was not welcome at Calais after he announced plans to ert ferries from the port under a no deal Brexit.The head of the French port Jean-Marc Puissesseau said he was never welcome toto the port as he accused Mr Grayling of being “completely disrespectful” for failing to forewarn the French about his contingency plans.The Sun revealed in October that Mr Grayling had drawn up plans to lease space on ferries so the Government can redirect them to Rotterdam and Belgian ports in case of logjams at Calais.Mr Puissesseau said the Transport Secretary gave no warning about the proposals - despite attending a meeting with port officials who insisted they could cope with extra customs checks that would be neededBritain crashes out of the EU without a deal.The French port chief told the : “Mr Grayling came to us in November and asked uswe would be ready. We told him ‘yes’, though we did not know as much as we know today. He did not tell us that he wanted to reduce the activity [at Calais].“It is not fair at all, it is completely disrespectful. I don’t want to see him again.”Mr Puissesseau added that Calais had injected fresh cash for a new traffic light system that will help combat logjams under a no deal Brexit.Green will be for lorries that have the correct paperwork, amber for those who are not sure and red for vehicles with no paperwork.He joked that Mr Grayling was so unpopular that he would also have to pass throught the traffic light systemhe did attempt to visit Calais.Mr Puissesseau said: “I have heard he is ‘failing Grayling’...He will have to have a declarationhe comes to Calais. He will have to go through the orange lane.”The anti-Brexit Best for Britain group last night said the move effectively meant Mr Grayling was “banned” from Calais.One of its supporters and Labour MP Virendra Sharma said: “Surely this is peak Chris Grayling - only this time he’s gone international.“All he needs to do now is release a statement blaming everyone  and his predictable path of chaos will be complete.”A spokesman from the Department for Transport said: “While the Transport Secretary strongly supports work across Government with the EU to ensure a deal is reached, he will also continue to lead the DfT to ensure all contingencies are prepared for concerning Brexit.” Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

They will always let negotiations go to the wire.Greece was denied a bailout at first but then the EU gave in and handed it three, he pointed out.The Brexiteer lashed out at the confrontational approach of the bloc and said the bloc should offer us a full free trade agreement like it has with other states like Canada and New Zealand.And he urged: This is the time for Government and Parliament to hold their nerve.There is no case whatsoever for an Article  extension. Instead, we need to insist on a deal that is mutually beneficial - not punitive - and that can be shown to work for everyone.DUP leader Arlene Foster echoed his words today as Mrs May visited Northern Ireland to talk to businesses and leaders about how to solve the problem of the Irish border.She said after talks with the PM that she should stand strong in her efforts to try and get the deal changed.It is welcome that the Prime Minister is travelling to Brussels to seek changes but she must stand strong and by the commitments she made to the House of Commons, she said.MPs have demanded she goes back to Brussels to rip out the hated border backstop and replace it with something .So far the EU have stood firm and insisted they cant re-open the agreement.German Chancellor Angela Merkel is set to press the Irish to compromise on high tech solutions to the Irish border, it was revealed today.Shes spearheading efforts to try and get a deal over the line by getting everyone to come together.The Irish have dismissed any solutions so far, saying they dont exist or just dont work.But a source in Berlin told The Times that Mrs Merkel was very hopeful that the backstop could be solved with a combination of new technology and a sophisticated customs scheme.She is waiting for London to come forward with concrete proposals about how it would work,” the source said.Dublin will come under a lot of pressure over the coming weeks to work constructively with London.”Leo Varadkar, the Irish prime minister, has been called to Brussels today for talks with the bloc ahead of the PM flying out there tomorrow.Hes seeking aid from the EU to get Ireland ready for No Deal.Yesterday the bloc warned that Ireland faced a choice between keeping the border open to preserve the peace, and facing the prospect of a new border in the Irish sea which would see it ided from the rest of the bloc.He said this morning there was a growing desire in the bloc to do more to stop a No Deal from happening."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/NINTCHDBPICT000454117346.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"greg hands eu customs union free trade agreement brexit","story":"We’ve heard about all the dficulties leaving the EU presents, but we need a chance to learn more about the opportunities.Ninety per cent of global economic growth will come from outside the EU in the years ahead. Brexit allows us to look beyond the shores of the EU and to agree free trade deals with the US and countries like Canada and Japan through the Trans Pacic Partnership.I was one of the trade ministers until I resigned over Heathrow Airport expansion last summer. As Minister for Trade Policy, it was my job, working with Trade Secretary Liam Fox, to design Britain’s free trading future outside of the EU.And today, I have joined my colleague, David Davis, and lawyers, Shanker Singham and Barney Reynolds, to present a comprehensive UK-EU Free Trade Agreement- the most advanced free trade agreement ever developed. It shows how we can make the most of our post-Brexit future.Our FTA creates a level playing field in competition policy and state aid, so that UK and EU firms aren’t given unfair advantages over each other by their respective governments.It protects workers’ rights, ensures that financial services like banking and insurance can operate freely and it will allow us to help the developed world as we will be able to y our tarfs on their exports, helping them to develop their economies.We based it on existing arrangements that the EU has already agreed including with Canada and Japan, so we know the EU will want to agree a text similar to this one.Many people say that the EU takes many years to negotiate an FTA and cite the seven years it took to negotiate the CETA deal with Canada. This has often taken a long time because of long and protracted rows about tarfs and the level they should be set at.But the UK is in the unique position of having identical tarfs and regulations to the EU to begin with. So it shouldn’t take very long andwe’re conducting trade negotiations quickly with other countries around the world, it will put pressure on the EU to agree a deal quickly.Staying in the EU customs union would be the worst of all options. We would be unable to set our own trade and development policy and we wouldn’t have a say – we would have to defer to Brussels on it all.When it comes to trade talks,you don’t have a seat at the table, you’re probably on the menu!The EU would be negotiating trade deals on the UK’s behalf, but we would have no say. That is what leaving the EU but staying in its customs union would mean. We would be irrelevant in trade policy terms to the rest of the world and it would come as no surprise to mewe ended up at the back of everyone’s queues.The only way to overcome the challenges of leaving the EU, and to take advantage of the opportunities at the same time, is through a comprehensive and advanced FTA with the EU. This would allow us to negotiate comprehensive FTAs with others, and to once again be a force to be reckoned with at the World Trade Organisation.We need a strong and self-confident Britain on the world stage, making trade agreements that benefit British workers and consumers.Today’s publication of a draft but detailed Free Trade Agreement allows us to do exactly that."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/NINTCHDBPICT000462215077.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"danny dyer right royal family flaw","story":"A documentary that was as funny as it was surprising, and all the more so because the BBC did the right thing and played it absolutely straight.Genuine blue plaque television, in fact, that should never have been revisited or reformatted, not least because it would remind the Beeb that Danny’s wonderful everyman story had killed the whole WDYTYA franchise.So I’d been expecting this sucker punch, ever since its final credits rolled in .Danny Dyer’s Right Royal Family, on BBC. “A potty old adventure,” as his nibs described it, tracing Danny’s family line even further back, to Scandinavia’s King Rollo, his -times great grandfather, who I’d always assumed was a s children’s cartoon character, rather than a ninth-century Viking warrior.There were two episodes of it this time as well, which I know some of you thought were as funny as the original. Personally, I didn’t.What I hope we’re all agreed on, though, is the fact that Danny’s too busy playing Danny Dyer, the professional geezer, to be a good listener or natural TV historian.It’s an act that worked, of course, when he was wondering, “Eleanor of Aquitaine, was she a looker ” but didn’t serve him so well when presented with a longbow.“Long, innit ”The Beeb clocked this before production started, obviously, so had paired him up with dozens of head-patting historians and actors who got him to dress up as every kind of medieval t**t you can imagine. Like Mr Benn on crack, it was.Armour, codpieces, nappies, tights, doublet and hose, and a gigantic white smock, bleached with human urine, which had one grovelling “courtier” wondering: “Has all the p*** been washed out, my Lord King ”A good question.We didn’t actually get the answer, though, until part two, on Wednesday, when, after a brief detour round his ancestors, Louis IX of France, William the Conqueror and Henry II, viewers got to the nub of things, with Professor Chris Given-Wilson explaining the agonising death of Edward II: “By thrusting a hollow instrument, like the end of a trumpet, up his fundament.”“’Old on a minute,” said a rattled Danny. “He’s been stabbed  With a trumpet ”“Into his fundament.” Long pause.“Don’t tell me it’s up his a**e ”Right up it, Danny, with a red-hot poker. News which didn’t just do his “nut in”, it seemed to derail the entire documentary.They ran out of direct royal ancestors shortly afterwards as well, and the BBC adopted its stupid default setting in such circumstances. It turned Danny’s Right Royal Family into a dance and cookery show, complete with demonstrations of both, from medieval experts.It was about this time I also sussed out what was going on in the background, with all those winsome historians. An audition.The BBC was using it to find its new face of history, though why any of the blokes turned up is a mystery. Auntie’s already made it clear: “The days of white, middle-aged men explaining stuff are over.”Danny, on the other hand, can be tolerated, because he’s their new performing Cockney. A novelty act who can be dressed up and patronised so much he ended this one doing some weird medieval can-can, with his family, in front of his lost ancestral pile.A trumpet wasn’t quite shoved up his fundament as they danced, but the p*** had very much been washed out of him, my Lord King.GREAT TV lies and delusions of the month. “I think it’s going to be a really great show.” Cheryl Tweedy, The Greatest Dancer.“We do TV shows and we’re national treasures.” Jedward, Celebrity Coach Trip.“People will remember my name and I love that.” Some t**t off Ship- wrecked.IF you’re to take anything from the news experts have claimed Monday, January  was the most depressing day of the year, it’s probably the fact the experts clearly never sat through what happened eight days later, on Tuesday, January .Britain’s Top  Dogs Live: . All two-and-a-half yapping hours of it, on ITV, with a bad hangover, in the company of presenters Ben Fogle and Sara Cox.A test beyond personal endurance not because of the alcohol or dogs, who are a largely blameless lot, but the presence of their barmy owners, who attribute all sorts of superpowers to their dumb little mutts and blur the human animal relationship way beyond the point of reason and sometimes even good taste.Hits Radio DJ Gemma Atkinson, for instance, claimed: “I wouldn’t be where I am today without Norman”, her pet sproodle.Which is a hell of a guilt trip to pin on any dog.While Spandau Ballet’s Martin Kemp was seen, sitting alongside Popsie the poodle and his Wham! backing-singer we Shirlie, exclaiming: “I’ll say this for her,she does do a poo she goes into the spare bathroom.”The least you’d expect, frankly, after  years of marriage.The case study that really finished me off, though, was a dog dancing instructor called Joan Clark and her powder puff hounds, whose act, as described by Sara Cox, was: “All building up to the big finish. Can she pull it off  Joan points to the spot and it’s one, two, three pups between her legs.”CHANNEL ’s Pure is a comedy drama about a woman who suffers from the sixth sense of seeing naked people and is so tormented by her condition she screams: “F***ing stop.

Then there they were again, on Sunday night, directly before Gemma Collins skated at Dancing On Ice.Although, I say “skated,” you’d see marginally more movement from the Larsen C ice shelf in Antarctica than we got from Gemma on this week’s show.The heroic Matt Evers had to shove, heave, prod and generally wield her like a hypermarket shopping trolley, in fact, just to get Gemma turning on her axis.One very calculated burst of tears later, though, the mug punters had voted her through for yet another week and she’d parked her over-entitled backside on Piers Morgan’s sofa early yesterday morning.So where the hell was Vagisan feminine itching cream and Jenny Eclair when the occasion really called for them Asleep on the job, that’s where.

He said: All was going fantastically well...tunes on...bevying in the taxi etc but as we got further up the Highlands the snowier it was getting. We then attempt to drive up a road we probably should never have went near but we are f*****g steaming so dont batter an eyelid and let the Turkish driver crack on .Half way into this road we are surrounded in the f*****g alps, we see a car with police tape on it and crash right into it.At this point, Robbie and Shaun - vodka bottle in hand - set out on foot for around an hour in a desperate attempt to find help.

The pair finally managed to move the taxi, with their driver temporarily demoted to the back seat. In the video, one of the lads can be seen joking to the driver: We are f****d. Weve been here for five hours. Back on the road with their driver in the front seat, the pair - in a drunken state of madness - then decided to leap out of the moving vehicle after thinking that they were going too fast, precariously close to clf edges.   The pair regretted almost instantly the move, adding they had to chase the taxi down a snowy hill in shorts screaming for their drive to come back. Thankfully for them, he did, and they finally made it to their friend Vanessa Ingles cottage in Aberfeldy hours later than originally planned.

And within just a few hours David Mearns managed to track down the missing Piper Malibu on Sunday, which was on its way to Cardf when it disappeared last month.Sala’s family appealed to the marine scientist after an official search for the aircraft was stood down and an online crowdfunding campaign to fund it raised more than pound,. But those who know David were not remotely surprised the man known as The Shipwreck Hunter was able to locate the plane so quickly. The expert, who was born in the US but is now a British citizen living in Sussex, has helped solve some of history’s greatest maritime mysteries.   He has lead searches for shipwrecks that have been at the bottom of the sea of decades, even centuries, making  major historical discoveries over the last  years. Using sonar technology and remote-controlled submarines, his expeditions have also set records for finding wrecks at extreme depths - and even helped solve crimes that would have remained forever undetected. But despite his successes he still dreams of finding one wreck which has eluded him - Sir Ernest Shackleton’s Endurance, which crashed into ice and sank off Antartica in .  He told the Times in : “If I could cap it all off with Endurance, I would be a happy, happy man because it is the ultimate shipwreck search in terms of dficulty and challenge.“Harder than Titanic. Finding a deep-water shipwreck in the Weddell Sea when it is covered in ice, you are not going to get any harder than that.” Most of David’s finds, though, have been the result of exceptionally hard work - often years of research, months at sea and millions of pounds. And with three Guinness World Records for underwater discoveries, including one for the deepest shipwreck ever found - the German blockade runner Rio Grande, which was discovered at a depth of ,ft - he is now regarded as the man to turn to when it comes to retrieving from the ocean floor. One of the -year-old’s most famous discoveries was the HMS Hood, one of Britain’s greatest battleships, which was sunk by the German navy’s Bismark in May .  There were just three survivors among the , on board, their lives saved by an air bubble that pushed them back to the surface. Among them was Ted Briggs, who David had met and sought consent from before setting out for a Channel  documentary to find the ship in . He eventually found the wreck at a depth of , ft at the bottom of the Denmark Strait, where he got another Guinness World Record for the deepest live broadcast on the internet, with live footage of the HMS Hood being streamed around the world. But he later recalled how there was none of the usual shouts of excitement when the ship was finally discovered. He said: “There were no whoops or joy of back-slaps. It was such an emotional and sad moment for me. I didn’t feel like celebrating in any way.”  When a plaque was placed on the wreck, now a recognised war grave, he made sure that it was Ted Briggs’ hands in control of an underwater robot when it wasreleased onto the wreck. He remembered: “For Ted personally, it allowed him a chance to say goodbye to his shipmates, to remove from his shoulders the guilt that he had felt his whole le as one of only three who survived. “In a sense, he laid a ghost to rest. It was something that I’ll never ever forget - a very proud moment for everybody that we witnessed that.” Other sunken warships he has found with his company Blue Water Recoveries include the HMAS Sydney, an Australian navy battle cruiser sunk by the Germans off Australias west coast in November , killing . It was the the country’s greatest maritime mystery for  years until he found the ship in . David also found the hospital ship Centaur, which was torpedoed off Queensland by a Japanese submarine in , for which he was awarded an honorary Medal of the Order of Australia.  He was also part of a team in  led by Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen, which located the wreckage of the Japanese battleship Msashi in the Sibuyan Sea. And in  he found a wreck he believes to be the SS Athenia, the first ship sunk in the Second World War at a cost of  lives when German U-boat commander Fritz Julius Lemp torpedoed the transatlantic liner – believing it was a warship – just hours after Britain had declared war on the Nazis. Describing his care with such wrecks, where many lives were lost, he said: “The sanctity of those grave sites and whoever has been lost is very important. “They are major unmarked grave sites, with no head stones to show who has been lost there, and that why we take this effort andto put plaques on the wreck, to leave a marker that those people haven’t been forgotten.” David, who trained as a marine biologist, began his career as a search and recovery contractor for the US Navy.  But his le changed forever when he was tasked with finding MV Lucona, a cargo ship which was blown up in the Indian Ocean in  at the cost of six lives. After finding the ship at ,ft, he found it had been blown apart by a bomb for an insurance fraud by Austrian businessman Udo Proksch, who was subsequently convicted in  of murdering six of his crew. He went on to defy the odds by finding dozens of other lost vessels, many of which had been shrouded in mystery for decades, boasting a  per cent success rate. Describing the months he often spends at sea searching for wrecks, he says: “Being on the water is great, I love being out there.  You see some days when it’s call, and days when it’s really mountainous seas. You’re working every minute of every hour when you’re awake.” He says that the discovery he’s most proud of was the SMAS Sydney, which nobody thought would ever be found. He said: “It’s not exaggerating to say that all of Australia was following that search. We had the worst luck, everything went wrong. Equipment failures, bad weather, the ship broke down…” He said he felt “pure exhilaration” when it showed up on his sonar.   In March , David announced the discovery of Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gaza’s Esmerelda, which sunk in . It is believed to be the earliest ship from Europe’s Age of Discovery ever to be found and excavated. Despite his extraordinary career, David says he will only be satisfied when when he finds three elusive wrecks. One is the legendary Endurance, but he won’t reveal the other two as shipwreck hunting is a competitive business. He says: “There’s three of them, and I haven’t given up on them. They leave this tortured feeling that you have, of unfinished business.” "},{"url":null,"title":"hilarious moment student comes home","story":"NewsHilarious moment student comes home to find everything he owns covered in foilLewis Braddock, , left the door unlocked to his university digs - and he lived to regret itShareCommentsByHelena KellyKelly-Ann Mills:,  FEB Updated:,  FEB Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news video student-comes-home-find-housemate-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News ,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,swipeNavigation:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News ,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,swipeNavigation:true\"\"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA student came home to find his prankster housemate had covered every item in his bedroom in tin foil.

In April , Beth, who was later diagnosed with stage  bowel cancer. suffered tremendous pain while she was on the toilet. She told thethat she thought she was constipated while going to the toilet but was shocked to see blood.  I felt something was stuck, when I went to wipe it away there was a lot of blood and I could feel something fleshy, she said. She was taken to Princess Alexandra Hospital in Harlow by her husband for emergency check-up to be polyps, which are abnormal tumours that are often found in the bowels. Medical experts examined and confirmed that it was bowel cancer and it reached stage four. A month later, the mother-of-two started her gruelling six-month chemotherapy treatment.  Sadly, Beth had to undergo more surgery as she suffered from peripheral neuropathy, a damage to the nerves that are outside the brain and spinal cord.

Everything was coming out of the wrong place, it was awful. “Then I had to have my bum sewn up.” In November , a CT scan revealed spots on her lungs, meaning the cancer had spread.  Beth had to get back on chemotherapy in the hope that the treatment could prevent further spread and keep the cancer at bay extending her le. Following three more months of chemotherapy, she had her lungs operated on at The Royal Brompton. And Beth was finally declared cancer free. She told added: Right now Im back on chemotherapy to try and keep the cancer away as long as possible, but Im feeling OK as I am on a less aggressive treatment. I get tired and a few other relatively minor side effects, but thats a small price to pay to keep me here for a bit longer. Beth has got together with Bowel Cancer UK and Coloplast to help others talk about their symptoms with their GPs in attempt to raise awareness about bowel cancer.

Aaron Smith, , spotted the shiny rock while exploring Sandsend Beach in Whitby, Yorkshire, and became excited when he realised it gave all the signs it contained a fossil. The medical student, who hunts for them twice a week, claims the fossil is an Eleganticeras from the Jet Rock Shales of the Upper Lias in the Lower Jurassic period. Aaron was filmed holding the shiny cannonball-shaped rock up to the camera, before opening the fossil to show the stunning palm-sized Elegantericeras inside before closing it again.   He claims the limestone of the golden cannonball was naturally coated in iron pyrite - also known as fools gold - which he polishes up to give it its glossy appearance. Aaron posted the video online with the comment: Here’s a video of us opening one of our huge Cannon Ball fossils. The limestone noduleis coated in Iron Pyrite, meaning we can polish it to become Golden, seen in our previous videos It still impresses me that these million-year-old fossils are along our beautul Yorkshire Coastline waiting to be found.   Albeit, this particular prestigious example is found only once every few years. The fossil hunter filmed the short video in his back garden against a huge pile of ammonite fossils that he and his dad have collected. Aaron, who is from North Yorkshire, said: Generally when people see the video, or see these fossils in real le, they absolutely adore them. They love them much more than our marine reptile fossils in many cases which is quite annoying because the marine reptiles are my favourite. Fossil hunting is a hobby of mine, or perhaps more like a serious passion.   I got into it because my dad was very interested in fishing and fossil hunting too so we had lots of exposure to this amazing coast. I remember very distinctly searching for our very first ammonite, when we cracked it open we were all so excited! This lit the fire for our future passion to develop.

Anna McLeod, , was found dead at her home in Lancaster last November, an inquest heard. Mrs McLeod was a head of year at Our Ladys Catholic College, and despite being much-loved by both staff and students, her husband Robert revealed how she always worried about letting down the school. Robert, a design engineer, said: Not only did she have friends, but she had a good family as well. We all supported each other. She loved her job but she was always worried about whether she was letting down the school and her pupils and colleagues. She had a big lack of self-worth and that was the basis of her issues. She was beautul and clever and she would dish out loads of compliments, but never take any for herself. Family GP Dr Joanna Smith said: She was prescribed anti-depressants in June . In , she was given Citalopram. In February , she reported that she was feeling well. In February , she was still taking Citalopram. In terms of her history, no previous recordings of self-harm or suicidal thought.   At the time of the tragedy, headteacher Helen Seddon said Mrs McLeod - known as Miss Brindle in school - was an excellent teacher who had a passion for her job and inspired her students. Ms Seddon said: She had grown to be an excellent classroom teacher who had a passion for enabling children of all abilities to achieve the very best, but more importantly inspired them so they enjoyed their learning and believed in themselves. During her time in school she not only taught English, but was a much-loved form teacher and an excellent, caring year head. She organised a boys reading group, led World Book Day events, was a leader of the Duke of Edinburgh and ensured other students got out of the classroom and into the countryside that she loved so much. She filled our classrooms and staff room with sparkle, laughter and love. As a school we are heartbroken but we will make sure that she is remembered and that as staff we continue her example to inspire all students to believe in themselves and to know that they are loved so they can be the best that they can be.   She was not just a talented teacher but a wonderful human being and our school community will be very sad over the coming weeks. I would ask you all to keep her and our community in your thoughts and prayers. Our faith gives us the confidence to know she is now at peace. In a statement Mrs McLeods family said: Annas greatest achievement was the effect she had on the pupils at school, and the extra effort and personal time that was put into making sure the kids were happy. She helped pupils in numerous ways, including with Saturday morning revision and classroom makeovers, and also ensured she celebrated every childs birthday with cake. She was always incredibly self-motivated and hard working, and would always have two part-time jobs or college and a job prior to teaching. Coroner James Newman said: There are three short form conclusions I have to consider. I have to consider whether her death was the result of a suicide.   To come to this conclusion, I have to be sure that, on a balance of probabilities, she took her own le and did so with intent. I have no dficulty with the first part of that, but not the second. The other two short form conclusions I can give are one of misadventure, which is the unintended consequence of an intention act, or an open conclusion, which is where there is not enough evidence to come to a short form conclusion. Can I rule out a suicide  No. But I have to rely on the evidence and the intent is just not there. She has not talked about self-harm in the past, although she did lack self-esteem and she could not see herself for who she was. Her intention was not clear in the evidence.

A teacher of Amber Peat, , Karen Green told an inquest at Nottingham Council House the schoolgirl had mentioned having a big secret. The -year-old was found hanged on June  , three days after leaving home in Mansfield, Nottinghamshire. Karen Green, vice-principal of the Queen Elizabeth Academy, Mansfield, had a phone call with social services regarding Amber, reports Nottinghamshire Live. She said: My gut instinct is theres something not right here. I cant put my finger on it. She had called seeking help over the -year-old who had recently become a pupil at the school after the move from Derbyshire.  One of Ms Greens comments referred to a big secret, Amber says she is not allowed to talk about it. This was thought to refer to her stepfather Daniel Peats criminal conviction for fraud, the inquest heard. Another phone call mentioned that Amber becomes stressednot allowed access to food in school, giving potential issues around her diet, the coroner Laurinda Bower said. The teacher also spoke about Amber twice running away. The coroner said: There was information that the family moved from the previous school when people started to work with them.  That suggests a potential lack of engagement. Ms Greens call was taken by Elizabeth Fisher, a member of the multi-agency support hub. She said a social worker had to make a decision on stepping up support for Amber and this was not done. I didnt feel there was enough for a full referral, said Miss Fisher, who told the inquest the decision was not hers to make, adding: Social workers are the trained staff.

Miss Fisher replied: I would have told them why dad was in prison.  Amber was found hanged after a family row shortly after they had all ed from a holiday in Cornwall. A pathologist said there was no evidence to suggest anyone  was involved in the hanging. The inquest has previous heard the teenager was woken at midnight for two hours to do cleaning jobs around the house. The hearing was told the teenager was also punished by having to use a carrier bag to take items to class rather than using a school satchel.  The coroner was referring to a phone call from Sharon Clay, a team leader at Queen Elizabeth School, Mansfield. Amber had recently become a pupil after the family moved from Tibshelf. The call was taken by Joanna Shepherd, a member of a multi-agency safeguarding team in Notts. The coroner asked whether this was regarded as emotional abuse. Miss Shepherd, who was giving evidence, said: It could possibly amount to emotional abuse. You would need more detail and content.  The coroner said other information had been compiled about Amber while the family were Derbyshire residents and efforts could have been made to get the bigger picture. The hearing continues.

Debbie Davis Seib has also laid bare how daughter Abby wished she hadnt been born after her excruciating headaches turned out to be a brain tumour . Nothing could prepare mum Debbie to break the news of the devastating diagnosis to the then six-year-old, who for months had been too unwell to go to school. But Debbie knew she had to tell her sweet pea. She took a deep breath before saying: You know those bad headaches and the vomiting you keep having  Yes mom, they hurt, Abby replied. It’s because you have something growing in there that shouldn’t be there. We have to get it out.  The brave youngster, from Davison, Michigan in the US, didnt cry, instead she replied Ok mom. Moments earlier Debbie had broken down in the hospital car park. It had taken minutes for her world to crumble when the doctor called her and husband Dave to one side in a room that felt like it was smaller than a cardboard box. She screamed no no no no as they were told Abby had a tumour in her brain and it looked to be a cancer that children are known to get.  I felt my whole self being thrown into a hellish nightmare, one I couldn’t leave, but one that could possibly take my beautul daughter away, Debbie told Love What Matters . Debbie and Dave had started to become concerned something was wrong with their daughter in the winter of  when she started to lack concentration and repeat her words. She was initially tested for ADHD and given medication, but her parents stopped her taking it when she told them she didnt like the way it made her feel.   Things started to gradually get worse in  when she would be sent home from school with headaches. It was not of huge concern for Debbie as migraines ran in her family. But when Abby began waking up in pain and vomiting thats when she became deeply concerned. Dave and Debbie took her to the doctor and he did several tests, including checking her hand-eye coordination. He then referred Abby to a neurologist. It was while there that the youngster started vomiting, however the neurologist didnt seem too concerned.   Debbie, who is also mum to Zach, , recalled: He told us everything is fine. ‘I see at least  kids in here a day with symptoms like your daughter.’ He told us it is probably due to allergies. He patted my daughter on the head, and gave her a pen. Abby was prescribed allergy medication, but the doctor who had referred Abby to the neurologist was not convinced. He advised Debbie to take her daughter to the emergency department to have a CT scan.   Don’t worry, we will get the CT scan, get some headache medication and go home, Debbie had told the smiley youngster unaware of the devastation to come. The scan confirmed the worst and Abby was immediately taken to a childrens hospital where she was sedated and a biopsy was carried out to identy the cancerous tumour as Medulloblastoma. As Abby was wheeled away for brain surgery she told her mum: Im scared, but Ill be brave. Four hours later when Debbie laid eyes on Abby after the operation she sobbed as she saw her baby girl covered in bandages and attached to drips.   Abby was in serious pain and couldnt move her right arm. She also had double vision and suffered from Pos Fossa, a term that means the brain hasn’t recovered from the trauma. But all she wanted was to go home. In the months that followed she had to learn to retrain her brain and use her legs again. After her seventh birthday she started radiation and her beautul curly strawberry blonde hair had to be cut off.   Debbie said: By the th treatment, it was gone. Abby didn’t like the radiation treatments because she could smell weird smells and could see flashes of the light. Abby would go on to have  rounds of radiation. Chemotherapy would also take its toll on the youngster leaving her crippled in pain. In one heartbreaking picture of Abby she lies in a hospital bed screaming in agony. The youngster would go on to say the words no parent wants to hear. She has said many times she hates her le, she wishes she weren’t born. This is from a -year-old little girl, said Debbie. No child should know all the pain my little girl knows.   Abby is still undergoing treatment but is determined to win the fight. Her dream is to own a rescue farm. She wants to save all the hurt animals. She told her mum: You can do all the harder work, I will just give them the love they need. Meanwhile, Debbie added: Childhood cancer is something you can never walk away from without a piece of your heart and soul taken along the way. We learn to appreciate the moments better, love harder and live with the most heartfelt zest. Because for the parents that have to hear the words ‘your child has cancer,’ we are never ever giving up hope. You canabout Abbys story here and find her Instagram page here .

And the truth is lots of us have been guilty of judging other parents for having noisy little ones too - when we all know it can be dficult to keep them under control. One mum says a man was huffing and puffing about her and her toddler as they sat behind him on a flight. She said it was the first time her child went on a plane - and understandably found it to be challenging. Stephanie Hollield, a parenting blogger, wrote an open letter published on Momstrosity to the annoyed man - and every parent will be able to relate.   She wrote: To the Gentleman on Flight , I first noticed you when you sighed loudly as you laid eyes on me and my toddler boarding the plane. In a momentary lapse of judgement, we sat behind you. It was the nearest set of seats, and I couldnt wait to put my child and our heavy bags down. From the over-dramatic huffs and puffs you let out as we buckled in, it was clear that you were annoyed by our very presence. At this point, my little girl was laughing and playing, obviously too loud for your liking. I wonderedyou had a bad day, orthis grouchy temperament was your normal behavior. She continued to say that it the first time that I had ever flown with a child, and I was making half of the trip without my husband after spending weeks researching tips to keep her daughter calm. I did everything in my power to keep her calm and quiet. I shushed her, and made sure her little feet didnt kick your seat. As we took off, her tears started. The kicking and the screaming tantrums came on fast. She was exhausted and fussy. You did not let up with your mutters of annoyance and looks over your shoulder. I apologized to everyone around me. I almost started crying myself.   I was feeling shame and guilt for not being able to control my own child. The mum added that she felt at her wits end when a flight attendant came over and gave her baby a straw and cup to play with - and she was suddenly content. The kind attendant told us, Its ok! Flying is tough on everyone, and you are both doing great! Somehow, her kindness calmed the baby and made the mum feel better. She added that kids are the future, and while they might be inconvenient now - theyll be the people doing amazing things when were all grey and old. Its an important reminder not to judge mums and dads who are clearly doing their best when their kids wont be quiet in a public place. Anyone who has cared for little ones will know how tough it can be - and it doesnt take much to smile and be kind instead of rolling your eyes to make parents feel bad.

Democratic state representative Richard Creagan’s has proposed the legislation which would effectively ban the sale of cigarettes in the area. If this were to be approved, the popular holiday destination would become the first US state to do so. Under current law, Hawaiians must be -years-old to buy cigarettes. But with new proposals, the age would rise to  in . This would then increase to  in ,  in ,  in , before jumping from  to  in .However the new age limit would not apply to cigars, chewing tobacco or e-cigarettes .  Mr Creagan does not believe that taxation and health warnings are good enough measures to prevent smoking.The doctor told Hawaii Tribune-Herald : “It’s slowing it down, but it’s not stopping the problem.“We essentially have a group who are heavily addicted – in my view, enslaved by a ridiculously bad industry – which has enslaved them by designing a cigarette that is highly addictive, knowing that it highly lethal.  And, it is. The state is obliged to protect the public’s health. Mr Creagan admitted that in the past he had smoked cigarettes during his medical residency to help him stay awake during long shts.   And while he was a teenager he also reportedly picked tobacco as a summer job. But while he plans to limit smoking tobacco, Mr Creagan is backing the legalisation of marijuana. He thinks that smoking the drug is not as big a health risk as smoking tobacco. Mr Creagan’s bill has two other sponsors and is expected to be heard by the House Health Committee this week. Other Hawaiian politicians are also making moves to clamp down on smoking. Democratic Senator Dru Kanuha has also brought in a bill to raise tax on tobacco in order to generate funds for health programmes.

The critters, described as “something out of a horror movie”, have small round bodies with long thin tails and can be seen squirming around in a disturbing video filmed in Auckland, New Zealand.Tim Clerke spotted the creatures at his mum’s house and appealed to his Facebook friends to try and identy them.He wrote: “My mother found these on the kitchen floor this morning. One is still alive. “Anyone know what they are  Nikki is horried and will have nightmares for weeks.” One person said they were the “detached legs of a moth”.   Another said: “Its like someone cut the bottom end off of baby mouse.” Another agreed that the things looked like deformed baby mice, while someone  chimed in with “miniature bats”. But despite the “disgusting” video being viewed more than , times, no one could come up with a definitive answer as to what they are. Experts too were perplexed by the specimens.   The Biosecurity New Zealand entomology team suggested the video showed the detached legs of a moth. They suggest that something [possibly a cat] had just recently eaten the body of the moth, which may explain why a few of the legs were still twitching, a spokesperson told Yahoo!.   Insect expert Eric Edwards, Science Advisor and Entomologist with the New Zealand Department of Conservation, then weighed in and said that they could be rat-tailed maggots. Earlier this month an Australian backpacker found something similar and it was later confirmed by an entomologist that he had found a hoverfly larvae, which is more commonly known as a rat-tailed maggot. The identity of this creature has yet to be determined.

The footage shows the flashing cylindrical shape in the distance, which Bret believes was at least the height of a commercial aircraft or even outside the atmosphere. The -year-old eBay seller claims he was blown away by what he captured and believes it is unexplainable and most likely otherworldly.   The eerie video has gone viral on social media where it amassed almost , views and some even claimed to know what UFO craft it was - the infamous black triangle TR-B. Bret said: I was outside capturing video and photos of birds. I spent about an hour outside before deciding to head back in and then I saw a tiny flash in the corner of my eye. I happened to notice this random flashing light that just kept flashing that was kind of behind an airplane. I decided to try to capture it. I saw it for maybe  seconds or so and my camera would not focus on it so I thought I did not capture it at all. But, low and behold, there was a brief flash andyou look carefully you can see this big flash comes into focus and you can see a pill-shaped object.   When I saw it when I came back inside, it just blew me away. It was not what I expected at all. I dont know what that is. Its got two ends to it and it also looks like its got a tether coming off the front of it or its ejecting some kind of fluid off it. I think there is something unexplainable in the video, a UFO. I am not sure whether it is man made or alien. At the time, I strongly suspected the object to be at least the distance of a commercial aircraft. After analysing I think this is the case, and also it could be even further away, potentially outside the atmosphere. In his video, Bret gives a detailed voiceover account of how he captured the footage and what equipment he used.  His rigorous description won him praise from other UFO enthusiasts - though some felt there was a more rational explanation of what it could be. Bret said: Some people flatly claimed it is a Mylar balloon, [and said] you can even see the tether. [However] a few claim to know what UFO craft it is - a TR-B. Bret is sceptical that what he captured could be a balloon. He added: Some say it is a balloon because of ious factors tether, floats with predominant wind direction, no noise, and Mylar balloons can look like they are flashing because they are so shiny. Given my entire experience, and analysing the video as best I can at this point, I have a hard time with that theory. I cannot completely rule it out, but the images I captured show a sequence of flashing, and tone changes on each end independently all within a fraction of a second.   It just does not behave like a balloon would in my mind doing all of that in a such a short time without changing orientation much. The weird part to me is the idea that it kind of looks electrical, like a battery or fuse. [The reason I think it was a UFO is] it was visibly dferent than all the other flying craft. [There was] no trail left. Just this very tiny intense random flashing. The images I did capture look otherworldly to me. It behaves like something that did not want to be seen. I cannot say for sure what it is, but my gut reaction is that it is something otherworldly. It is not the first unexplained sighting that Bret has made. Bret said: In the past I saw a silvery triangle in the clouds that I was not able to capture. It was small and did not hang around for long. I also saw an object at night that looked like a star but started moving slowly while turning slightly, then it curved sharply and got very small until it disappeared like it was moving far away quickly. I was searching for birds to take photos of. Im always looking up - looking for birds, looking for planes, looking for anything I can see in the sky, [such as] critters I can photos or video of. I have always believed in UFOs, aliens and other paranormal aspects of reality. This experience did not change the way I feel about that one way or another. I find it incredibly dficult to believe we are alone in such a huge universe.

They claim theyve made the decision as its more important to contribute to the conservation of the planet that is so overpopulated and damaged. But their post has sparked a furious debate on social and many people have slammed their unusual outlook. But others have praised them and said more of us should do the same.Their original post, shared on Andreacutess Facebook page, says: We want to share with you the great joy. WE WILL NEVER BE PARENTS.We accept a le in which we will forever buy the toys for us, we can travel without limitations, walk naked around the house and more.   However our main reason is not this, the most important is to contribute with the conservation of the planet that is so overpopulated and damaged. We will not bring one more human in to contaminate it. Whoo.Nathalielater added: Guys, children are beautul to me.If I wasnt affected by what I see every day, because sometimes it hurts me to breathe, to see so many children suffering in the street, so many drugs, violence and cruelty. Believe me, I would consider having one. Many people were shocked by the Colombian couples decision and their outlook in general. One woman wrote: It seems to me that its not an intelligent way to describe or explain why they dont want to have children. How are the children a contamination    Another simply wrote: They dont know what theyre missing. One man commented: What would be of youyour dad had done the same. Because a child is never a mistake, its a blessing. They will never be happy. Selfish, at least have one. But other people agreed with their unusual thought process. One wrote: I dread the idea of bringing a human being into this world to live this le of slavery. We live to maintain a decadent society and its large corporations while the planet dies! It is a beautully responsible decision. Another added: Congratulations!! The smartest!!! and empathetic of your part!!! I wish you good le!!! One man commented: We are a parasite in the world, we are more and more!!! If people realized that all the problems of the planet are for so many humans.... good decision Im glad.

Raphael Samuel, from Mumbai, India, is reportedly part of a so-called child-free advocate group that believes children should not be made to suffer le. He has been described as an anti-natalist who thinks parents do not have the right to give birtha child has not agreed to being born. Now his mother, Kavita, has spoken out saying she admires her sons temerity. She went on to say her son has caused an upheaval in her le and listed the reasons why. Kavita added: I must admire my sons temerity to want to take his parents to court knowing both of us are lawyers.   If Raphael could come up with a rational explanation as to how we could have sought his consent to be born, I will accept my fault. The media has focused on a sliver of what Raphael believes in. His belief in anti-natalism, his concern for the burden on Earths resources due to needless le, his sensitivity toward the pain experienced unwittingly by children while growing up and so much more has been ruefully forgotten. Im very happy that my son has grown up into a fearless, independent thinking young man. He is sure to find his path to happiness. Kavita Karnad Samuel. After revealing his plans to take legal action against his own parents, Raphael claims he has a great relationship with the pair. I want to tell all Indian kids that they don’t owe their parents anything, he told The Print.   I love my parents, and we have a great relationship, but they had me for their joy and their pleasure. My le has been amazing, but I don’t see why I should put another le through the rigamarole of school and finding a career, especially when they didn’t ask to exist. Raphael said that people must know it is an option to not have children and to ask your parents for an explanation as to why they have birth to you. In a video posted on YouTube, he talks about a myth of respecting elders in India, but says what we should be respecting is peoples actions. He asks: Has that person treated you well  Is that person giving you freedom  Is that person encouraging your growth    Your parents are two people at the age of - who just wanted a good night together and then they had you, he adds. He thinks parents owe children for bringing them joy, rather than the other way round. You must love themyou feel like loving them, he says. Raphael talks about respecting a person for who they are instead of merely because of their position.

That happens with late goals but we still have to take confidence because it still was a good performance.“I came in two weeks ago and we had five new boys on the deadline.“They’ve only trained once so it was always going to be hard but in periods of the game you could see we can all play together and how it can come off.“Hopefully, we can show more of that in the upcoming games.“It’s always disappointing to concede a last-minute goal but I think the boys worked their socks off. The performance might not have been as good as against Motherwell and Hearts but every one of us certainly put everything in.“Unfortunately, a strike like that happens and you can’t do anything about it.”Despite only signing for the Dark Blues on January , Dales has already featured five times for the club and is set for his sixth turn-out in tonight’s clash at home to high-flying Kilmarnock.It’s been a non-stop start to le at Dens Park for the -year-old who is enjoying le already in the Scottish top flight and is hoping to experience his first victory in dark blue in just over  hours’ time.He added: “I think I’ve settled in quite well.“It’s definitely dferent up here, it’s a lot quicker, up and down all the time but I think that suits me.“That’s my game, to be dynamic, so I think it probably suits me more up here than down in League One.“I’ve only been here a couple of weeks and I’ve already played four-and-a-half games in two weeks.“Some of the others have played five so it has been pretty thick and fast butwe can put another good performance on again I think we can get the three points.“It’s a great opportunity to do that as long as we work as hard as we did on Saturday. If all the lads put in % like that I don’t see why we can’t get the three points.”Despite coming in from mid-table League One side Scunthorpe to join Dundee’s push to avoid relegation from the Premiership, Dales says he’s up for the challenge.“Some people prefer to go into a promotion-chasing team but, for me, there’s nothing wrong with being in a relegation battle.“I’m up for that and I think every single player in the changing-room is definitely up for it.“With the quality we have and,we can keep showing that for most of the game, there’s no reason why we can’t get to where we should be.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/02/5c5435fee7f0d9.26716581.jpg ","title":"dundee united loan signing charlie seaman wants to return to bournemouth with medal","story":"Dundee United loan signing Charlie Seaman has come to Dundee United to develop as a player and get first-team experience.And he also aims to be heading back to parent club Bournemouth this summer with a Scottish Championship medal in his pocket.In capturing the -year-old full-back from one of the surprise success stories of the English Premier League over the past few seasons, Tangerines boss Robbie Neilson stressed the deal was exactly what it said on the tin – a loan.The end of the season will see Seaman head back to the south coast and be expected to challenge for a top-team place with the Cherries.However, while his time in Scotland will be a learning experience, the former West Ham youth wants success as well.“Hopefully, coming here and learning dferent things will help me for when I go back for next season,” he said.“I can learn dferent styles here so I am really happy to be in Scotland with United.“The boys here love to play football and that’s good because it’s that way down at Bournemouth.“Every side of the game, though, on the ball, off the ball I am trying to learn, it’s what I’m here for. Defensively I am trying to be better and I want to be better offensively as well.“I came here to get experience of first-team football. I was waiting for my chance at Bournemouth but I felt I could get it here sooner, get some games for the rest of the season. Hopefully I will be more readyI get the opportunity when I go back, or wherever it may be.“There is a job to do for the team as well and our goal at Dundee United is to win this league. Yes, it would be nice to be finishing the season with a medal for that.”Seaman’s time north of the border hardly got off to the perfect start and, within hours of his arrival, he was tasting defeat as United went down to Ayr.His temporary manager was disappointed with the team performance at Somerset Park but did make a point of saying the new arrival had put in some good work.The young full-back took encouragement from that but has admitted he did not necessarily agree with Robbie’s assessment.“I was happy to make my debut last week, obviously disappointed with the loss, but it was good to get out there and experience something dferent,” he added.“I didn’t think I started the game too well but I thought I grew into it. Still, personally, I don’t think it was one of my better games by any stretch.“It was my first game at the club, my first playing a dferent style of football and my first playing in dferent weather conditions and stuff like that.“It was all a learning curve, something to take from that game into future games.“I came up Thursday night, so I only had a day here before the game but I have high expectations and I like to set high standards.“When I don’t reach them, I’m disappointed.”The aim now is to show up well as he makes his home debut as Morton visit Tannadice and United try to get back to winning ways to keep in touch with leaders Ross County.And Seaman does admit this week has given him more time to do his homework on the opposition, saying: “Before Ayr the gaffer gave me a lot of clips of Ayr to watch so I had a fair idea of what they were going to do.“I was relatively ready for the game in a tactical aspect but I did only come up on Thursday night.“For this game against Morton we have been getting information throughout the week.

I actually don’t have any relatives here in Dundee because they all moved to America but I’m sure they will be over soon to watch me in person.”And the former DC United man admits being in an environment where the population live and breathe football is a special feeling.His grandad’s love of United and the fact dad John, a former USA skipper, spent a big chunk of his career in England, means that’s not come as a surprise.“Over here everyone talks about football all the time and it’s the culture. It’s everywhere, which I love, and it’s all over the city.“There are so many competing sports back in the US that are big but football is getting bigger and at the final this year in Atlanta you saw , people there and that is great to see. The game is going to keep growing there and you will see more and more players coming through but here it’s on a dferent level.“I knew what it was like over here, I got it from my dad from when he was here. My mum and dad talked about it a lot, how everyone is immersed in the sport.“I get in taxis here and they are talking about it and all the people are. I love that.”For Ian, though, just being able to experience le in a football-mad country is not going to be enough.He’s come to United to progress his career and that means helping get them back to the Premiership and making a name for himself at that level.With the squad Robbie Neilson has put together, that’s a goal he’s convinced he will achieve.“There’s a lot of new guys in the squad and I thought you saw us start off well against Morton,” he added.“You also saw glimpses in the second half where we had to finish off the game and get that third goal and we didn’t.“However, I think in the first half the guys were moving the ball around well and getting into good positions.“Pete Pawlett was coming inside for us and Pav Safranko was stretching them. That got us the space to play and I think we got a bit away from that in the second half but it will come.“If we keep going and show our class we will finish off games a bit better.“I think, like the manager has said, there are a lot of good players who have good experience so when they get in, they just gel.”"},{"url":null,"title":"dundee united sign former st johnstone defender mark connolly","story":"Dundee United have signed defender Mark Connolly from Crawley Town for an undisclosed fee.Irish-born Connolly joins United on a contract until the end of season .As a youngster, he spent a season at St Johnstone and two seasons at Kilmarnock where he became club captain between two separate periods at Crawley Town.He has represented Ireland at Under , Under  and  level.The -year-old becomes Robbie Neilson#s ninth signing of the January window and third of a busy final day.

these streets safer and more convenient for active travel by redesigning public spaces in a more attractive, healthier and more sociable way.#Mark Flynn depute convener of Dundee City Council’s city development committee said: “We were really encouraged by the initial consultation where people showed strong support and enthusiasm for investing in segregated cycling infrastructure and we are grateful to everyone who took part.“That backing has spurred us on to the next stage with refined proposals and some visual representations of what the new layouts could look like so that people can get a better idea of how active travel infrastructure could look.“The benefits for our city cannot be underestimated healthier citizens, more connected communities, reduced traffic congestion and better air quality.”Cllr Kevin Cordell Dundee City Council’s cycling spokesperson added: “The visual representation of what a segregated cycleway on Lochee Road might look like really brings home how our streets could be set up to encourage more active forms of travel.“Getting more people to use their bikes for commuting and short journeys around the city would be good for all of us.”People can

aberdeens sinking flats","story":"Dozen of residents on two Aberdeen streets could face being moved from their “sinking” homes, the Evening Express can reveal today.Councillors will meet tomorrow to discuss the fate of residents living in  blocks of flats on Errol Street and Errol Place, near King Street, as the ground under the properties is sinking.The long-running subsidence issue was first identied by residents more than two decades ago, with two blocks having been demolished in the past.Four options will be put before members of the city council’s growth and resources committee when they meet in private session at the Town House tomorrow – including knocking the remaining blocks down and moving residents where in the city.An Errol Street resident, who asked not to be named, said the local authority “condemned the houses” on both streets around  years ago due to “subsidence issues”.She added: “They were due to be pulled down  years ago but that didn’t happen, and since then only two buildings have been demolished.“The residents want clarity. My house is one of the worst affected, the ceilings don’t even touch the walls anymore.“My husband and children have had to move in with family because of health issues so I’m living here alone.” vw, px\"  Subsidence occurs when the ground under a property collapses, or sinks lower, taking some of the building’s foundations with it.This puts strain on the home’s structure as one side sinks, causing cracks to appear. Many of the residents have also reported damp problems and cold flats.It is understood the four options on the table are for external repairs, micropiling and ground beams, mass concrete underpinning and demolishing the buildings then rehoming the residents. All options other than external repairs would result in residents being rehomed, with the building work displacing people in the area for up to five years.Micropiling and ground beams – where strengthening rods are drilled into the ground – would take five years to complete, mass concrete underpinning four years, and external works six to eight weeks. vw, px\"  It would take around  weeks to totally demolish the buildings.John and Marilyn Davidson have lived on Errol Place for  years and believe demolition is the only option.John said: “We have had damp in the bedrooms. The conditions of the houses are awful.“They should demolish them – they’re that bad.”The couple said they have been plagued with issues like windows and doors “twisting”.Even when their front door was closed they could see outside through a crack next to the hinge.John added: “They aren’t worth anything. We’ve been here  years and the only work that’s been done is external painting.“The stairwells were meant to be redone but they never have been. The doorway is twisted and so are the window frames. There are times we can hardly lock them.“They’re not worthwhile living in.”Marilyn added: “I wish they would make up their minds about what they are doing.”Another resident, James Gray, , who lives on Errol Street, said he was one of the lucky ones, having avoided issues like damp in his home. He too, however, would like to see the buildings demolished. vw, px\"  He said: “They said it will take four or five years to do all the underpinning, and they can rehome everyone. I must be one of the lucky ones. It’s a cold flat, there’s a draught from the windows, but I haven’t had any damp.“There’s nothing concrete been decided. There’s seven houses empty, the one next door has been empty for two years. It’s a shame when there’s people homeless.“I’ve lost my family over the past couple of years so I want to move. I was going to go away for a month in January with my daughter and son-in-law but then all of this happened and I couldn’t.“They’ve said they would move us into a like-for-like house.”Agnes Brands, , who lives in Errol Place, said she would like to stay in her flat. She added: “They are very cold.“I have had the roof leaking before for a while. I’ve been here  years. I’m not able to move. Some of the people want to flit but I’m not able.“Will the council help you out  I can’t move my stuff.”Councillor Sandra Macdonald, who represents the area, stressed that the homes were not a danger to the residents.She said: “They’re safe for habitation – we wouldn’t have people living in them otherwise.“There was a consultation with residents in September and as far as I’m aware they were split half and half.“Some want to stay because they have friends and family.“Anecdotally older folk want to stay in their homes.“At the end of the day I don’t think doing nothing is an option – I don’t think anyone wants to just mend and repair.“It has to be either concrete underpinning or demolishing the buildings.“It has to be the best decision for the residents and our tenants as well and the council’s finances.”Cllr Macdonald said the decision will be taken tomorrow but it would take a “while” to negotiate with homeowners.She added: “There’s a complete range of tenants who are all wanting to know what is going to happen in the longer term.”"},{"url":null,"title":"north east lifeboat crew teams up with brewery to create fundraising beer","story":"A new north-east partnership hopes the creation of a beer will help raise cash to save lives.Peterhead Leboat has teamed up with Brew Toon brewery to make the drink, with % of the profits going to the charity.Craig Aird, crew member at the leboat and a regular in the Brew Toon bar in the town, had approached the company about collaborating to create a beer.After months of discussions, nine members from the RNLI charity jumped at the chance to create the beverage, and it is hoped it will be ready by next month.A classic, New England-style IPA is currently fermenting and will be called Mayday.

It’s an increasing trend we are seeing.”Evan runs the foodbank and knows first hand how dficult it can be after he was left homeless in .He said: “One of the big things that we battle in this country is the sense that the welfare system is a wage – it is not. We’re trying to help people plan, it’s a dficult thing.“We get people who were made redundant from oil jobs. They go from a four-figure wage to nothing, it’s a massive change.“A lot of churches and community centres will offer a free meal.“There’s no reason for people to be going hungry, but they are just a band aid.“Ideally, they wouldn’t be needed.”Other foodbanks in the city include Somebody Cares on Greenwell Road, East Tullos, and CFINE on Poynernook Road.Non-perishable parcels are also offered by Aberdeen Cyrenians on Summer Street, RCCG Jesus House Torry on Victoria Road and Social Bite on Union Street, which distributes leftover stock between .pm and .pm.The OAK Cafe at St Mark’s Church on Rosemount Viaduct offers a meal for a small donation, Fountain of Love on Palmerston Road offers a free lunch and City Church Aberdeen at Gilcomston Park has a food and chat session in the evening.Other parties which contribute to meals for homeless or low-income families include St Vincent de Paul Society at St Mary’s Cathedral on Huntly Street, Street Friends outside Marks and Spencer, Bethany Toastie Club on a Wednesday at Kings Community Church on Urquhart Road and the Salvation Army at Aberdeen Citadel.Crown Terrace Baptist Church also offers a Quay Toastie Club on Friday nights, providing a free hot meal between  and pm on a Sunday.A DWP spokeswoman said: “The reasons for food poverty are complex, and it would be wrong to link a rise to any one cause.“Latest figures show % of Universal Credit claimants are paid in full and on time.“People can claim up to % advance payments from day one and budgeting support is also available.“The UK government continues to spend around £ billion a year to support low-income families, including cold weather payments, so the most vulnerable people get support when they need it most.”"},{"url":null,"title":"mid argyll girls secure scottish cup win","story":"Bruce WestUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowHere’s a novelty question.

He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13926204.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_18355078.jpg","title":"ayr united 2 inverness 3","story":"NewsAyr United  Inverness : John Roberston hails Somerset Park among best grounds in worldThe Inverness gaffer was full of praise for the old fashioned surroundings as his side clung on in the face of a stirring fightback.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  JAN Updated:,  JAN NewsNathan Austin puts Caley - up \"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailJohn Robertson hailed Somerset Park as one of the best grounds in the WORLD after Caley held off a storming Ayr fightback. Inverness were three up and on easy street after a crazy opening  minutes which saw United gt-wrap the game. But a Lawrence Shankland inspired comeback almost grabbed a share of the spoils for Ian McCalls title contenders. A relieved Robertson said: Had it finished - you wouldnt have been surprised. Somerset Park is one of these grounds that sucks you inyou give them a snf. Its a good throwback and their fans make it intimidating and a good atmosphere for teams when you lose a goal. Its brilliant...one of the best grounds in the world to come and play your football. In the past we might have lost a game like this so Im delighted.  Ayr knew a win here would take them top of the Championship and started well with Robbie Crawford missing a good chance in the first minute. But they soon hit the self destruct button as their defence went AWOL to allow Nathan Austin in for a double before Liam Polworth rammed home a third. The game looked over with barely  minutes on the clock and shellshocked Ayr took time to regroup. Coventry-bound Michael Rose rocked the post with a header before Michael Moffat drew a fingertip save from Cammy Mackay. McCall turned to the bench at half time and introduced top gun Shankland who immediately turned the tide. He set up Declan McDaid to haul Ayr back into the contest with a close range finish eight minutes after the restart. And a resurgent Ayr thought they had a penalty when Carl Tremarco appeared to handle in the box but ref Nick Walsh waved away loud protests. United continued to pour forward as the clock ticked down and Shankland set up a grandstand finish when slamming home a  yard free kick with five minutes left.  But their comeback proved too little too late as Inverness clung on. Ayr boss McCall said: Im just gutted. Weve conceded three goals and at least two of them were gted with just crazy defending. And were the team with the best defensive record in the league. I think a draw would’ve been fair but it’s just one of those nights. It’s a dficult one to take to get beat.They’re a big strong team and at times we didn’t cope with that.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyrAyr NewsAyr United FC"},{"url":null,"title":"bllalana","story":"NewsbllalanaadfdfadsShareByStephen Houston:,  FEB News \"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThe Ayr branch of HMV shut down instantly as the new owner wielded the axe on  stores.

The iconic property, near Ayr Central, went under the hammer last Thursday. Wilsons Auctions Land and property sales executive, Lorren Mullen were managing the auction of the ex hotel. The three and a half storey building, which has lain empty for more than  years, consists of two commercial shop units on the ground floor and sandstone units above is located on Kyle Street. It had a guide price of pound,. A spokesman for Wilsons Auctions Land  Property Sales, said: “Unfortunately we cannot disclose any further detail on this property in terms of the identity of the purchaser or the sale price . “However this figure will be disclosed by the Registers of Scotland and the Ei Group in the coming months.” In May, the Post reported how plans to knock it down and turn it into a gym were rejected by councillors. Builders Dawn Developments wanted to build a new block in its place to home a gym and shops. But the plan was cut short as council planners want the hotel preserved or refurbished instead. And the sale happened after concerns about the safety of the former hotel were discussed at this month’s Fort, Seafield, and Wallacetown Community Council held at Ayr Town Hall. One community councillor said: “It is the most dangerous building in Ayr. ” It wasn’t the only empty building t discussed at the meeting. The meeting heard how young people were putting themselves in danger by gaining access to Belleisle House One said: ”If we can show concern then the council can take action and step in..” And the meeting was told how youngsters were “masquerading around” Strathdoon House.

Now the proposition has got a whole lot dferent. Pet Heaven, a crematorium for family animals, has just opened in Ayr. And businessman Forbes Robertson believes it is the answer for many families who want to give their four legged - or two-legged in the case of birds - friends a splendid send-off. No expense has been spared in an -month project at the former commercial garage site in West Sanquhar Road. Area MP Bill Grant performed the official opening ceremony last week. The lavishly decorated gilded interior includes a parlour where families can pay their last respects. Entrepreneur Forbes, who has business interests throughout the area, revealed up to  people can attend the pet funeral services . Mourners can watch as their pet recedes behind the final curtain at the close of the service, similar to what would happen in a human ceremony at Masonhill. As yet Pet Heaven cannot handle horses, but the biggest of dogs to cats, hamsters and birds. There is a tea and coffee service as well as any choice of music desired and a book of remembrance in the reception area.  Much of the interior decoration has been gathered by Forbes, a keen antique hunter and auction room collector. The company will offer a collection service as well as provide a selection of remembrance urns for ashes. It seems no expense is spared by some dog lovers in the UK and recently a couple spent pound on a full funeral including a horse drawn glass hearse. Forbes said: “People sometimes care more about their animals than humans. “A farmer who contacted me askedhis dog goes before him, the animal would be cremated here and I will store the ashes. “He told me his lawyer would be in touch as he wanted buried with his dog. “Pets are loyal, they don’t steal from you and are there first thing in the morning and last thing at night.” MP Bill Grant said Pet Heaven was a signicant investment for the area. He said: “I am sure this will be welcomed by pet owners from all over the southwest, pet owners who have lost their best friend. “To have a dignied departure for that pet who has been their friend - in some cases for  years - is a great service. “The set-up Mr Robertson has here is wonderful and I think he can be proud of it. “That last journey for pets will be full of dignity and respect from Pet Heaven and its staff. “Indeed my family had a wee dog Blackie for  years and I don’t mind admitting, then a senior fire officer, that I cried unashamedly for an hour at the loss of our companion”.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyrPetsSanquharAyr News"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"piping hot performance ayr stars","story":"NewsPiping hot performance from Ayr starsAyr Pipe Band Society took to the stage to support the world-renowned bagpipe band Red Hot Chilli Pipers.ShareByAbi Smillie:,  FEB NewsAyr Pipe Band Society gear up to support Red Hot Chilli Pipers at Ayr Town Hall \"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailPiping stars joined together to wow crowds at a top show in Ayr’s Town Hall.

However, it has a narrow focus in terms of local taxation.ldquoGiven the consultation only concluded last Friday, it is surprising that the Scottish Government were able to announce the tourist tax today.The new deal with the Scottish Greens includes an extra poundm for the core local government settlement, a move to three-year local authority budgets and legislation that will give councils control over tourism taxes.The deal also includes raising the council tax cap, meaning local authorities will now be able to increase council tax by .%, up from %.Fellow Tweeddale East councillor Stuart Bell, also leader of the councilrsquos Scottish national party opposition group , said: ldquoSignicant announcements have been made on a phased development of alternatives to the council tax. ldquoAlthough I donrsquot advocate that locally we should immediately take advantage of the proposal to give local authorities power to introduce a tourist tax, or the suggested workplace parking levy, these are adjustments that some Scottish city authorities will want to take up after the necessary legislation is approved.ldquoI am also pleased that talks on meaningful alternatives to council tax will restart and that with a three-year funding settlement, as opposed to the current one-year deals, there will be more clarity for local authorities on future funding.ldquoThere are also small changes in the - revenue grants for local authorities. Despite the constant chant of despair from the Bordersrsquo Tories, I said all along that the December announcements of funding for the council were only provisional. ldquoThe Conservatives who lead the council like to highlight that we were told we might see pound.m less for core revenue funding next year, conveniently forgetting to talk about promised money for new services such as the massive expansion in early learning and childcare.ldquoThey also omit to tell Borderers that we are getting poundm more next year as capital funding, almost exactly offsetting the change in revenue funding.ldquoWe must wait until the detail of the poundm package from the Scottish Government is analysed by officers, but my provisional calculation is that the new funding announcements could give the council more than pound.m, meaning that we will see a clear cash increase in next yearrsquos funding for core revenue and capital.ldquoSadly, we are being told that the Conservatives in Holyrood may vote against these welcome changes.Rachael Hamilton, Conservative MSP for Ettrick, Roxburgh and Berwickshire, said: ldquoThanks to the SNP, Scots across the country are about to be hit by a triple tax bombshell.ldquoThis budget not only taxes aspiration but taxes people for driving to work, which is quite frankly ridiculous in a constituency like mine, where travelling by car is essential.ldquoWe will pay the highest income taxes in the UK, council tax could go up and now you might even be taxed hundreds of pounds a year for taking your car to work.ldquoThe SNP have run out of ideas on how to grow and expand the economy.

around Candlemas and one of the most interesting came from Scotland.In the olden days, Candlemas was the day when children brought candles to school so that the classrooms would have light on dull days.As time went on, gas lighting took over from candlelight and the children brought money to school with which the teacher was supposed to buy sweets for the children.The child who brought in the most money was declared Candlemas King or Queen and they ruled for six weeks.They had the power to make one whole afternoon a week a playtime and to excuse anyone they wished from any form of punishment.I don#t think this will catch on in Argyll!I think it is a lovely custom to take a child to church or temple for a blessing and to give thanks to God for their birth.I have the privilege of

It was a cold day but my friend, who is skilled in bushcraft, had brought his portable fire pit with him.We searched for drtwood and sat by the fire, roasting marshmallows and warming our hands. It was a short walk but dramatic rock formations loomed above us, making it feel like a real adventure. The kids climbed them and explored the rocky beach, where once there had been an open-air bathing pool.On our , we went through a small tunnel-like arch. I stopped for a moment, suddenly taken by the view. The ruins of Dunbar Castle were beautully framed by the archway. Locals call this archway the keyhole and I reflected that the term is a perfect name.When we look through a keyhole, our vision is narrowly focussed. Such was the effect here. It cast a visual spotlight on what is left of what was once a mighty fortress.The kids trundled on before me, noticing smaller wonders: a frozen worm on the path, a sea shell and interesting-looking stones. But I stood for some moments, taking in the view beyond and thinking of what stories those old stones of the castle could tell.Many people pass this way every day, both locals and visitors. Itrsquos a section of the John Muir Way. I have often been with my family to Dunbar Leisure Pool and the harbour and town. But somehow I had missed this short but spectacular nearby walk until this day.Dunbar Castle is now but a fallen-down ruin. Indeed, itrsquos dficult to imagine what it once was. But the weathered sandstone castles on the shoreline built by nature still stand defiant, somehow reminding us of their greater permanence in the face of human transience. But as I stood looking at the ruins, the keyhole focussed my thoughts as well as my vision.History is also viewed through a keyhole, a very narrow one. The lives and events of the castle were lived in most part unrecorded by it. The spotlight of history has illuminated only brief moments, and even then the characters have been only those deemed lsquoimportantrsquo.There are moments where the view through the narrow keyhole of history has included insights to untold stories. The bravery of Black Agnes, as she defied the siege in , is one of those. With her husband away, she was in charge of this important fortress during war with England. She refused to give up the castle, even in the face of bombardment and attempts to starve her small garrison into submission. Her mocking of her besiegers by dusting down the battlements with her maids after a bombardment is an image seared in legend.But itrsquos a chink of light on a huge untold story we are led to believe by historyrsquos silence that women were insignicant players in events. For sure they were oppressed and put down by a system that centred on male power, but they are half of humanity and at least half the story.As the actions of Black Agnes reveal, even with such constraints put on them, women were there, part of events and often refusing to accept their assigned role.The le of Mary Queen of Scots has always been for me an example of this. Yes, she was privileged and powerful by birth, but because of this history took notice of her.Despite all the political and religious challenges she faced, it was her womanhood which men deemed her main failing. And so she was judged by dferent standards. Had she behaved with the morals of her father she would not have lasted five minutes in power. But no one raised an eyebrow because he was a man.But more than this, even though Mary was the monarch, her royal authority was deemed diluted and even less legitimate merely because she was a woman.So she understood she needed to find a husband to bring her royal authority to full strength in a country full of powerful and bullying misogynist men.She chose the dashing young Darnley, and the fact that he turned out to be dross was not, in my opinion, Maryrsquos fault. How easy it is to blame a woman for a manrsquos failings. She was taken in by him it was he who was the failure, not her.Thatrsquos what Irsquove always maintained, despite the protestations of my tutors at university. And her third husband Bothwell, well he was a disappointment as well.It is the stones of Dunbar,they could speak, who could tell us of the truth of his forced union with Mary. She had been taken there by him in April . The circumstances of this still remain debated. Was she abducted by him as later claimed, or did she go willingly It was also claimed she was raped and forced to marry Bothwell soon afterwards to save her honour . This idea has been disputed by some because Mary is said to have miscarried with twins while imprisoned at Lochleven Castle some months after, suggesting a relationship with Bothwell even before Darnleyrsquos murder. So a woman cannot be abused by a man she has had a relationship with  Really If they could talk, the stones of Dunbar would whisper the truths of those events in , and the despair and desperation of a strong and clever woman whose destiny was stolen mainly because of her sex.These were my thoughts as I stood looking through the keyhole towards Dunbar Castle. Suddenly, my daughter Manja broke my trance by wiggling the frozen worm in front of me. I smiled and thought to myself that thankfully times have changed since the days when the castle was a fortress.But sometimes, I fear, not as much as we think they have."},{"url":null,"title":"new-fidra-gin-hoping-for-east-lothian-base","story":"Fidra Gin is the brainchild of Emma Bouglet and Jo Brydie and is currently based at Ballencrieff and Aviemore.The duo came together to create the juniper berry-based drink and have already enjoyed immediate success, with the product already available in a number of Edinburgh restaurants.Now they are hoping to make it  per cent based in the county, with plans under way to find suitable premises.Emma said: ldquoWe pick all the botanicals in East Lothian and, at the moment, we use a still in Aviemore.ldquoA friend has lent us his still for the time being so we can get enough momentum behind us and bring the whole operation to East Lothian.ldquoWe have potentially secured a premise in East Lothian.

The doorsquocot is a clue that once a residence of some signicance stood here. It was called Dolphingstone Castle. Nothing now visibly remains of the castle, but around  years ago ruins were still to be seen.It was at one time an elegant mansion, but before that, on the same site, an older castle once stood ndash now all gone, and the structures of modernity are hemming in what is left of this ancient site. A wave of new housing laps at its walls to the west, the A traffic roars past on its south, and roads surround it on other quarters.One wondersthis small slice of East Lothian history will survive the developers. I hope it does. It is a small, historic fingerprint and gives a mysterious glimpse into our countyrsquos past, in an area now being carpeted with thousands of new houses.Earlier maps suggest that Dolphingstone Castle was surrounded by woodland. So perhaps the planting of a small wood or orchard within the old walls could create an island of both nature and history amidst the tide of urbanising development in this area.Up above on the ridge of Falside Hill to the south, the restored Farsquoside Castle looks down on the developments below . It sits like an eagle perched on a high ridge, observing the land below.How dferent the landscape it surveys would have been in  when, according to an old story, a small force of hand-picked warriors descended from the castle under the cover of darkness.It was just past midnight when they left, guided by a slither of moon. It was a raiding party, bent on revenge and heading for Preston Tower in what is now Prestonpans.Tradition tells us a feud had existed between the houses of Farsquoside and Preston for some years. The cause of the feud was the breaking down of walls between the two estates and the animals of each side grazing on the land of the other. Regular, and sometimes violent, clashes had taken place.But then Hamilton of Prestonrsquos livestock had been poisoned, or so it seemed. They had drunk from a burn which flowed from Farsquoside and it was assumed the water had been deliberately poisoned. Hamilton of Preston Tower, making no investigation, sent his men on a raid of violent retribution.Farsquoside Castle was attacked and blood was shed. This was the act which the select band of warriors who had set forth from Farsquoside were to avenge.In darkness, they filed down from the ridge on a path now known as Whinney Loan. This took them down to where the new houses are now being built on the southern edge of Wallyford.From here, great care was needed lest they be seen or heard. Dolphingstone Castle lay ahead and although their grievance was not with the occupants of Dolphingstone, early discovery could ruin the element of surprise.So the raiders veered north of Dolphingstone, by way of Prestoungrange, and at dawn, with the smell of the salt pans in their noses, they set about their vengeful work.Screams and running bairns alerted the occupants of Preston Tower. Armed men were ready, for this raid was expected, although not from this direction.The walls of Preston Tower held the attackers at bay but the people of the village suffered the worst of the slaughter. What senseless violence: neighbours separated only by the brae of a hill had been whipped up into a hateful frenzy against each other. Gradually the raiders melted away, back up the hill, with blooded swords.But hate builds on hate and the reckoning was not slow in coming. The very next day, Hamilton of Preston led a force westwards. It arrived by the walls of Dolphingstone Castle and then rounded past them to head up the hill towards Farsquoside, crossing where now the A speeds by.No attempt at surprise was required, this was to be an open fight. The Lord of Farsquoside had arranged his men along the top of the ridge, looking down on the approaching force of Hamiltonrsquos men. The order to charge was given and the men of Farsquoside poured down the slope.The leaders of both sides were in the thick of the fighting. It was the Lord of Farsquoside who fell, pulled from his horse and hacked to death by Hamiltonrsquos men.Seeing the death of their leader, the men of Farsquoside fled back to the castle. But the Lady of Farsquoside, in shock and rage at the death of her husband, rallied the men. She led them out of the castle in a furious charge as the sun began to set, forcing Hamiltonrsquos men to flee back to Preston.The battle, or skirmish as some would call it, was over, and the feud had reached its bloody climax. Soon after it was discovered an infectious disease had stricken the cattle, not poisoned water. Cattle on both sides had been equally affected. No one was to blame.How easy it had been to make enemies out of neighbours based on  assumptions. We are told Hamilton attempted to make amends. But the dead could not rise and the Lady of Farsquoside was said to be devastated at the loss of her husband. We can be sure others of lesser status suffered no less.This feud was over little remains to record it except tradition passed down, captured and retold by th-century writers such as P MrsquoNeill and Robert Seton, from whose works this account is garnished.Preston Tower still stands in Prestonpans, in a ruined but still defiant state. Farsquoside, much restored, is a visual delight still keeping watch atop the ridge. But only those feint hinds of Dolphingstone Castle remain, most of it lost to time and mystery just like the details of this story.But all the more reason to preserve and value them, I think."},{"url":null,"title":"betting-businesses-told-to-monitor-gambling-habits-of-people-on-benefits","story":"East Lothian Councilrsquos licensing board has approved a new gambling policy which puts the responsibility for policing the risks of betting in the hands of new licensees.Among the issues that new applicants will have to prove they have addressed before being given a licence will be monitoring ldquogaming trends that may reflect benefit payments, ldquoidentying and reporting attempts to launder money on premises and ldquoprotecting vulnerable people and those with gambling dependencies.Approving the new draft policy, which will govern the boardrsquos licensing decisions for the next three years, board members raised concerns about a lack of legislation to stophigh streets in deprived communities becoming lined with betting shops.Councillor Lachlan Bruce, Preston Seton Gosford ward member, called for current laws which prevent local authorities from refusing a licence to betting businesses because of overprovision to be changed.He said that it was impossible to walk down some town centre streets without being confronted by gambling premises offering promotions and deals.Mr Bruce told the meeting: ldquoThere are high streets in East Lothian where [betting shops] seem to be every  yards.ldquoThere is an issue where it is impossible to avoid gambling premises.The board was told that the Gambling Act  precluded using overprovision as a reason to refuse a licence for a betting shop.The councilrsquos new policy will put the onus for local risk assessments on applicants who want to open licensed gambling premises ranging from bookies to casinos, bingo halls, tracks and travelling fairs.Board member Councillor Jane Henderson, North Berwick Coastal, spoke of the dangers of gambling addiction, saying: ldquoGambling is an extremely destructive situation and sometime it does not get the headlines other things do.ldquoBut it crosses all walks of le and we, as a board and as iniduals, have a moral duty to recognise it is as much an illness as anything  and anything we can do to help should be taken very seriously.Councillor Willie Innes, council leader and Preston Seton Gosford ward member, cautioned that only a minority of people who gambled were affected by addiction and for others it was simply an activity they enjoyed.He told board members: ldquoWhen I first joined the council, gambling was a backstreet activity with premises down back alleys and it took us a long time to persuade the industry to come onto the high street.Mr Innes said that the new policy, which set out additional risk assessment requirements for applicants, sent ldquoa clear message to both the industry and those concerned about it."},{"url":null,"title":"prominent-cockenzie-campaigner-larry-tomlins-remembered","story":"Larry Tomlins, who was chairman of Cockenzie West Tenants and Residents Association, was involved in campaigns to reduce speeding and upgrade local park facilities in his community.The grandfather-of-two was an active supporter of the recent fight to implement speeding restrictions outside new housing at The Chimneys, Cockenzie, and helped oversee the trial and subsequent introduction of  miles per hourspeed limits in the Whin Park area of the village.Mr Tomlins, , grew up in Ayrshire and moved to Cockenzie more than  years ago, where he raised his family with we Ann.A consultant engineer, he ran his own successful business and still found the time to be an active member of his local community.He was a founding member of the tenantsrsquo and residentsrsquo association, which helped improve Whin Park for local families.Ward councillor Fiona OrsquoDonnell said: ldquoLarry made a huge contribution to the tenantsrsquo and residentsrsquo association and the wider community.

The Council would make joint decisions for the UK in shared areas, giving \"proper respect and weight\" to all involved on areas such as fishing and agriculture.Askedhis proposal would give the Scottish Government a veto over UK Government decisions, the Labour peer argued majority voting could apply to the decisions of the Council, admitting that would \"seriously threaten the sensibilities of the UK Government\".He went on: ldquoIf you had these two structures in place, then after  years[of devolution] and after Brexithellipthe UK would look much more like a multi-national governmental structure, which it should be, given the legislative autonomy there now is in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.The former Scottish Labour leader, who was First Minister between  and , made clear the Scotland Office - now officially dubbed the Office of the Secretary of State for Scotland ndash should be abolished and noted how he was \"surprised...there was still a Secretary of State for Scotland\" following devolution in .His former Government colleague, the Liberal Democrat peer Lord Wallace of Tankerness, backed plans for a UK Council of Ministers to deal with the ldquonew reality of a strengthened devolved settlement.The former Deputy First Minister also questioned the power of the Scotland Office, telling MPs: \"I suspect[David Lidington, the Cabinet Office Minister and Theresa Mayrsquos de facto deputy] carries more clout for Scotlands interests than Mr Mundell does no disrespect to Mr Mundell.ldquoI dont think we would be have been any worse off in the early days of devolutionthe Scotland Office had disappeared,\" he declared.Following the meeting, a UK Government spokeswoman said: \"The Secretary of State for Scotland and his office play a vital role in ensuring Scotlands voice is heard at the heart of Whitehall and that the UK Governments responsibilities and activities in Scotland are fully understood.\"Elsewhere in the committee hearing, Sir Peter Housden, the former head of the civil service in Scotland, recalled how relations between senior members of the UK and Scottish Governments \"could not have been more tense\" at times during the  independence referendum campaign.John Lamont, the Conservative committee member, asked him: \"Thinking back to  and the referendum, is it fair to say that relations between the two governments were quite tense \"Sir Peter replied: \"Well, interestingly, yes and no. At senior level they could not have been more tense on occasions but nevertheless there were important channels of communication that were being held open.\"I saw it as my responsibility, with officials in the UK Government, to keep those channels open.Meanwhile, Lord Wallace claimed Tony Blair, the then Prime Minister, \"spent most of the time looking out the window\" during Joint Ministerial Committee meetings with Scottish Government leaders.He said: \"I remember meeting in Edinburgh, in Cardf and by the time it came to the third meeting in Downing Street, I dont think Im exaggerating to say that Tony Blair spent most of the time looking out the window.

Between them they have five medical schools, three dental schools and two vet schools. There is an art school, a conservatoire and an agricultural college. But no matter what the size, the speciality or the location, Scotlandrsquos  universities are committed to reducing their carbon footprint.As for any other business or institution change comes at a cost and a lack of funding can mean the dference between a carbon reduction project happening and it remaining a well-intentioned idea in a strategic plan. It was a desire to help remove this barrier that led the Scottish Funding Councilto introduce its University Carbon Reduction Fund.Launched in , the fund has two strands one that supports large-scale programmes from pound, to pound million and one that supports smaller-scale energy efficiency projects. In the first year of the funding scheme  applications were funded to a tune of just over pound million.Amongst the larger projects was funding towards the University of Strathclydersquos pound million Combined Heat and PowerDistrict Heating system, itself part of a long-term, pound million investment in the universityrsquos infrastructure which is set to reduce its carbon-dioxide emissions by , tonnes and save pound million a year.SFCrsquos University Carbon Reduction Fund provided pound, to improve the efficiency of the existing heat network. Central to the improvements was the need to balance out iations in demand and prevent heat being vented into the atmosphere when demand was low. This is being achieved by the installation of a huge , litre thermal store. The funding also paid for over two kilometers of piping to extend the universityrsquos district heating network.Dr Roddy Yarr, Strathclydersquos Assistant Director , said: ldquoThese new works will extend and optimise the district energy network to generate additional financial and carbon savings. The university has been working in partnership with SFC on this and other innovative schemes and this funding is helping to transform the way that the university manages its energy costs and is able to tackle climate change.In the East of Scotland, a pound, funding investment at Heriot-Watt University illustrates a more typical package of measures underway to make Scottish universities greener. Designed to reduce the universityrsquos energy spend and carbon emissions from heating, it focusses on upgrading boiler plants in three student halls of residence. Once installed, the upgraded system will save an estimated % on heating bills and contribute to a % reduction in emissions.Elsewhere, projects are of the type that any energy-conscious homeowner would recognise ndash but scaled up to a large organisation level. At Abertay University inefficient fluorescent lighting is being replaced by modern LED fittings with intelligent controls to make sure lights go off in unoccupied areas or when natural daylight is providing enough illumination. New lighting systems at the University of Dundee include improving the working environment in laboratories in a scheme that will reduce energy consumption by  percent.

Itrsquos a government which is concealing from parliament, and concealing from those who are in good faith trying to negotiate the budget, the facts of the availability of funds.ldquoSurely you need to reflect on this cabinet secretary Committee convener Bruce Crawford advised Mr Fraser to watch his language.Mr Mackay said he had been ldquohonest, transparent and clear throughout.Mr Fraser said later: ldquoDerek Mackay today confirmed that he and Patrick Harvie were bailed out at the last minute by [Chancellor] Philip Hammond.ldquoDespite demanding independence at every turn, their deal only got through thanks to the United Kingdomrsquos system of pooling and sharing resources. What complete hypocrites.ldquoWorse, Mr Mackay failed to tell parliament or any opposition parties of his windfall before he presented his Budget last week ndash despite knowing about it  days before. He has behaved in an underhand and dishonest fashion, which does the SNP no credit whatsoever."},{"url":null,"title":"bins to be collected once every three weeks in new council strategy","story":"Aberdeenshire residents will be encouraged to become recycling champions with the introduction of a controversial three-weekly collection programme.The revised waste strategy for all , properties in the Shire was approved in a - vote by the council’s Infrastructure Services Committee despite an alternative option from Peterhead SNP councillor Stephen Smith who said it was “too much, too soon”.From April next year, households will have weekly kerbside collections for one of three bins including a  litre bin for paper and card and  litre bin for metals, plastics and cartons.However under the new scheme, the existing general residual bin for non-recyclable waste will be signicantly reduced to a  litre capacity.Councillors were told by waste director Philip McKay that while it was a considerable reduction, the service felt it “should be manageable for most households”.He added that while a three-weekly non-recyclable waste collection might feel a bit daunting to residents initially – as did the move from weekly to fortnightly collections in Aberdeenshire a few years ago – experience from other Scottish local authorities showed that it is workable and can lead to a signicant increase in recycling rates.Mr McKay also stressed that given the larger recycling capacity provided in the favoured option, it provided “more flexibility in the future” for the addition of other recyclable materials without the need for additional recycling containers.Councillors were told that the scheme had the potential to save waste services £, per year at the lower end of the scale and even morethere was a higher uptake in recycling.However, Peterhead councillor Stephen Smith said the proposals as they stood were a step too far for North-east communities.In a bid to address concerns about the potential impact of any necessary changes to the waste strategy, he proposed that instead of using a -litre bin for three weekly collections, Aberdeenshire Council instead do what has happened in much of the rest of Scotland and keep the  litre bin for three weekly waste collections, with new  litre bins – which are expected to be funded in large part by ‘Zero Waste Scotland’ – being used for paper and card recycling for a transitional period.Councillor Smith’s proposal – which he claimed would have saved an estimated £, annually – followed confirmation from council officers that such a proposal would be compatible with Zero Waste Scotland’s requirements for helping to fund the cost of the new bins required.But council depute leader Peter Argyle warned against “changing horses” halfway through the programme as it would only lead to confusion.He told the committee that with an imminent landfill ban on biodegradable waste “coming down the tracks” by , it was “unacceptablewe don’t recycle” and questioned how people would be encouraged to recycle morethey continued to have the larger residual waste bin.data-src\"https:res. jpress image fetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.fraserburghherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Local musicians Morag McCormick and Arthur Coates try out the studio equipment\"  Musicians bank recording time with new play and exchange deal viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"FRAS | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"FRAS | Article Teaser\"He also stressed that Aberdeenshire Council waste teams would continue to visit every house in the region every week.*What’s your view  Visit our Facebook page."},{"url":null,"title":"posting parcels to eu countries after brexit","story":"Q: I have an online business with  per cent international sales, but neither Royal Mail nor the Post Office can sayCN customs labels are going to be required for the EEA EU.Any idea A CN is a customs document, used when goods are being transported overseas.

them.The £m project was completed last year and pupils have been at the school since August.During the building’s construction more than  pupils were taken by bus daily to nearby Midmill School for  months, following a fire in the old building back in .Temporary accommodation on site was made for the nursery children.The new library space at Kinellar SchoolThe new school is built on the same site as its predecessor. As part of the build, the project team used the opportunity to improve facilities in the village by redeveloping a derelict tennis court and constructing an enclosed children’s play park as well as additional parking for use by the school and local community.The school’s social staircase is already becoming a well-used architectural feature alongside its many other bright and airy flexible learning spaces, including the glass fronted library and learning area upstairs.Its teaching wings benefit from cleverly designed acoustics, modern set up and technology offerings in all  classrooms, and are on two levels, with lightwells connecting them.Specially commissioned artwork is also an important feature of the new school.Local artists worked with pupils to design and create a number of pieces, including a large Oak tree in the dining area symbolizing growth with leaves painted by every child.  Aberdeenshire Provost Bill Howatson said: “A great team effort has led to the delivery of an extremely high quality building on time and on budget, and we’re thankful to everyone who has played their part in that. data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Erasums students question what will happen after Brexit\"  What is the future for Erasmus students after Brexit  viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"“It stands testament to what a community can achieve by working together, right from those dark early days after the fire when local people rallied round to offer soup and sandwiches to staff, to the lovely reception pupils received from the community in Kintore.”Chair of Education and Children’s Services Committee, Councillor Gillian Owen said: “It’s not only wonderful to see the pupils at Kinellar enjoying their new school but also to reflect on what a fantastic learning experience this project has given them.

The planning application also covers landscaping and future restoration of the site.The application process is being handled by consultants AECOM.The council-owned quarry currently supplies stone and aggregate materials for Council roads and building projects as well as the local construction industry.  It extracts Devonian Flagstone which is highly suited to a range of crushed aggregate products, in particular as roadstone and aggregates, used for producing asphalt for road construction and maintenance, with the quarry being the only active producer of asphalt in Orkney.The activity at the quarry generates an income for the Council which is reinvested to provide and protect some of the vital services we provide in Orkney.The current quarry area is heading towards the end of its use and an expansion would safeguard supply of materials. Current output ranges between , and , tonnes of rock per year andapproved, the ha expansion will release approximately  million tonnes of additional resources, sufficient for another  years of production.Full details are available on the Council website at http:www.orkney.gov.uk Council C long-term-development-of-cursiter-quarry-in-firth.htmPersons wishing to provide comments on the proposed development can do so by writing to AECOM at fraser.blackwood@aecom or by post to Fraser Blackwood, APEX ,  Haymarket Terrace, Edinburgh, EH HD by  February .OIC says that, at this stage, comments made to Aecom are for the purposes of assisting with the scheme design and EIA process and as such are not representations to the Planning Authority.

These moves are hugely intensive and provide a short-term boost for local workers and the economy. Such projects also develop the expertise and credibility of Scotland’s already impressive pool of financial services talent. : Nicola Sturgeon: Real and growing risk of no-deal BrexitHowever, that fact remains that much high-value work generated by exporting financial services to the EU is draining out of the Scottish economy permanently.On the other hand, there are new opportunities emerging as a direct result of the Brexit effect – for example firms are bringing some foreign operations back to Britain. Whilst the inward surge is not expected to match what is being lost, we are seeing a trend of UK and foreign firms relocating parts of their business to the UK to ensure they can continue to support their UK customer base. This includes many UK insurers who had previously set up offshore subsidiaries.The driver for larger UK firms moving operations to the EU is to satisfy their European customers, who are seeking assurances that there will be no disruption to their services in the event that no withdrawal deal is reached.However, some customers have raised concerns about whether they will get the same levels of consumer protection as offered in the UK – such as the protection of the Financial Services Compensation Scheme.We are advising a range of organisations, including a number of high-growth, financial technology businesses, who are planning their international growth strategy with Brexit in mind. We are seeing particularly high levels of activity in the payments industry. Many expanding fintech businesses in Scotland have an ambitious global outlook.: Brexit: Queen to be evacuated in event of no-deal, reports claimIt would be much simpler for them to grow abroadthe EU wasn’t to suddenly become a ‘foreign’ jurisdiction. On the other hand, many of these firms already have processes in place to manage a truly international business. For those companies, the potential barriers to exporting financial services to EU are relatively simple to plan for.International trade in financial services is particularly restricted by the requirement of firms to be authorised to undertake regulated activities. This is why Brexit is a serious issue for the financial sector to contend with. Currently we are part of a common regulatory regime, so any firm authorised to provide financial services in one EU member state can effectively get permission to conduct business in any other member state, using a mechanism known as ‘passporting’. When we are no longer in the EU, UK firms will lose their rights to passport their permissions to the EU. UK firms will be subject to the same restrictions as other firms from where across the globe.The UK will be eligible to apply for equivalence in a limited number of regulated activities, but this process is not automatic. It requires the approval of the European Commission, which could take considerable time and be subject to political obstacles. If an equivalence is approved for the UK, there would be a requirement to maintain close alignment to the EU financial services regulations. The Commission has the discretion to withdraw their approval at any time, which would provide little certainty for UK firms.On the flipside, any EU firm wanting to trade here will have to satisfy the UK’s own rules. Even though no deal has been agreed at the moment, the UK Government has thus far given assurances that regardless of what happens we’ll continue to give EU firms the opportunity to continue trading whilst applying for UK permissions up to March . They must noty the UK regulators in advance of Brexit to get the temporary permissions, but this gives more certainty to EU firms trading here than the other way around as it stands.If we are looking for positives where there are some short-term benefits of a weaker pound, which helps keep inward investment into the UK on the radar as an appealing prospect, but there is a bigger foreign exchange risk for the future should our economy and currency value begin to erge signicantly from mainland Europe.We have been helping our clients to review their businesses in order to better understand how Brexit will affect them. In some cases, depending on their set-up, it turns out after a thorough analysis that there are few specic risks.However, the process has been useful as a prompt to look at their operations in detail to see where there could get more general business efficiencies and opportunities. That may be the one silver lining to emerge from the Brexit process, whether there are any more remains to be seen.Stuart Murdoch is a solicitor advocate and partner at Burness Paull LLP©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4868785.1549464609!/image/image.jpg","title":"mike russell scotland facing deep recession under no deal brexit","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...A No deal Brexit could plunge Scotlands economy into a \"deep recession\" with widespread job losses and firms leaving the country, Brexit Secretary Mike Russell has warned.Scots could also face food price hikes of -% with rural areas of the country facing particular issues, he told MSPs at Holyrood.The cabinet Secretary spoke out as the likelihood of a No deal scenario looks increasingly likely, with Prime Minister Theresa May struggling to salvage her much-maligned Withdrawal Deal after its Commons rejection.Read more: Donald Tusk: ‘A special place in hell’ exists for Brexit backersThe Scottish Government has been \"steadily intensying\" its preparations for a No deal in the early months of the year, Mr Russell revealed today.He warned: \"A No-Deal Brexit has the potential to generate a signicant economic shock which could tip the Scottish economy into recession - potentially into a deep recession.\"It would also have a severe impact on the labour market resulting in potential job losses, business relocations and closures, underemployment and a reduction in recruitment.\"He even called for extra cash reserves be to pumped into the banking system, with small business likely to be worst hit.Read more: How to prepare your business in case of a no deal BrexitA special Scottish Government Resilience Committee, headed up by Deputy First Minister John Swinney has been established, with councils chiefs and Police Scotland involved.Fears of freight delays at Dover and through the channel tunnel could hit goods coming to Scotland, with rural areas worst hit.Mr Russell added: \"Transport Scotland is also working with transport providers and ports and airports in Scotland to assess their existing capacity and identy how they could help mitigate disruption and ensure that Scotland’s exporters can continue to get their goods to market.\"The absence of a trade agreement between the UK and the EU would result in World Trade Organisationtarfs for imports and exports is also expected to seesignicant price increases, MSPs heard, particularly for food and drink. \"The Governor of the Bank of England has identied potential rises of between -%,\" Mr Russell added.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4868792.1549465314!/image/image.jpg","title":"these 21 incredible images show how edinburgh looked before the st james centre","story":"As work on the #bn new St James complex in Edinburgh gathers pace, we peel back the layers of time to lt the lid on the area as it looked before the high street retailers and global shopping brands moved in, when it was still among the most densely-populated urban areas in all of Scotland.Hundreds of families would be displaced when streets laced with ageing and often dilapidated tenements crashed to the ground under the weight of the wrecking ball to make way for a bus station , followed by the St James Centreand the Omni Centre , over the course of four decades.

If anything, it should be amplied.It turned into a trilogy. There was a Great Book of Skye Two in , and now we have the #Great Book of Skye Three#.That was perhaps predictable. In the first volume, Cailean Maclean commented that he had two problems in persuading Norman Macdonald to prepare the book. The first problem was to get him to start the second was to get him to stop.Three books and , pages later, the prof has stopped — or so he says.The three volumes comprise a Dictionary of Skye Biography. The lives of almost , people are profiled and illustrated inside their pages. They have all #been Skye born or bred or are people who have had an intimate connection with the island. They have all been noteworthy in one way or another… #There has never been more than , people living in Skye at any one time, and for much of history — particularly recent, recorded history — its population has been much smaller than that.Nobody, however, will be too surprised that Norman and Cailean uncovered and portrayed over a thousand eminent Sgiathanaich. Without wishing to kickstart Norman once again, the miracle is that they enumerated so few. The island, like almost all Hebridean islands, has been a breeding ground of talent and character.The only other qualication for entry in the Great Books of Skye is that you must be dead. You, dear reader, however, accomplished you might be, will not be able to read your entry unless metaphysics permits you access from your celestial cloud. These are obituaries, not panegyrics.That lends a sombre tone to certain pages of the Great Book of Skye Three. There are people featured here who, we are sharply reminded, were alive when volume one was in preparation.Here, for instance, is the smiling face of Dr Vicky Ann Galbraith, who was born in Portree in  and who died at home in Aird Bernisdale of brain cancer in .Vicky Ann was achievement personied. A leading scientist for Roche Pharmaceuticals, she also played for Scotland#s national women#s rugby union team on  occasions. Following her fatal diagnosis, she raised thousands of pounds for cancer research by leading sponsored walks from Portree to Glasgow, up the West Highland Way and where.Here is Thomas William Mackenzie. You may have known him as Tommy. He was born in  and he died last March. He was, in the GBS abbreviated subheading, a #printmaker, etcher and gallery owner, Chieftain of Skye Highland Games, boat race devotee, tug-of-war revivalist, shinty enthusiast, and half-marathon runner.#That just about covers it, as a dictionary of biography is forbidden to indulge itself and cannot add that for very many people, Tommy Mackenzie was the face and personality of modern Portree.These volumes, these hefty Great Books of Skye, are a leisurely parade along Wentworth Street and then out to the peninsulas, pausing to wave at or pass the time of day with Victorian land reformers, clan chiefs, bards, teachers, surgeons, fishermen, and climbers. It#s a verbal Skye equivalent of the cover of #Sergeant Pepper#s Lonely Hearts Club Band#.Sir Harold Boulton was not a Sgiathanach. He came from Hertfordshire and was educated at Harrow and Oxford.In  he married into the Highland quality via a Dingwall military family. Boulton already had an interest in Gaelic song and music.He enters the Great Book of Skye because, in the late th century, Boulton seems to have heard a Gaelic rowing song and put his own, English, words to the tune.Those lyrics and that tune have become internationally known as #The Skye Boat Song#. Norman Macdonald digresses wonderfully on Boulton#s creation of a supposed Jacobite anthem.We are still left with the dilemma of the bonnie boat#s journey. The original Gaelic version may have celebrated a voyage from Torrin to Loch Coruisk. For most of the th century, it was assumed to refer to Charles Edward Stuart#s post-Culloden flight by sea from the mainland to Skye.As Charles never made such a journey directly by sea, pedants have more recently suggested that Boulton must have been referring to the Pretender#s actual sea voyage It really, really, does not matter. We are in the realms of mythology. Charles may as well have been sailing from Papua New Guinea. Harold Boulton invented the whole damn thing — the misty isle#s most famous song is a Victorian concoction — and in recognition of that, he deserves his entry in the Great Book of Skye Three.And finally, here we are back in Portree. William Cowie was born in Kiltarlity in  and became an agricultural advisor in Skye in the s. The brother of a professional footballer, Cowie devoted himself to shinty and became one of the greatest players of his era.Fittingly, he married in  a grand-daughter of the captain of the Skye shinty team which had won the inaugural MacTavish Cup in .William and Margaret Cowie had two sons, Ross and William. He died too young, at the age of  years, while playing badminton in Portree Drill Hall.William Cowie would, therefore, have been shy of his th birthday had he led his natural course to June  and a day in Fort William which would have caused him, more even than the rest of Skye, unimaginable pride.It is tempting to say of all three Great Books of Skye that they are for dipping in and out rather than reading as a single narrative. The trouble with that suggestion is that once you#ve dipped in, it is very hard to dip out again.As a trilogy, they are a phenomenal publishing achievement. They should take their place, alongside the inevitable Tommy Mackenzie print, in every home in Skye."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/INDOOR-SHINTY-19-P4-7-FINAL-2.jpg","title":"skye schools indoor shinty competition all the action in","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineYoung shinty players fromthroughout Skye gathered to take part in two indoor tournaments for primary school teams last weekend.Portree High’s Fingal Centre hosted competitions for P-P and for P-and-under teams.On a fast and furious day of excellent shinty action teams fromBun-sgoil Ghàidhlig Phort Rìgh won both competitions.Broadford were runners up in the P- competition, with North West taking second spot in the P-under tournament following an epic final."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/web-ad-sales-large.jpg","title":"skye charities work to be showcased at skeabost","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineA multi-charity event will be held in Skeabost on Saturdayto highlight the work of several good causes across Skye.The event will be held at Skeabost Memorial Hall from  am until  pm and will provide information on the work carried out by a iety of charities in the area, as well as insight into the costs and challenges they face.to raise awareness of the event, which will support Skye and Lochalsh Young Carers the Skye and Lochalsh Foodbank Crossroads Care # Skye and Lochalsh Macmillan Cancer Support Skye Dance Bloodwise, and Rotjanas Hands, which Mr Williams set up with his we nearly  years ago.He said: “I have been an independent fundraiser for many years – I am a trustee of Rotjanas Hands – formally known as Hands Across the Water – which I set up alongside my we following the Indonesian Tsunami .”He added: “For me, it has always been important to share particularly when we are so fortunate and others not so.

If anyone wants to see what makes a real Ballymena man they need only look at Sir William Wright.” Lauren Christie, speaking on behalf of the extended Wright family, thanked all who attended for the honour conferred on her grandfather and paid special tribute to Mrs. Ruby Wright, who, she described as ‘the great woman behind the great man’.

I was born in , my family have been resident in Ballymena for generations, Allen, obviously, on my fathers side and Gribben on my mothers. My parents moved into the Demesne Estate shortly after it was built, first living in Carnduff Drive and then after a few years moving to Glenshesk Drive where they lived the rest of their lives.  I attended Ballymena Boys Secondary School. Music lessons were pretty much a non event. Every exam time each student would be hauled up to the front of class to sing a song and was awarded a C grade. My standout memory of music lessons was hearing the music teacher playing an album of Holsts Planet Suite to himself, this at least started a le long love of classical music.  In my early teens Glam rock was the big thing but apart from Bowie, T Rex, Rod Stewart etc I seldom listened to the charts.  I was more into album bands like Cream, Taste, Hendrix, early Fleetwood Mac, Pink Floyd and especially Led Zeppelin. Of course I followed the usual links from these back through Willie Dixon, Muddy Waters, Howlin Wolf to the Delta greats, Robert Johnson, Son House and Charley Patton.  First real early Blues album I heard was by Leadbelly and then Robert Johnson : The King of the Delta Blues , album which has been a major influence on my playing ever since.  I started playing bass guitar when I was about twelve then switched to six string. FLAMINGOMy first paying gig was at The Flamingo playing bass with local rockers Angel when I was fourteen.  After discovering the joys of Blues and Booze, I could be found many a night after closing time, sitting around a fire in the woods at the back of my old school, playing guitar and singing the Blues with friends.  Many Friday nights were passed in The Bridge, Dunloy listening to South Bound Train and most Saturdays were spent in The Pound or The Harp Bar in Belfast, catching as much live music as I could.  This was during the dark days of the Troubles, with bomb warnings and check points an everyday normality but somehow music lovers seemed to live in a world apart, music clubs being one of the few places religion didnt encroach on.  I have played in ious bands throughout the years, including Angel, AGS, Harpers Hill Blues Band, The Flood and BIDDY EARLY as well as playing as a solo Delta Blues player, playing slide guitar harmonica.  Lately I have seriously got into electric Blues Harp, being influenced by Sonny Boy Williamson ii, Little Walter, Paul Butterfield, John Myall, Walter Horton etc. I currently play Blues Harp with The Matchstick Men, Irelands premier Status Quo tribute act, and I also regularly sit in with Legal Tender and Blues Taxis. I can be found most first Saturdays of the month at the excellent BT Blues and Rock Club sitting in on Harp with the featured bands. For the last six years I have been host of BIDDY EARLYS Open Mic at the BT Club, one of the Provinces most successful Open Mics which I also founded. I have finally decided to call an end to it at the start of this year to concentrate on my own music.  I play ious instruments guitar,  string guitar, slide guitar, bass guitar, banjo, mandolin, auto harp, Appalachian mountain dulcimer and of course Blues Harp.  Yeah, after all these years, Ive still got the Blues, once your hooked, thats it for le! - see BB King, John Lee Hooker, Buddy Guy etc.  As for other local promoters of the Blues, theres the afore mentioned BT Blues Club which Looi Burns has been doing an excellent job of running for many years and of course local bands like Legal Tender and Blues Taxis.

Nowadays even the most hard to wake sleepers have bleepers, bells and even the dulcet tones of Alexa at their bedside to ensure they get up for work in time.But in times gone by, it wasn’t just a case of a verbal shot across the bows from the bossyou turned up late for work - back in the so-called ‘good old days’ it could mean the loss of a day’s pay or maybe even your job. And back in the hungry s when every day was a grind to put the most basic grub on the table and keep a roof over your head, it was women like the lady opposite who you relied on to get you to your work on time.Our pictures show one of the last of the ‘knocker-uppers’ who rose well before the crack of dawn every day in le to go round the doors to give people their morning alarm call.Known as ‘The Lady With The Map’, Mary Millar plied her trade in Kells and Connor.A knocker-up was a job in Britain and Ireland that started during and lasted well into the Industrial Revolution, when alarm clocks were neither cheap nor reliable.Most had given up the role by the begnning of the s but Mary was still performing her morning task up until the outbreak of World War .  The knocker-up used a baton or short, heavy stick to knock on the clients doors or a long and light stick, often made of bamboo, to reach windows on higher floors. At least one of them used a pea-shooter!In , the knocker-up would be paid a few pence a week. The knocker-up would not leave a clients window until they were sure that the client had been awoken.A knocker upper would also use a snuffer outer as a tool to rouse the sleeping. This implement was used to put out gas lamps which were lit at dusk and then needed to be extinguished at dawn.There were large numbers of people carrying out the job, especially in larger industrial towns. Generally the job was done by elderly men and women but sometimes police constables supplemented their pay by performing the task during early morning patrols.The pictures, re-discovered by areporter on a research task at the Local Studies Department of Ballymena Library appeared in the Belfast Newsletter in January of .

Only one in ten of these people survived to be discharged from hospital. However, with CPR and defibrillationwithin  to  minutes of collapse, survival rates can rise to % and above.Ambulance response times to cardiac arrests are typically longer than this, as in Northern Ireland they average  minutes. Andthis is why communities across the Northern Ireland have formed these community first responder schemes.Volunteers are trained, and dispatched at the same time as the responding ambulance crew, by NIAS.The Braid Valley is now joining this movement.Leonard Wharry, the scheme coordinator, explained: We aim to go live in early summer with a scheme covering Ballymena, Broughshane and the surrounding rural areas.Were raising money for defibrillators and other equipment, but our priority is to recruit and train volunteers.

At only four-days-old Dáithí travelled to London where he underwent open heart surgery. Six days after that he underwent his second open heart operation.Máirtín described the stay as a “hard week” for his family and told the Andersonstown News that although Dáithí’s hearthasn’t declined, there had been slight damage done to his kidneys due to the high dosage of medicine the Ballymurphy toddler has to take.“It was a hard week for Dáithí, it was a hard week for us as well,” explained Máirtín. “There were constant needles, test after test for Dáithí but we got through it. The staff were amazing and the cardiologist seemed happy with Dáithí’s heartbut noticed some kidney damage.“Dáithí takes medicine for his heart, to help him go to the toilet he takes aspirin, around  doses of medicine in total a week. The hospital will be keeping an eye on it. Dáithi’s heartis okay at the minute and he is stable.“I know I speak for Seph and I when I say it was tough for us. When we first went over last year we have been educating ourselves ever since around organ donation and it’s got a lot more real. We were speaking to the surgeon who is going to be taking Dáithi’s heart out and eventually putting in a new one hopefully, it’s a lot more real,” he saidSince the family’s ‘Is Deontóír Mé Yes I Donate’ campaign began back in July, launched by Lord Mayor Deirdre Hargey, there has been an increase of four per cent in the number ofpeople in the north who have opted into the organ donation register.Máirtín stressed how transplant is not a cure, but a last resort when all other options have been exhausted.“Seph and I came back from Newcastle saying we had to up the campaign, we have to keep raising awareness. When we were over we had to sign consent forms for the heart surgery for when Dáithí receives his gt, for the surgery to go ahead. You are basically siging a consent form with a list of risks and the first thing that it states is ‘death’ in capital letters and that’s jumping out of the page.“I did a radio interview this week and we were asked ‘so you are basically waiting for someone to die’ so that Dáithí can receive his gt – I said my son is dying, that’s the reality of it. We are desperate to help save his le and truly believe that awareness is key.”“Dáithí had his tube out for three months there and people thought he was fixed because he looks so well, people don’t always think he is sick.”An avid Paw Patrol and Liverpool FC fan, Máirtín and Seph spoke of how their son will continue to wait on the routine list. “He is stable enough to be at home,” explained Seph. “We asked the medical team over in Newcastle what are his chances of getting a heart on the routine list and there was little to none. It’s not impossible but it doesn’t happen that often. There are quite a few children around Dáithí’s weight and age that are unfortunately on the urgent list. We want to be at this stage because it means we are getting more time.”“You don’t want him to get worse but he is going to get worse,” added Máirtín. “While organ donation as a whole is up, hearts for children are down the last two years and that list is going up. As I said transplant is not a cure, transplant give you time. Everybody is dferent the first transplant baby in the UK is now in her ’s. The anxiety that Seph and I have will probably never go away. The last two years have been some of the best and worst times of our lives. We love Dáithí so much and will do anything to get as much time with him as possible.“We have put down hurdles, the first was getting to Newcastle, the second was getting Dáithí assessed, the third was getting him accepted onto the organ list and the next one is getting him a new heart. There will be lots after that but we’ve been taken it one wee step at a time. We would rather be on that rocky road than no road at all,” he said.A family health morning will take place on Saturday February  from -pm as part of Heart Awarnesss month at Glór na Móna.To register to become an organ donor visit: www.organdonation.nhs.uk register-to-donate register-your-details "},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"mcdaid double ends stars cup hopes","story":"Irish Cup Sixth RoundLarne Crumlin Star A SECOND half brace from David McDaid crushed Crumlin Star#s dreams of a place in the last eight of the Irish Cup as runaway Championship One leaders, Larne fought back from a goal down to claim the win at a sunny and cold Inver Park on Saturday.The Ardoyne side dared to dream when Joe McNeill put them into the lead on  minutes, but the hosts drew level on  thanks to a Jeff Hughes header and after the break, they went ahead when McDaid converted what looked a harshly awarded penalty after Hughes# shot hit the arm of Ciaran Hughes and the ex-Cltonville striker make sure of victory with a late goal.Star were far from disgraced in this game and their large support could be proud of their team#s efforts on the day as they put it up to the Premiership-bound opposition who were laden with players who have played at the top level including former Reds in McDaid, Martin Donnelly, Tomás Cosgrove and Conor Devlin.In front of a big crowd that added to the occasion, the visitors opened with confidence and two minutes in, Devlin had to get down to his right to claw Barry McKervey#s free-kick around the post for a corner that led to a shot from Mark Lyons flying wide right.Larne gradually got to grips with the early pressure and looked to move the ball quickly in order to find gaps in the Star defence.Their first chance fell to McDaid who didn#t get hold of his shot and it was easily saved by Shane Harrison.On nine minutes, Martin Donnelly weaved his way past a number of challenges from the right and found himself just yards out, but he elected to place his shot rather than put power behind it with the goal at his mercy and Harrison was able to get down to stop it and get his behind for a corner that was aimed at the back post, but McDaid headed just too high.Star remained a threat and were always looking to create an opening # something they did to perfection on  minutes when brothers, Aidan and Joe McNeill combined to perfection with Aidan playing a perfectly-weighted ball in behind the Larne defence with Joe beating Devlin to the ball and lted it over the goalkeeper and into the net to send the away support into raptures.The pressure was now on Larne and they bombarded Star in search for the equaliser.Patrick McNally # a replacement for the injured Shane McEleney # headed over from Tomás Cosgrove#s shot and Cosgrove then saw his shot at the near post saved.The hosts were getting closer and on  minutes, the goal came when Hughes rose to meet Donnelly#s corner from the right and thundered a header high into the net.The momentum was with Larne and Donnelly then saw his brilliant free-kick saved onto the post and cleared by Harrison, while on the stroke of half-time, Cosgrove#s curling effort from the edge of the box went just outside the post with the goalkeeper beaten.With the sides level at the break, it was all to play for and both tried to establish themselves early in the second period.Chances were thin on the ground with Larne#s Jeff Hughes hooking a th minute effort well off target, but they really should have gone ahead on  minutes when Cosgrove cut in on the left and rolled a good ball across the face of goal to McNally a couple of yards from goal, but he inexplicably lted the ball over when it looked much easier to score.Larne did get their noses in front on  minutes from McDaid#s penalty, but Star certainly felt the award was hard as Hughes# shot at goal seemed to just hit the arm of Burns who had no time to get out of the way, but a spot-kick was the decision of referee Shane Andrews and McDaid made no mistake, firing high into the net.Star now needed a goal, but they were unable to carve out any clear chances with Larne looking to put the game away and Martin Donnelly had a couple of chances, but couldn#t find the goal his performance deserved.Instead, it was left to McDaid who swept home in the final minute from Lee Lynch#s cross from the right to seal his side#s passage into the quarter-final.LARNE: C Devlin, C Ramsey, T Cosgrove, J Hughes, L Lynch, S McEleney , F Sule, G Kelly, B Tiney , M Donnelly , D McDaid.

Up stepped Peter Henvey and his shot was well-struck high into the net to tie the game at -.Carryduff made the perfect response as from the restart, they moved straight upfield with Beatty getting on the ball, finding Ciaran Sherry who broke through and squared for Darragh Connolly who rose to palm into the net and restore his side#s three-point lead.Beatty and Owen McCabe added points as it appeared Carryduff were set to pull away, but St Brigid#s refused to break as John Blaney and Rory Brolly kicked scores to get them back to within three.Beatty and Finnegan traded points while Beatty added another from play to make it a four-point game with seven to play, but St Brigid#s were far from done.Five minutes from time, substitute Paul Bradley gathered Peter King#s long ball and waited for movement inside. He spotted James Smith in space and played a high ball that Smith rose to meet and brilliantly palm to the corner of the net.Again, Carryduff went upfield and found the net when Beatty put Connolly in on the right, but while his shot was destined for the net, substitute Eoin Rooney decided to make sure of it by getting his foot to it. However, Rooney was well inside the small square before the ball and the effort was correctly ruled out for a square ball.St Brigid#s took full advantage as they swept upfield and Smith thumped over a great point to level with three to play.Once more, Carryduff were able to respond. This time, Guinness created space  meters out and his shot curled just inside the post with the referee # standing right behind the shot # overruling the umpire who waved it wide.St Brigid#s still had time to save themselves, but they couldn#t engineer a score as Carryduff broke away and almost sealed their win, but Rooney#s shot crashed off the crossbar to give the Antrim champions one last chance. But with the whistle in referee Martin Conroy#s mouth, it was now or never and Brolly had to shoot from an unfavourable distance, the effort tailing right and wide as Carryduff held on.CARRYDUFF: D Ross L Toal, G Henderson, C Cunningham J McGeough , D Coogan, D GuinnessP Laverty , J ConneryR Anderson , O McCabe , P Loughran D Connolly , R Beatty , C Sherry.

The draft Withdrawal Agreement is flawed because the backstop would undermine the economic and constitutional integrity of the United Kingdom.“It is welcome that the Prime Minister is travelling to Brussels to seek changes but she must stand strong and by the commitments she made to the House of Commons.“We want a deal. One that works for us as well as our neighbours in the Republic of Ireland. But we must face reality. There is no ‘agreement’ unless it is able to command the necessary support in Parliament.”Mrs May heard a dferent message from Sinn Fein. Party president Mary Lou McDonald said the backstop remained the “bottom line”.“Ireland will not be the collateral damage of the Tory Brexit” @MaryLouMcDonald tells media after meeting with Theresa May pic LxEKeyh— Sinn FéinFebruary , “That has consistently been our position, that is the position of everybody across Irish public and political le, with the exception of the DUP,” she said.Mrs McDonald accused Mrs May of coming to Belfast with “no plan, no credibility and no honour”.“We have told her that the British strategy of running down the clock and playing a game of chicken with Ireland and Irish interests is profoundly unacceptable and wrong,” she said.“We have told her that the days of Britain dictating to Ireland or Irish people, that those days are over and will not .“We have told her that the backstop is the bottom line, the bare minimum requirements to meet Irish interests, to protect the Good Friday Agreement, to prevent a hardening of the border, to in some way mitigate citizens’ rights.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  “We have told her that pandering again to the DUP is wrong on every level and we have reminded her that the DUP do not represent the views of the people of the north of island, or indeed the island as a whole.”Last week, MPs backed an amendment that advocated the negotiation of “alternative arrangements” to replace the backstop.On Tuesday, on the first day of her two-day visit to Belfast, Mrs May suggested she would be seeking to change the backstop – perhaps with the insertion of a time limit – rather than ditching it completely.SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said Mrs May needed to understand there was no alternative to the backstop.SDLP Leader @columeastwood made it very clear to the PM that Northern Ireland must stay in the Single Market and Customs Union to avoid a hard border. pic NWzRteOF— SDLPFebruary , “Last week’s vote – the Brady amendment – was a betrayal of everything that was said before that, of the people of Northern Ireland and of all the political progress that we have made,” he said.“It just doesn’t add up. The last time Theresa May was here she was expounding the values of the backstop and now we are in a situation where apparently the alternatives to the backstop are being explored.“We made it very clear that there are no alternatives to the backstop.“The bottom line is this – for the people of Northern Ireland, for our peace process, for all of our political progress, we need to remain within the customs union and single market in order to avoid a hard border.“I think that will begin to be understood at all levels in the British Parliament because they don’t have an alternative. They talk about vague alternatives but there aren’t any alternatives.”The meetings at Stormont came amid the ongoing powersharing crisis at Stormont.The region has been without a properly ing devolved government for two years.Senior civil servants are running public services, with the Westminster Government reluctant to introduce direct rule.UUP leader Robin Swann, who is also opposed to the terms of the backstop, said Mrs May must impose Westminster rulethere is a Brexit no deal.Prime Minister must stand up and defend the constitutional and economic integrity of the United Kingdom - SwannThe Ulster Unionist Party Leader, Robin Swann MLA, has called on the Prime Minister to deliver on her... https:t.co sUlEZr— Robin Swann MLAFebruary , “She has to put direct rule in place come  March because Northern Ireland needs political leadership and it needs political direction,” he said.Mr Swann claimed Mrs May appeared reluctant to talk about efforts to restore powersharing.“The conversation we were having with the Prime Minister was initially about Brexit, we had to drag her to a place where we actually started to talk about how we get these institutions back up and running,” he said.Alliance Party leader Naomi Long expressed her impatience at what she termed a lack of progress in the two years since the UK voted to leave the European Union..@donaldtusk didnt show contempt for voters but for the reckless politicians who sold Brexit without any plan to deliver it. Its they who show contempt for the electorate with dark money, lies on the side of buses, barely concealed xenophobia  lack of any substantive answers. https:t.co zprpdbhiUT— Naomi Long MLAFebruary , “It’s very clear from our perspective that the time for reiterating red lines and regurgitating reassurances has long gone,” she said.“What we need now, and the only lines we are interested in, are black and white on paper, an actual deal.“That is the only thing that is actually going to reassure the public, it is the only thing that is going to reassure business, and it is the only thing that is going to reassure those of us in politics who are concerned about what is going to happen next.“This is not about political philosophy, this is about people who live in Donegal and work in Derry, this is about people who live in Newry and work in Dundalk. “This is about people being able to do their jobs, it’s about workforce planning in our health service, in our schools, it’s about all of those things. It’s not about philosophical debates in Parliament.”"},{"url":null,"title":"pm must introduce direct rule in northern ireland if no brexit deal agreed uup","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsSix NationsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

If she is not prepared to do that, and we are at a situation where the executive and the Assembly isn’t up and running again, she has to put something in place.“She has to put direct rule in place come March  because Northern Ireland needs political leadership and it needs political direction.“So by March ,we are coming out with no deal with no executive, we need direct rule for Northern Ireland. The manufacturing industry needs direction, our agri-food industry needs direction, we need some sort of political leadership in Northern Ireland.“If the place behind me isn’t fit to deliver that, then it has to be direct rule ministers.”Alliance leader Naomi Long said the subject of devolution in Northern Ireland was touched on during her meeting with Mrs May.She said she would like to see Secretary of State Karen Bradley working to restore devolution.“We made it very clear that while it was lovely to see the Secretary of State today with the Prime Minister, we would like to see her more frequently here dealing with the chaos in this building which has added to the dficulties we have had around Brexit and certainly isn’t helping how people view politics as a problem-solving mechanism outside this building,” Mrs Long said."},{"url":null,"title":"psni officers to receive 2","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsSix NationsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

However, the proposal was dismissed by the Government \"as it does not work for the unique circumstances of the Northern Ireland border\".given consideration among Government officials but dismissed as there would have been a need for a hardening of the border with infrastructure.The EU and Taoiseach Leo Varadkar have previously stated there are no technological solutions currently available.The leaked document - described as a Drive Through Border Concept - proposed monitoring of vehicles using articial intelligence-driven analysis from a wide array of information - including social media posts.Read MoreNorthern Ireland business leaders seek clarity on Brexit border issueSuzanne Breen: Mays meaningless Brexit mantra big on sentiment but short on detailEd Curran: Still time to save island of Ireland from utter madness of no-deal Brexit Brendan Duddy Jnr: Northern Ireland should stay in the backstop for the time being... but hold a referendum every five years to give it democratic legitimacy A tracking system would also monitor vehicles on \"designated routes\" using satellite technology as well as number plate recognition.The plan also proposed:Tarfs could be paid online by registered users,Police would monitor every goods vehicle that crosses the border to clamp down on smuggling,Inspection depots away from the border which suspicious drivers ordered to re-route to.The system could have been trailed before the departure Brexit day on March  with  hauliers testing it.The report states the Governments working group on finding alternative arrangements has also been briefed on a possible solution in Africa aimed a stopping bandits and hijackers operating on the borders of Kenya, Rwanda and Uganda.MLA Stephen Farry added: \"If this is for real, those behind it have no understanding of the complexities of the Irish border and the impact of this level of surveillance.

However, councillors subsequently switched attention to the former St. Maryrsquos Girlsrsquo Primary School campus at Shanslieve Drive.Despite a number of protracted attempts to secure the site and hopes that a deal could be agreed, it was bought by supermarket giant Lidl.While widely regarded as one of Northern Irelandrsquos premier tourist resorts, Newcastle does not have a modern indoor leisure facility and while there are some politicians who would like a swimming pool as part of any new development in the resort, this seems unlikely given there are local authority pools in Downpatrick, Kilkeel and Newry.It was previously suggested that the sale of the Annesley Buildings would free up the site for a new hotel and, signicantly, generate funds to help provide new leisure provision in the resort. But that now looks unlikely.As part of the drive to signicantly enhance leisure provision in the resort, council officials are continuing to work alongside education officials to develop a major new sports hub.Shimna Integrated College is planning to redevelop its King Street site which would include the creation of additional sports facilities at nearby Donard Park.It has been suggested that the proposed sports facilities could potentially be developed by the Department of Education in partnership with Newry, Mourne and Down Council with pitches and a sports pavilion forming the new sports hub which could also used by the community.While discussions are ongoing, the local authority still has to address the issue of no meaningful indoor sports facility in the resort to cater for both residents and visitors and is turning its attention to the Annesley Buildings site.Senior council officials have admitted that their initial thoughts about using the location for a town centre hotel have changed, confirming they are working to make a final decision on the way forward. It is also being suggested that the most likely outcome is developing a new leisure-cum-community facility at the Central Promenade site.A feasibility study on the redevelopment of the town centre site for a new hotel was completed several years ago which suggested a two or three-storey extension extension would be acceptable.The new hotel was viewed as a key ingredient in the plan to deliver highly ambitious proposals outlined in the Mournes Gateway proposals aimed at shaping future tourist provision in Newcastle.Other proposals include a gondola ride into the heart of the Mournes and a visitor centre at the site of the old quarry at Thomasrsquo Mountain.It has emerged that work on the high profile tourism project is progressing with moves to establish a board to deliver its ious elements, with membership including representatives from the local council, Tourism NI, Forest Service, Mourne Heritage Trust and National Trust.Over the next month, work is scheduled to start on tendering for consultancy and architectural services, alongside the recruitment of environmental and traffic management services.

Scrum half Conor Gibson was on hand to move the ball quickly to Hutley, who put Luka Walsh in space for the first score of the game.Omagh bounced back well, again using the wind effectively, and their pressure gave way to a penalty which they successfully struck to close the gap.As they continued to apply pressure, the home side had a chance to take the lead on the  minute mark, but their kick drted to the right hand side of the posts.With  minutes left in the half, Down High extended their lead. Having forced Omagh deep into their own half, Luka Walsh capitalised on Omaghrsquos decision to play out from their own quarters when he intercepted the ball to score his second of the day. Hutley slotted over the conversion. Down carried a - lead into half-time.With the strong wind now on their tails and a reasonable points buffer, Down High controlled the game well. Omagh continued to apply plenty of pressure, but the Down defence was hungry and with the exception of a few indiscretions they soaked up the Omagh onslaughts.With  minutes left the game took a critical turn when Hutley slotted agoal to take the Down lead to -.As would be expected from the men from the west, they didnrsquot lie down, but they were forced to chase the game.

However, the book kept me from thinking dark thoughts. Soon, all I wanted was to hold a copy of the book in my hand.Maureenrsquos dream came true in the autumn of  when her haunting story was finally published.Maureen, who is the mother of five grown-up children, explained some of the background as to why she put pen to paper.She added: ldquoI was initially setting out to piece together my family tree and the computer screen flashed up information on my great aunt Brigid. I was so fascinated with what I read that I could see the story unfold in a book and in turn I felt the plot would work well on screen too.Research took Maureen to the Presentation Convent in Co Kildare, which Brigid entered at the age of .Maureen said: ldquoI met with such a warm and friendly welcome from the community of sisters, that it gave me the desire to pursue Brigidrsquos story further. I travelled to Australia shortly after and I received the same, warm and friendly welcome from the sisters of the Presentation of the Blessed Virgin Mary in Wagga Wagga.On herMaureen set about sting through a mountain of information and carefully crafted the remarkable story of her great aunt. The book was published in July  and was officially launched a few months later to a rapturous reception in Murphyrsquos Bar in Downpatrick.A chance meeting which her web designer, Michael McLaughlin, had had a year later led to a further development.She said: ldquoMichael was working on a display in Eclipse Cinema in Downpatrick for another movie when he struck up a random conversation with Colin McIvor.ldquoAs they chatted Michael mentioned that he had recently read a book written by a Downpatrick woman which he thought might make a great movie.ldquoWithin days Colin, with the backing of Northern Ireland Screen, was in my house and we were signing contracts on a movie deal. That was in July last year and since then the whole thing has snowballed.ldquoIt has been a pleasure putting the whole thing together. I wrote it like a novel which makes it easy for the reader to follow the story. My story is entirely based on fact.As Maureen describes the plot her face lights up. She believes her great aunt would be delighted at her revealing the long-lost tale to a new generation.ldquoBrigid had trained as a teacher and in  there was a great demand for priests and nuns with skilled trades in Australia and so she was shipped off to the mother house in Wagga Wagga.ldquoBrigid proved herself capable and popular with the children she taught for six years. But a bad day in front of a teaching inspector led the convent demoting her to refectory duties.ldquoTwo weeks turned into two years of hard labour that took their toll physically and mentally on poor Brigid. Requests toto her former duties were denied and feeling she had no real means of complaint, it left Brigid desperate.ldquoOne day she wandered outside the convent walls. Tears welled up in her eyes as she called at a strangerrsquos home. Her afternoon of tea and warm company by the fire ended all too soon and Brigid was sent back to the convent, seen by a doctor and put to bed, Maureen added.The story really begins in earnest at this crossroads in Brigidrsquos le. Drawing on every ounce of courage she had, Brigid leapt from her bed that night and made a hasty escape barefoot in her nightgown on a foggy winterrsquos night in .This night set the scene for a religious storm unprecedented in Australiarsquos history. Brigid found refuge in the home of Protestants who refuse to disclose her whereabouts to the Catholic authorities.A bishop swore before a magistrate that Brigid was insane and a warrant was issued for her arrest. She was hunted down like an outlaw and the local media attention created a level of sectarian tension rarely unseen in that part of the world.Later, when there was no apology from the bishop for the arrest and slur on her character, Brigid turned to the courts for redress. But taking on the bishop meant taking on the Catholic Church.Maureen had a challenging time presenting Brigidrsquos story.She said: ldquoIt was a scandal at the time but I had to be careful to write it from both sides and let people judge for themselves. Itrsquos all I can do.Maureen says she is looking forward to the filmrsquos premiere.She added: ldquoIt will be the culmination of not just my five years of writing and telling the story, but all the hard work and effort that my family have put into supporting and helping me and, of course, the efforts of the film company, the director and the actors.Colin spoke of his enthusiasm over Maureenrsquos forthcoming film.ldquoI am thoroughly delighted to have optioned such an amazingly powerful book and to have met the inspirational Maureen and her family through the process, he said.He is currently adapting the book into a screenplay. ldquoI believe the film will offer a fantastic role for a strong female lead and supporting cast, he said. ldquoTo be able to bring this beautully written, dramatic and deserved piece to the silver screen some day would be just fantastic.Log on to Maureenrsquos website toon the forthcoming movie premiere at www.theextraordinarycaseofsisterliguori..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C January 30%2C 1979  ","story":"DOWNPATRICK mdash A Strangford man had a narrow escape from death when he turned up for work on Monday morning at the new Abbey Lodge Hotel, outside Downpatrick.A muffled explosion during the night had ripped apart a section of the hotel mdash which was due to open in three weeksrsquo time mdash but no alarm was raised and workmen were unaware of the danger when they reported for work.One of the men, Mr Francis Black, from Strangford, passed through the lounge and noticed a black bag and two yellow tins.

He put it down and it was discovered later that the contents were competence for a lethal fire-type bomb.By then Mr Blackrsquos colleagues had discovered the damage caused by another bomb and a warning was raised. Police and firemen rushed to the scene and the main Downpatrick-Crossgar Road, beside the hotel, was sealed off as army bomb disposal experts raced from Lisburn.An army officer successfully defused the second bomb and workmen moved in to assess the damage, which was confined that bedroom section of the hotel.The hotel owner, Mr William Polly, said: ldquoDoors, windows, the gable and the roof have all been damaged and this includes a total of eight bedrooms.

These premises will be our new premises with dedicated areas for Lowden acoustic guitars and new electric guitar ranges, said George.ldquoWe are currently planning out the logistics of our move from Down Business Park. This will require attention to detail and be orchestrated stage by stage to minimise any disruption to our ability to complete and ship our guitars to waiting customers.Lowden Guitars successfully managed to keep news that it was working with Sheeran mdash one of the worldrsquos biggest music artist, who has sold  million albums and has had more than  billion streams mdash under wraps for considerable time.

But a starting price for a Lowden was three grand. When yoursquore , three grand may as well be a million pounds.ldquoThe dream of any kid who likes music is to have a guitar and the dream of any musician is to have a signature guitar.George realised that he needed to make a range that was something special and revealed that he sought inspiration from the North Coast.ldquoEvery guitar that I design and make I have to feel afterwards proud of it, I have to feel that I have achieved something with it. That itrsquos not just a normal guitar, he explained.ldquoThe main aim was to design and make a guitar here at an affordable price noticeably better than anything  at that price range. So I went up to the North Coast and spent a week at the Giants Causeway walking and thinking and drawing. Then having designed it, of course I sent it off to Ed and the rest is history.Sheeran has previously bemoaned that fewer youngsters seem to be interested in guitar-playing these days.ldquoThere are fewer guitar bands and fewer artists using guitars now, and not as many kids picking up guitars, he added.ldquoThat is something I would like to change by getting these great quality guitars, made in Ireland, into kidsrsquo hands and encouraging them to learn and progress.The Sheeran by Lowden acoustic guitar range features eight inidual models across two small body sizes familiar from the Lowden range, known as the S and the Wee Lowden.The guitars have been designed for uncompromising tone and playability and are made using sustainably-sourced wood including naturally fallen trees and reclaimed spruce.George says that the new range combines years of hand-crafting and traditional luthier methods with new construction technology.ldquoItrsquos taking everything I have learnt over the last  years, cherry-picking from that a few traditional methods of working by hand and introducing those into a whole series of new groundbreaking procedures for guitar making so that the end result is a guitar made in Ireland but one which really sings and which I hope inspires many young musicians and older ones as well, he added.The first orders should be shipped in March.

But there was disappointment for anyone hoping that with just over  days to go until Brexit day the prime minister was going to set out a clear pathway to securing a deal with the EU.Instead, with the point of departure from the EU within touching distance, Mrs May told the invited audience that she is now “working on a solution” to how Brexit will impact on the Irish border that will “command broader support across the community in Northern Ireland”.It was an attempt to be all things to all men which will have fuelled the fears of those who believe that she is out of ideas and cynically running down the clock in the hope that the looming reality of no deal prompts MPs to suddenly swing behind her deal.It took a question at the end of the speech to reveal something of what is really going on within government at this point. Asked by UTV’s political editor Ken Reid to explain how she could expect nationalists in Northern Ireland to accept a deal which does not include a backstop, the prime minister made clear that – contrary to what some Brexiteers had hoped – there will definitely be a backstop in any deal.She said: “Well, I’m not proposing to persuade people to accept a deal that doesn’t include that insurance policy for the future.”That will concern some Brexiteers and some of the DUP who want to see the backstop removed in its entirety. Just two months ago, DUP leader Arlene Foster told Mrs May that she wanted to see her “bin the backstop”.But even that revelation from Mrs May was ambiguous. ‘A backstop’ couldmean almost anything and it is the specics of that arrangement which will be signicant.However, there is hope for Mrs May – at least from the DUP. When pressed yesterday, Mrs Foster refused to say that she is still demanding the removal of the backstop.It now seems that the DUP is prepared to accept a time-limited backstop, or perhaps some other mechanism. The real test of that will be the reaction of Brussels – and Dublin.Sinn Fein dodges questions over who paid for its Venezuelan tripPrime minister repeats her pledges to Northern Ireland but gives no clarity on Brexit Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"try catch  TrendingIN PICTURES:  things you should never EVER say or do to someone from Northern IrelandHas PSNI officer Bobby Singleton become an unwitting sex symbol Ian Ogle daughter: UVF gang that murdered Dad are still planning to kill my brotherVIDEO: Police investigation into fight at Belfast International Airport, AldergroveIN PICTURES: the funeral of Ian Ogle          ..

One of his historical advisors, Lord Bew, a very respected figure in the House of Lords, he said one of the most remarkable things was the British government had not challenged this Irish narrative on the Belfast Good Friday Agreement in recent years and I’m wondering what you think about that.Prime Minister Theresa May at Allstate in Belfast, where she spoke about her Brexit plans and took questions from the media. Photo: Liam McBurney PA Wire“He is concerned, like Lord Trimble, that Britain would be signing away the right, the possibility of there one day there being regulatory and customs ergence on the island of Ireland.Are you going to keep open that possibility for Britain ” Mrs May replied: “What I’ve made clear and you’ve heard me repeat in my speech, is the commitment that we made in the December joint report, December  joint report, to ensure Ireland’s place in the — the integral place that NI has within the internal market of the United Kingdom. We have already set forth, set out within Westminster, ways in which we believe as a UK government we would deliver on that.“I recognise the concerns that have been expressed about regulatory dferences but as I say, we were absolutely clear in that December joint report, and we retain our absolute commitment to that, to ensure Northern Ireland’s integral place in the UK’s internal market.”Ken Reid of UTV asked:“Fty six per cent of people in Northern Ireland voted to remain, it has wide support in the business community here as well. How are you going to persuade particularly nationalist politicians, the nationalist parties, to accept a deal that doesn’t contain a backstop ”Mrs May replied: “Well I’m not proposing to persuade people to accept a deal that doesn’t contain that insurance policy for the future.

He decided to put together a calendar of his work together to help raise money for the Alzheimers Society, as his father died from the disease in .The -year-old was encouraged to put together the calendar after posting some of his pictures in a local Facebook group.He said: \"I was surprised by the positive response and all the encouraging comments my first set of photos received, said Phil, ldquoWhen I posted another set of photos people started suggesting putting them together in a book or a calendar.\"Mr Lewis said the idea stuck and he asked the group to vote for their favourite photos which would be included in the calendar, before working with local graphic designer Ceri Legg who designed the layout and Beacon Printers, who printed the calendars.Around  calendars were printed altogether which were on sale in shops throughout the town, but have now fully sold out.ldquoI was really worried at first as the number  was suggested to me by the printers, and as soon as I picked them up I start feeling anxious about how exactly I was going to sell  calendars,\" said Mr Lewis.\"I thought that  would have been a more realistic number. I was completely taken aback by the huge response.\"I had people contacting me from all over the world ndash Australia, Spain, Texas, askingI would post calendars to them.

We can now offer our customers a streamlined product supply chain package by integrating their co-packing requirements with the grouprsquos warehouse and transport subsidiary companies.ldquoLogistically, this works out to be more cost effective overall, but also lowers the carbon footprint on the transportation of food products, which is something we are passionate about.Wild Water Group has a current annual turnover of poundm and Mr Rattenbury believes the company can increase that figure by a further poundm within  months and then reach poundm within two to three years.The project is backed by a pound. million investment from Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking and the Development Bank of Wales and has secured Welsh Government funding under the new economic contract.Using a similar business model to the grouprsquos other three sites in Merthyr Tydfil, Llanishen and Cardf Bay, the first phase of development will be the conversion of available space into a large ambient open plan co-packing facility, which will be operational early November  to meet festive season demand.During the first quarter of , Wild Water Group will move the entire Cardf Bay co-packing facility to Aberbargoed, once freezer facilities, production lines and machinery are in place.The company will then continue services such as frozen to frozen storage, bagging, over wrapping, sleeving and tray sealing, as well as the full spectrum of print labelling applications required under the Food Safety Technicalspecications.Economy Secretary Ken Skates said: ldquoThis project will not only see a successful, growing Welsh business create an additional  jobs, it will also create a new strategic hub and facility for both large and small food and drink businesses across the region to pack or store products themselves. This could, in turn, open up new markets for those businesses ndash so Irsquom excited about what this means not only for Wild Water Group and Aberbargoed, but for the region more widely.ldquoIt shows that both our Economic and Food and Drink Action plans are delivering what we had hoped ndash jobs, prosperity and sustainable growth. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It was made with willow grown in the grounds of Cogan Primary School.More than  people attended the hill rolling ceremony down Clf Hill towards Penarth Esplanade - with the school pupils from Cogan and pupils and families from Ysgol Pen Y Garth helping to roll it along.The head was accompanied by a wooden frame from the Mabinogion stories called the Window of Sorrows made by Tony Simms, and the artist Ifor Davies undertook the ritual sawing of the Window of Sorrows on the clftops and read the Bendigeidfran story from the Mabinogion tales before the rolling went ahead.The head of Bendigeidfran and the Window of Sorrows was accompanied by Penarths Mari Lwyd which is a symbol of hosting, and negotiating hospitality through song and teasing. Richard Parry led the Mari Lwyd this year, and on arriving at the bottom of the hill the celebration visited local shops and resaurants along the sea front wishing the proprietors and customers a Happy New Year. We sang for Romeo Italian restaurant, The Fig Tree, James Sommerin, The Crazy Cafe and Hamptons seaside shop. After reaching the bottom of the hill the head was carried by the children along with the Mari Lwyd to the shops and cafes along the seafront where dferent New Year songs - called Calenig - were sung in each venue and led by local opera singer Richard Parry.Speaking about the event, artist Haf Weighton said: \"I loved working with Cogan School. Itrsquos a hidden gem in Penarth with very enthusiastic staff who were happy to jump in to get involved in this project at short notice. Richard Parry and the schools deputy head Tom Lewis, ran a assembly to the whole school on the new year traditions. Then children from across the school came to see me working on the piece. \"It was lovely to hear children who donrsquot come from homes where Welsh is spoken enthusing about the mabinogi tales and Welsh traditions. Children from Pen y Garth joined in after the head was created. They helped us roll it down the hill from the clf tops.\"Richard Parry, who helped to organise the event and led the Mari Lwyd, said: \"It was great to see so many people come together to celebrate Hen Galan in Penarth. The giant Bendegeidfran got his name because he was the Blessed Bran - the best friend anyone could ever want - and in the stories of the Mabinogion he was loved by those who knew him. He is a symbol of friendship and celebrating together. \"The community celebration on the clftops was thoroughly enjoyed by children and adults alike, and even though its a bit chilly it was wonderful to see so many people out of doors, celebrating, singing and enjoying wishing everyone we met Blwyddyn Newydd Dda and Happy New Year.\"The head will now go on display at a iety of places, including Pen y Garth School, Cogan Primary School, Penarth Library and The Hearth Gallery Llandough Hospital. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We tell client’s stories through engaging content written by former journalists – grab their customers’ attention with stunning design, maximise conversions by using the latest digital marketing expertise, and develop websites which are living, breathing, online stores or shop windows. As content director, my role is to bring almost  years’ experience in journalism, political communications, corporate PR, crisis management and digital content crafting to Grofuse. How did the business start and how has it grown The business was created by a fusion of expertise to achieve sales growth, including experienced digital marketers, PR consultants, web developers, software developers, graphic designers, illustrators and motion designers. I co-founded the company with expert digital marketer Denis Finnegan who has spent  years fuelling online lead generation for businesses. Growth has been swt over the last  months. We’ve employed an effective combination of marketing efforts and created fans of our existing clients.What is your background I’m a seasoned hack, having worked in print journalism for almost  years followed by a few years as a political communications adviser. I spent a brief period teaching English and history at secondary level before entering a newsroom. The working environments were poles apart in terms pace, excitement and... language choices. As a school pupil and university student, I worked on building sites, supermarkets, farms, bars, bread delivery vans, a bakery and even a bacon factory kill-line. However, I had never encountered such flurries of expletives as I did in newsrooms. Great places to work. High pressure, tight deadlines and great target-setting – a superb way to fuel productivity in any work environment.What do you do dferently from your competition and what are your strengths Clear communication with our clients is our greatest strength. We listen intently to what our clients’ goals are, take time to learn about their products and gain full understanding of their ideal customers.

Do you have a target in mind in terms of where you want the business to grow We are currently focusing the bulk of our efforts on the island of Ireland with a particular focus on Dublin and Belfast. What challenges have you faced The somewhat ‘snake-oil industry’ reputation of digital marketing sometimes poses a barrier to speaking with decision makers who in the past have invested with little . However, once we’re given an opportunity, we like to let the results do the talking. Who most inspires you Those who thrive in the face of adversity and have strong growth mind-sets. The type of person with the right measure of accountability, skill and relentlessness to inspire their teams to achieve targets. It’s a mind-set akin to that of a top athlete whose body is screaming ‘slow down’ in the business end of a race but whose mind interprets that as a cue to go faster. My we Martina – a former operations manager with Lidl Ireland who co-founded and runs leading human resources consultancy, HR Team – has these qualities in abundance. She inspires me in everything I do.Where do you see yourself in the next few years I love living and working in the North West. Whatever people like to call Derry or Londonderry, it’s a very special place with a lot of talent and a big future in driving the cross-border regional economy. With our headquarters at Catalyst Inc and plans underway for satellite offices in Dublin and the UK, we want to ensure our agency plays a part in shaping that economic prosperity with the provision of more high-quality jobs for the area.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/js_1.jpg","title":"uncertainty interconnectors and the future of ni energy post brexit","story":"Posted on Wednesday February  by Ulster Business With a potential ‘no deal’ around the corner on Brexit, what will that mean for the future of Northern Ireland’s energy policy – especially on renewables, the I-SEM all-island market and power generation  John Simpson takes a closer look On the last working day before Christmas , the System Operator for Northern Irelandpublished draft proposals of how the electricity systems and grids on this island may operate in -. Subject to confirmation by the all-island Single Electricity Market Committee, the auction for electricity generators to be awarded capacity contracts, on an all-island basis, has identied electricity capacityof , MW which will be in place for the year starting October ,  – , MW of that all-island total is attributed to Northern Ireland.This is a critical series of draft decisions which will reassure the large conventional generators about their contracts and will impose the discipline of revenue limits constrained by the capacity auction. The draft decisions also point to the expectations in terms of the capacity earmarked from renewable sources, from inter-connection with the Scottish grid and the capacity adjustments that may follow from demand-side adjustment contracts.SONI has not been as open and transparent as should have been possible. Readers must make the assumption that ties location to where capacity payments are identied in sterling and euro.The SONI statement lists  generator names ,  of which are identied as DSUswhich leaves  others. Eight are shown as part of the AES capacity in Ballylumford and Kilroot: four are small capacity generators, six each have capacity of over MW , and the last capacity source linked to Northern Ireland is the Moyle Interconnector.SONI does not present the capacity awards in a way that allows readers to identy the location of each successful unit.The Utility Regulator has agreed that the available Northern Ireland capacity should include  MW from the Moyle Interconnector which represents over % of locally available capacity. This is a judgement that might be queried. Is the interconnectora guaranteed source of capacity  If, at a time of peak demand in Northern Ireland, demand in the grid in GB had no spare capacity, presumably the capacity might not be available for supply to Northern Ireland. The regulator and SONI are well placed to judge the probability of this outcome and might argue that it is a minimal risk.There are some interesting features stemming from the assumptions made in setting the framework for the capacity auction. First, Northern Ireland has been treated as meriting some contract iations because of locational constraints. This is a reflection of the limited capacity of the electricity grid on the whole island to send electricity to the places where there is demand. Both the Dublin area and Northern Irelanddid not attract auction bids adequately to supply these area locational constraints. For Northern Ireland. the easy explanation lies in the absence of the long awaited north-south grid expansion from to the planned distribution hub in Co Tyrone.The capacity auction allowed for the acceptance of bids with prices which are higher than the main auction prices which would match supply and demand across the whole island. Because of the locational deficit, some Northern Ireland bids now show capacity payment prices above the all-Ireland ceiling of £, per MW which applies to most of the successful bids.In the quotation from AES for the two large fossil fuel burning units, the proposal is that they should attract payment prices of £, and £, per MW. At first sight this appears to allow a premium of nearly % on the payment price for each MW. This seems more than a marginal cost and points to the possible cost savingsthe proposed new north-south link had been operational.This answer for the older high capacity units at Kilroot is a further reflection of the doubt about the continued viability of these units. It will be remembered that a year ago, these same two units were deemed unsuccessful in the auction but, at a late stage when faced with a request for a derogation to be allowed to close these units, the initially agreed settlement was revised.A year ago, the first capacity auction under the rules of the newly instituted I-SEM, was accepted with a capacity supply of near to , MW for all of Northern Ireland. Now, in early , SONI has concluded that for security of supply Northern Ireland should contract for just under , MW. There is no obvious major uplt in demand in Northern Ireland so that, quietly, the suggestion is that the arithmetic in late  may now be thought to have been slightly too risky.The capacity auction is a fundamental building block of electricity supply policy for Northern Ireland. However, on its own, the allocation of capacity and the possible scope for investment in new generating capacity must also be seen in the context of increasing,market forces allow, the proportion of electricity supply that is supplied from renewable sources. The distribution of generating capacity is still dominated by fossil fuels. Northern Ireland’s capacity is nearly % from gas andcoal. However, the statistics showing the proportion of electricity supply from renewables points to average consumption from renewables of nearer to -%. Because of the iability in the contribution of wind based renewables, it would be hazardousgreater security dependence was allocated to renewables.In turn, the caveat about the possible role of renewables points to the possible value of further investment in energy storage for which no major scheme has been launched. If Kilroot power station survives for a further three to four years, then the experimental electricity storage capacity on that site may become an attractive asset.There are several continuing questions about Northern Ireland’s security of electricity supply. Will Kilroot be given further stays of execution after   Will the North South interconnector eventually be built  Will the proposed large natural gas burning power station be built in Belfast  Will the politically unpopular investment in anaerobic digestion plants be tackled  Will the Brexit settlement, or lack of it, damage the continued operation of the all-island single electricity market  But... it seems Kilroot has been given a temporary extension of its role in keeping the lights on.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
