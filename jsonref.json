Some of the show was great – notably, Olivia Colman’s gloriously ebullient Best Actress speech, Rami Malek’s equally endearing response to winning Best Actor          I loved Spike Lee behaving in the same lunatic way he does at New York Knicks gamesBut what it didn’t do was make me laugh.Instead, it dripped with insufferable identity politics, Trump-bashing, and a series of box ticking awards that smacked of Hollywood trying to make itself look as worthy and virtuous as possible.‘I can’t believe a film about menstruation won an Oscar’ wept director Rayka Zehtabchi for her (powerful) film Period. End of Sentence.Really?I’d have been more shocked if it hadn’t.After all, the main winners last night were a film about a gay immigrant rock star, a film about a black superhero with an almost entirely black cast, a film about racial injustice in segregated U.S. South in the 1960s, a film about a black detective who goes undercover with the Ku Klux Klan – and Roma, a beautifully made but almost unwatchably dull, depressing and painfully slow black-and-white film about a Mexican maid, in Spanish with subtitles.I’m not disputing the inidual merits of any of the winners, but it’s hard not to avoid the conclusion that Hollywood – whose Academy voters are predominantly old white guys – is now doing everything in its power to avoid more of the‘White Oscars’ backlashes of recent years.Even the red carpet morphed into a ‘woke’ farce as Pose star Billy Porter turned up in a tuxedo-skirt, presumably to make himself the new poster person for gender fluidity.‘OMG! He’s magnificent!’ screamed Twitter.          The red carpet morphed into a ‘woke’ farce as Pose star Billy Porter turned up in a tuxedo-skirt, presumably to make himself the new poster person for gender fluidity.‘OMG! He’s ridiculous!’ I screamed back.In the end, the only real amusement came from watching people I’d never heard of, and frankly was quite happy never to have heard of, making fools of themselves on stage during the seemingly endless tedious production categories.The hapless trio from Vice who won the make-up and hair award made collectively the worst speech in Oscars history - a bumbling, stumbling, jabbering, linguistic fiasco that became the perfect evidential argument for sliding these kind of awards into commercial breaks, as was intended this year until a massive furore from ‘the industry’ forced the producers to do a U-turn.But at least they were riveting, for all the wrong reasons.When Green Book won Best Screenplay, one of the writers (and the movie’s director) Peter Farrelly pulled out a sheet of paper and began dementedly reciting the names of what seemed like every single human being he’d ever met.I counted at least 40 people on his turgid list of mainly nonentities.          When Green Book won Best Screenplay, one of the writers (and the movie’s director) Peter Farrelly pulled out a sheet of paper and began dementedly reciting names Important to him, I’m sure – but utterly irrelevant to the billion people watching around the world.Oh for a trap door that could have sucked him down into the bowels of the Kodak Theatre and spared us this orgy of self-indulgence.And what about the ridiculous woman who made Free Solo, the extraordinary documentary about climber Alex Honnold? She barely mentioned the guy who actually risked his life for her bloody film, even as he stood three feet away from her on stage!          Documentary maker Chai Vasarhelyi (in gray) barely mentioned the guy who actually risked his life for her bloody film, even as he stood three feet away from her! ( second from right)But for me, the single most depressing moment came with presenting duo Awkwafina and John Mulaney, who were unfunny, boring and unctuously sycophantic.‘I want these people to like me to a degree that is embarrassing,’ gushed Mulaney, and you could see he really meant it.‘Wait, why are we still here?’ exclaimed Awkwafina, as they remained on stage to introduce a second award.  The single most depressing moment came with  Awkwafina and John Mulaney, who were unfunny, boring and unctuously sycophantic. Why wasn’t Ricky Gervais there to rip into people instead of these fawning clowns?I asked myself the exact same question, with this supplementary: Why wasn’t Ricky Gervais there to rip into people instead of these fawning clowns?Yet today, I’ve read many people raving about them and saying they were so ‘hilarious’ they should host the whole show next year.To which I say: Hayi! Hayi!

Four or five months into IS, I wanted to leave.’Suleman added: ‘I take responsibility. I was with IS, I was with a terrorist organisation. But I didn’t kill anyone, I hope I didn’t oppress anyone. I did have a Kalashnikov and a military uniform, but I didn’t hit anyone, I didn’t oppress anyone. I was in the office.’ "},{"url":null,"title":"Univision says team held Venezuela interviewing president","story":"Univision said on Monday that a news team led by its anchor Jorge Ramos (right, before being detained) was detained at the presidential palace in Caracas, Venezuela, while interviewing President Nicolas Maduro (right)            \u0027They were interviewing @NicolasMaduro but he didn\u0027t like the questions.

May is expected to ask them to endorse her plan to renegotiate the backstop.It is not a new \u0027meaningful vote\u0027 to approve or reject the Brexit deal. Backbench MPs are likely to put forward amendments containing alternative plans - but whatever happens, the stage is set for another showdown on March 12.This is the third time since the \u0027meaningful vote\u0027 on January 15 MPs have voted on Brexit. May promised the votes would happen as a concession to rebels while she negotiated to stop them taking no deal off the table.  What amendments might there be? Formal amendments have not yet been tabled but they are expected to include:  Labour\u0027s Yvette Cooper and Tory Oliver Letwin want to change the law to order the PM to delay Brexit if there is no deal in place by March 13. This would mean suspending the normal rules of the Commons to allow backbench MPs to introduce legislation.Tories Simon Hart and Andrew have a similar amendment that makes a statement the PM should delay Brexit if there is no deal by March 13. There may be a second referendum amendment. Labour has said it will back one as an alternative to no deal or the Tory deal.Tory Alberto Costa is separately pushing an amendment seeking more guarantees for EU citizens in Britain in the event of no deal.Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn will table his usual amendment setting out Labour promises for a Brexit based on a permanent customs union with the EU. It will fail.SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford will table an amendment - usually one complaining about Brexit.

She has tried once before on January 15 and lost by 230 votes.The PM has promised this will happen no later than March 12. If she wins then, she has said Brexit should happen on time and the Government will scramble to get the necessary laws in place. What happens if May loses the second vote? May has told MPs they will then have to choose between delaying Brexit for further negotiations or leaving the EU without a deal if the reject the deal by March 12.On March 13, there will be a vote for MPs to say yes or no to no deal.If they say no, on March 14 MPs will be asked to say yes or no to delaying Brexit.If the House also votes no to delay, backbench MPs - backed by Jeremy Corbyn and most Labour MPs - will probably try to push for a second referendum.  Why do people say there needs to be a second referendum?Theresa May\u0027s Brexit deal has no majority in Parliament - and it is not clear any other deal has a majority either, even if one could be negotiated.Passing the question back to voters is seen by some as a way to end the impasse and give a clear instruction to politicians on what to do.Some campaigners also say the 2016 referendum was not an informed choice because too many of the implications of Leave were unknown.   Britain\u0027s view on whether it should Leave or Remain in the EU is little changed in the more than three years since the referendum. Pictured are the dozens of polls since June 23, 2016  What do critics think?Many people - led by the Prime Minister herself - say a new vote on Brexit would betray the people who voted Leave in 2016. They insist there was a clear order from the public to Leave the EU and politicians must follow it, working out the details for themselves.Unionists also complain that accepting a new referendum on Brexit would pave the way for another referendum on Scottish independence, threatening the future of the UK. Some politicians also feel it would simply reopen the wounds from the 2016 battle without really deciding anything more clearly.  What needs to happen for a referendum to happen?Parliament would need to pass a new law for a referendum to be held. This process alone would take weeks and would likely be very controversial.Before that can even happen, for political reasons there would probably have to be some kind of moment creating a \u0027mandate\u0027 for a new referendum as it is something neither of the main parties promised at the last election.This might be a simple vote of MPs after Mrs May\u0027s deal has been rejected. The Government could call such a vote at any time. Labour also has some opportunities to call a vote - though winning such a vote would have less power.It could even be a whole general election where one or more sides puts a new referendum in their manifesto. What would the question and be who decides? Nobody knows for sure - and this is probably the hardest question of all.Some say it should be a simple repeat of last time, with Leave or Remain on the ballot paper. Others say it should be Remain versus Mrs May\u0027s Brexit deal.Others advocate a two stage referendum - between Remain and Leave, followed by Mrs May\u0027s deal versus No Deal if Leave wins. Still others say there could be multiple questions on the ballot paper, possible using a ranking system known as alternative vote.The Electoral Commission would make a recommendation and MPs would make the final decision on what the question would be.       "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2019/02/26/14/4FFB1CC300000578-6746889-image-m-17_1551190198108.jpg","title":"Cricket ace Alastair Cook gets knighthood Queen","story":"Cook (pictured left being presented with honour from the Queen today, and right)  became the first England cricketer to be knighted since all-rounder Ian Botham in 2007          Father of three Sir Alastair, 34, (pictured after scoring a century against India last year) retired from international cricket in the summer and ended his career with 12,472 Test runs and 33 Test centuries - both England recordsThe league\u0027s CEO since 1999, he stepped down from the role at the end of last year.Cook became the first England cricketer to be knighted since all-rounder Ian Botham in 2007.He joins an exclusive club of former England cricketers to hold the title, including Jack Hobbs, Len Hutton and Colin Cowdrey.He was also awarded an MBE in 2011 and a CBE five years later.Cook, speaking after the investiture ceremony, said: \u0027Seeing my name up there in whatever capacity - you just don\u0027t get used to it.

The UK’s trade deficit in goods and services exceeded £10bn in the fourth quarter of 2018, a level reached only in four previous quarters in our economic history. Finally, the negative trend in investment looks set to continue, according to surveys of business opinion.In the second half of 2016, after the Brexit referendum result, resilient consumer spending supported the economy before the slowdown which followed. We may be seeing the same thing now. The forward-looking indicators – productivity, trade performance, investment and job announcements – point to a further weakening in the UK economy.Professor of economics at Dartmouth College in the US and member of the MPC from 2006 to 2009Gertjan Vlieghe, a current MPC member, has argued that Brexit is already costing the UK £800m a week, more than double the £350m a week savings that leavers had wrongly suggested Brexit would bring. Oops.It is unclear how much of this slowing is down to Brexit. But what is clear is that Britain leaving the EU couldn’t have come at a worse time, as the very long global recovery since the financial crisis is now coming to an end.Trade wars haven’t helped and neither have rate rises in the US. Italy is already in recession and Germany is close, with zero growth in the last quarter, and negative growth in the prior quarter. There is also a growing prospect that the US will be in recession within a year. Markets are increasingly pricing in the next rate decision by the Federal Reserve to be a cut. Industrial production figures in Europe have been disastrous, with 17 out of 27 countries recording negative growth in December.I was especially struck by the declines in UK consumer confidence. In the latest release for the UK for January, there were big drops in consumers’ reports of their financial situation over the past 12 months and their expectations on what will happen to them over next 12 months. There has also been a marked pick-up in unemployment expectations over the next year.That brings us on to the labour market, which is a lagging indicator, and has started to show some signs of slowing.

Similarly, it’s astonishing that it’s only now, after 150 senior managers have enjoyed their collective £500m windfall, that Persimmon wants all its lower-paid toilers to earn the full living wage.Jenkinson will have to rub along on a £515,000 salary this year with no bonus or incentive top-up. The usual adornments will have to wait until 2020 and, presumably, will be re-cast in merely conventionally greedy form next time. He’ll survive.So, of course, will Persimmon. If the new corporate do-gooding mantra feels a little windy (look, we’re even sponsoring Team GB for the Tokyo Olympics!), try the half-baked mutterings coming from government.James Brokenshire, the housing minister, is said to be “increasingly concerned” by Persimmon and the company’s approach will be “a point of discussion” as help-to-buy contracts are reviewed. Whatever that means, it’s several bricks short of an actual policy, let alone a description of the grounds on which Persimmon could be singled out for punishment.Brokenshire should concentrate on the shortcomings of help-to-buy itself. There may have been an argument for stimulating demand for new houses circa 2013, but not now. There is ample evidence that help-to-buy homes are sold at premium, with the excess providing the rocket fuel for housebuilders’ profits margins. It’s time to unwind the market distortions – and safe to do so. Even if Persimmon’s return of capital were to halve, it would still has a strong financial incentive to keep building. Just call the whole thing off."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b299f5500800a68b7ed3ed79cc80ddb816037139/0_233_4287_2577/master/4287.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=07441c79be5382b245b01eea71707f52","title":"m s ocado food delivery service marks spencer waitrose","story":"Joint venture with Marks \u0026amp Spencer could spell end for Ocado’s deal with WaitroseMarks \u0026amp Spencer has confirmed that is in talks with Ocado over the launch of a food delivery service that signals the latter’s long-running partnership with Waitrose could be coming to an end.On Tuesday the companies issued identical statements confirming that they were in discussions “regarding a joint venture in UK retail”. News of the potential alliance leaked in January but at that time neither company would comment on the reports.The Evening Standard report said there was a question over how M\u0026ampS would fund the deal, which would value Ocado’s retail arm at up to £1.8bn, with speculation it would need to do a cash call to investors.Ocado has worked with Waitrose for the past 20 years but the current supply deal between the companies ends in September 2020. Ocado and M\u0026ampS are thought to be trying to strike a deal before Friday, which is the deadline for Ocado to trigger an 18-month break clause with Waitrose.Although Ocado already works with Morrisons, the terms of the Waitrose contract would not permit Ocado to work with M\u0026ampS on the same basis, Ocado boss Tim Steiner confirmed to reporters earlier this month.After nearly a decade as an unloved listed company, Ocado has more recently been billed as the “Microsoft of retail” after striking several technology deals with foreign retail chains including US grocer Kroger. Selling a stake in the UK retail arm, which comprises four automated warehouses, would free up Steiner to focus on winning the licensing deals that have stoked the share price gains that have propelled its market value to £6.8bn.However, Ocado suffered a setback three weeks ago when a huge fire – on the same day as the company’s annual results – destroyed its warehouse in Andover, Hampshire. Andover had been an example of an online food delivery model that relied on robots rather than human labour. After the fire investors took fright, with more than £1bn wiped off the stock market value of the firm. However the share price has been staging a recovery and is now close to pre-fire levels of about £10.M\u0026ampS started experimenting with online food delivery in 2017, but has been reluctant to pour money into it at a time when sales in its clothing and food departments are falling. M\u0026ampS’s food halls sell just 7,000 products, compared with 40,000 at most Tesco shops, so it is not regarded as a destination for the weekly shop. With a focus on exclusive own-brand products and only a limited number of household brands available in stores, in the event of a deal Ocado would have to help M\u0026ampS fill in the substantial gaps in its ranges.M\u0026ampS declined to give details beyond its statement, which said: “Marks \u0026amp Spencer confirms that it is in discussions with Ocado regarding a joint venture in UK retail. There is no certainty that these discussions will result in any agreement or as to the timing of any such agreement.”Bernstein analyst Bruno Monteyne said: “We think the deal makes lots of strategic sense for both M\u0026ampS and Ocado, therefore we would expect that some kind of deal at some point will develop.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f9852c1ed98c5fb417808606f8d36ba5998dfbf8/0_0_1280_768/master/1280.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7ed1661b216ef1fe07dd31fc2c64dca0","title":"no deal brexit vauxhall says it wont shy away from the dark side","story":"Chief executive issues warning of ‘unpopular decisions’ including factory closuresThe chief executive of Vauxhall owner PSA Group said the carmaker would not shy away from unpopular decisions, including shutting factories, if there is a no-deal Brexit.However, Tavares also said that the Vauxhall brand’s appeal to Britons could provide the company protection not available to European rivals in the UK’s large car market.Tavares, speaking at the company’s Paris headquarters on Tuesday, said the company would try to ersify its sales to make it less reliant on the European market, where it expects flat sales this year even if there is an orderly Brexit. PSA will relaunch Peugeot in North America after almost 30 years, as well as launching Citroën in India.PSA’s Opel–Vauxhall business reported its first annual profits in 20 years after a major cost-cutting plan following its £1.9bn purchase from US carmaker General Motors in 2017. During General Motors’ ownership the company made $19bn in accumulated losses, but Opel-Vauxhall made a profit of €859m in 2018.Opel-Vauxhall runs two factories in the UK, at Luton in Bedfordshire, and Ellesmere Port in Cheshire, which together employ about 2,300 people. While the Luton plant will start production of the new Vivaro van this year, a future investment decision for Ellesmere Port is expected to come after the UK’s trading relationship with the EU after Brexit is decided.At the start of 2018 unions had feared that Ellesmere Port would close as Tavares, known for cost cutting at Renault before joining PSA, made hundreds of job cuts at Opel-Vauxhall.Tavares gave no indication that PSA has reached a decision on what part British plants would play in future production, including the UK in the possible contenders for production of new Opel-Vauxhall models.However, he also gave a stark warning that British factories could close if trade becomes less favourable with the EU after Brexit.“We can go on the dark side, say, well, perhaps you have to shut down plants and things like that. Well, if we have to make unpopular decisions we will,” he said.“But on the other side let’s not forget that we have the Vauxhall brand. The Vauxhall brand is warm to the hearts of UK consumers and we may have also the opposite opportunity, to be the survivor of the automotive industry in the UK.”Tavares’s comments come at a pivotal moment for the British car industry, following the decisions of Nissan to revoke a decision to make its X-Trail SUV in Sunderland and of fellow Japanese carmaker Honda’s plan to end production in Swindon in 2021, at a cost of at least 7,000 jobs. Jaguar Land Rover and Ford have also announced thousands of job cuts this year."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d926cfcc07dab3fe4670e811b9358ecda002799e/592_584_5168_3101/master/5168.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=38e76dbc75524acb06a54450a040f2b1","title":"selfridges to stop selling exotic animal skins","story":"Leather from agricultural stock will still be sold at department store that went fur-free in 2005Selfridges has announced it is to stop selling exotic skins from animals such as pythons, alligators, crocodiles and lizards.The department store will only sell leather from agricultural livestock including cow or calf, sheep, pig, goat, water buffalo and lamb from February 2020 after the exotic skins are phased out.It banned the sale of fur in 2005, saying it prided itself on being a “responsible retailer and a trusted curator of brands”.Claire Bass, the executive director of the Humane Society International, said the decision would save the lives of countless crocodiles and snakes.She said: “When Selfridges went fur-free more than a decade ago, it positioned itself as a retailer at the forefront of compassionate fashion. “Banning exotic skins in recognition of the serious animal welfare issues that exist in this industry is a natural next step for a responsible retailer.”Selfridges’s buying director, Sebastian Manes, said: “We will continue in our ambition to inspire our brands and customers through thoughtful, ethical and transparent buying strategies.”It comes after the commitment the retailer made in 2016 to ensure half of its products were “better for people and planet” by 2022 which has seen the removal of single-use plastic water and carbonated drink bottles from sale.Carrier bags made from upcycled coffee cups were introduced in Selfridges in 2017, while all garment bags have been made with used plastic bottles since the beginning of this year.In December, Chanel became the first luxury fashion house in the world to stop using exotic animal skins.

Because shale producers pump more oil when prices rise, it acts as a “shock-absorber” to prevent inflation getting out of control as in the 1970.On trade, Powell warns that “uncertainty is the enemy of business.” The Fed has been hearing for months that the uncertainty over America’s trade links (due to the dispute with China) has had some impact on confidence.And on US financial stability, he says America’s banks are strong - with no bank failures in 2018.Jay Powell has also taken the opportunity to tell Congress that America has too much economic inequality, and too much debt too. He’s challenging Senators to do more to help their citizens, saying:Productivity growth, which is what drives rising real wages and living standards over the longer term, has been too low. Likewise, in contrast to 25 years ago, labor force participation among prime-age men and women is now lower in the United States than in most other advanced economies.Other longer-run trends, such as relatively stagnant incomes for many families and a lack of upward economic mobility among people with lower incomes, also remain important challenges.And it is widely agreed that federal government debt is on an unsustainable path. As a nation, addressing these pressing issues could contribute greatly to the longer-run health and vitality of the U.S. economy.Fed chair Jerome Powell also cites Brexit as a key source of uncertainty that could threaten financial markets.He tells the Senate banking committee that the mood in the world economy has darkened:Financial markets became more volatile toward year-end, and financial conditions are now less supportive of growth than they were earlier last year. Growth has slowed in some major foreign economies, particularly China and Europe.And uncertainty is elevated around several unresolved government policy issues, including Brexit and ongoing trade negotiations. We will carefully monitor these issues as they evolve.Newsflash: America’s top central banker, Jerome Powell, is starting to give his bi-annual testimony to the US Senate.And the top line is that Powell is reiterating that the Federal Reserve won’t rush to raise US interest rates.Echoing the message from the Fed’s last meeting, a month ago, Powell says:In January, with inflation pressures muted, the FOMC determined that the cumulative effects of these developments, along with ongoing government policy uncertainty, warranted taking a patient approach with regard to future policy changes.Going forward, our policy decisions will continue to be data dependent and will take into account new information as economic conditions and the outlook evolve.Powell also says that the US jobs market remains ‘strong’, with low-skilled workers getting the highest wage growth recently.Brexit has already cast a cloud over UK investors, who are now the gloomiest in Europe, according to new research from UBS Global Wealth Management.UBS has found that City investors are much more anxious than those in rival financial centres like Frankfurt or Paris, even though the eurozone economy has weakened in recent quarters.Nick Tucker, Head of UK Domestic at UBS Wealth Management, explains:“As we get closer to the UK’s official departure from the EU at the end of March, this survey shows that political turbulence is dragging on investor sentiment in the UK compared to the rest of the region. UK investors seem to have dramatically lowered expectations for 2019 in almost every sense, from expected financial returns to their outlook for the economy.” “From our conversations with clients up and down the country, we know that investors are anxious.Here are the main findings from the report:Danielle Haralambous of the Economist Intelligence Unit suspects that today’s offer is just another attempt by the PM to get her deal over the line:The boss of Vauxhall’s parent company, PSA, has warned that a no-deal Brexit could lead to ‘unpopular’ decisions, such as job cuts and factory closures.Carlos Tavares warned this morning:“We can go on the dark side, say, well, perhaps you have to shut down plants and things like that. Well, if we have to make unpopular decisions we will.”Tavares also warned that a disorderly Brexit would disrupt supply chains at Vauxhall, which employs hundreds of people in Luton, and at Ellesmere Port in the North West.“Moves to avert no deal in March are essential. There are now proposals from Parliament and Government. But they are just one step.To avoid a hammer blow to firms and livelihoods, delay cannot simply be an extension of stalemate. Compromise is the only way.”Claire Walker, co-executive director at the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC), has warned business leaders to keep preparing for all Brexit possibilities:“The overriding priority is still to assure businesses and communities that an unwanted ‘no deal’ scenario will not happen by default on March 29th.“Businesses still need to ensure they are preparing for all possible scenarios and government and its agencies must provide clear, precise and accurate information for all eventualities.”Edwin Morgan, interim Director General of the Institute of Directors, has welcomed Theresa May’s commitment to let MPs vote on extending Article 50.Morgan also warned that most UK firms simply aren’t ready for a no-deal Brexit (not least if they need a pallet to ship goods to Europe!).“Seeing the impasse continue may not be comfortable for businesses, but a disorderly exit could bring unbearable disruption for firms in sectors from farming to finance, manufacturing to business services, across the UK. It is a long time since we have been in a world of easy choices, and while an extension is not an end in itself, it may become a necessity to achieve an orderly exit.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/63b60e421bbd15ef1a7f5b3668575e95070d4e3b/1_0_2559_1536/master/2559.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8875984dff6ca11367d373390eab81d2","title":"hard brexit united ireland second referendum dup","story":"The year is 2025 and the prime minister, David Lammy, has just phoned the Sinn Féin leader, Mary Lou McDonald, to congratulate her on victory in Ireland’s unification referendum. The deputy prime minister, Nicola Sturgeon, tweets that she hopes Scotland will follow suit in the referendum she secured at the last election for taking the Scottish National party into coalition with Labour. Gerry Adams gives the dedication as a statue of Jacob Rees-Mogg is unveiled in Crossmaglen. The Tory leader, Amber Rudd, refuses to publicly blame her predecessor Boris Johnson for the breakup of the union but, like the rest of what’s left of the country, she knows the truth.As anyone involved in the Good Friday agreement will tell you, principles guarantee no deal. It’s why the current Brexit negotiations between the UK and itself are going so well. Theresa May has red lines, the European Research Group (ERG) has absolute red lines, the Democratic Unionist party (DUP) has blood-red lines, and Jeremy Corbyn has blurred lines featuring Pharrell. If they all hold firm, we’re heading for a hard Brexit. And a united Ireland.We were always going to end up here because Brexit has never been about Nissan X-Trails or the shape of your bananas. It’s only ever been about sovereignty. For the gammons and bowler hats on the team, the final destination has always been the top of the white cliffs of Dover dressed as Dad’s Army, straddling Dysons.Northern Ireland has always been about sovereignty for a different reason – almost half of its population see themselves as Irish. How very rude. Yet as Brexiteers preach about their precious union, Irish nationalists in the same country are meant to park the union they want and just work out how the chicken crosses the border.Last week I was back in my home village of Dundrum, County Down. It lies in a constituency that in the past has elected both Éamon de Valera and Enoch Powell, but when talk in the pub turned to Brexit, the same truths were repeated again and again: nothing good can come of this for Northern Ireland. And: we knew this would happen.Most people in Northern Ireland voted to remain in the EU because there have only ever been two options post-Brexit – customs checks at the Irish border or in the Irish Sea. Each would cause isions just as we were bridging the gaps (in spite of our politicians). Depressingly, there’s no way through this.As the prime minister Maybots her way through the charade of alternative arrangements, there’s only one thing you need to know – there are no workable alternative arrangements. If there were, you’d have heard of them by now. The details of this technological masterpiece would already be a double-page spread in the Daily Mail with Rees-Mogg mocked up as Alan Turing under the headline “Enigma cracks Enigma – spirit of Bletchley takes back control”. If an alternative arrangement that worked actually existed (or was likely to exist in the next couple of years) Brexiteers would have already accepted the backstop, knowing they could easily replace it with their idea during the transition. The fact that they won’t bet on themselves tells you all you need to know about what they have in the locker.Yet none of that matters when you’ve inoculated yourself against reality. It’s why the ERG continues to cup its balls and cough while looking at a picture of Winston Churchill. “Did you feel that, too? We need a clean break.” Meanwhile, Corbyn complains the clock is being run down, but knows his last hope of a general election is when time’s up. To those outside the Labour party he’s become the José Mourinho of Brexit, sticking to a system that has lost half the dressing room while a people’s vote remains benched like Paul Pogba for daring to be more popular than the manager.All of this could have been avoided if the majority in Northern Ireland had been listened to during the referendum campaign. But as Nigel Farage and Johnson trumpeted their migrant-free magic kingdom, we were Kevin in Home Alone – only remembered at the baggage carousel after the plane had landed. It’s why the minutes of the first meeting between Michel Barnier and David Davis will never be released. “So, what do you propose for your land border with Europe?” Polite laughter. “We have a land border with you guys?”The housing minister Kit Malthouse brokered talks between Brexiters and former remainers on a possible way out of the Brexit impasse.The resulting \u0027Malthouse compromise\u0027 involves redrafting the backstop arrangement for the Irish border which is so unpopular with Conservative Eurosceptic MPs and the Democratic Unionist party, which props up the government.It would also extend the transition period, set out under the previously negotiated withdrawal agreement, until the end of 2021. The extension is designed to give extra time to agree a new trading relationship.Under the plan, the backstop would be replaced with a free trade agreement with as yet unknown technology to avoid customs checks on the Irish border.If the attempt to renegotiate the backstop fails, the Malthouse compromise proposes what amounts to a managed no deal.The PM would ask the EU to honour the extended transition period, in return for agreeing the £39bn orce bill and its commitments on EU citizens’ rights. This would give both sides time to prepare for departure on WTO terms at the end of 2021 – or to negotiate a different deal.The compromise is backed by the DUP, the European Research Group of hard Brexiters, and former remainers including Nicky Morgan. It is this unlikely coalition that helped secure Commons backing for the Brady amendment, which pledged to replace the backstop with unspecified \u0027alternative arrangements\u0027.Before MPs voted for that amendment and against others, Theresa May praised the Malthouse compromise. She said these were \u0027serious proposals\u0027 and she would engage with them \u0027seriously and positively\u0027.When Conservatives say they care about Northern Ireland, they actually just mean the freehold. Like a stable block with planning permission, they know the extra square footage adds value but they’ve no intention of actually developing it. Just as long as they can see it from the big house, they’re happy. As for those who live in the stable? If Brexit has proved anything, it’s that many Tories don’t give a stuff about the people of Northern Ireland – not even the unionists. If they did, they wouldn’t dream of a hard Brexit because it only guarantees one thing – a border poll.That’s one that will be decided not by Sinn Féin or DUP votes, but by the moderates in the middle – nationalists who once felt Irish enough post-Good Friday agreement and those pro-European unionists applying for Irish passports. The inevitable economic downturn and border circus of a hard Brexit might just be enough to swing those floating voters and Northern Ireland out of the union. So, why would any member of the Conservative and Unionist party take that risk? Because no matter what they say in public, they’ve never honestly believed Belfast is just like Finchley.All notions of a border poll could easily have been damped if, post-Brexit referendum, the DUP had accepted that Northern Ireland was a special case. Like they insisted it was when they asked George Osborne to drop Northern Ireland’s corporation tax to mirror the Republic back in 2014. Or how same-sex marriage and abortion laws are different to the rest of the UK thanks to a veto by the DUP in the Northern Ireland assembly (apparently, it’s also in a confidence and supply arrangement with the Lord Jesus). But that was never on the cards because, for the DUP, Brexit is about proving they’re biologically British, not adopted. It means the party will always order what Johnson and Farage are having but, unlike them, actually eat it.Of course, special status for Northern Ireland would mean some form of “dreaded backstop” (pause, pearl clutch, continue), but when a country has more than 300 land border crossings and only five main ports to the mainland, where would you rather try to do the “dreaded paperwork”? And, let’s face it, any customs check that can take place in the middle of the Irish Sea while a lorry driver hoovers a fry-up on the ferry then has a snooze in his bunk has to be a good thing. Cue sash-shaking Brexiteer rage. “Don’t you understand Northern Ireland would then become a rule-taker not a rule-maker?!” Because apparently, it’s all about rule-making – as the Stormont assembly, where rules should actually be made for Northern Ireland, remains in mothballs since 2016 because the DUP backed out of a deal with Sinn Féin to restore power sharing. So we’ve reached the fatberg in the sewer of principle. We’re told that the DUP has the government over a pork barrel and unless the backstop goes, it will bring the house down. But as time runs out, it’s actually the Tories who have the political wing of the Old Testament surrounded.On the one side is May’s deal (complete with backstop). On the other is the ERG and a hard Brexit. If the DUP buckles on the backstop, party members will walk away with their UK sovereignty between their legs. For those of us who have their early albums, this isn’t going to happen.Which leaves just one option. The DUP holds firm and jumps off the cliff with the ERG, knowing a hard Brexit is the only scenario that guarantees a hard border in Ireland, a border poll in Northern Ireland and the perfect economic storm where it could lose that vote. By trying to be the most British person in the room, the DUP could actually end up the most Irish.Whisper it quietly, but the best outcome for the DUP is actually a people’s vote. They’ll scream red, white and blue murder if it happens but privately breathe a sigh of relief. Like Boris Johnson, they never wanted Brexit but wanted to be seen to support it. A second referendum offers an escape from their worst nightmare, while allowing them to reluctantly go along with “the will of the entire country”. Very unionist.For Northern Ireland as a whole, another EU referendum is also the only way out of this mess. Not to save face. But to save peace, prosperity and a shared future. It’s wrong that Northern Ireland should take one for the team so that others can have their version of Brexit. It’s now time to act, or Northern Ireland might decide the team is no longer worth playing for.• Patrick Kielty is a Northern Ireland-born comedian and TV presenter.

Here are my favourite momentsA photo of the group’s first outing was tweeted last night by Chuka Umunna. As so often with politicians trying to appeal to the people, it was a food-based photo opportunity:The first observation here is that Umunna’s sentence structure is off. “TheIndGroup meal out before votes tonight at Nando’s!” reads as though the vote is taking place at Nando’s, and the gang have just gone out for a quick bite beforehand. I am assuming this was not the case.Huge props go to Heidi Allen, who is absolutely not waiting for this photo opportunity to be over to dig in. And to Angela Smith, who is reaching for her glass of wine like someone who knows this snap is going on Twitter whether she likes it or not, and better not be tagged. Mike Gapes looks thrilled, because Mike Gapes never not looks thrilled (more on this later).But let us turn to Anna Soubry. Now, I’m never going to forgive Soubry for her record on welfare votes – it just isn’t happening – but her interventions on Brexit have been admirable indeed. She’s also dealt superbly with the bunch of knuckleheads, inspired by gilet jaunes, who see themselves as brave guards of a long-ago empire, but actually just look like marshals at a cross-country race in the local park:Soubry has done a great job of ignoring them, and also of wearing a Russian style ushanka with a Arsène Wenger-esque long padded jacket and the most baller boots politics has ever seen. Aside from maybe in junta-run countries. To wit:But back at Nando’s, Soubry has let the side down. She appears to have ordered a salad. At Nando’s. (Although she is already stealth-reaching for a chip.)But more egregiously, she has bottled still water. Nobody but a sociopath orders bottled still water at a restaurant that isn’t in a country where the water is dodgy. The Nando’s trip was not the first key picture of the gang together. The original launch shots were pretty dull, aside from Ann Coffey who came dressed for success in an orange suit like the early morning sun. A new dawn has broken, has it not?When “the three amigos” – as Soubry, Sarah Wollaston and Allen refer to themselves – and Labour’s Smith joined the group, we were treated to some excellent pics with a girls night out vibe. Everyone out to All Bar One, then to the chippy where Allen as a northerner gets ripped for ordering chips and gravy, and then back to Soubs’ and a last bottle of Jacobs Creek and a singalong to Independent Women by Destiny’s Child:Then there was the main sublime photoshoot so far. I’m afraid the most widely shared picture was the one below, and once I envisioned the group as Borrowers people in an empty baked beans tin, I couldn’t see anything else:There were plenty more snaps from this shoot to enjoy, with Soubry featuring heavily. Including this one of her about to drop a freestyle verse with support from her hype women:And this one, which is very “all-girls school group of friends at a wedding”, with Soubry about to catch the bouquet:Here we have Gavin Shuker looking like an absolute PLAYER. Don’t hate him cos you ain’t him:Then we have Soubry (again) leading a tour on Pugin’s gothic architecture, which the rest saw on Groupon, pointing out some intricate roof detail:But it was the Tiggers’ first foray on to the green benches of the Commons that was most enjoyable. The shot had the look of a school assembly scene:Chris Leslie is the boy who is forcibly separated from his mate and then catches his eye minutes later. Luciana Berger has spotted her crush from biology. Soubry is LOLing at her mate who is getting told off by the teacher for talking – despite the fact Soubry was also talking.

Smith, meanwhile, is all of us, WhatsApping plans to meet at break.Umunna already seems jostling for future leadership of the Independent Group (it has said it will elect one at the end of the year) but the main Tigger is Mike Gapes, because he is permanently energised, smiling and beaming. He has the demeanour of a guy who wins millions on the lottery, but tells his local paper he will continue his job as a gardener, because that is what brings him true happiness. Look at him:Finally, there was this exquisite moment last night on Newsnight, in which Labour and Corbyn loyalist Barry Gardiner placed a hand on Umunna’s wrist and – how best to put this? – it was met with … revulsion? Disgust? The type of repugnance when one takes a swig of sour milk? (As an extra bonus, there is Emily Maitlis wildly pointing a pencil at the two, and, at this point, which of us is above threatening all of our politicians with an HB?)There’ll be many more press appearances, social media content and pics to come from the Independent Group. And possibly more MPs joining them, depending what happens on Wednesday’s day of Brexit amendment votes. But for now, it’s bye from me and bye from Mike Gapes!

The first is the belief that you can game the system from a desk in Westminster to get the outcome you want. When significant numbers of voters want to leave without a deal at all, a “choice” between May’s deal or remain is not democratic. MPs rightly want to avoid no deal, but to pretend we can settle “the will of the people” when a major, popular option is simply left off the ballot paper treats people as if they are stupid. They aren’t. Why aren’t we learning?The second problem is the message this decision sends to the wider Labour party. Apparently, you can have more impact on Labour policy by leaving the party than by staying in it. For a political party that seeks to govern effectively that is just not sustainable. Above all, none of these elite power-plays deal with the reality already upon us. In towns across Britain, the ongoing uncertainty is already costing jobs. There has been no effort to build consensus for a referendum in parliament, let alone the public. As a short-term tactic it may help the party through a difficult week, but look through a longer lens and the future looks much more fraught than it did a week ago, for us and more importantly for the country.• Lisa Nandy is Labour MP for WiganOver the past three years, thousands of jobs have been lost, hate crimes have rocketed, and real problems such as the housing crisis and NHS underfunding have been neglected while the British political class has been paralysed by Brexit. Labour’s decision to finally listen to its members, young people and what is now a majority of the country could be the first step to putting this sorry saga in British history to an end.A people’s vote is now inevitable, as well as essential. As it stands, just 31 days before Brexit day and after three years of argument, we are close to a form of Brexit that parliament can accept. Theresa May’s deal remains deeply unpopular among MPs, and there is broad consensus against the economic catastrophe of crashing out of the EU without a deal, with government ministers prepared to resign imminently if a no-deal Brexit is not taken off the table.The reason consensus has not been reached is that no form of Brexit can live up to the fantasy Nigel Farage and Boris Johnson sold to voters in 2016. The only way to break the logjam and get a clear mandate in favour of a real Brexit deal, or indeed to remain in the EU, is to put the question to the people.Labour now has an opportunity to become the champion of hope and inclusion by proudly and unashamedly becoming pro-European again. After years of lies and false promises, we can be the party that tells the truth. We can offer to fix the inequalities that created the dissatisfaction that caused the result in 2016. We can stand up for workers’ interests, not patronise them by scapegoating Brussels. We can argue that free movement is an opportunity, not an imposition.Just as we have now started to bring the party together again after years of ision, we can do the same for Britain. We can come together again.• David Lammy is Labour MP for TottenhamCall me old-fashioned, but as a democratic socialist I believe politics is about principles. The “democratic” part matters. You make election promises. You keep them. After 22 years in parliament, I thought that was how democracy worked. Straightforward, honest politics.Labour’s first 2017 general election leaflet stated: “Theresa May wants to make this election a re-run of the EU referendum. But the decision to leave has already been settled by the British people.” Labour’s manifesto Brexit chapter was called “Negotiating Brexit” not “Stopping Brexit”. It began: “Labour accepts the referendum result and a Labour government will put the national interest first.”Remainers and leavers alike voted for a Labour manifesto which stated: “‘No deal’ is the worst possible deal for Britain.” At conference, Jeremy Corbyn offered to discuss a reasonable deal. Not “the perfect deal”, not only “a Labour deal”, a reasonable deal.Encouraged by Labour MPs, union leaders and Jeremy met the PM more than once. Why bother if compromise was impossible? If you never intended to reach an agreement?Labour’s conference motion promised to “support all options remaining on the table”. Why opt for a second referendum when an improved deal is still within reach? Not a “botched deal”, but a deal worth pursuing.Safeguarding workers’ rights resolving the Northern Ireland border securing a transition period guaranteeing EU citizens’ rights and giving certainty to businesses. This is what is on the table. A second referendum offers only more delay and a nation ided once more.Ditching our election pledge means spurning every Labour leave voter. Our working-class bedrock. Four out of five Tory-Labour marginals, Labour’s 25 most vulnerable constituencies and Peterborough and Newport West – at least one of which faces a byelection – are all leave-voting seats. Do we ignore them, or honour our election promises?

But not all agreeThousands of pupils walked out of their classrooms on the Friday before half-term to protest against the lack of action on climate change. Though many headteachers privately support the strike, the issue has ided the school community. In a letter to the , more than 200 academics backed the students’ stand, but the two headteacher unions said it was disruptive for schools and raised safeguarding issues. So should pupils have time off to protest?professor of education, Cambridge University“Yes, definitely. I’d like to think that had I still been teaching in a school, I would have taken a stand and gone on strike in support. The older generation has really let young people down with short-termism and by prioritising self-interest, and I think young people in the UK lack opportunities for democratic engagement.“Most of those involved in the strike are too young to have a vote. Protesting is one of the very few ways in which they can take political action and be part of a participatory democracy. I encouraged my niece to go and she came back full of enthusiasm, and also much better informed about the state of the environment. Some people have argued that children are missing out on learning. Well, I think it’s a positive learning experience to come together collectively in a common cause.” executive headteacher, Harrogate grammar school, and president of the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL)“No. I don’t agree with pupils taking strike action as a protest against climate change. The cause is vital to humanity and I feel personal shame that my generation has allowed this crisis to happen on our watch. But a pupil strike is not the right approach. Each day’s learning is important for their life chances and their potential to go out and change the world. Schools are also in loco parentis and it is a concern if pupils are off site.“We had a small number of very able and principled students let us know they planned to take strike action. Colleagues met them and explained why this was difficult for the school to support as we would struggle with our duty to keep them safe. The head and deputy voiced their support for the cause and showed them what the school was doing to respond to the challenge of climate change. We are not aware of any students who were absent because of strike action.”​A-level student, Brighton, Hove and Sussex sixth-form college“Yes, we should be allowed time off. I think if you care passionately about something enough that it makes you want to go on strike, you should be able to.“I say that as someone who values my education, especially right now, with my A-level exams coming up. Missing a day of sixth form meant a lot to me – it was very costly for me to go when I am right in the middle of revising for my mocks – but I think it was important the strike took place during the school term. If it had not, it would not have been so impactful or controversial.“I have heard people arguing that young people went on strike to get out of school. Those people are not taking us seriously, they are not taking the issue of climate change seriously, and that attitude is part of the reason why we went on strike. When I read the statistics about global warming and what is going to happen in the future, I don’t think enough is being done by older people. If I can do something to make a difference, even if it’s just making everyone around me aware that I’m concerned, then I’m going to jump at that. If older people don’t want us to strike, they need to act.“My parents signed me out of college along with my younger brother, who is in secondary school, so they took responsibility for ‘safeguarding’ us that day. I know other young people whose parents didn’t want them going, and schools that didn’t allow it. And those young people felt silenced.” “I’d like to say yes, but I’m struggling. A school cannot authorise absence for this purpose. A parent can withdraw their child, but must be willing to accept the consequence of a fine. Headteachers rightly have safeguarding concerns for those who miss school yet whose whereabouts are unknown in uncoordinated events such as Friday’s marches. “However, I believe peaceful, powerful protest has a valuable place in a civilised, democratic society much good has historically come from it. Teenagers must be able to form, express and share their views. Adults need to listen to young people. They are voters of the future and dismissing or patronising their actions and views now may be something politicians later regret.”“Yes. The school community felt very strongly about the strike and I was happy to authorise the absences of those who wanted to take part. I sense a great deal of exasperation from children that political leaders of the world today seem to be unable or unwilling to take decisive and unilateral action on climate change. Instant gratification and myopic political point-scoring blindly trumps all.“As the head of a Quaker school that takes its responsibility towards the environment seriously, I believe it is incumbent upon us to support the children of today in making their voices heard. What is education about? If we do not have a planet to live on, then there is not a lot of point in learning about Pythagoras or Shakespeare. “Whatever the debate about climate change, there is clear and troubling scientific evidence, which cannot be ignored. Many children rightly have a sense of urgency and they absolutely should have a voice.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/49b87a4a7c08acf50111722f4959a765faf3c0c0/0_130_5100_3062/master/5100.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d6a261fee371654733811354d7a88037","title":"what is your experience of zero tolerance behaviour policies in schools","story":"We’d like to hear from teachers, parents and young people about their schools’ discipline policiesThis year has seen increasing criticism for zero tolerance behaviour policies used by schools – from putting children in isolation booths as punishment for breaking school rules, to excluding them for apparently minor indiscretions.This month the TES and Schools Week reported that a multi-academy trust had been using a strategy called “flattening the grass”, in which students were publicly humiliated in assemblies and made to cry in order to establish the MAT’s expectations of students’ behaviour when it takes over a new school.Whether you’re a teacher, parent or young person over the age of 16, we’d like to hear from you.What experience do you have of zero tolerance behaviour policies?

The lifeless humpback, which was about eight metres (26ft) long, was found in thick shrubs and brush.“We imagine it was floating and the tide took it into the mangrove,” Renata Emin, the president of Bicho D’Água, told local media. “The question is, what was a humpback whale doing in the month of February on the northern coast of Brazil? It’s unusual.”A group of biologists examined the carcass over the weekend to figure out how the whale died. The group is expecting a postmortem report within 10 days. “We are collecting information, identifying marks on the body, to determine if it was trapped in a net or hit by a boat,” Emin said.Conservationists from the Bicho d’Água Institute suggest the whale could have been separated from its mother before being forced ashore by high tides during a storm. Other researchers have speculated that the humpback may have swum towards the beach looking for food and suffocated after consuming large amounts of plastic.Peter Evans, the director of the Sea Watch Foundation, which monitors whales and dolphins off Britain’s coasts, said incidents like these were rare. He said humpback whales were often found in coastal waters and were known to migrate great distances. South American humpbacks breed around the equator and then migrate towards the Antarctic to feed.“This calf probably got separated from its mother, maybe its mother had died, in the southern summer, and then wandered about trying to find food. The idea that it was killed by ingesting plastic would need some evidence first to support it. It seems to me more likely that it simply starved to death. If they do a postmortem examination, we will have a clearer idea,” Evans said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c542a99dcc7a00cbe9e4fe68231406a9197ae509/0_140_2100_1260/master/2100.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1e3a5351d231d0462af55712c71f867a","title":"san francisco coyote lady urban wildlife on rise","story":"With the animal making a comeback in many US cities, enthusiasts such as San Francisco’s ‘coyote lady’ have become both educator and defenderSan Francisco’s resident Coyote Lady met her first coyote early one cool June morning on Twin Peaks, one of the city’s tallest hills.The coyote was a curious little thing, prancing here and there, dashing up the hill, and then down, all the while watching this strange creature and her dog. “She ran this way, she ran that way, she was so excited, like, ‘What’s going on? What are you doing?’” said Janet Kessler, 69.In other words, it was as if Kessler met herself that day in 2007. Describing her first magical encounter, Kessler jumped up from her table at a local cafe to show how that coyote danced and played. Skittering back and forth, she demonstrated that the coyote was more than just an animal, more than the predator feared by small-dog owners, more than just the vermin that so many in rural areas still consider these creatures to be.“She had a personality,” Kessler said. “She was interested. She was intelligent. She obviously had emotions. She was reaching beyond her species.”From that first meeting, Kessler was hooked, becoming part of a growing fascination over coyotes that has swept the United States over the past decade. This fascination – and the subsequent research borne from it – has centered in particular on coyotes that inhabit cities, as more and more coyotes appear to be making their homes in urban hubs across North America.Coyotes once considered many of these cities their native habitats, but were driven out throughout the 20th century. Within the last two decades, however, they quietly began making their way back. They’re trotting through the parks. They’re crossing streets. They’re hopping on the roof of bars.While there’s no official count (though some organizations have estimates for specific cities) coyotes have been spotted living in Chicago, Denver, Washington DC, and New York in addition to San Francisco, as well as in Madison, Wisconsin, and Portland, Oregon.And as coyotes become more visible, coyote enthusiasts nationwide have found themselves stepping into the role of both coyote defender and educator, fighting the very human instinct to shun what is unfamiliar and encouraging instead the concept of coexistence.“Seeing something that seems so wild, a really standard response is to say they have no place in an urban setting,” said Jaymi Heimbuch, director of the Urban Coyote Initiative. “But coyotes used to be here before San Francisco was ever built. Now they’re back, and they’re not going away. How do we deal with it? How do we minimize conflict?”In general, conflict is already minimal. Coyotes tend to keep to themselves and shy away from humans. They are known to sometimes exhibit defensive behavior around dogs – and sometimes prey on small unattended pets – but the average coyote is only 45lbs, said Mark Weckel, one of the co-founders of the Gotham Coyote Project in New York.“There’s always concern, but for the most part, coyotes don’t pose a threat to humans,” Weckel said. “Coyotes do so well in urban areas because they do so well in avoiding us.”The last reported negative coyote-human interaction in New York occurred in 1995, Weckel noted, before anyone realized that coyotes were making their way back into urban spaces. The best course of action should anyone come across a coyote in an urban setting is to just walk away.This push in coyote research comes almost out of necessity. Yes, researchers say, coyotes are apex predators that sometimes have a taste for small dogs – but they also mate for life. They form social relationships. They play and explore and make their homes in places no one expects them to be.Anthropomorphizing – projecting human traits to animals – is typically frowned upon in the scientific world. But when humans and animals live in such close proximity to one another, it’s hard not to make that connection.“One of the reasons why I love coyotes is that they are so much like us,” Heimbuch said. “We are just like, ‘Oh, this place looks good. Well, this is home now. Look no further.’ I think that’s awesome.”But at a certain point, there’s anthropomorphizing and then there’s just observation. In the 12 years that San Francisco’s Coyote Lady, Janet Kessler, has spent photographing, tracking, and writing about the city’s coyotes on her website, she has observed enough to know that coyotes live full lives, sometimes without anyone noticing.“It takes time,” Kessler said. “You can’t just go to a park and pick it up. Spend years in that park and you’ll find out who’s Dad, who’s Mom, the pups that are last year’s, the pups that are this year’s, who likes each other, who gets along, who is sort of shy and withdrawn and who doesn’t mind being seen. It all comes out.”Almost every day Kessler goes to a city park where the coyotes are known to frequent, usually once early in the morning and once just before dusk, with her waist-length hair pulled back low and her heavy gear strapped around her waist. On one recent afternoon, Kessler made her way onto a narrow path on a hill in a San Francisco park, navigating her lean frame over the uneven ground with ease. She let out a breath at the telltale sight of a dark brown pile. “Coyote scat,” she said with a smile. “We found their trail.”When asked how she knew it was coyote scat and not dog poop, she went into detail about the musty smell, the ropey look of the feces, the seeds, the fur. “You just know after a while,” she said.This was how Kessler knew the puffs of fur in another part of the park belonged to a dog, not a coyote. It was how she knew the little paw prints in the mud were not made by coyotes (“Coyotes have more elongated paws,” she explained, “and their two middle fingers point inward”).It was how, out of the farthest possible corner of her eye, nearly 400ft away, she spotted a coyote that she referred to as Big Red.‘“There! There!” she said, scrambling down a hillside. “Coyote, first coyote sighting!”Kessler kept one whole other bramble-filled slope between her and the rust-tinged animal before she began to snap her photos, but even from that distance, she could recognize him as one half of the breeding pair that frequented that area. She recognized him in the same way she can recognize all the other coyotes she has documented – by their faces, by their gaits, by their personalities. “I study them as iniduals because that’s what they are,” Kessler said.“Every coyote is different,” she said. “Every coyote has its own personality. I tell you, it’s not so different from watching humans.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e16890eac1e190dc400b803789810f8e3dddad9c/0_204_3798_2279/master/3798.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=474228170f2fa36df29de0a986b09571","title":"tell us what you are doing to reduce your greenhouse gas emissions","story":"We’d like to hear about the action you and yours have taken to reduce greenhouse gases It’s the crisis that we just can’t seem to tame: the ominous rise of global temperatures, aggravated by the burning of fossil fuels and the release of carbon dioxide and other so-called greenhouse gases.But not everyone is belching out emissions like there is no tomorrow.

I wanted to do something much more masculine,” the designer said. With success came a bigger budget and at last the opportunity to buy more expensive fabrics and textiles, he added.With this collection, his tailoring has moved beyond the traditional to incorporate oversized pockets, leather culottes and utilitarian waistcoats. Belted coats in leopard print, structured oversized knits and long asymmetrical dresses worn over palazzo trousers came with the easy, laissez-faire attitude that makes his clothes so wearable. “What I show is what I sell,” he said.There was also a lot of fun. One shirt and trouser combination in “the blue of David Hockney” was styled with earrings featuring a childhood photograph of Jacquemus, his brother and his mother in a swimming pool, which customers will be able to customise. Elsewhere, large padded bumbags punctuated polished looks.The set was inspired by his love of French cinema, taking on the form of a town square with florists, grocers and boulangeries. He may be eschewing the direct sartorial references to the romanticism of the riviera but he still knows how to work the aspirational lifestyle of the region to his advantage.Prints incorporated hand-drawn sketches of ceramic pots you might pick up in a Sunday morning flea market, while a cream trouser suit was adorned with appliqué tulips.Despite his age, Jacquemus has been around the block. After making his fashion week debut in October 2012, he was shortlisted for the prestigious LVMH prize, winning the special jury accolade the following year.However, he had been designing for years before that. A video recently surfaced of Jacquemus early in his career, dressing friends in his clothes and crashing a French Vogue consumer event in the French capital to present his designs to the then fashion editor, Emmanuelle Alt.It is this youthful confidence that permeates every aspect of his brand, and with this collection he shows he is not afraid to carve his own path rather than play to the Instagram crowd. Jacquemus revealed on Monday that the change of direction had been hard but he was happy with the results.Given that the French leg of the autumnwinter fashion weeks stretches for nine days, it is confirmation of his popularity and selling power that so many editors, buyers and other industry heavyweights arrived for day one to be present at his show.Jacquemus told Fantastic Man magazine last year that he had been approached by a global French fashion house, among many others, to become its head designer, but turned the offer down.“I don’t need the stamp of approval that comes from working for a big house … I have a big house: Jacquemus is my house and now I want to take it somewhere.”This collection showed his determination and dexterity at doing so."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/10f92a1a961b70a12e6bc3a2cb0c25d306ccdcdf/668_0_2832_1699/master/2832.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1e7d7b9be669d169cca96d6be6814d3d","title":"the actual bestworst moment of oscars 2019","story":"There was strong competition, but Sunday’s ceremony provided one epic, multi-vehicular pileupSunday’s Oscars had an awful lot going on. While some of the big events – such as Olivia Colman’s speech, Green Book’s contentious win and the CooperGaga facerub – received the attention they deserved, a handful of smaller, bizarre moments got lost in the cracks.It is my opinion that these moments also deserve their time in the sun, which is why I am here to laud one such instance: the flaming multi-vehicular pileup that was Vice’s Oscar win for best makeup and hairstyling.Of course, this isn’t to say that Vice did not deserve to win an Oscar. Of course it did. The transformation of every single actor who appeared in Vice was both amazing and total. However, I cannot believe that anyone involved in the makeup and hairstyling on Vice realised this, because their acceptance speech was genuinely one of the weirdest things I have ever seen. It wasn’t that they weren’t prepared. It was as if they’d been deliberately placed in an isolation chamber since birth and didn’t even understand the concept of what an acceptance speech was.First, some context. The Oscars this year were surprisingly brisk, and nowhere was this more apparent than with the speeches. The speech that directly preceded Vice’s – the best documentary win for Free Solo – was played off almost instantly. Perhaps this made Vice’s hair and makeup team jumpy. Perhaps they were already jumpy. But, even if they were, it still doesn’t fully explain what happened next.The winners – Greg Cannom, Kate Biscoe and Patricia Dehaney – staggered on to the stage. Cannom immediately started thanking people, before he noticed his two female colleagues standing beside him. One of them, Biscoe, unfolded a sheet of A4 paper and held it landscape. Landscape, for crying out loud. Nobody writes landscape on a sheet of A4. The only people in history ever to use A4 landscape are kidnappers writing ransom notes, and even then I suspect it feels a bit weird for them.Biscoe pointed at part of the paper. “That’s you,” she told Cannom. “Read that.” Cannom non-committally stuttered a couple of words, before Biscoe barged in and just read it out herself. At this point, all bets were off. Dehaney – easily a foot shorter than her companions – kept trying to e between them to say her piece, before chickening out and backing away. In the end, she had to crane in past Biscoe.Biscoe held out her sheet for Dehaney to read from, but in an act of pure spiteful rebellion, Dehaney revealed that she had brought her own acceptance speech, written on her own piece of paper. The three of them kept starting the same sentences at the same time, hitting an awkward bottleneck that more often than not had to resolve itself when Cannom backed out with a gracious “Go ahead”.After 60 seconds, the play-off music struck up. But this didn’t deter our three winners from this majestic piece of avant garde performance art they kept thanking people, sometimes whispering names to themselves like naughty little woodland elves before gaining the confidence to say them out loud.Another 15 seconds passed, and the camera cut away from them. Their microphone was switched off, but still they stood there wordlessly thanking people. This went on for another 10 agonising seconds before, finally, someone did the humane thing and cut the stage’s lights. Then, and only then, did the speech end.There were other odd speeches on Sunday. My second favourite was the speech for best live action short for Skin, which began as a solemn address about the bigotry that led to the Holocaust before whiplashing into a detonation of mad-eyed, jazz-handed, room-shaking, all-caps, we-did-it WHOOPING.But it paled in comparison to the Vice win, which might well be the most excruciating thing I’ll ever see. It was like watching an implosion. And, honestly, I wouldn’t have it any other way. Because, on a night of over-rehearsed slickness, this was a cold bucket of reality. If you or I ever had to give an acceptance speech at the Oscars, in front of the entire world, we’d shrivel up in exactly the same way. We’d whisper and stammer and yell. We’d get shut off in the most brutal way imaginable, too. So here’s to Greg Cannom, Kate Biscoe and Patricia Dehaney. They are all of us. May they never be forgotten."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/031079c32ab0548656496a7cb65037c19723ab28/502_108_3158_1896/master/3158.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=349101966560281ca2411ef639af24d2","title":"black sheep guardian film nominated for best short documentary oscar","story":"Ed Perkins’ film about a young black boy’s response to a racist gang after he moves out of London is up for an Academy awardBlack Sheep, a film commissioned by the , has been nominated for best short documentary at the 2019 Oscars.Directed by Ed Perkins, Black Sheep tells the story of Cornelius Walker, a black 11-year-old from London who moves with his family to a housing estate in Essex after the murder of schoolboy Damilola Taylor in 2000.

The 46-year-old is expected to be appointed within the next 24 hours after Celtic reluctantly gave him permission to talk to Leicester. It is understood that talks are at an advanced stage and that a deal in principle has been agreed between all parties, paving the way for Rodgers to take charge of his first game as Leicester manager at Watford on Sunday.Leicester had identified Rodgers as their No 1 target to replace Claude Puel several months ago but there were doubts as to whether the Northern Irishman could be persuaded to leave Celtic in the middle of the season, especially given the Scottish champions are on course to win a third domestic treble in succession.However, Puel’s dismissal on Sunday, on the back of a 4-1 home defeat against Crystal Palace the night before, has forced the issue. With the best part of three months of the season remaining, Leicester were eager to make a permanent appointment straight away and prepared to pay a compensation figure of £5m for Rodgers, who has previously managed in the Premier League with Liverpool and Swansea City.Although there was still an expectation that Rodgers would complete the season with Celtic, Leicester refused to be discouraged and made it clear that they wanted to fill the vacancy immediately. Chris Davies, Rodgers’s assistant at Celtic, and Kolo Touré, another member of the club’s backroom staff, will also move to the King Power Stadium.Rodgers is viewed by Leicester as the perfect manager to develop a talented group of younger players and to implement a clear playing philosophy – something that Puel failed to do during his time at the club. Although Leicester are 12th in the table, there is a feeling that the squad is capable of far more and that Rodgers, with his ability to coach as well as manage, ticks all the right boxes in that respect.From Celtic’s point of view, the timing is far from ideal and leaves them with sizeable shoes to fill – Rodgers won seven domestic trophies in the space of 32 months with the club – at a critical juncture of the season. It appears likely that Celtic will now turn to Neil Lennon, who left Hibernian at the end of January, as a short-term option."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bd0a41ca933bb13c5e137fc73fce3e65aad1e840/0_26_1212_727/master/1212.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c8542a2a3e949b51f648da04758edf25","title":"mauricio pochettino tottenham disappointed cannot apologise mike dean football association","story":"Mauricio Pochettino says he is disappointed that Mike Dean will not be the fourth official for Tottenham’s Premier League game at Chelsea on Wednesday night because he wanted to apologise to him in person following their altercation at Burnley on Saturday.The Spurs manager lost his composure in the aftermath of his team’s 2-1 loss, which severely dented their title hopes, and he angrily confronted Dean – a lapse that resulted in a Football Association charge for improper conduct.Pochettino has since been the picture of contrition.

Yet Sarri, who goes into the Spurs fixture fighting to retain his position after recent damaging results, offered the world’s most expensive goalkeeper no guarantees that he would retain his place.“I spoke with the goalkeeper, with Kepa, of course.

The withdrawals are set to occur in three ports, including the key Red Sea port of Hodeidah.The summit comes after reports that delays to scheduled withdrawals of Houthi troops had led to clashes between the two sides in southern Hodeidah, something that would represent a setback to the Stockholm agreement.The UN says about 20 million people need help to secure food this year in Yemen, including nearly 10 million who are just a step away from famine. Nearly 240,000 are facing “catastrophic levels of hunger”, it says.Last week Mark Lowcock, the UN coordinator for humanitarian relief, told the UN security council: “Among the many challenges the aid operation faces, funding is quickly becoming the biggest. We expect current resources to be used up by the end of March – just six weeks from now”. More than 250 humanitarian organisations are operating in the country.Britain’s Department for International Development (DfID) announced at the weekend it would provide a further £200m in 2019, taking its total aid donations to £800m since the civil war started.They are likely to be the dominant donors again this year, highlighting the paradox that those leading the aerial bombing campaign are doing most to alleviate some of its consequences.In a statement ahead of the Geneva conference, Unicef’s Middle East and North Africa director, Geert Cappelaere, said: “Not enough has changed for children in Yemen since the Stockholm agreement on 13 December 2018. Every day since, eight children have been killed or injured. Most of the children killed were playing outdoors with their friends or were on their way to or from school.“Mind-boggling violence over the past four years, high levels of poverty and decades of conflicts, neglect and deprivation are putting a heavy strain on Yemeni society, tearing apart its social fabric – fundamental for any society and especially for children.”Jan Egeland, secretary general of the Norwegian Refugee Council, said: “Yemenis need much more than just money. They need an end to interference in aid delivery, a lifting of the blockade, all ports and airports reopened, public services restored, and a nationwide ceasefire so that talks can bring an end to the conflict.”Yemen’s prime minister Maeen Abdulmalik Saeed said on Monday that his government was appealing to the international community for support in achieving a just and comprehensive peace.“The war in Yemen will not end until the Houthis are defeated, we hope that the humanitarian agencies will deal impartially with the situation in the country,” Saeed said during a meeting in Geneva ahead of the donor conference."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/daf06f3312f99c278700ca3f397033479c9ac579/0_77_5720_3432/master/5720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=78e56926aabb0350cafaa217a56b8c89","title":"guardian supporters future journalism","story":"By opting for a reader-funded business model, we rely on readers to support our groundbreaking independent journalism.

The Speaker, John Bercow, will decide whether to select the amendment on Wednesday.It calls on her to see at “the earliest opportunity a joint UK-EU commitment to adopt part two of the withdrawal agreement on citizens’ rights and ensure its implementation prior to the UK’s exiting the European Union, whatever the outcome of negotiations on other aspects of the withdrawal agreement”.The South Leicestershire MP is concerned that between 3.5 million and 3.8 million EU citizens will ultimately lose some family reunion and immigration appeal rights in the event of a no-deal Brexit, and up to 1 million British nationals in the EU could be left without significant rights, including the ability to work or offer services in another EU country.British pensioners in EU member states may also be left without healthcare paid for by the NHS in their country of residence.Monique Hawkins, an activist with the grassroots campaign group the3million, said that if this amendment passed, it would be the first step towards ringfencing rights for the 5 million to 6 million people affected by a no-deal Brexit."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a6a1d7a8aa8985dc1694e7ab97e0501cefac69fe/0_20_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=be7ca74c3b44b72d109c8a7d292a2933","title":"keir starmer labours brexit stance is either credible deal or remain","story":"Shadow Brexit secretary tries to clarify party line after Corbyn backs new referendumKeir Starmer has stated unequivocally that Labour will back a second EU referendum with remain on the ballot if Theresa May’s deal gets through parliament.Speaking to BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, the shadow Brexit secretary also took a thinly veiled swipe at some in Jeremy Corbyn’s office by urging the public to listen to elected MPs on the issue rather than advisers.The Labour leader finally threw his party’s weight behind a second referendum on Monday night, but there remains doubt about the wording of the question that would be put to the public.Starmer insisted the party agreed on the gist of the wording. “A public vote ought to be between the option on the one hand of a credible leave deal and on the other hand remain … That deal should be subject to the lock of a public vote,” he said.“Precisely what wording that is will obviously have to be decided by parliament, but that’s the basic choice.”On Monday, the shadow foreign secretary, Emily Thornberry, told Channel 4 News she and Corbyn would be campaigning to remain in the EU if there were a second vote. It was reported later that a source in Corbyn’s office claimed Thornberry had “misspoke” during the interview.She dismissed this as “nonsense” and was backed by Starmer on Tuesday.He said: “I don’t know who said what. What I do know is that you have got elected politicians on your programme, you had Emily Thornberry out last night setting out what the position is that we agreed as the Labour party.”For the avoidance of doubt, Starmer added: “I’m telling you what was in the official briefing from my office and Jeremy’s office to Labour MPs last night. So there is no question that it should be between a credible leave option and remain.”Starmer said he would back remain in a second vote, but was more cautious than Thornberry about Corbyn’s stance.“I would vote for remain. Jeremy will obviously speak for himself, but he voted remain last time and he like me has attacked the prime minister’s deal uphill and down dale,” he said.Starmer said Labour could not guarantee backing a second referendum until the party had tried to win support for its own soft Brexit alternative to May’s deal.“We will put that proposition up for a vote on a customs union and single market alignment this week. If it doesn’t go through, we the Labour party will either put down ourselves or support an amendment in favour of a public vote to protect us against what will be a damaging Tory Brexit, or even worse, no deal,” he said.The Labour MP John Mann warned Corbyn risked being ditched by voters over the party’s “absurd” shift to support a second referendum.“Voters won’t have it.

He told reporters: “Questions on whipping on what may or may not follow that are for another day.”Asked what length of extension the government would recommend if her deal failed and MPs rejected no deal, the spokesman pointed to the prime minister’s words, saying it would be “as short as possible”, and declined to say what the government would do if MPs amended the motion to demand a longer period.Pressed on whether May was willing to take Britain out of the EU without a deal, he said: “She wouldn’t give parliament a vote if she wasn’t willing to abide by it.”The concession angered Brexit-minded Conservative MPs from the European Research Group. Jacob Rees-Mogg told Sky that if a delay was seen as a way to stop Brexit completely, this “would be the most grievous error that politicians could commit”.Theresa Villers told the BBC: “It’s frustrating that the prime minister is partially backtracking on her repeated statements that we would leave on 29 March.”May stressed her own continued aversion to this option, saying the “absolute focus should be on working to get a deal and leaving on 29 March”.Extending Brexit beyond June would mean the UK had to take part in the European parliament elections, she said, whereas a short extension would be a one-off option that would “would create a much sharper cliff edge in a few months’ time”.Nonetheless, her concession brought expressions of relief from business groups, with the British Chambers of Commerce calling it “a small step towards the clarity and precision that businesses need to chart their future direction”.May sought to keep Conservative backbenchers on side by saying the UK and EU would devote time to alternative arrangements to avoid the Irish border backstop, a plan devised by several Tory MPs.MPs will vote on a new amendable Brexit motion on Wednesday. One planned amendment, led by the Labour MP Yvette Cooper, would call for a bill seeking to extend article 50 as needed to avoid no deal.In her statement, May said this would amount to “tying the government’s hands by seeking to commandeer the order paper”.Cooper respond by saying assurances alone were not enough because “promised votes have been pulled before, Commons motions have been ignored before”.Corbyn said Labour would still back the Cooper amendment, so as to “to rule out that reckless cliff-edge Brexit”.He also talked up a planned Labour amendment seeking the party’s version of Brexit, including membership of a customs union. In a change to policy, on Monday it was announced that if this plan was not adopted, Labour would back a second Brexit referendum.May criticised this move, saying: “Anyone who voted Labour at the last election because they thought he would deliver Brexit will rightly be appalled.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/uploads/2017/10/06/Heather-Stewart.jpg?width=140\u0026amp;height=140\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4d4ea8889bd43746db8c5a1250834e2c\" alt=\"Heather Stewart","title":"brexit latest news developments theresa may chairs cabinet amid reports she is about to announce u turn on giving mps potential vote to extend article 50 politics live","story":"Rolling coverage of the day’s political developments as they happen, including Theresa May’s statement to MPs about Brexit, and the possibility of the Commons getting a chance to vote against no dealAt the start of this week there were claims that tomorrow’s vote would mark the moment when Theresa May, finally, had to make a choice between siding with the pro-Europeans in her government or the European Research Group, the faction in her party pushing for a harder Brexit. But, not for the first time, predictions about May being forced to commit have turned out to be misplaced. Her capacity for equivocation is extraordinary.I summarised the main announcements in her statement at 2.02pm. But here are some thoughts on the political consequences.1) An extension of article 50 has, within the space of a week, gone from something that the government would scarcely discuss in public to a firm probability. May has announced a mechanism for how it might happen. And if, as the BBC’s Katya Adler argues (see 12.04pm), May was hoping to use “three-way Brexit blackmail” to encourage Brexiters, Labour and the EU to compromise ahead of the “meaningful vote”, by creating a mechanism for an article 50 extension she has weakened the leverage that might help get her deal through parliament - making extension even more likely.2) As usual, May is treating EU thinking as an afterthought. May wants to let MPs vote for a short, one-off article 50 extension if her deal gets voted down. (Quite whether, in practice, she would be able to stop parliament pushing for a second extension is another matter.) But EU leaders have been clear that they would support either a short extension to allow MPs to pass the legislation needed to facilitate Brexit, or a long extension needed to allow the UK to make up its mind. A short extension to allow the UK to dither for three more months holds little attraction for them, and it is not obvious that that they would even agree. (For article 50 to be extended, the EU 27 would have to support this unanimously.)3) May seems to have done enough to avert government resignations. MPs are still mulling over what she said, but the early indications are that she has done enough to satisfy those Tories who were planning to resign from government to back the Cooper amendment. Indeed, it is not even certain at this point whether the Cooper amendment will still be put to a vote.4) Cleverly, May has also managed to appease the remainers without unduly provoking the ERG leavers. During her statement it was striking how little criticism she received from Tory Brexiters who until recently would have viewed any talk of an article 50 extension as a betrayal. It may just be that they are holding their fire. But equally it may be that, as Jacob Rees-Mogg suggested in an interview earlier (see 1.27pm), they have concluded that May has not removed no deal as a prospect, but just delayed the point at which it might happen.4) But not so cleverly, May has just perpetuated the uncertainty. May won’t even commit the government to whipping its MPs to vote for an article 50 extension if her deal fails and, as my colleague Heather Stewart points out (see 2.37pm), this does not make life any easier for businesses trying to work out how seriously they need to take the risk of no deal. She seems to have pulled off a modest tactical success, while doing nothing to edge her party, or parliament, any closer to a long-term resolution of this crisis.MPs received a surprise in the House of Commons earlier when Theresa May quoted a catchphrase from a car insurance advert to explain the options on Brexit. As the Press Association reports, the prime minister quoted Compare the Market’s TV advert to SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford, who claimed May was “running down the clock” before departing from the EU. Blackford accused May of wasting nine days of parliamentary time after she announced she was giving MPs a vote on delaying the Brexit departure date past 29 March. Responding, May said:If he wants to end the uncertainty … then he should vote for a deal. Simples.Politicians said they were “stunned” by the quote, with Labour MP Rupa Huq tweeting:This is from the ’s Christopher Hope.And ITV’s Robert Peston says Sir Oliver Letwin, another leading Tory supporter of the Cooper amendment, is satisfied with what May has promised.Theresa May has finally finished her statement. She was on her feet for just over two hours. I will post a snap analysis shortly.Nick Boles, one of the Conservative MPs who voted for the Cooper amendment last month, seems to be happy with Theresa May’s offer.Yvette Cooper sounded far less happy with May’s assurances when she spoke in the Commons earlier (see 1.19pm), but she has not said yet whether she will go ahead with her amendment and press it to a vote.Briefing journalists after the prime minister’s statement, her spokesman repeatedly - and maddeningly - refused to say how the government would whip its MPs if it has to call a vote on 14 March on whether article 50 should be extended. He said:I think what you heard in the Commons was the prime minister’s absolute determination to get a deal over the line in a way that the House of Commons can support it. That is her focus and that is what you would expect.Questions on whipping on what may or may not follow that are for another day. I think it’s important that we set these things out in order.Asked what length of extension the government will recommend, if her deal fails and MPs reject no deal, he pointed to the PM’s words saying it would be “as short as possible” - and declined to say what the government would do to if MPs amend the motion to demand a longer period.Pressed on whether May was still willing to take Britain out of the EU without a deal, he said “she wouldn’t give parliament a vote if she wasn’t willing to abide by it.” But the conversation underlined the fact that what the PM has announced today is not “taking no deal off the table” she has simply accepted that if it comes to the crunch, she will allow MPs to bind her hands. It is not at all clear how all this is meant to help employers and investors attempting to weigh the probability of a no-deal Brexit - though it appears to have averted the risk of a rash of resignations on Wednesday.“There was broad cabinet agreement that this was the way to proceed,” said her spokesman.The SNP’s Peter Grant asks what will happen if MPs vote against both no deal and against extending article 50. Is it any coincidence that the day ahead is the Ides of March?May says the Commons will have decisions to take.Back in the Commons the Plaid Cymru MP Jonathan Edwards asks May to confirm that under her plan, if MPs vote to rule out no deal, and vote for an extension, the government will then enter an extension with no deal again an option. This is “swimming round in circles”, he says.May says she wants MPs to back her deal.Theresa Villiers, a leading Tory Brexiter, told the World at One that, although the prospect of an article 50 extension was “frustrating”, the overall position had not changed significantly. She explained:It’s frustrating that the prime minister is partially backtracking on her repeated statements that we would leave on March 29. But fundamentally it doesn’t change the challenge that she has - she needs to get changes to the withdrawal treaty before it is capable of commanding support in parliament. She needs to replace the Northern Ireland backstop with alternative arrangements which don’t have the flaws of the withdrawal treaty at present.Villiers also said that, without a binding change to the withdrawal agreement, Theresa May’s deal would not pass.Without binding treaty change it is hard to see how the prime minister gets her majority and overturns what was the most significant defeat for any government ever in the history of parliament."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f2c56830dcb2b6738b31f7bfffe2107dd61ee8a2/362_213_1761_1057/master/1761.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9d5b4c8c07ee45989e3978d2ed6109b2","title":"bradman hetmyer writers judgment the spin cricket","story":"“It is curious,” Neville Cardus wrote in this newspaper in December 1928, “how the sense of style and class will make itself felt even through a cable read thousands of miles from the spot.”This, in the end, is perhaps the most important job of the cricket writer, and what makes reporting more than the mere reproduction of scores and statistics with the occasional added adjective. The reader’s ability to judge a player has been rendered significantly easier since Cardus’s time by the advent of, well, almost everything we now use to watch and learn about cricket except paper, ink and eyes. Still, the writer’s job continues to be done, and with a bit of luck the sense of style and class continues to make itself felt.When just last month Vic Marks used a few broad brushstrokes to describe “a young batsman who commands attention … a left-hander who has a bit of swagger and likes to hit the ball”, it was the first time the play of Shimron Hetmyer had been described for the  reader. Watching and reading about England’s tour of the West Indies the picture of a 22-year-old of considerable style and promise has continued to fill out, as Hetmyer has blossomed into everyone’s new favourite batsman.Cardus was writing about one of them when he penned the above statement in 1928, a player who at that point he had never witnessed. As it happens the first time Don Bradman was mentioned by the  had been that January, in a report on a Sheffield Shield match between Queensland and New South Wales, when we described him as “a medium-pace bowler” who “kept a good length”. As with Hetmyer, who has already been a Test cricketer for nearly two years, it took an England tour for a fuller picture to emerge.In a warm-up game against NSW in November 1928 Bradman was “a brilliant young colt” who “batted splendidly” with “an easy style”. The hyperbole grew further following a century on debut in the first Test, and by the time Cardus got a chance to see Bradman at first hand, when Australia arrived in England in 1930, the 21-year-old was already considered among the world’s finest players. “The genius of this remarkable boy consists in the complete summary he gives us of the technique of batsmanship,” Cardus wrote that summer. “The really astonishing fact about Bradman is that a boy should play as he does, with the sophistication of an old hand and brain. How came this Bradman to expel from him all the greenness and impetuosity of youth while retaining the strength and alacrity of youth?”Bradman wasn’t the last great batsman whom the  initially considered a bowler. In 1954 we wrote about “an 18-year-old left-arm slow bowler from Barbados” (actually 17) by the name of Garfield Sobers. It took three more years, and a century against MCC at Lord’s, before we got excited about his batsmanship, Denys Rowbotham writing that he was “clearly a man who loves to hit hard and often”, while “against all the slow bowlers he used his feet as feet should be used”.It can be irresistibly tempting to bestow greatness upon players who are simply very promising. Phil Tufnell used to say that Ed Joyce was the best young batsman he had ever seen, an honour Bob Cottam, Somerset’s director of cricket, bestowed on the wildly hyped Mark Lathwell in 1993: “He has immense talent and it’s incredible the way he takes everything in his stride.” The Evening Standard once gave its best young cricketer award to a callow 13-year-old by the name of John Major. “He’s a superb player, the best young player in the country. I see a lot of Tendulkar in him,” said Justin Langer in 2007, of Ravi Bopara.All of these descriptions turned out to be a little overenthusiastic, though observers have also sometimes failed to get excited enough. In May 1974 we sent John Arlott to watch a county match between Somerset and Lancashire, where a youngster was given his first-class debut. “Botham, in his first match, made a pleasant impression,” he deadpanned. The following month Henry Blofeld saw the same player hit 45 not out for Somerset against Hampshire in the Benson \u0026amp Hedges Cup. “Ian Botham, a young man of 18 from Yeovil, played not only the innings of his life, but he also lifted the game from a state of conventional excitement to one of unbelievable suspense and drama and finally into the realms of romantic fiction,” he drooled. There were, it turned out, other innings-of-his-life to come.Watching for the first time a young player who, if only in your mind and at that moment, could be destined for greatness is one of the genuine thrills of sport, one that can be rendered greater by their subsequent success but cannot be dimmed by disappointment. As ever Cardus transmitted this excitement flawlessly.“Here was a great cricketer in the making,” he wrote in June 1937 of Bill Edrich, the kind of player who could inspire others to take (and indeed build) a stand. “A finer exhibition of resourceful batsmanship could not well be imagined. When the pitch was at its worst he executed his strokes according to the soundest principles, and his power when he did hit was impressive. He is a player far above ordinary good or high class he is perhaps the finest young batsman of the day.”And on that day, if not on any other, it was true.• This is an extract taken from the Spin, the ’s weekly cricket email.

I thought he ran a lovely race at Ascot in the Ascot Chase. I think the Ryanair Chase is the plan at the moment.Elixir Du Nutz (Supreme Novice Hurdle): He was absolutely brilliant in a gallop at Wincanton last week. We could have another little away day, but we might leave him be as he looks very fit. His form stands up to anybody else’s in the Supreme. Lostintranslation (RSA Chase): He is just a lovely horse and he also has winning form round Cheltenham and the track will suit him. Whatever he does this year, I see him as a Gold Cup horse for next year.Mister Malarky (RSA Chase or National Hunt Chase): He has been a revelation over fences and is rated 148 so he is good enough to run in any of the big novice chases at Cheltenham, including the RSA. Master Debonair (Champion Bumper): He has won two of his three bumpers and did it well at Cheltenham last time. He has won on autumn ground at Cheltenham, but spring ground will be fine. He is not a big horse and has form in the bag – whether it is good enough is anyone’s guess. Hopefully, we will aim for the Supreme with him next year, he’s a good horse.Cuddles McGraw (2.30) has plenty to recommend him at around 7-2 in the novice handicap chase at Leicester. Fergal O’Brien’s chaser got off the mark over fences at the second attempt at Warwick last time and recorded a good time in the process.All Is Good (3.30) travelled well for a long way when returning from a four-month break at Huntingdon last time before finishing less than four lengths behind the winner. He should show the benefit of that run when he lines up off the same mark, while It’s All About Me (4.50) is another with an obvious chance on the card at Catterick Bridge.Martineo was back to his best at Wolverhampton last time out but whether he should be a 15-8 chance to follow up today is a different question and the veteran Lucky Lodge (6.00) looks overpriced at around 7-1 to register a seventh course success."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/93d2dbf39c6df68e96129d46e73737515880ebff/0_581_3468_2080/master/3468.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4dbc2024216cb1efefe1dc52f0028a98","title":"how we made hair the musical","story":"‘Some of the cast ate some pot brownies one night and ended up hanging on to each other saying: “Where is the audience? Which way is up?”’ I was in a play on Broadway that got such bad reviews it opened and closed on the same night. I had been cast opposite an actor called Gerry Ragni and told him about my dream of writing a musical. It was the mid-60s, a time when hippies were appearing in the East Village. They seemed like creatures from outer space, so open, loving and beautiful. They touched our hearts. The anti-Vietnam-war protests on the streets were dramatic and thrilling. Gerry and I thought we could write a show about all this.I’d seen a painting at the Whitney Museum, of a comb holding a clump of hair that had been pulled out. It was just called Hair – and that gave us the title for our musical. Galt MacDermot, our composer, set everything to music, even the stage directions – unlike Herbie Hancock, who was asked to write music for one of our songs, and returned it with half the lyrics cut. Fate seemed to be at work with the show. Gerry was on a train one day when he met the producer Joseph Papp, who had a new venue in New York, the Public Theater, and needed a show to open it. Two weeks later, we had the job. The show needed actors with long hair but there was no such thing at the time, so we would approach suitable people in the street, tap them on the shoulder and say: “Excuse me, do you sing?” The songs we’d written really pushed the envelope and there was a mood of permissiveness among the actors, too. Once the show moved to Broadway, there was more and more drug use backstage. Whenever the fire marshal came round, the stage manager would get on the intercom and say: “Marti Whitehead, please report to the stage manager’s desk.” Then everyone knew to throw their joints away.The Public Theater wouldn’t let us do the nude scene, but our Broadway director Tim Horgan was all in favour. In fact, he changed it so that instead of just two people, the entire cast took their clothes off. I played Claude, the leader of the hippies, and Gerry played Berger, a free spirit – until we got fired from our own show. The play had opened a production in Los Angeles and we went over to visit, watching from the back of the theatre. We decided to take our clothes off during the interval and walk down the aisle naked.The producer heard about it and decided we were a liability. When we flew back to New York, we’d been fired and there were armed guards on the door of the theatre keeping us out. So we wrote on a bedsheet “We want our baby back!” and picketed the theatre. They let us back on stage eventually.After that, Gerry and I started fighting more and more. It had become too intense: we had to get away from each other. But we found our way back to each other as friends, even writing a second show called Sun, which has never been produced. Maybe someone will put it on before I die.It was a wonderful, exciting time. Everything was changing. I was working at the Night Owl Cafe in the Village when Jim and Gerry came in looking for musicians. I had long hair and was innocent-looking, and they asked if I could sing, dance or act. I said: “No. Who are you?” My friend talked me into auditioning so I sang With a Little Help from My Friends. They liked it, but they didn’t have a role for me – so they wrote a song, Frank Mills, for me instead.Jim and Gerry were yin and yang: Gerry was outgoing and wacky, Jim quiet and thoughtful. Galt was the grownup in the room. We became like a close-knit family – a tribe, as we called it. The nude scene didn’t bother us: we weren’t shy about our bodies. We were anti-war, of course, and went on the anti-Vietnam marches and to be-ins at the park. But they said we hated the soldiers, which just wasn’t true.Martha was born in 1970. When I began to show, they had me play the part of the pregnant girl, Jeanie. That was a lot of fun, but it became too dangerous because she has to go up a ladder. After Martha was born, she’d be backstage with me. Many stage managers have held her while I sang Frank Mills.A lot of the show is about masculinity and male friendship. Heather MacRae – who played Sheila, the woman caught in a love triangle with Claude and Berger – was magnificent. I remember sharing a dressing room with Diane Keaton and Melba Moore, too. They were getting their careers together while I was just having a good time. I never felt like acting was my calling."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/68bd77db04ea7282bd4f48f772b96bf815b4ac1d/0_0_6239_4171/master/6239.jpg?width=480\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=6e69fe040bac212e3deab114f997058e 960w","title":"jeff bezos philanthropy donations top 50","story":"Bezos, who holds Amazon stock valued at about $137bn, contributed a total of $2bn in 2018Jeff Bezos, the world’s richest man and one frequently tagged a cheapskate when it comes to giving away money, has emerged as a leading philanthropist.According to the latest Philanthropy 50 list, a ranking of America’s top 50 donors compiled by the Chronicle of Philanthropy, Bezos actually made more charitable donations than anyone else in the US last year, including philanthropists with comparable fortunes such as former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg and Microsoft’s Bill Gates.Bezos, who holds Amazon stock valued at about $137bn, contributed a total of $2bn to good causes in 2018 through his Bezos Day One Fund, a philanthropic vehicle founded by his soon-to-be ex-wife MacKenzie Bezos.According to the foundation’s website, the Bezos fund was established to support existing not-for-profits addressing homelessness and poverty, in addition to funding preschool education in low-income communities.While the Bezos gifts may still be far behind Gates’ lifetime donations of about $45bn to global poverty alleviation and education, or Bloomberg’s current $6bn in gifts, his surprise entry into the top 50 comes as overall giving among the group declined by half last year compared to 2017.According to the Chronicle’s annual list the people who gave the most to charity contributed a total of more than $7.8bn last year, a steep drop from the $14.7bn a year earlier.In order of magnitude, the Bezos’s $2bn came in easily ahead of Bloomberg, who gave $767m to the arts, education, the environment, health and other causes and at No 3, Pierre and Pam Omidyar, whose fortune derives from eBay, who contributed $392m to not-for-profits that seek to promote democracy, citizen activism and other causes.The Omidyars handily beat out Mark Zuckerberg and Priscilla Chan, who came in at No 7 with gifts totaling $213m to various causes.Other newcomers to the list include Craigslist founder Craig Newmark at No 11, who donated $144m, largely to not-for-profits that produce news and journalism.According to the publication, the 2018 list is notable for donations directed toward artificial intelligence or other tech advances. One of the principal donors to that field is Wall Street fund manager Stephen Schwarzman, who at No 4 gave $350m to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology for artificial intelligence studies.Still the focus of the latest list is likely to remain on Bezos, whose entry onto the charts comes after years of making no impression whatsoever.Bezos has previously said he intends to plough his entire fortune into his Texas-based space operation Blue Origin, explaining: “We have to go to space to save earth, and we kind of have to hurry.”But with an impending orce that could siphon off half of his fortune, the scale of that plan could be facing reductions.Bezos’s $2bn gift may help to quell persistent grumblings about his slow philanthropic uptake. In 2017, Bezos responded and solicited ideas on Twitter for long-term philanthropic causes, receiving over 49,000 comments.Bezos later said the responses, which trended to affordable housing, environmental protection and workers’ rights, had been “very helpful and have already changed my thinking about how to approach this”.Yet investors have been willing to pay for Amazon shares at an extreme multiple of earnings in the hope it will someday return higher earnings. That hope, and canny tax structuring, is the basis of Bezos’ richest-man status and in part why his gift-giving – or lack of it – comes under persistent scrutiny.Bezos’ charitable donation will also refocus attention on his personal tax status.Last month historian Rutger Bregman made a speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos during which he accused wealthy participants at the meeting of avoiding higher taxes. Societies should not rely on the generosity of the rich, Bregman said, adding: “Philanthropy is not a substitute for democracy, or proper taxation, or a good welfare state.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/005804b89ea0202afbd9be58bfcbcaea13f829b7/0_70_4382_2631/master/4382.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d90546608a83d37497b6c042d46315a9","title":"barely one star at best this time with alan partridge reader reviews","story":"Can Alan still cut it in 2019, or did he fluck it up?

But for me, the script was too subtle to raise belly laughs more like embarrassed winces. The best bit was the exposure of Partridge’s anxieties about status, money etc, by the hacktivist’s revelations during the interview. The show’s ending in the BBC lift didn’t work. Perhaps the sharper and funnier W1A had raised my expectations of a BBC-based satire? Liz, 60, LeedsAs a Partridge fan of many, many years who can probably still quote far too much of the really obscure stuff, like when he was on the radio doing KMKYWAP (smelling salts anyone?) I really enjoyed it. Sure – it wasn’t as good as ‘vintage’ Partridge – character high point for me, Jed Maxwell – but it’s unfair to expect those heights every time. jimstinksThe writing is too undisciplined, like they wanted to jam every idea they thought of in there, even getting sidekick Simon involved when it wasn’t needed, instead of having a few well written jokes. The main problem is that old Partridge was surreal thanks to Armando Iannucci and Peter Baynham, and the directing style matches the tone. The new stuff is too clean and realistic in its presentation, so when something unrealistic happens it just feels awkward and out of place. BrainedThe original Partridge fans are in their 40s and 50s now and, like most old people, they find change difficult (I’m in that age bracket but I’m not scared of change). There’s people pulling the script apart, saying x or y wouldn’t happen in a TV studio. WTF are these people on? Alan shot dead a guest in Knowing Me Knowing You and carried on broadcasting – it’s never been about recreating a real-life scenario. It’s comedy not a documentary.Then you have the people moaning about how Coogan is playing the character all wrong. His era has gone. He was briefly a big cheese with his own show, he was still deluded when he was at the hotel. He now realises he’s well out of it but he has a chance. Of course he’s not going to wear a big-shouldered green blazer and have his hair parted with glue like before. Times have also changed.It was a brilliant first programme and it was great it didn’t copy any of the previous formats. Lynn had some brilliant lines and it’s hilarious when her jealousy shows through. I look forward to more. barrycalmsNot a five-star show. It fails to have the wonderful set pieces and guests that Knowing Me Knowing You had. The segments of presenter chat felt hollow and vacant. The dodgy technology errors like the failing Twitter feeds etc felt dated and tedious. I got the impression Steve Coogan thinks this is funnier than it is. tjhvaliantsI thought Knowing Me Knowing You was almost always hilarious. I’m Alan Partridge is probably one of my favourite sitcoms of all time. But this was barely one star, at best.I didn’t laugh once, which is rather spectacular. Not even a slight smile. There was no bite or edge to the comedy there wasn’t much comedy at all. The jokes were very safe. It seemed to steer away from all controversy and danger. Especially when you compare it to similar parody stuff like Brass Eye and Charlie Brooker’s Screenwipe (and others), it just wasn’t in the least bit funny.I’m really not sure what it was going for. I’d rather have simply watched The One Show (and I really don’t like The One Show). Was the whole thing about how Steve Coogan is even more desperate for the pay cheque than Alan is? I wouldn’t have thought so. Definitely one to skip next week. pretentiouspenguinI imagine this’ll grow nicely, especially the likely ever more tense and resentful relationship he’ll have with the co-presenter. It’ll be interesting to see where they let Alan completely lose the plot (for he must), or where his ego runs amok prior to his fall. He’ll no doubt get more desperate to cling on to his return. I can see an attempt to sabotage the original host’s return being somehow revealed. Maybe not vintage Alan quite yet, but I think it sets it up nicely for a gradual ratcheting up towards his inevitable self-combustion. And thank God it’s not Mrs Brown’s Boys, of course. RicardoRed99One of the most remarkable things to witness is Steve Coogan’s complete capture of Alan how he inhabits every nervous tic, desperate look or awkward move. He’s always been a very physical performer, as well as having exquisite comic timing and a real command of vocal delivery. The brief demonstration of how to go to the toilet on a train without using your hands was great. Right up there with his running up the hill in the Kate Bush medley, or working out how he can use two mini soaps in the shower. Good to have some genuine talent back at the BBC. dylan37Started a little bit slowly for me but really found its feet after Tim Key’s interactive screen struggle. No-hands hygiene and the hacktivist were solid, and hopefully it can build from that now it’s all established. Not sure it warrants the five star review, mind. I’ve very recently gone through the entire Partridge backlog and the opening 15 minutes were some of the weakest. CaldersInBrumIt didn’t work for me. He was just too out of step with current TV values. I don’t see how he could have got past a rehearsal. It would have been more convincing if he could have learned just a little bit more of how to survive in 2019. He and Lynn seemed to have stepped out of a time machine without doing any research whatsoever. Hope it improves, but if not, I think it’s over for Alan.

In a statement, Zarif urged other diplomats not to follow his course of action, saying the aim of his resignation was to strengthen his department.In his resignation note, Zarif apologised for his “shortcomings” and “inability to continue serving”.There were informed reports that he was angry at being excluded from a meeting between the Iranian leadership and Bashar al-Assad when the Syrian president made a rare visit to Tehran on Monday.The future of Syria is critical to Iranian foreign policy, and Zarif’s exclusion from a meeting between Rouhani and Assad was taken as a snub that undermined the prestige and efficiency of the foreign ministry. It is said to be one of a series of clashes between the office of the president and the foreign ministry.On Sunday, Zarif had criticised Iranian hardliners in a speech in Tehran, saying: “We cannot hide behind imperialism’s plot and blame them for our own incapability. Independence does not mean isolation from the world.”Zarif’s resignation leaves Rouhani without one of his main allies in pushing Iran towards more negotiation with the west. Analysts have said Rouhani faces growing political pressure from hardliners in the government as the unravelling nuclear deal further strains the economy.Zarif, who is fluent in English, is seen as the acceptable face of Iranian diplomacy to the west, which has made him the subject of relentless attack by hardliners, especially over his role in championing the nuclear deal.Donald Trump pulled the US out of the agreement last year, leaving Europe to make limited efforts to prevent powerful US sanctions from destroying Iranian hopes of increasing trade with the west – the supposed benefit of the deal from the Iranian standpoint.European diplomats were aghast at the resignation, potentially losing their chief interlocutor, and angrily condemning the US for pushing Zarif over the edge. One diplomat likened the US administration’s attitude to Marxist revolutionaries worshipping at the altar of change and disruption.The EU has long warned sanctions that cripple the Iranian economy will only weaken reformists in Tehran, and not usher in the kind of democratic revolution that the Trump team seem to be seeking to engineer.The US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, tweeted his reaction to Zarif’s announcement.A US state department official tweeted an unflattering gif of Zarif, saying: “How do you know @JZarif is lying? His lips are moving.”Zarif served as Iran’s ambassador to the UN from 2002 to 2007, first under the reformist president Mohammad Khatami and then under the hardline Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.Later, secret talks between the US and Iran in Oman became fully fledged negotiations over its nuclear programme. During the talks, Zarif met the then US secretary of state, John Kerry, more than 50 times – something unimaginable years earlier."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7553f5fb89f5411fd1f89bc4a5b5b8dea5d05576/534_165_2398_1440/master/2398.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a4eaac950f7f48fecb919855121f15ba","title":"canada jagmeet singh gets chance to take on trudeau after byelection win","story":"First non-white leader of major party in Canada enters parliament ahead of October electionJagmeet Singh, the leader of Canada’s New Democratic party, has won a critical byelection and a seat in parliament, ensuring he will lead the left-of-centre party in the country’s October federal election.Singh, the first non-white leader of a major party in Canada, was under immense pressure to win the highly anticipated race in Burnaby, a city east of Vancouver.“Friends, we made history today,” he told supporters. “When I was growing up, I could have never imagined someone like me running to be prime minister.”Calling the victory “incredible”, Singh pledged to fight for Canada’s middle class and took direct aim at growing fears of xenophobia in the country.The rookie leader, who has been seen as an energising force in Canadian politics, will have a place in the House of Commons, allowing him to spar with other leaders and the prime minister, Justin Trudeau, ahead of the election.The victory was critical for the party leader: amid sagging poll numbers nationally and fundraising difficulties for the party, senior members had cast doubts over his future leadership had he not secured the win.“Jagmeet Singh has always been underestimated,” his brother Gurratan Singh tweeted as results were reported. “And he always proves them wrong.”Typically, leaders of federal parties in Canada decline to run competitive candidates when another leader is seeking a seat. The Liberal party, as well as the Conservatives and the People’s party, all ran candidates in the Burnaby South electoral district. The Green party chose not to run a candidate.The closely watched byelection was not without controversy. In January, Liberal candidate Karen Wang was forced to step aside after making racially charged remarks about Singh. “If we can increase the voting rate, as the only Chinese candidate in this riding, if I can garner 16,000 votes I will easily win the by-election, control the election race and make history!” she wrote on WeChat. “My opponent in this by-election is the NDP candidate Singh of Indian descent!”The text was widely condemned by both the NDP and the Liberals. Wang stepped down at the request of Trudeau.While the win is a relief for Singh, the electoral district of Burnaby South is widely viewed as an NDP stronghold.In two other byelections across the country, the NDP lost Outremont, handing over the Quebec seat once held by its former leader to the Liberal party candidate, Rachel Bendayan."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e3832347555abddc85d1cbe8f93640d99b2ef4c2/0_107_6708_4025/master/6708.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=44392a94bb15aefcbb869f0279189cb3","title":"dutch customs seize 90000 bottles of vodka believed to be for kim jong un","story":"Authorities say investigations led to suspicions the haul was to be taken to PyongyangDutch customs officials at the port of Rotterdam have seized 90,000 bottles of vodka believed to be destined for the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, and his army chiefs.The discovery, on the eve of Kim’s two-day summit with Donald Trump in Hanoi, was made after Dutch authorities flagged up the suspicious route and records of a Chinese-owned container ship, Nebula.The Russian vodka, contained in 3,000 boxes, had been recorded as being due for unloading in China, via the ports of Hamburg and Rotterdam.When officers sought to retrieve the container from the ship’s hull, it was found to be concealed and hemmed in by the fuselage of an aircraft also due to be exported to China.Despite concerns about damaging the aircraft, the Dutch ministry of affairs ordered the container’s removal.Initial investigations heightened suspicions that the haul was to be taken to Pyongyang, Dutch authorities said.Arno Kooij, the customs officer in charge of the seizure, declined to comment on what had alerted his systems to the container ship.“We do not want to make anyone wiser than necessary,” he told the Dutch newspaper, Algemeen Dagblad. “What I can say, based on the information we had, we suspected that this container would fall under the sanctions regime for North Korea. We suspected that this vodka would not go to China, but to North Korea.”Sigrid Kaag, the Dutch minister for trade, who ordered the seizure, said: “The security council of the United Nations has imposed clear sanctions on North Korea, so it is important to enforce those sanctions. The sanctions also govern the import of luxury goods and so customs was completely justified in unloading that container.”Kim, who was educated in Switzerland, is known to have a taste for the high life. Last year, it was claimed he had has spent more than $4bn (£3bn) on importing luxury products from China since taking power in 2011.Kim arrived in Hanoi in his armoured train on Tuesday, ahead of his second meeting with Trump. He had travelled for two and a half days, covering 2,800 miles, although his precise route has not been disclosed.The meeting comes eight months after a summit in Singapore, the first between a sitting US president and a North Korean leader, which failed to produce concrete results on a path to denuclearisation."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ae398f855da449b8f34abc4d387b5724ebb739d2/0_28_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ebfcb682253b4ed069565c11d3d7c721","title":"margaret atwood and arundhati roy say afghan women must be heard in us taliban peace talks","story":"Authors sign letter saying US-Taliban talks exclude broad sections of Afghan societyArundhati Roy and Margaret Atwood are among a group of international writers and activists backing claims that US peace talks with the Taliban are excluding Afghan women’s voices and risk pushing back the rights of women in the country.In an open letter published in the , Atwood, the author of the dystopian novel The Handmaid’s Tale, and Roy, who won the Man Booker prize for The God of Small Things, along with hundreds of Afghan women and young people, call for “global solidarity to keep women’s voices alive”.“We, the women of Afghanistan, will not go backwards,” the letter states. “History has taught us the bloody lesson that you cannot have peace without inclusion.”The letter has also been signed by other international figures including the playwright Eve Ensler, the author Neil Gaiman, the film director Ken Loach, the author and physician Khaled Hosseini, the feminist activist Gloria Steinem and five Nobel peace laureates.The letter highlights concerns about the peace deal currently being negotiated between the US government and the Afghan Taliban. It says the negotiations exclude broad sections of Afghan society, including women and young people, as well as democratic structures, government and institutions.“Over the last 17 years we have fought to bring women’s voices and interests into Afghanistan’s political, social and cultural institutions, against a backdrop of ongoing violence,” it says.The Afghan signatories, describing themselves as “civilians, doctors, activists, student and artists,” say they have “collectively and inidually created space to advocate both for ourselves and for peace in our country”.“Many of our leaders have paid with their lives for this progress,” the letter adds, highlighting cases including the 2012 killing of Hanifa Safi, a prominent Afghan politician who was blown up in her car, and Farkhunda Malikzada, 27, who was publicly beaten and killed by a street mob in Kabul in 2015.“The gains made from these hard-won battles are now being threatened by a deal that excludes our interests and voices and ignores the representations we have fought for,” the letter says. “It is at this critical moment for the future of our young people, our women, and our democracy that we ask for global solidarity, so we can continue to build on our victories.”It continues: “When the coalition arrived in Afghanistan in 2001, it was on the back of promises made to Afghan women and future generations. We have been fighting for our rights and representation ever since. As we prepare to defend our rights once more, we ask that this peace process reaffirms and protects our constitutional rights, interests and democracy.”The letter was the initiative of Time4RealPeace, a coalition of Afghan women and young people that aims to raise awareness about the lack of female involvement in the peace process.Rahela Sidiqi and Sahar Halaimzai, two of the letter’s four coordinators, said: “Afghans are dealing daily with the legacy of violence, the Taliban, warlords and ethnic factions, but we now have a constitutional framework to deal with these issues and a new generation of Afghans – women and men – committed to creating peace and stability.“We have come together to demand a legitimate peace process that includes our interests and our democratic institutions. Not one that simply trades US withdrawal and our democracy, however flawed, for shallow Taliban promises to respect rule of law, protect women’s constitutional rights and not monopolise power.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/93b4030656873954a5f76d6a448c03da63bd129c/0_117_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8b18c69abcb9fd0c9ae087158c8ebad6","title":"resurrection pastor sparks storm of parody responses on twitter","story":"South African pastor Alph Lukau’s ‘revival’ of a dead man prompts online mockeryA pastor in South Africa who claimed to have performed a resurrection has sparked a social media craze as users took to the web mockingly mimicking his miraculous powers.A video of Alleluia Ministries International pastor Alph Lukau “reviving” a supposedly dead man emerged over the weekend and quickly went viral.It showed Lukau laying his hands on a body dressed in a white suit and lying in a coffin, which suddenly came to life and jumped to his feet.Within hours, the hashtag \u001dResurrectionChallenge was trending on Twitter as users posted wry images of their own dramatic “revivals” alongside screenshots of Lukau’s supposed miracle.Just Jusca pictured himself with a look of surprise sitting up in the bath under the caption “My alarm just resurrect me to wake up”.Dikano Sino posted a video of a class of schoolchildren being magically reanimated by a teacher.But Lukau’s supposed resurrection prompted a backlash from the funeral home “hired” to make the arrangements for the “dead” man.“As Kings and Queens Funeral Services, we would like to distance ourselves from the supposed resurrection,” the company wrote in a statement. “We are in the process of taking legal action for this malicious damage to our image.”By Tuesday, the Alleluia church had distanced itself from the video, telling local media “it was not a resurrection miracle”.The church has declined to comment on criticism that it deceived worshippers, the Sowetan newspaper said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e19989621ec75b2fb42e22076b90755d6f3bd4fb/0_270_6409_3846/master/6409.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4f7719b1baf17570b6e0fe6b009620da","title":"how creating a sense of community can help your business thrive","story":"At a time when customer needs are changing rapidly, small businesses must adapt to stay relevant. Many are adopting a community ethos to gain the edge while giving something backAnimator Joanna Susskind opened Glasgow-based design studio Toad’s Caravan in 2010. While running a weekly drawing club on the side, she met dozens of creative freelance workers who were looking for somewhere to work other than their kitchen table. Seeing both a business and social opportunity, Susskind opened up Toad’s Caravan’s office space as a not-for-profit co-working place.Within a few months it was full, with Susskind attributing the project’s success to its collaborative ethos, in which members often share projects, building mini, one-off collectives to tackle larger projects they might not be able to handle alone. “The studio is a great place for connecting with like-minded professionals within our community. It provides a solid base for me to work from, but it runs almost like a cooperative,” she says. “We keep the membership fees low and flexible, so it appeals to everyone.”No matter the sector, businesses that engage with their community are able to build strong relationships with the people in their local area and a reputation for being a business that cares. For example, successful postmasters – the people who run Post Offices – offer a vibrant retail business that builds relationships with and provides a range of services to sole traders and small firms.“Research has shown that a Post Office has a positive impact in the local area, and the postmaster is central to that,” says Amanda Jones, retail director at Post Office. “The most successful ones partner their commercial expertise with a strong sense of social purpose, by fully integrating into their local community and actively engaging with the people. This empowers our postmasters to really understand the communities they serve and ensure their retail offering meets their customers’ everyday and changing needs. I know one postmaster who runs bingo evenings in his local community, and another who, every year, invites someone who he knows would otherwise be alone, to share Christmas dinner with his family.”In 2017, Sean Hudson became postmaster at West Boldon Post Office, a village midway between Sunderland and Newcastle. He and his wife, Katie Hudson, had lived in the village for 20 years and recognised that the Post Office shop could become a hub for the community.Sean, originally a lawyer by profession, says: “The small village communities in that part of Yorkshire were exactly how we remembered them from years ago. We thought it would be great if our own Post Office could go back to being the heart of this village, as it was when we first came here.”In truth, Sean had been growing tired of the law, so he reduced his partnership when the Post Office came on the market and, with Katie, set out to make it the centre of the community once again.The village population is small but erse – a mix of young and old, and people from different career and social backgrounds. This shaped the Hudsons’ strategy to build a business that would appeal to them all. Through social media and Facebook, they have raised their business profile and engaged with the local community in an online space that complements their physical retail presence.Sean says: “We knew that a social media presence was important and also that there were people who don’t use social media, but had family members and carers who do. That has been a very strong link for us. We are already seeing good growth in the retail side, and customers have started to return to the Post Office counter.”One of their community-focused services is “ring and bring”. “If we stock it and you ring us, we’ll bring it to you at no extra cost,” says Sean. “It’s a bit like ‘click and collect’ but more personal. For tech-savvy people, click and collect is an easy concept, but for a lot of people it isn’t. Ring and bring has become very popular with many of our older, less mobile retail customers.”And unlike typical supermarket home delivery services, there’s more to it than simply running into the customer’s home with the groceries and running out. “We always spend a few minutes chatting with them to find out how they are,” he says.The couple are active in many aspects of community life, including helping to set up a volunteer library service following the closure of the local library, and they are members of the residents’ association.Sean describes his role as a challenge and a complete change that is both daunting and exhilarating. He says: “If someone had told me I’d be happier working seven days a week in my current role, than working five days a week in my old job, I wouldn’t have believed them, but it is actually true.”As well as that innate ability to show empathy and engage with people of all ages and all social backgrounds, anyone looking to start a company with a strong community culture also needs a flair for business.Jones says: “They need to develop a retail offering that is relevant to their audience. They must be able to think creatively and, above all, be adaptable.” This goes for postmasters, too. “Like all retail businesses, Post Office has to innovate to maintain its relevance to changing customer needs, so our postmasters must keep pace with evolving digital services and put forward their own ideas on new propositions and ways of working to further improve customer service and experience. That comes with really engaging with, knowing and understanding your local community.”If you’re a community minded entrepreneur, please visit runapostoffice for more information."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3799346.1550662004!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"trials of modern parenting how pushy should mums and dads be","story":"\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t                                                            Daimee Ng (14) was just three years old when her mother  enrolled her in structured violin classes.  ‘I don’t feel I’ve made sacrifices as it has brought me so much pleasure,’ she says.

Then, when he didn’t like my decisions, he had a go. It got heated and he shoved me. . . He did apologise but we had to talk to him about his expectations and his behaviour.”Hothousing is a term commonly used to describe educating a child to a high level at an earlier than usual age, or where a parent excessively manages scheduled activities for their child – whether music, sport, drama, extra tuition or something else entirely – leaving little time for free play.It’s a contentious word that can carry a sting of criticism and disdain. But, in a world where “playdates” are organised and children’s fun is increasingly structured, is there a risk that some parents can be too pushy?Of course some children need a push to get off the couch and challenge themselves, and Kumon is just one of the ways parents seek to give their offspring a leg-up.In Ireland, more than 2,500 children take part in the Kumon supplementary education programme, which involves filling out daily numeracy and literacy worksheets. It’s a popular option, having expanded from just over a dozen Irish franchises in 2012 to 23 in 2019.The company was founded in the late 1950s in Japan and, today, it says that more than four million students in almost 50 countries take part in its programmes. A significant proportion of the children taking part in Ireland hail from families with non-Irish backgrounds including Pakistan, India and China.Kumon says its programmes “empower students to learn for themselves and build independent learning skills” and that it is useful for both academically gifted and academically struggling children.Kumon really, really does not like the word “hothousing”. The  asked for details of how their programme works, what sort of commitment it involves, whether it was affordable to families on lower incomes and if they could refer us to any studies which showed its benefits.We don’t use the word “hothousing”, a UK-based spokesperson for Kumon said. After this, they did not provide any further response to any queries.Peer-reviewed studies of Kumon present somewhat mixed research findings, with some investigators suggesting it is of limited value, particularly for younger children, and others saying that it can help improve a child’s learning outcomes.Parents – particularly mothers – always face judgement: get your child involved and you’re pushy let them make all their own decisions and you’re lazy.“Is it ‘hothousing’ or is it responding to the needs of a gifted child?” asks Dr Jennifer Symonds, an assistant professor at UCD’s school of education.“Many gifted children flourish when they receive additional creative or academic stimulation through activities that are not available in the school day.“It also depends on the child’s age when the high expectations begin and whether they see themselves as having a voice and agency in steering their own development, or whether they should accept instruction from a parent or school without question.“Before the age of about eight or nine, a child may have a negative emotional reaction but feel unable to express it.”Dr Mark Smyth, a clinical psychologist and president-elect of the Psychological Society of Ireland, agrees that a child-led approach is key.“I have met more young people whose intellectual ability has not had the full range of enrichment opportunities. But there are definitely parents with unrealistically high expectations and who want more than the child is ready for.“You want your child involved in extracurricular activities: what that is should be up to them although they do need to stick with it.”If the weekend has six different activities, this can be equally stressful for parent and child, says Symonds.“And if they’re pushed into it, they may not want to do it. There is pressure on parents to give their children the best opportunities but, in early childhood, play is the most important thing they can be doing.“Play is how children learn fundamental social and emotional competencies. If they’ve no time for unstructured play, they miss out.”While most extra-curricular activities cost money, she says it’s not always the case: visiting a gallery, for example, may be more valuable than extra tuition.Smyth, meanwhile, says parents are often unfairly judged or labelled, when it is the child who is pushing themselves.“My own seven year old really likes extra workbooks. What matters is that the activity is child-led and they find it enjoyable. As long as they’re still mixing with friends and being active, that’s okay,” he says.“The pushy parent is increasingly rare: today, parents are very tuned into mental health concerns and don’t want to overburden their children.”Daimee Ng’s story‘People assume I’m a “tiger mother” because my daughter is doing so well’Daimee Ng was just three when her mother Amy enrolled her in structured violin classes.Now 14, Daimee is a second-year scholarship student in The High School in Rathgar, has made the finals in prestigious international competitions and is looking toward a career as a musician. Has it been worth it, or is it too much pressure?“None of us played an instrument but, as a little baby, Daimee was clearly interested in music,” says Amy.“I had trouble finding a teacher who would take a three year old for instrumental lessons. I found Maria and she did an assessment. I thought we’d do a term and see how it went.Maria Kelemen, founder of Young European Strings, a busy and successful music school in Templeogue, says assessments depend on the child.“We don’t assume the child should play any particular instrument: it’s important to respect the child’s choice. My assessments are all age-appropriate and they help me understand the child and what they want,” says Kineman.Daimee’s earliest memories involve being interested in music, especially strings.“I love performing, being on stage and playing with other people. I don’t feel I’ve made sacrifices as it has brought me so much pleasure. I set aside time for the violin every day and, when it’s over, I focus on something else,” she says.“When I was in primary school, I would easily devote at least an hour a day. It has taken a bit more juggling with the time demands of secondary, but I don’t have a lot of social media apps and I leave my phone downstairs while I work.”Her mother Amy, who was 10 when her family moved here from Hong Kong, says people assume she is a “tiger mother” because of her Chinese heritage and because her daughter is doing so well.“Nobody mentions a ‘tiger dad’. In this case, Daimee is the one pushing me. She doesn’t like to be idle and wants to be challenged with more work and difficult pieces. I don’t push her into competition.“There is some juggling to be done, but practice and work can be built around parties and playdates. It’s about timing, not sacrifice.”"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Supreme Court judges find in favour of former minister for justice but do not criticise barristerPhilomena Canning suing over suspension of indemnity insurance in 2014Vote will take place on May 24th, the same date as the local and European electionsCounsel for film makers claim redactions are part of efforts to preserve secrecyTributes paid to \u0026lsquofriend and long-term motorcycle enthusiast\u0026rsquo after untimely deathPressing need to understand root causes of \u0026lsquohorrendous cases\u0026rsquo, says St Patrick\u0026rsquos chiefChildren\u0026rsquos Rights Alliance expresses concern over impact of delays on young peopleClosing arguments on behalf of businessman to begin at High Court laterHealth and Safety Authority, garda\u0026iacute open investigations after victim is fatally struck by loaderCavan-based GP denies alleged failings while attending elderly patient in April 2017Postmortem on 57-year-old is expected to take place at Cork University HospitalEdgar Morgenroth says LPT failed to allow for change and has stored up a large increaseSocial networking giant says it will remove content that promotes the phenomenonOne passenger remains in serious condition in Dublin\u0026rsquos Mater hospitalControl practices criticised by health watchdog after CPE outbreak hits 17 patientsCatherine Murphy and R\u0026oacuteis\u0026iacuten Shortall concerned at allegation of backstory inaccuracyDriver, aged in his 60s, treated for non-life threatening injuries in hospitalAn investigation into the cause of the incident is ongoing, Irish Water saysCouncil has identified four industrial areas it sees as \u0027new key growth areas of the city\u0027"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3806658.1551165461!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"labour to back second brexit vote in effort to avoid no deal outcome","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBritish Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn: “We are committed to also putting forward or supporting an amendment in favour of a public vote to prevent a damaging Tory Brexit being forced on the country.” Photograph:  Aaron ChownPAIn a major policy shift on Monday night, the British Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said his party would back a second referendum on Brexit. Mr Corbyn told Labour MPs that the party would also back a vote this week in the House of Commons that, if passed, would compel Theresa May to delay Brexit rather than leave the EU without a deal on March 29th.“One way or another, we will do everything in our power to prevent no deal and oppose a damaging Tory Brexit based on Theresa May’s overwhelmingly rejected deal. That’s why, in line with our conference policy, we are committed to also putting forward or supporting an amendment in favour of a public vote to prevent a damaging Tory Brexit being forced on the country,” he said.Mrs May will make a statement on Brexit to MPs on Tuesday ahead of votes on a series of amendments on Wednesday, including one tabled by Labour MP Peter Kyle that would put the prime minister’s deal to a referendum. Labour will table an amendment outlining its own Brexit plan, including a permanent customs union but it is almost certain to be defeated.“If parliament rejects our plan, then Labour will deliver on the promise we made at our annual conference and support a public vote,” shadow Brexit secretary Keir Starmer said.Possible delayLabour’s move comes as EU leaders, meeting in Egypt for an EU-Arab League summit, raised the possibility of a delay to Brexit by extending the article 50 process. Mrs May did not rule out a delay to Brexit but said it would not “deliver a decision in parliament”.Meanwhile, The  understands the British government is likely to reintroduce direct rule to Northern Ireland if there is a no-deal Brexit.The move is being planned principally because of a large amount of new legislation, regulations and government orders which will become necessary to deal with a no-deal Brexit, according to British and Irish sources who have been briefed on the plans.There is legal uncertainty surrounding the powers of civil servants in the North in the absence of the powersharing institutions, and British ministers and officials have been advised the legal changes necessary after Brexit may need to be done from London, necessitating a period of direct rule.Several Irish Government sources confirmed Dublin is aware of the plans, which have been suggested as an administrative necessity rather than a political move.Restoring Stormont The Department of Foreign Affairs did not comment directly on the prospect of direct rule but said the Assembly and Executive were “urgently needed in order to represent the interests of all of the people of Northern Ireland and address issues of concern”. The Northern Ireland Office said secretary of state Karen Bradley is “focused on working closely with the political parties and restoring the devolved institutions at Stormont”.Unionist parties have repeatedly urged the British government to introduce direct rule, but the move has been strongly resisted by the Irish Government. Sinn Féin and the SDLP also oppose the move.The British government has resisted the DUP’s request for the reintroduction of direct rule, though it was forced to introduce a “direct rule budget” for the North last year in Westminster to provide a legal basis for the continued spending on public services in the North under the direction of civil servants.But there are doubts about the legal basis for the extent of civil servants’ powers. A court judgment last year which found that Northern Ireland civil servants did not have the legal authority to sanction a controversial waste incinerator plant in Co Antrim has prompted caution by officials about the extent of their powers in the absence of the Assembly and the powersharing executive.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Photograph: Getty ImagesIndia claimed its fighter aircraft had successfully launched strikes against a Pakistan-based militant training camp in the disputed Himalayan Kashmir region before dawn on Tuesday, considerably escalating tension between the nuclear-armed neighbours. It is the first such cross-border air attack by India since the two sides fought the third of their four wars in 1971 since after independence in 1947. The attack has also led to the two sides putting their militaries on “high alert” in anticipation of further escalation of hostilities by either side. Official sources said the attack by 10-12 French Mirage 2000 fighters followed the February 14th suicide car bomb attack that killed some 44 paramilitaries in Indian-administered Kashmir, for which the Pakistan-based Islamist Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) group claimed responsibility. India also blamed the Pakistan military and its Inter Services Intelligence Directorate for supporting the JeM and for planning the attack on the Indian paramilitaries, for which prime minister Narendra Modi vowed punitive action against Islamabad. Indian foreign secretary Vijay Gokhale told reporters that the “pre-emptive air strike” across the line of control (LoC) that ides Kashmir between the neighbours, was launched against Pakistan following credible intelligence that the JeM was planning another suicide terror attack in the country. He claimed that in the intelligence-led operation, India struck the biggest JeM camp in Balakot located in thick forest on a hilltop eliminating a “very large number of terrorists, trainers, senior commanders and jihadis who were being trained for suicide action”, but did not elaborate. Other than the attack on its paramilitaries earlier this month, India blames the JeM for the strikes on its parliament in 2001 that led to the two sides mobilising their armies for over 10 months. The Islamist group was also blamed for attacking an army cantonment in Kashmir in 2016 in which 20 soldiers died. Pakistani responseMilitary sources said the Mirage 2000H aircraft, whichwere escorted by one airborne early warning and control (AEW\u0026ampC) aircraft and an Ilyushin-78 mid-air tanker, employed 1,000kg precision guided munitions (PGMs) in their strike. Pakistani military confirmed the Indian air force intrusion , but claimed it had successfully thwarted it by scrambling its own fighters.“Indian aircraft intruded from Muzaffarabad sector,” Pakistani military spokesman Maj Gen Asif Ghafoor tweeted, referring to the capital of Pakistan-administered Kashmir. He said the “timely and effective response from the Pakistan Air Force led to the Indian aircraft releasing their payload in haste while escaping”. No casualties or damage were reported, he added. The Indian air force strike across the LoC in Kashmir follows recent warnings to India by Pakistan’s prime minister Imran Khan against initiating any “military adventurism”.“It easy to start a war, but difficult to control it,” Mr Khan said in response to Mr Modi declaring that India would inflict a “jaw breaking” response from Islamabad for the paramilitary killings. “We will not think of retaliating. We will retaliate,” Mr Khan stated. The air strike, which took some 10 days of planning by the Indian air force and other security officials is expected to boost Mr Modi’s image in India’s upcoming electionls, scheduled to be completed before end-May, provided there is no Pakistani riposte. At an election rally on Tuesday afternoon Mr Modi declared that India was in “safe hands”. “The attack is bound to show up Modi as a decisive leader who will not compromise with India’s national security,” said military analyst, retired lieutenant general Vijay Kapur. It would stand him in good stead politically, he added.India and Pakistan have have fought two of their three wars since independence over Kashmir. And in 1999, soon after both became nuclear weapon states, their two armies clashed in Kashmir’s Himalayan Kargil region for 11-weeks resulting in 1,200 soldiers dying on both sides. The conflict came close to a nuclear exchange that was prevented by US intervention.

Photograph: Getty ImagesBritish prime minister Theresa May has promised to give MPs a vote on extending Brexit negotiations or withdrawing from the EU without a deal if her plan is rejected next month.In a dramatic statement to the House of Commons, Mrs May confirmed that she will put her withdrawal agreement — including whatever additional assurances she has secured from Brussels — to a “meaningful vote” by March 12th.If that fails, MPs will be offered two separate votes the following day — one on a no-deal Brexit, and the other on requesting an extension to the two-year Article 50 negotiation process to delay EU withdrawal beyond March 29th.“The United Kingdom will only leave without a deal on 29 March if there is explicit consent in the House for that outcome,” Mrs May told parliament. “An extension cannot take no deal off the table.”The sequence of votes will be proposed in an amendable motion tabled by the prime minister for debate and vote in the Commons on Wednesday.UproarTo uproar in the Commons, Mrs May told MPs: “They are commitments I am making as prime minister and I will stick by them, as I have previous commitments to make statements and table amendable motions by specific dates.”DUP MP Jeffrey Donaldson said he believes that a deal will be reached between the UK and the EU at the last minute. “My experience of negotiations is that these things often go down to the wire,” he told RTE’s News at One. “I believe there’s still time to secure changes to enable parliament to sign the withdrawal agreement.”Mrs May said the Government was publishing a paper assessing its readiness for a no-deal Brexit and the “very serious challenges” it would pose.“I believe that if we have to, we will ultimately make a success of a no-deal,” she said.“But this paper provides an honest assessment of the very serious challenges it would bring in the short-term and further reinforces why the best way for this House to honour the referendum result is to leave with a deal.”Mrs May said the government must honour Britain’s decision to leave the European Union. “This House voted to trigger Article 50 and this House has a responsibility to deliver on the result – the very credibility of our democracy is at stake,” she told parliament.Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said he had “lost count” of the prime minister’s explanations for her “grotesquely reckless” delays.He said: “I have lost count of the number of times the Prime Minister has come to this House to explain a further delay.“They say history repeats itself, first time as tragedy, second time as farce, by the umpteenth time it can only be described as grotesquely reckless.”Mr Corbyn said Mrs May was promising to achieve “something she knows is not achievable” and her “obstinacy” was the block to a resolution.‘Unilateral exit’“Will she be straight with people?” he said. “The withdrawal agreement is not being reopened, there is no attempt to get a unilateral exit on the backstop or a time limit.“She has so far promised a vote on her deal in December, January, February and now March, and only managed to put a vote once — in January when it was comprehensively defeated.“The prime minister continues to say it is her deal or no deal, but this House has decisively rejected her deal and has clearly rejected no deal.“It is the prime minister’s obstinacy that is blocking a resolution.”A delay would increase the chances of a reversal of Brexit, especially as the Labour Party is tilting towards supporting another referendum, though much would depend on the extent of the delay.While businesses have increasingly warned of the risk of a chaotic EU exit and its impact on trade and investment, any delay would be anathema to pro-Brexit members of May’s Conservative Party.Both of Britain’s main parties are under intense pressure to change course on Brexit, though both are officially committed to implementing the result of the referendum.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

One local police official who declined to be named told the  that the strike had taken place at Jabba, near Balakot, inside the Pakistani province of  Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.Photograph released by Pakistan military said to show site where Indian bombs fell in KashmirVillagers in the area told Reuters they heard four loud bangs in the early hours of Tuesday but reported only one person wounded by shrapnel.We saw trees fallen down and one house damaged and four craters where the bombs had fallen, said Mohammad Ajmal, a 25-year-old who visited the site.Pakistan said the Indian claims were self-serving, reckless and fictitious and released photographs of a cratered wooded hillside where it said the payload had landed.Indians set off fireworks to celebrate the strike“Facing timely and effective response from Pakistan Air Force released payload in haste while escaping which fell near Balakot. No casualties or damage, said Maj Gen Ghafoor.He went on: “Under forced hasty withdrawal aircrafts released payload which had free fall in open area. No infrastructure got hit, no casualties.”Indian military sources said 12 French Mirage 2000 fighters crossed the line of control on their raid into Pakistani territory at around 3.15am local time.  Accompanied by an IAF airborne early warning and control aircraft and a mid-air re-fueller, the Mirages reportedly employed 1000kg precision guided munitions or PGMs to hit their targets in a mission that lasted a few minutes.   Pakistan\u0027s government said it would hold an emergency meeting to discuss the incident and in the past has said it would retaliate against any aggression from Delhi.Tensions between the neighbours have been raised since at least 40 Indian paramilitary police were killed in a suicide bombing on their convoy near Pulwama in Indian-controlled Kashmir earlier this month.Narendra Modi faces a general election this spring and has come under intense domestic pressure to respond to an attack he says was carried out by the Pakistan-based militant group Jaish-e-Mohammad.Both sides claim Kashmir, which is ided between the neighbours by a heavily militarised line of control. Rivalry over the region has led to two of their three wars.Prakash Javadekar, India\u0027s human resource development minister, said: This was a necessary step for the defence of the country, and Prime Minister Narendra Modi had given the armed forces a free hand.

Britain is the fattest nation in Western Europe, with rates of obesity rising even faster than those in the United States.Two in three adults are overweight or obese.Experts said many cases of Type 2 diabetes could be prevented or delayed by healthy eating, being more active, and losing weight if overweight.Chris Askew, chief executive of Diabetes UK, said: “Millions of Type 2 diabetes cases could be prevented if we help people understand their risk and how to reduce it. Even though the older people get the more likely they are to have Type 2 diabetes, it is never too early to know your risk so that you can make changes to prevent or delay it.”The charity is urging those aged 40 or over to have a free NHS health check offered by GPs.It also said their own Know Your Risk online tool could help people to find out their risk of developing Type 2 diabetes.Mr Agnew said: “The signs of Type 2 diabetes are often not obvious, that’s why spotting them early can be life-changing. Early diagnosis means that fewer people will experience diabetes-related complications such as sight loss, amputation, kidney failure, stroke and heart disease, because they could seek support to manage their condition effectively as soon as possible.“We urge people over 40 to get an NHS Health Check and we advise everyone to find out their risk of developing Type 2 diabetes with the Know your Risk tool.”Experts said symptoms of diabetes - which include going to the toilet a lot, being really thirsty, feeling more tired than usual and losing weight without trying -  can be easy to miss especially in the early stages.The condition can go undetected for many years, with one in three cases not diagnosed until they have developed complications with their eyes, feet, kidneys or nerves.Under NHS plans, 5,000 people will be put on 800 calorie-a-day liquid diets in a bid to reverse the disease.Tam Fry, from the National Obesity Forum, said children should be warned in school about the risks of diabetes, with diagnosis now happening at an ever-younger age.He said: “Telling them that they could lose a leg or go blind from the disease if they fail to look after their health might seem extreme but it\u0027s the truth.”Professor Jonathan Valabhji, national clinical director for diabetes and obesity said: “The growing obesity epidemic is dangerous for the nation’s overall health and worrying for the NHS, fuelling growing numbers of people with Type 2 diabetes as well as costing taxpayers billions every year.This is exactly why the NHS Long Term Plan sets out radical action to tackle this growing problem by expanding the NHS Type 2 Diabetes Prevention Programme so that 200,000 people every year can benefit and introducing a pilot of very low calorie diets that have been shown to put Type 2 diabetes into remission in a significant proportion of those that already have it, he said.Caroline Cerny, from the Obesity Health Alliance said: “This dramatic increase in the number of people living with Type-2 diabetes is likely to spiral further as obesity rates continue to rise. The good news is that we can do something to halt this epidemic.Strong measures from Government and meaningful action from the food and retail industry could transform our environment into one that encourages healthy options. This is why we need the Government to fully implement measures in its childhood obesity plan including restricting unhealthy food promotions and a 9pm watershed on junk food advertising.”Brexit latest news: Theresa May says MPs will be given choice of no deal or delay if her deal fallsSwallows return early as Britain basks in summer-like temperaturesWealth gap at Scotland\u0026#39s universities widens with little progress in closing gulf in school attainmentLondon theatre: the best plays and shows on nowNurse paid double her NHS wages for a year by mistake spared jail after admitting theftRotterdam seizes 90,000 bottles of Russian vodka believed to be intended for Kim Jong-unConviction of Cardinal George Pell for sex abuse contrasts with woolly words and lack of action from the VaticanEaster 2019: Forbidden eggs, Eostre and how the date is decidedAsh Wednesday and Lent 2019: Why we use 40 days to test our willpowerComment: I wish the Labour breakaways the best of luck, but why did these Tory nonentities join them?Conflict in South Sudan linked to rise in number of young girls forced to marryWHO calls for more money in fight against Ebola as violence hampers response once againBullying on the rise in NHS, with one in four staff falling victim to abuse \u0026#39Mounting pressure by Iran\u0026#39s hardliners\u0026#39 behind foreign minister Zarif\u0026#39s resignationCriminal investigation launched into circumstances which led to soldier\u0026#39s death at Deepcut BarracksWatch as British Airways plane rocked from side to side in terrifying crosswindsCorbyn and Labour are tanking in the polls.

The group is changing its aerial emergency services businesses to comply with European operating requirements, and said ongoing additional costs relating to the new structures will be around £10m per year. The firm also said underlying earnings expectations for 2019 remain unchanged, with slightly higher margins offsetting slower revenue growth.Total revenue is expected to drop to £5.2bn, compared with £5.36bn in the previous year, due to lower activity in its rail business.Chief executive Archie Bethel said: “We continue to make good operational and strategic progress and won some great new contracts in the period including an expansion into the aerial emergency services market in North America, a significant win in Australia and securing the next 10 years for our rail business.Created with Sketch.

The company’s finance director John Bason said there was a “real possibility of food shortages” in the event of a cliff-edge Brexit.“A Brexit where there is no agreement would be very disruptive and people need to understand that and the effect it would have on food,” Mr Bason told Bloomberg. His remarks followed ABF’s latest trading update in which the company reported that Primark sales were set to rise by 4 per cent in the first half of the year. The group is expecting to record growth across all businesses, including brands such as Ryvita, Dorset Cereals and Ovaltine, except its sugar arm, which has been in decline for years.

Critics of the streaming service have\u0026nbspno cause to feel schadenfreude at it missing out on the biggest prize.\u0026nbspThose opponents\u0026nbsphave stirred a heated debate about the film’s status,\u0026nbspmost recently in the context of\u0026nbspthe Baftas where Roma did (deservedly) win best film.\u0026nbspThe boss of Vue Cinemas, one of the UK’s biggest chains, wrote a furious open letter to Bafta chief Amanda Berry in response to Roma’s presence in the lists, threatening to pull the firm’s support from the annual shindig.Created with Sketch.Biggest talking points of the Oscars Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.110 Lafy Gaga and Bradley Cooper perform \u0027Shallow\u0027A Star is Born actors Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper performed their Oscar-winning song “Shallow” at this year’s Oscars ceremony and set social media alight.Best Actor winner Rami Malek caused concern when he fell off stage after accepting his award.

The latter arrived with the announcement that Green Book had beaten out the category’s frontrunner, Roma, to Best Picture. It was a dismal reminder that progress is a slow, tedious process.

Given the adorable viral video he posted in reaction to the nod, the countless selfies with every Hollywood actor he comes across, and the interviews in which he’s grinning ear to ear, it’s clear Grant decided to grab the opportunity with both hands.Tim Richards derisively described the film as a “made for TV movie” on account of its limited cinematic release.\u0026nbspHe said that it was still unclear\u0026nbspwhether Roma was screened on more than 13 UK screens at the art house Curzon Cinema chain, “representing less than 0.5 per cent of the cinema market” and for a week at the Filmhouse in Edinburgh.Richards went on to point to Bafta’s rules stating that: “Films should not be screened purely to qualify them for these awards, and the film committee may not accept entries if they do not deem the theatrical release to be meaningful.Bafta decided Curzon’s screens made it meaningful enough.\u0026nbspI was raised by domestic servants like the one in RomaThe controversy is far from unique to the UK. AMC Cinemas and Regal, two major US chains, refused to play Roma as part of their best picture Oscar showcases and didn’t participate in its very limited US theatrical run because of the short window available before Netflix subscribers got their hands on it. Even the offer of cheap rentals couldn’t entice them.\u0026nbspMexico, the film’s home market, was not immune either. Cuarón went so far as to tweet his disappointment that it was showing on more screens in Poland than his native land as a result of big chains saying no.\u0026nbspBut are cinema operators right to draw a global line in the sand over the “theatrical window”\u0026nbspthat Richards says “has successfully served all sides of our industry for many decades and is one of the core differentiators that makes cinema unique”?How about asking yourself this: how many subtitled films\u0026nbspwould you normally expect to see at your local multiplex, regardless of how good they are?\u0026nbspAlfonso Cuaron wins Best Director for RomaArthouse cinemas are mostly where they live. Roma is different chiefly because it has an A-list Hollywood director and a distributor with enough cash to give\u0026nbspit an Oscar campaign.Awards films don’t always get much of a run even when\u0026nbspthey’re in English. My local multiplex, for example, supported If Beale Street Could Talk\u0026nbspwith just one of its 14 screens for barely a week.\u0026nbspThe fact that I was able to catch it was greatly assisted by my having booked time off during that week.\u0026nbspRoma, by contrast, didn’t involve my jumping through any of the hoops families usually have to jump through when the parents want to see the sort of film they can’t take the kids along to. It was there, at my convenience, and it has remained in my head ever since.\u0026nbspIt’s the sort of film that does that.At the core of this controversy is a clash of business models, with Netflix’s desire to give its subscribers what it has paid for as soon as possible, clashing with the big chains’ demand for their cherished period of exclusivity.\u0026nbspBaftasAs ever, in these situations, the customer ultimately loses. I would still like to see Roma on a large screen and I would make the effort to do so, even after viewing it at home. The experience would be worth it.\u0026nbspRichards may be right to take shots at Netflix for scarcely making previous releases available for any sort of cinematic run at all, regardless of the window.\u0026nbspBut as regards the “window”\u0026nbspas a concept and the terms on which Roma was released, he’s on shakier ground. Note how he says the window has “successfully served all sides of our industry for many decades”. The problem is with that “many decades”. Things change.\u0026nbspSteven Spielberg takes thinly veiled shots at streaming servicesDespite people repeatedly calling its doom, the silver screen has adapted to a lot of changes, a bewildering array of them. It has weathered the emergence of TV, the widespread purchase\u0026nbspof home entertainment systems, video gaming, the internet, the explosion of choice in people’s leisure options.\u0026nbspIt can survive Netflix too, and cinemas’ rising global gross revenues\u0026nbspsuggests they are doing just that. I’d be willing to put money on their surviving shorter exclusivity windows for Netflix or for other films too.\u0026nbspThe latter’s customers, as a rule, tend to go to the cinema more than non-subscribers do anyway. They like movies. If they’re like me, they’ll often watch them more than once. But the first preference will always be to see them on the big screen, and it doesn’t matter whether it’s Roma or Captain Marvel, about which my daughter and I are positively breathless in anticipation.\u0026nbspThe cinema offers an experience that Netflix cannot, and that is worth paying extra for.\u0026nbspThe disruptive threat Netflix poses is being felt much more by traditional television operators than it is by movie theatre chains.\u0026nbspNetflix needs to change its tune too though. It should be more open to giving more of its properties a cinematic release as Amazon, which admittedly has a rather different business model, has done very successfully.\u0026nbspSurely the various sides in this debate ought to be be capable of reaching a compromise? It should to be in their interests to do so. It would certainly be in the interests of movie lovers and movie goers and, well, art.\u0026nbspWe’ll tell you what’s true.

The group is changing its aerial emergency services businesses to comply with European operating requirements, and said ongoing additional costs relating to the new structures will be around £10m per year. The firm also said underlying earnings expectations for 2019 remain unchanged, with slightly higher margins offsetting slower revenue growth.Total revenue is expected to drop to £5.2bn, compared with £5.36bn in the previous year, due to lower activity in its rail business.Chief executive Archie Bethel said: “We continue to make good operational and strategic progress and won some great new contracts in the period including an expansion into the aerial emergency services market in North America, a significant win in Australia and securing the next 10 years for our rail business.Created with Sketch.

The company’s finance director John Bason said there was a “real possibility of food shortages” in the event of a cliff-edge Brexit.“A Brexit where there is no agreement would be very disruptive and people need to understand that and the effect it would have on food,” Mr Bason told Bloomberg. His remarks followed ABF’s latest trading update in which the company reported that Primark sales were set to rise by 4 per cent in the first half of the year. The group is expecting to record growth across all businesses, including brands such as Ryvita, Dorset Cereals and Ovaltine, except its sugar arm, which has been in decline for years.

It’s enough to know Ocado has the interest of one of the biggest retail names in the UK, following the devastating fire at the Andover warehouse earlier this month.The accident sent shockwaves through the share price, because Ocado’s future rests on its ability to sign deals to build robotic warehouses for other retailers. Ocado’s current share price is still lofty, and that means investors are expecting big things, considering the group is yet to make a meaningful profit – hopes are pinned on some impressive revenue growth in the medium term.So to hear M\u0026ampS is sniffing around is welcome news indeed, and if an agreement is announced, it would be a real boost for the group. Ocado still offers an exciting and unique product, which should mean the future’s bright.”We’ll tell you what’s true. You can form your own view.At The Independent, no one tells us what to write.

But scientists didn\u0027t know that they themselves were still wrapped in the edges of the\u0026nbspgeocorona.The extra source of hydrogen laying far out from Earth is not enough to allow space exploration, or to support any kind of human life. Down here, it would be referred to as a vacuum.But fortunately those particles do not pose any threat for anyone interacting with them, such as future space travellers that hope to journey to orbit around the Moon.“There is also ultraviolet radiation associated to the geocorona, as the hydrogen atoms scatter sunlight in all directions, but the impact on astronauts in lunar orbit would be negligible compared to the main source of radiation -- the Sun,” says Jean-Loup Bertaux, co-author and former principal investigator of SWAN, the instrument that made the founding.But it could get in the way of future observations around the Moon, the researchers caution.“Space telescopes observing the sky in ultraviolet wavelengths to study the chemical composition of stars and galaxies would need to take this into account,” adds Jean-Loup.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Pay, holiday entitlement and benefits for teachers will remain unchanged.Mr Elliott said: “This is about moving away from a culture that has developed in the teaching profession of over burdening staff with excessively long hours.\u0026nbspThe benefit to the students is that they we will be able to recruit, train and most crucially retain the very best teachers which means better quality of teaching in the classroom.”It comes after experts\u0026nbspwarned this week that there was an urgent need to ensure there were enough teachers amid rising pupil numbers, a shortfall in trainees and more teachers quitting.Last month, the government published its Teacher Recruitment and Retention Strategy last month to reduce workload and encourage more teachers to stay in the profession.Additional reporting by SWNSWe’ll tell you what’s true.

The idea is to give people back control of their data and end the exploitation and monetisation of people\u0027s private lives by the likes of Facebook and Google.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialHTC describes its Exodus 1 as the first smartphone built for this new internet and it is the brainchild of Phil Chen, the appropriately-titled \u0027decentralized chief officer\u0027 of the Taiwanese firm.\u0026nbspWe\u0027re this far into the information age and there\u0027s barely any conversation about digital property, Chen tells\u0026nbspThe Independent.\u0026nbspAll of our private data – from credit history to search data – is handled by third parties. We don\u0027t own or control any of it. Instead, it is just seven companies in the world that control almost all of the data. They have become more powerful than governments.The way to get the power back, Chen says, is to introduce a paradigm shift to the big data business models of these large tech companies, from the apps we use, to the way we pay.\u0026nbspThese blockchain phones operate on the same underlying technology that supports bitcoin, so it is no surprise that cryptocurrencies form a key role in their operation.At MWC, HTC is also introducing a new range of decentralised apps – or\u0026nbspdApps\u0026nbsp– that do not share or send data back to a centralised company or server. Some apps even allow people to monetise their own data, by selling it for cryptocurrency.Payments can also go the other way, meaning users can make micropayments directly to websites and content creators without the need for transaction fees.\u0026nbspEven the phone\u0027s default browser, Opera, supports\u0026nbspsuch functionality, describing itself as the world\u0027s first crypto-ready browser.We are at the dawn of a new generation of the Web, one where new decentralized services will challenge the status quo, says Charles Hamel, head of crypto at Opera.\u0026nbspHTC and Opera have both made the bold decision to be the first to step up and enable this transformation.ethereum (HTC)Like other blockchain phones, such as the Sirin\u0026nbspFinney, the HTC Exodus 1 comes with an in-built cryptocurrency wallet that can store private keys for\u0026nbspbitcoin, ether and litecoin\u0026nbspoffline. By not being connected to the internet, this cold-storage wallet protects the funds from hacking, as well as a person\u0027s private data.Until now, the HTC Exodus has only been available to buy in cryptocurrency\u0026nbspbut from March people will be able to purchase it using traditional fiat currency, with the eventual hope that the phone and the decentralised web will make it into the mainstream.I don\u0027t like calling it a blockchain phone because it\u0027s not just for crypto geeks, Chen says. It\u0027s about the internet.Created with Sketch.Bitcoin\u0027s volatile history in pictures Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.18 Satoshi Nakamoto creates the first bitcoin block in 2009On 3 January, 2009, the genesis block of bitcoin appeared.

This represented a 1,300 per cent increase from its price at the start of the yearIt\u0027s been 10 years since the birth of bitcoin and blockchain technology but the industry is still very much in its infancy.Interest in cryptocurrency and blockchain has been in decline ever since bitcoin\u0027s dramatic price crash, which saw the cryptocurrency lose more than three quarters of its value in 2018.Bitcoin price predictions for 2019: From $0 to $36,000, experts weigh Online analytics show Google searches for both terms have been in free-fall during that time, and according to Gartner, the technology entered the so-called \u0027trough of disillusionment\u0027 phase in its 2018\u0026nbspHype Cycle for Emerging Technologies\u0026nbspreport.The leading market research firm says it may be another 10 years before it reaches the \u0027plateau of productivity\u0027 and begins to see widespread adoption.For this to happen, Chen says, it will likely involve the very tech giants that this technology poses a threat to. Their considerable reach means their adoption of such technology would automatically push it into the mainstream. Another scenario would be that continued data breaches propel\u0026nbspthe conversation of digital property into the spotlight.People are becoming more aware of their data and will realise this is part of the solution, he says. This could spread like wildfire. The tech giants may try to quell its spread, but ultimately they may have to choose between fuelling it or getting burnt and left behind.The HTC Exodus 1 and Sirin\u0026nbspFinney\u0026nbspmay be the first, but blockchain technology is already seeping into more mainstream devices. Earlier this month, Samsung announced its flagship Galaxy S10 range of smartphones, which came with a Blockchain Keystore.There are also rumours that Facebook is planning to launch its own cryptocurrency, which could facilitate payments across its range of messaging apps – from WhatsApp to Messenger. With close to 2 billion users worldwide, such a move could create a currency to rival the dominance of the\u0026nbspUS dollar almost overnight.In a recent interview with Harvard Law professor Jonathan Zittrain, Facebook boss Mark Zuckerberg explained how blockchain-based authentication could make the social network more secure. But he added: I\u0026nbsphaven\u0027t figured out a way to make this work out.With the technological and financial resources at his disposal, it may just be that Zuckerberg simply hasn\u0027t figured out a way to implement the technology in a way that Facebook can still claim ownership\u0026nbspto it.blockcain smartphones (HTC)The open, decentralised and borderless nature of blockchain\u0026nbspis the reason blockchain remains the only technology vertical not dominated by the incumbents of the industry – it is antithetical to their current business model. The likes of Amazon and Google are leading the way in everything from fintech\u0026nbspto artificial intelligence, as these are all technologies they can control and own.The two largest smartphone makers, Samsung and Huawei, both profit from personal data through their cloud storage businesses. It could therefore fall to Apple to create that spark.Tim Cook keeps talking about privacy but can he take the next step? I\u0027m hopeful and I would be their first cheerleader if they did, Chen says.\u0026nbspThis is a big, giant leap, but we are a David among Goliaths. It will take a giant company to start reversing this tide.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

As a new breed of smartphones, Huawei Mate X combines 5G, foldable screen, AI and an all-new mode of interfacing to provide consumers with an unprecedented user experience.The Huawei Mate X will be the first key for consumers to open the door to 5G smart living.The company confirmed the new device would cost 2,299 Euro - higher than Samsung\u0027s Galaxy Fold, which has been given a price tag of 1,980 dollars.The Chinese firm\u0027s presence in the 5G infrastructure market remains a geopolitical talking point, with the United States warning European countries it may find it difficult to work with anyone who choose to use Huawei products in their networks, after raising security concerns over the Chinese company.But Huawei appears to be ignoring these on-going issues as it continues to expand its phone business.Now the second largest smartphone maker in the world, it is also due to unveil a new range of flagship devices in Paris next month.In terms of its foldable device, The Mate X will also come with fingerprint sensor built into its power button as well as featuring a camera system engineered with German camera firm Leica.Additional reporting by agenciesBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

If we can do that, then the whole thing will take off and there will be thousands of companies doing creative things.”Blue Origin has already carried out several successful flights of its New Shepard reusable rocket and the company plans to use it to take people into space later this year.Despite similar ambitions by SpaceX and Virgin Galactic, Bezos insisted\u0026nbspat the New York event that it is not a race, stating, “We will fly when we’re ready.”He also stated that his goal for Blue Origin is different to that of Musk, who has consistently said that he wants to send people to live on Mars.Bezos has been reinvesting money he made at Amazon since he started his space exploration company Blue Origin more than a decade ago (Getty)Musk even predicted last year that there is a 70 per cent chance that he would go to Mars himself. Bezos\u0026nbspsaid he had a different long-term vision for humanity, which involves moving heavy industry and energy production into space in order to protect Earth.“My friends who want to move to Mars – I say, ‘do me a favour, go live on the top of Mount Everest for a year first, and see if you like it. Because it’s a garden paradise compared to Mars,” Bezos said.“We want to go to space to protect this planet. That’s why the company’s named Blue Origin – it’s the blue planet that’s where we’re from.”Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It’s enough to know Ocado has the interest of one of the biggest retail names in the UK, following the devastating fire at the Andover warehouse earlier this month.The accident sent shockwaves through the share price, because Ocado’s future rests on its ability to sign deals to build robotic warehouses for other retailers. Ocado’s current share price is still lofty, and that means investors are expecting big things, considering the group is yet to make a meaningful profit – hopes are pinned on some impressive revenue growth in the medium term.So to hear M\u0026ampS is sniffing around is welcome news indeed, and if an agreement is announced, it would be a real boost for the group. Ocado still offers an exciting and unique product, which should mean the future’s bright.”We’ll tell you what’s true. You can form your own view.At The Independent, no one tells us what to write.

The new project that has not only envisioned but created such a molecule.“Life detection is an increasingly important goal of NASA’s planetary science missions, and this new work will help us to develop effective instruments and experiments that will expand the scope of what we look for,” said Lori Glaze, acting director of NASA’s Planetary Science Division.European Space Agency announces name of brand new Mars roverThe new research saw scientists create a new kind of molecule system that functions like DNA, but has an important difference. Instead of the usual four ingredients, it contains eight.It has all of the four that are found in life on Earth:\u0026nbspadenine, cytosine, guanine, and thymine. But it has four extra, synthetic ones, that mimic the structures of the ingredients found in regular DNA.The researchers call the new creation hachimoji” DNA – hachi means eight in Japanese, and moji means letter. It functions the same as our DNA, meeting the same requirements that allow it to store and transmit information.That has meant that the kinds of molecules that might be storing information in life on alien worlds could be similarly different. It suggests that life could structure itself in different ways than it does on Earth, at the most fundamental level – meaning that environments Earth-bound life could never live in might be teeming with unimagined life forms.“Incorporating a broader understanding of what is possible in our instrument design and mission concepts will result in a more inclusive and, therefore, more effective search for life beyond Earth,” said Mary Voytek, senior scientist for Astrobiology at NASA Headquarters.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

They use futuristic motors to allow them to be precisely tightened up automatically, without any shoelaces or other input.All of that can be controlled by an app, which allows people to slip on the shoes and then let the motors do the work of tightening them up, in a way shoelaces would traditionally work. They use much the same technology that allowed Nike to recreate the self-lacing shoes from Back To The Future in a limited run.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialBut that feature has broken after the Android app stopped syncing with the sneakers.

Well, good things come to those who wait. The iconic 1461s from heritage Midlands brand Dr Martens are now also being made in a super shiny synthetic material that mimics patent leather, so that everybody – men included! – can bring a touch of rockstar to their footwear. The inner sole is worth paying that bit for – it’s air-cushioned and resistant to oil, meaning no slipping and blisters. We were relieved to find that these didn’t need to be broken in like other Docs do – they were comfy from the first day of wearing them and looked slick with trousersleggings or a grungy dress. Colour-wise, you can choose from black, the cherry red (seen here), silver chrome or rose gold chrome.Firstly, yes, these are Star Wars-themed trainers (think rubber Rebel Alliance badge, Star Wars logo and galactic silver colouring), so if you’re not a fan of the movie space saga, they might not be for you. If you or a friend are, however, they’ll make the perfect affordable footwear gift. They slip on and are fantastically comfortable from the off. The outer is made with linen and Pinatex (a fibre made from pineapple leaves), the lining is organic cotton canvas and the insole is made from cork and natural latex, which moulds to your natural foot shape. Islington-born brand Po-Zu (meaning to pause in Japanese) is not entirely vegan, but much of its offering is, and all shoes are ethically produced in Portuguese or Sri Lankan factories using sustainable materials. For the height of vegan sophistication, no-one does brogues better than Will’s Vegan Store in London. Made with a kind of Italian faux leather created from plants and organic bio oil, they are fully decked out with the traditional brogue trim. Our top colour pick is the tan – it shows up all that intricate stitching beautifully – but they come in black or dark brown too. The durable rubber soles offer strong grip, the comfy insoles are made with recycled rubber and there’s a small block heel for added suave. Sizing is regular though if you normally look for halves, go one up. The Vegan Society has given this entire range the green light, and Will’s is a carbon neutral company that only uses plastic-free packaging, making this the ultimate in ethical browsing.411 Merrell all out crush 2 gore-tex: £120, MerrellFor the more active vegans among you, trustworthy trainers are a must-buy. US brand Merrell often pops up as a go-to brand for its small but reliable range of versatile shoes and after trying a pair for ourselves, we can see why. This lightweight pair of colourful kicks are built from Gore-Tex, a synthetic material, which is breathable and waterproof so will protect your feet in all running conditions. The heel is lined with lycra to help prevent rubbing and the sole boasts an impressive grip, even through slippy mud. In fact, these were designed especially with Tough Mudder-type challenges in mind. Expect your arches to feel well-supported, with plenty of room for broader feet. They come in black too, but why go boring when you can go jazzy with these bright blue, pink and coral dazzlers? Half sizes are also available.What we love about Birks is that you’re offered the choice between regular width (on the wide side) and narrow width, meaning everyone can find a pair of sandals to live in next summer, regardless of the shape of their feet. These have criss-crossed straps that are more slender than the classic design you might be used to. They’re made from Birko-Flor – essentially PVC with a breathable fleece-like lining. Its look mimics leather’s two-tone effect and feels just as gentle on the skin while being easier to clean. It’s win-win. The footbed, meanwhile, is the German footwear giant’s standard cork with arch support, only it’s lined with microfibre, not suede. The sole is made from an elastic material with excellent cushioning. Our pick of the three colours is the cream (pair it with any summer dress imaginable), but we might have to splurge on the dark grey and rose too. Here’s hoping they offer a vegan version of the yellow ones soon.611 Collection \u0026amp Co porto black lace up brogues: £120, Collection \u0026amp CoFor something that bit edgier, check out the new, fully vegan, Bristol-based footwear brand Collection \u0026amp Co, who are doing all sorts of cool things with waste materials in an effort to be more sustainable. We fell in love with these lace-up brogues, which come in jet black or rusty orange. They’re made in small, ethically-run Portuguese factories from soft faux leather, with faux suede side panels to add textural interest to the design. They slip on and off and have padded insoles for extra comfort, while rubber soles will withstand a pounding of the streets on a shopping mission. The 4cm block heels add a glam bit of height, although shoe lovers with wider feet might want to go for a size up as these are a bit on the narrow side. Oh, and they’ve got Peta’s seal of approval, too.Go back to basics with some canvas shoes specially designed by minimalist British shoe company VivoBarefoot to mimic the sensation of being barefoot and free. These dotty delights are handmade in Ethiopia in partnership with social enterprise, Soul of Africa, which supports education projects for disadvantaged kids. Even the print – choose from black or natural – has been designed in collaboration with local painters. Canadian accessories brand Matt \u0026amp Nat totally shun all animal-derived materials, so you can shop conscience-free (sorry, reader’s bank balance). These 3-inch block heeled Chelsea boots caught our eye, and certainly do away with any preconceptions that vegan shoes can’t be ethical, comfortable and stylish. In fact, the company’s motto is live beautifully, in more ways than one. The Peta-approved Kalistas have a sophisticated pointed toe and are made from black imitation leather, which you’d never know wasn’t the real deal. They pull on easily thanks to a smart elasticated ankle panel and came up true to size, while the gum rubber sole is hard-wearing enough to see you through those long days dashing between meetings – and finally to the pub afterwards!Every woman needs a reliable pair of black stiletto heels, be it for work, play or both. These faux leather beauties from Brighton-based vegan footwear brand Beyond Skin were recommended to us by a vegan pal who was overjoyed to find some plastic-made shoes that didn’t rub and give her blisters (it doesn’t give as well as leather does, though). Handmade in Spain, they have pointed toes, a breathable faux leather lining made from recycled materials and a heel of roughly 9cm. Peta has given them the thumbs up, so you can strut down the corridor feeling ethically awesome. No wonder Oscar-winning actor Natalie Portman is one of many famous fans. Some sizes may be out of stock online but we’ve been assured that they’ll be back in shortly, with pre-orders sent out in early March – so don’t panic!M\u0026ampS deserves a shout-out as a high street store with a huge range of vegan shoes that aren’t just kind to animals, but well-made and chic too. We were drawn to these metal trim loafers, which come in cheery cherry red or classic black and offer women with broader feet a wide fit option. The man-made material mimics suede (so be careful in rainy weather) and has an elegant check lining. They’re an absolute steal at just £25 a pair, and so comfy you’ll forget to take them off when you get home from a long day’s slog. The only downside is that there are no half sizes – if in doubt size up and grab some insoles.Roll back to the Seventies with these laid-back corduroy kicks from Californian footwear favourite Toms. Though not a vegan brand per se, the company offers an extensive range of shoes that are. These sneakers, inspired by the Sunshine State’s seaside towns, shot straight to the top of our must have list as they tick our three boxes: ethical, comfortable and cool. They’re also not like any shoes we’ve spotted elsewhere, so expect compliments from admiring strangers on the street. Though blissfully lightweight to wear with a cushioned insole, they’re also sturdy thanks to a rubber sole. Our faves are the turquoise, but the spicy red ones are hot too. Catch ‘em while they’re 40 per cent off in the sale and you could even justify buying both, especially as for every pair sold, Toms gives another to an underprivileged child. Go for your usual size.Have you lusted after this classic three-eye shoe with its trademark yellow stitching for years while bemoaning its lack of vegan credentials?

Downloading and applying that caused the Android app to break.The shoes do have manual controls, meaning that people can lean down and tie them up. But a large part of the functionality is built around the fact\u0026nbspthey can be controlled through the companion app, allowing for easy tightening when needed.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Mr Jenkinson received £38m last year in previous role as managing director.\u0026nbspHousing minister James Brokenshire is said to be “increasingly concerned” about Persimmon’s behaviour, including its use of leasehold contracts, the quality of its buildings and its leadership.Created with Sketch.Outrageous property deals in pictures Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.115 The Park Lane townhouse set to become one of the UK\u0027s most expensive student flats at £4,000 a weekA town house situated in Park Lane, one of the most affluent places in London, is about to become the capital’s most expensive student residence.215 London\u0027s most expensive flat goes on sale at Buckingham Palace near Buckingham Palace priced at £150mA luxury flat in London’s historic Admiralty Arch, which overlooks Buckingham Palace, could sell for up to £150 million.315 ‘Little White House’ inside the US embassy complex in London goes on sale for £2.5mA luxury home inside the US embassy complex has gone on sale for £2.5m.415 First London luxury flats to contain their own private art gallery  with prices going from £3.8m up to £7.7mThe first private luxury apartment building in London with its own private art gallery has been unveiled in March.515 Margaret Thatcher\u0027s Belgravia home is up for sale for £30mMargaret Thatcher’s six-floor townhouse in Belgravia is on the market for a cool £30 million.615 Tiny London house that is just 10ft wide goes on market for £800,000A tiny terraced house that measures no more than 10ft wide has gone on the market in south London for a staggering £800,000.

The company sold 7,970 homes under the scheme in 2018, almost half of all of its sales, and up from 7,682 in 2017.\u0026nbspFor each of those sales the government provided an interest-free loan to purchasers, a move which critics say have served to further boost house prices and returns for\u0026nbspshareholders. Persimmon has £2.2bn returned to shareholders in the past seven years.A source close to the housing minister told the Press Association: “Leasehold, build quality, their leadership seemingly not getting they\u0027re accountable to their customers, are all points that have been raised by the Secretary of State privately,” the source said.Leasehold homes have come under increasing scrutiny as homeowners have been hit with thousands of pounds in fees to carry out repairs on their own properties.A spokesperson\u0026nbsp for the Ministry of Housing, Communities \u0026amp Local Government said: “We expect all housing developers to deliver good quality housing, to deliver it on time, and to treat purchasers of new-build homes fairly.\u0026nbsp“Last October, we announced our intention for there to be a New Homes Ombudsman and we intend to introduce legislation to require developers of new-build homes to belong to this body.“We’ll tell you what’s true.

Prices for the Galaxy S10 start at £799.As the name suggests, the S10+ is essentially a plus-sized version of the S10.Measuring 6.4-inches, the S10+ features the same triple-lens setup on the rear of the phone but adds another lens to the front.It can also hold an incredible\u0026nbsp1.5 terabytes of data – 500GB more than its nearest rival (the Galaxy Note9) – if its 512GB expandable memory is utilised.The battery on the S10+ is also enormous, though without real-world testing it\u0027s difficult to say how far this will go in an average user\u0027s day.Up to 12GB of RAM makes this smartphone more powerful than most modern laptops.Prices for the Galaxy S10+ start at £899The Galaxy S10 5G is huge – and not only because of its 6.7-inch frame.Its real significance comes in its support for 5G, the next-generation mobile network that will define communications for the next decade.This phone will appeal to anyone wanting to see what this new world might look like, though it\u0027s likely going to be at least a year before 5G rolls out on any significant scale.In terms of general specs, the Galaxy S10 5G is most similar to the Galaxy S10, with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of internal storage.\u0026nbspSamsung is yet to announce a price or exact\u0026nbsprelease date for the Galaxy S10 5G, though it will likely be coming at some point in the summer.While some may be questioning what the point of a folding phone is, others are heralding the Galaxy Fold as the future of smartphones.Like the S10 5G, this is a phone for early adopters, with future generations likely to iron out any kinks that may arise from such a radically new technology.It comes with 512GB of internal storage as standard, 12GB of RAM and an incredible six cameras.\u0026nbspSamsung is yet to announce the cost of the Galaxy Fold in the UK, but with prices in the US set at $1,980 and €2,000 in Europe, British buyers can expect to pay around £1,600.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Due to a lack of knowledge about the past climate of Mars, scientists\u0026nbspcan not tell whether it came from\u0026nbspgroundwater, precipitation,\u0026nbspmelting glaciers or something unheard of.There is no liquid water on the surface of mars today, though plenty of similar ex-water features\u0026nbsphave been discovered in recent years, suggesting Mars once had a far wetter and warmer climate.Each discovery raises further questions about the planet\u0027s past atmosphere and\u0026nbspscientists ultimately want to know whether or not it would have been suitable for life.Next year the ESA in collaboration with Russia’s space program Roscomos will launch the ExoMars mission with the primary goal to “address the question of whether life has ever existed on Mars.Here The Independent has collated images\u0026nbspfrom recently discovered evidence of water on Mars in the gallery above.We’ll tell you what’s true.

It would not be unfair to characterise them as dedicated Remainers pro-Europeans who have dedicated much of their political careers, in their respective former parties, to the European cause.Created with Sketch. Show all 18Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.These billboards were plastered by campaign group Led By DonkeysThese billboards were plastered by campaign group Led By DonkeysThey would also, to a man and woman, warmly welcome any efforts to rule out a “no-deal” Brexit, and to postpone Brexit in any case. In this respect they share the instincts of many former colleagues in their old parties. In the words of Chris Leslie: “Choosing to stand by while our constituents’ lives and future opportunities are hurt by Brexit is a fundamental violation of Labour’s traditional values.”Debates about Brexit delay mean we’re missing the bigger pictureYet what might TIG do if a second referendum or a delay to Brexit – both it seems increasingly likely – was somehow not possible to achieve? Would they, when push comes to shove, back Theresa May’s deal over a no-deal Brexit – as logic would suggest? Or would they simply refuse to accept the choice as a genuine one and vote her deal down, if forced into such a dilemma? Might they have a free vote, each according to their own conscience?And if there was a Final Say referendum, what if Britain again voted to leave the EU? What then?More widely, in pursuit of their European beliefs, would TIG MPs be prepared to vote against the government in a vote of no confidence? The answer, as Heidi Allen told The Independent, is that they would not, because it might mean a government led by Jeremy Corbyn. But, on the other hand, that removes their negotiating leverage with Theresa May on Brexit she need not fear that they will eject her from Number 10.These sorts of questions, among many other tactical matters, is where differences of opinion will start to emerge – no doubt labelled “splits”. In future, particularly if they end up campaigning to re-enter the EU, TIG MPs will have more tense debates about having to adopt the euro, about the Schengen no-passport area, and about the UK’s contributions to the EU budget.Even so, the group’s 11 members have much more in common than points of difference, such as their enthusiasm for Europe. There is a reason, for example, why Ian Austin, an MP for Dudley, did not choose to join them when he defected from Labour – because he is prepared to support a version of Brexit and TIG is not.If and when the time comes for a general election, if the Brexit issue is still live, TIG will, with the Liberal Democrats, the nationalists in Scotland and Wales, the Greens and the Northern Irish republican parties, offer an unequivocally anti-Brexit, pro-second referendum, pro-Remain agenda.\u0026nbspGot an unanswered question about Brexit?

Liberal Democrats have led the campaign for a people’s vote. We have campaigned for it, we have marched for it and we will vote for it.”With dissatisfaction over Brexit having sparked several Tory and Labour MPs to quit their party and form the Independent Group, Sir Vince said he has been speaking to “many of these now independent MPs” and that they have “much in common” with his party.Created with Sketch.

If they choose to reject it, another vote would be held on whether to extend the Article 50 period.Ms May was responding to numerous Remain-backing ministers threatening to quit if she failed to give parliament the right to block a no-deal Brexit.\u0026nbspIt came after\u0026nbspJeremy Corbyn offered a major boost to the campaign for a Final Say vote, when\u0026nbspLabour announced it will back a second referendum if its withdrawal plan is rejected by MPs this week.See below for live updatesTheresa May to make Commons statement amid mounting pressure to delay BrexitMajor boost for second referendum as Jeremy Corbyn gives Labour\u0027s backingTheresa May\u0027s spokesman has refused to say how the government would whip Tory MPs to vote on the matter of a no-deal Brexit or an extension of Article 50.\u0026nbspHe said:\u0026nbspI think what you heard in the Commons was the prime minister’s absolute determination to get a deal over the line in a way that the House of Commons can support it. That is her focus and that is what you would expect.Questions on whipping on what may or may not follow that are for another day. I think it’s important that we set these things out in order.Business minister Richard Harrington, who had threatened to resign in order to vote to block a no-deal Brexit, has said he is satisfied and will not be quitting\u0026nbspHe\u0026nbsptold the BBC said: I\u0027m satisfied because for the first time she has acknowledged in a statement that Parliament will be allowed to vote on ruling out no deal, which of course it overwhelmingly will.Dominic Grieve says May\u0027s deal is a second rate outcome for our country.\u0026nbspHe accuses the prime minister of brow-beating the Commons, saying she was inaccurate in claiming the only options for avoiding a no-deal Brexit are to vote for her plan or revoke Article 50. He says the prime minister\u0026nbspcould also go back to the public in a second referendum.\u0026nbspMay says another poll would not change the fact that the only three options are leaving the EU with a deal, leaving with no deal or not leaving at all.Labour\u0027s Yvette Cooper, who has tabled an amendment to give MPs a vote on whether or not to approve a no-deal Brexit, asks what the government\u0027s position would be if the choice is between no-deal and extending Article 50.\u0026nbspThe prime minister dodges the question.Veteran Tory MP Ken Clarke asks how long the prime minister would be willing to extend Article 50 for, saying an extension to the end of June would not be enough time and would see the current pantomime performance continue.\u0026nbspMay says merely that she does not want to see Article 50 extended and would want any extension to be as short as possible.Jeremy Corbyn is now speaking.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspHe says he has lost count of the number of times May has had to come to the Commons to explain a further delay. He says the latest is grotesquely reckless, adding:\u0026nbspThis is not dithering, it\u0027s a deliberate strategy to run down the clock.The Labour leader\u0026nbspsays the real life consequences of the prime minister\u0027s cynical tactics are being felt across the country, in lost jobs and investment.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspHe adds:The responsibility for this lies exclusively with the prime minister and her government’s shambolic handling of Brexit. Even now, with just one month to go before our legally enshrined exit date, the prime minister is not clear what she wants in renegotiations that have now dragged on since it became clear in December that her deal was not even backed by much of her own party, let alone Parliament or the country.Theresa May makes three commitments:\u0026nbsp1. We will hold a second meaningful vote by Tuesday 12 March at the latest.2. If the government has not won a meaningful vote by Tuesday 12 March, then it will...table a motion to be voted on by Wednesday 13 March asking this House if it supports leaving the EU without a withdrawal agreement....The UK will only leave without\u0026nbspa deal on 29 March\u0026nbspif there is explicit consent in the House for that outcome.3. If MPs reject a no-deal Brexit,\u0026nbspThe government will, on 14 March, bring forward a motion on whether Parliament wants to seek a short, limited extension to Article 50.\u0026nbspIf MPs vote for this, May says, she will seek an extension from the EU. She does not want to see this happen, she adds, saying our absolute focus should be on approving a deal before 29 March.\u0026nbspShe says an extension to Article 50 would not take no-deal off the table.Theresa May says the government is also working to ensure there will be no lowering of workers\u0027 rights and environmental protections after Brexit.\u0026nbspShe says the government will ensure Parliament has a vote on whether to follow suit whenever the EU standards in areas such as workers\u0027 rights and health and safety are judged to have been strengthened.\u0026nbspNew papers outlining the impact of a no-deal Brexit will be published today, she says, while insisting the UK would make a success of such an outcome.Theresa May says she and Geoffrey Cox, the attorney general, are making good progress in talks with the EU, including a constructive meeting she held with Jean-Claude Juncker.\u0026nbspShe says the EU and the UK have agreed to develop a joint work stream to look at using alternative arrangements to maintain an open border in Northern Ireland - potentially removing the need to implement the backstop.Theresa May is now up...Theresa May will deliver her statement in the Commons in the next few minutes.\u0026nbspWe\u0027re expecting her to announce plans to give MPs two votes if her deal is rejected next month: one on whether to pursue a no-deal outcome and another on\u0026nbspwhether to ask the EU to extend the Article 50 process.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThe prime minister is seeking to quell a potential rebellion by Remainer ministers, who are demanding that she take no-deal off the table and pledge to delay Brexit if she cannot get a deal through Parliament by 29 March.\u0026nbspWe’ll tell you what’s true.

slapped down Jeremy Corbyn’s aides as he vowed Labour would back moves to give voters the chance to reject Theresa May’s Brexit deal in a fresh referendum.The Labour leader’s advisers are accused of watering down the party’s surprise commitment to a referendum – suggesting it would not cover putting the prime minister’s agreement on the ballot paper.But Sir Keir, the shadow Brexit secretary, insisted “elected politicians” had decided the policy, with Mr Corbyn’s agreement, saying: “If Theresa May’s deal goes through, it is subject to the lock of a public vote.”The cracks emerged within hours of the announcement, which has been hailed as potentially “a defining moment” in the campaign for a Final Say referendum on the Brexit outcome.Mr Corbyn – desperate to head off further defections to the breakaway Independent Group – said he would back another public vote if, as expected, his own softer withdrawal plan is defeated this week.Created with Sketch.Brexit deal vote:

briefing note for MPs said an amendment “could be attached to the prime minister’s deal – or a version of it – should it win a majority in the House of Commons”.The sentence was a reference to the amendment put forward by Labour backbenchers Peter Kyle and Phil Wilson, for a confirmatory referendum.However, on Monday night, a Labour source said the party would not support the amendment in its current form, because “we will not be voting for anything which supports May’s damaging Brexit deal”.A second, anonymous sources briefed that Emily Thornberry, the shadow foreign secretary, “misspoke” when she said the referendum was likely to be Ms May’s deal vs Remain.Asked if Mr Corbyn’s aides were attempting to dilute the pledge, Sir Keir said: “You have got elected politicians on your programme – you had Emily Thornberry out last night – setting out what the position is that we agreed as the Labour party.“What I am saying is telling you what was in the written briefing, the official briefing from my office and Jeremy’s office, to Labour MPs last night“There is no question about that – it should be between a credible Leave option and Remain.”Three ministers urge May to take no-deal Brexit off the tableMajor boost for fresh Brexit referendum as Corbyn gives backingBrexit delay a step closer as rebels and EU leaders pile on pressureSir Keir made clear that a “credible Leave option” meant Ms May’s deal, if approved – although it is still unclear if Labour will abstain to allow it to pass, subject to a referendum.It appeared Mr Corbyn’s aides were suggesting Labour would only back a referendum on its own Brexit proposals, which are almost certain to be rejected by MPs.Speaking on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, Sir Keir also sought to play down suggestions that at least 25 Labour MPs would refuse to back a second referendum in a Commons vote.He pointed out that predictions of a similar revolt on the “meaningful vote” had been proved wrong, after a call for unity, adding: “That pretty well worked.”We’ll tell you what’s true.

They are carrying posters of the Ayatollah Khomeini, the Iranian religious and political leaderSome were happy to see Mr Zarif’s possible exit. “Good riddance,” tweeted Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, in a sentiment echoed by both conservative think tanks in Washington and hardliners in Tehran.“Close the door behind you and never come back, Yankee!” wrote Zahra Tabakhi, a conservative Iranian journalist, in a tweet.Mr Rouhani, in a speech on Tuesday, did not mention the resignation, but praised Mr Zarif, amid reports that he was trying to convince him to stay. \u0026nbspIf our Foreign Ministry is doing something, it is because it is from the people and it represents the people,” said Mr Rouhani.His chief of staff, Mahmoud Vaezi posted a photograph of the president and Mr Zarif working closely together, and insisted that Mr Rouhani was “completely satisfied” with his foreign minister.Despite Mr Rouhani’s entreaties, Mr Zarif may be holding out for a gesture of support from supreme leader Ali\u0026nbspKhamenei.Mr Zarif’s announcement came just hours after his visible absence during the first public visit of Syrian president Bashar al-Assad to Tehran since that country descended into a years-long civil conflict.In his place, seen in meetings with both President Hassan Rouhani and Ayatollah Khamenei, was Qassem Suleimani – the powerful commander of Quds force, the clandestine overseas ision of the Revolutionary Guards (IRGC).Mr Zarif had apparently been kept in the dark about Assad’s surprise visit, and while there is no sign that the foreign minister opposed Iran’s steadfast support for the Damascus regime, he has been frustrated by being kept out of the loop on significant policy matters.“This was the last straw that broke the camel’s back,” said Maysam Behravesh, a researcher and Iran expert at Lund University in Sweden.“Zarif’s curious and conspicuous absence from Syrian President’s meeting with Khamenei, Rouhani and Soleimani took many off guard,”The slight, documented in state news agency photos and shared on social media, apparently outraged Mr Zarif, who told an Iranian newspaper that after the pictures today, Javad Zarif has no credibility in the world as Iran\u0027s foreign minister.Shortly afterward, he posted his resignation on Instagram: I would like to sincerely apologise for not being able to continue my service and for all my shortcomings during my service.One Western diplomat who works on Iran policy matters said he understands that “the pressure of the IRGC” may have contributed to the resignation.\u0026nbspAs for the JCPOA: “The supreme leader doesn’t seem to want to get out of the deal but to test limits to send a message,” he told\u0026nbspthe Independent.The US-educated Zarif, long a fixture of the moderate factions of Iran’s political elite, had previously served as Tehran’s envoy to the United Nations. He was a key architect of the nuclear deal, forging a partnership with then US Secretary of State John Kerry, as well as EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini.While it is unlikely that Ayatollah Khamenei or Mr Rouhani would immediately abandon the deal, it remains unclear whether any successor to Mr Zarif would have the diplomatic skills, personal ties, and strong motivation to maintain it.“There seems to be a fragile collective consensus within Iran’s wider leadership that the handicapped nuclear deal is still worth keeping, but this can change once its most vocal and solid backer is out of the game,” said Mr Behravesh.Being the most public face of an isolated Middle East country seeking to build up trade ties with the West, without scuttling the utopian ideals of a 40-year revolution, was never going to be easy.But Mr Zarif has been facing numerous pressures that have likely made his job especially challenging.Mr Trump’s decision last year to abandon the nuclear deal badly damaged Mr Zarif’s credibility among regime hardliners who opposed any rapprochement with the West. \u0026nbspHe has become a lightning rod of criticism by an often unelected but powerful collection of hard-line stalwarts in the clerical and security establishments, who are skeptical about his outreach to the West.A photo published recently showed Mr Zarif in apparent physical anguish as he sought to convince such lawmakers about the importance of upgrading Iran’s money-laundering rules to bring them in line with international standards as a prerequisite to robust trade with the West.Mr Zarif is also under pressure by Iran’s Western allies, including France, Germany, and UK. Lacking any other interlocutor, European diplomats have been pressing Mr Zarif and his foreign ministry colleagues to scale back deployment of militias and hardware to Syria and Iraq, ease the expansion of its missile programme, and comply with money laundering standards – \u0026nbspall matters over which the foreign ministry has little control.“What has driven Zarif crazy is the Rouhani administration’s handling of some files, in particular Bashar Assad’s visit,” said Adnan Tabatabai, co-founder of the Center for Applied Research in Partnership with the Orient, a Bonn think tank.“It’s a sign of frustration with Rouhani.”In addition to the president’s appeal, a group of 150 Iranian lawmakers on Tuesday were petitioning Mr Rouhani to reject the resignation and for Mr Zarif to stay in his post, according to official news agencies.“I strongly believe Rouhani will try to bring Zarif back,” said Mr Tabatabai. “But this has to be done in a face-saving manner and it is yet to be seen to be done.”Mr Zarif’s departure may ignite a struggle for control of the foreign ministry. Already elements of the clandestine services and the Revolutionary Guard have been accused of using Iran’s diplomatic outposts to carry out potentially violent operations abroad, and to heighten tensions with the West, all of which could intensify.His resignation, if embraced, could also embolden US hardliners who’ve been generally thwarted in their efforts to isolate Iran. Mr Zarif has earned a measure of admiration even from his critics for his passionate and sometimes effective defence of Iran in the international media and at global forums, including at the Munich Security Conference this month.“He was acting as a remarkable brake on the confrontational policies and ambitions of Iranian hardliners,” said Mr Behravesh. “Abroad, he was hampering the Trump administration’s efforts to optimally exercise its ‘maximum pressure’ policy against Iran by calling out its contradictions, perils, and consequences.With Zarif gone, the\u0026nbsphardliners on both sides of the planet will be going on a honeymoon together.”We’ll tell you what’s true.

died, and I had to walk a long way behind her coffin, surrounded by thousands of people watching me while millions more did on television.“I don’t think any child should be asked to do that, under any circumstances.”Harry has also previously revealed he battled with depression following his mums tragic death.He said he “shut down all his emotions” for two decades after losing his mother Princess Diana.The Prince admitted he had been close to a breakdown, sought therapy and took up boxing to combat frustration.According to The Richest, Prince Harry has an estimated net worth of around £m.This

Heres the latest on how its affecting your cash.On February  the pound is trading at . against the euro.The British currency is pushing higher than the euro because of hopes Brexit will be delayed.The prospect of the Prime Minister ruling out a no-deal Brexit has caused the exchange rate to rise sharply.Theresa May said the government would seek to speed up ratication of its Brexit withdrawal deal with the European Uniontime gets too tight.Lee Hardman, currencies analyst at MUFG said: The recent bigger picture is still that market participants are actively pursuing downside protection.He said that sterling markets remained relatively calm, with the spot price reflecting more confidence that Britain would avoid a chaotic exit from the EU. But as the clock ticks down, that optimism is likely to fade, Hardman noted.Before the EU referendum in June  a pound was trading for around €.. Sterling fell around  per cent after the result.The highest rate in recent years was €. in November .Foreign exchangemarkets allow currencies to be bought and sold around the world.They are necessary for international commerce but are also opportunities for traders to make a profit by effectively gambling on whether rates go up or down.As in any market, rates are determined by the price that buyers and sellers are willing to accept.If more people are buying than selling the price will go up, and vice versa.Traders confidence in a countrys economic health is the biggest factor shaping forex markets.Reports and forecasts on GDP growth, inflation, employment, retail sales and manufacturing can prompt traders to buy or sell a countrys currency.Other factors that sway forex markets include interest rate decisions by central banks , and news such as the signing of a trade deal or a natural disaster.Movements in global capital markets, bond markets and stock markets can also influence forex trading.Banks and money changers who sell holiday cash broadly follow foreign exchange markets in the rates they offer the public.The buy and sell price for each currency is usually a few percentage points either side of the true rate so they can make a profit eventhere is no commission.Unstable and unpredictable government events can also negatively impact the pounds strength in trading.Following the resignations of Theresa Mays Cabinet in response to her draft Brexit proposal on Thursday, the pound plummeted to its lowest value in over a year.Euros can be bought at supermarkets, such as Marks  Spencer, as well as the Post Office and currency specialists – but rates y massively.The best rates can often be found at specialist online outlets, such as Travelex, which will deliver cash directly to your home.Travellers can use comparison sites, like MoneySavingExperts TravelMoneyMax, to find the best rate.If you order in advance and pick up the cash then you’ll most likely get a better rate thanyou walk into a bureau de change.Alternatively, providers such as FairFX and WeSwap offer currency cards that can load up at a good rate and then use abroad like a debit card without transaction fees on each purchase.You can always buy last-minute currency at the airport or withdraw cash at your destination, but its almost always cheaper to buy before you go.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

They also showed me a box of weapons that they said they would use on anyone who went against them.Slavery takes a iety of forms, but most commonly forced labour, sexual exploitation, domestic work or forced criminal activity. The Home Office estimated that there are , people held in slavery in the UK, with the Global Slavery Index suggesting the figure could be as many as ,.The UK recognised a staggering , victims from  countries in , including adults who had been used for organ harvesting and children that were forced into sexual exploitation.At present, trafficked victims have just  days government support after being recognised as a victim. Campaigners and businesses say this is not enough time for victims to find a place to live and means to support themselves so they risk becoming homeless and destitute.We want the government to: Back Lord McColls proposed bill, which suggests all victims of modern slavery should be given a year to recover, and alongside that they should be given special support to help them, including housing benefits, financial support and other services.Fearing for his le, Joe eventually fled with nothing but the clothes he was wearing, and was referred to The Salvation Army who helped him find a safe house, where he is currently living. But sadly, like many victims of modern day slavery, Joe was so scared of his traffickers that he didn’t want to speak to the police so there was no investigation into his case.When labourer Sandu Laurentiu-Sava first arrived in the UK and landed a job in a car wash, he believed it was the perfect opportunity hed been looking for to earn enough money to provide for his family back home in Romania.However, the horric reality that greeted him was very dferent.When he arrived in the UK, he was forced to work long days at Bubbles Car Wash in Bethnal Green, East London, and kept in a squalid, rat-infested flat owned by his employer that he shared with five other workers.One summer evening in August  after a long sht Sandu, , was electrocuted and killed while taking a shower.Car wash owner Shaip Nimani, then , was jailed for four years after admitting manslaughter.Workers without rubber gloves have suffered burns from putting their bare hands into water tainted with chemicals, and a lack of protective footwear has also led to trench foot - a painful condition of the feet caused by long immersion in cold water.  Salvation Army medic Anne Read attended a police raid to provide support to potential victims last year and was horried by what she saw.She says: “We were offering them food and drink and the chance for a shower and a change of clothes while victims were being interviewed.“Whilst other men gratefully took the new clothes offered, one of them seemed reluctant to remove his shoes. When we askedhe was OK, he showed us his feet. He had been wearing just his own lightweight shoes to work on the car wash. Over time the harsh chemicals in the cleaning fluids he had been forced to use had fused his shoes onto his feet, which meant that he hadn’t been able to remove them for weeks.The shoes had to be surgically removed. This is just one of many stories of the unspeakable cruelty people face at the hands of their trafficker which we see everyday as victims of modern slavery come to us for support.Despite being promised work and accommodation by gang members posing as recruiters, sadly for the large number of car wash labourers trafficked to the UK, the pay and living conditions are diabolical.Hand car washing has grown largely unchecked for the past  to  years, car wash expert Dawn Frazer says.In November last year police raided a premises in Manchester and three men were detained. Police said ten ‘potential victims’ of slavery were rescued following the sting on Drive and Shine car wash.In  Kristian Holub admitted forcing Czech immigrant Milan Tencik - who was made to sleep on the floor - to work in a car wash, and business owner Ali Mohammed Raza was jailed for six years in  for trafficking five Syrian illegal immigrants to Hull to clean vehicles. In the same year brothers Igor and Marek Marcin got  months and  months’ jail time for trafficking  Czech and Slovak men to work in car washes and factories, paying them just £ a week and putting them up in bug-infested rooms.Heartbreaking stories like these are why The Sun is backing calls for a change in the law so that specialist support given to modern slavery victims – including forced labour and human trafficking – is increased from as little as  days to a full year, as they rebuild their lives.You can sign the petition for the Modern Slavery Victim Support Bill here.Find out more about Co-Ops Bright Future programme, which offers employment to survivors of modern slavery, here.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

At , she was given just four weeks to live and her family were told to say their goodbyes.Now , Brooke has been clean three years and has undergone an incredible transformation.She tells the Sun: I look at my pictures when I was using and I dont feel like the same person. I couldn’t see I looked bad or skinny back then.But I keep those photos because it’s good to be reminded of how things used to be - and I feel sad for that girl. I know she was broken and lost but I’m just happy she came out the other side.Last week, Jeremy Kyle fans were amazed at the transformation of crack addict Kristie - whose habit left her sleeping in car parks, stealing from relatives and even selling her body for sex in order to fund her habit.After going to rehab she ed to the show just three months later and looked unrecognisable from the gaunt girl who had first appeared.Here, three more women explain their battle with addiction and how they overcame it, dramatically changing their looks – and lives – for the better.Brooke Finkel, , a student nurse from Melbourne, Australia, has been clean for three years now.She says: I started drinking when I was  at parties or friends’ houses.By the time I was , I was introduced to weed and cigarettes. I was kicked out of home at  and a half because of how violent I became towards my family.Over the next year, I went into hospital with pneumonia, lived in a psychiatric hospital and got hooked on prescription drugs.I refused all help I just wanted to die or stay on my high from drugs all the time. The first time I ever took the drug ice - otherwise known as crystal meth - I didn’t care about anything anymore.My weight fell to st lbs and by this time I was using every hour of every day.By the time I was , my skin started to turn yellow, I lost energy and started to suffer severe back and stomach pains.I had been given four weeks to live by my doctors. My liver was failing, my kidneys were failing, my heart was slow and only beating because of the high that the meth was giving me.Then one day I got so sick I was taken to intensive care. They did what they could with medication but my family were advised they should say goodbye.For  days I slept and on the final day when I became fully conscious, my recovery started. I checked into rehab on th July  - but I hated it and ran away all the time.During the recovery meetings I had been introduced to at rehab I heard people telling a similar story to mine who were now happy. That helped me a lot.At around seven months being clean I walked into a gym, wanting to make myself strong from the inside. I became a personal trainer and then reapplied to study for my dream job: nursing.My whole perspective on le has changed dramatically and I now use each day as an opportunity to grow.Katie O, , is a stay-at-home mother from Baltimore, USA, and has been clean for a year.She says: “I was about  when I started self-harming and cutting,  when I became anorexic and  when I started drinking several days a week and using cocaine.By , I was on crack cocaine and other hard drugs.I grew up in a very loving home, with wonderful parents in a beautul home, but I didn’t know how to deal with my feelings and emotions.I was very involved in competitive swimming but I was forced to leave the sport due to an accident one drunk night at college. At that point, everything changed.I became a daily drinker, cocaine user and had an active eating disorder. A few years later, I found crack cocaine and fell in love and never looked back.There were overdoses, guns to my head, a long, enmeshed, co-dependent and extremely abusive relationship, assaults, homelessness, and more. I stole, lied and cheated my way through every single interaction for years.After eight inpatient treatments, several detoxes, arrests, jail, psych-wards, probation, hundreds of hours of community service, nothing was working.I felt I was a lost cause, and everyone, including myself, thought I would die an eating-disordered alcoholic and drug addict.I met a wonderful man, and got married. He was the reason I left drugs but I couldn’t stop drinking.And after my third child was born, my alcoholism hit a new low. Externally, everything was great. But internally, I was suicidal and hated myself more than ever.One day, my third child crawled into bed with me, as my head throbbed, and his little voice begged me to wake up. He said: Don’t die, Mummy. Dont die.That night in July , I went to a meeting of Alcoholics Anonymous and I have been sober ever since.I had been to AA before a few times but it was always someone telling me I had to stop or forcing me to quit. But this time I walked in all by myself.I’m grateful today to be alive. When I look at pictures of myself over those years, the crazy thing is I didn’t realise how terrible I looked. Not until I got sober did it hit me.Today I’m confident and that’s a big dference. I barely recognise the girl in the before photos. It’s a dferent person. I’m grateful for my sons words it saved my le.”Allie Severino, , works in community outreach in Boca Raton, Florida, and has been clean for  years.She says: My addiction started at the age of  using mainly weed, cocaine and ecstasy, then moving to Xanax, coke and pills.I was using prescription pills for four years and was going to  doctors a month, coming home with about  pills per doctor. I was selling most of the pills just to pay for my addiction.But then I got arrested for drug trafficking. My le was dirty, dangerous and scummy. I was sentenced to six years and when I got out of jail I was placed on house arrest where I eventually continued to use.I recovered by being court ordered to nine months in a government-run treatment facility.While I didnt want it to happen at the time, that saved my le.For the first three months I vividly remember still having the urge and constant thought of using. When I got into the halfway program, things got even stricter - but I needed that.I started going to meetings and got heavily involved in AA. When I was in treatment, women would come in to meetings who  were now living fairly decent, happy lives and thats what I wanted.I’ve been  years drug free now. I feel like I’ve lived two dferent lives. Today I own a nice clean home, I have two cats who I take care of, I show up for all my friends and family and get to help so many people everyday in my job.I thought I looked great when I was using. But it was all a delusion. Obviously now I see my complexion was grey and I actually looked ill.I’m happy with the way I look now. I take care of my skin, eat well and do yoga daily. I feel and look better than ever.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Likewise, consistently receiving less than you need to because you are paying back an advance can push people over the edge and into destitution.To succeed, Universal Credit needs to raise the incomes of those locked in poverty and ensure that work is a route to a better le. Without further reform, its potential risks being unfulfilled.The best immediate step the Government should take would be to lt the freeze on working age benefits this April.One million people are already receiving it and by the time the system is fully rolled out in , nearly  million will be on it.But there are big problems with the flagship new system - it takes  weeks to get the first payment and it could leave some families worse off by thousands of pounds a year.And while working families can claim back up to  per cent of their childcare costs, they must find the money to pay for childcare upfront - we’ve heard of families waiting up to  months for the money.Working parents across the country told us they’ve been unable to take on more hours - or have even turned down better paid jobs or more hours because of the amount they get their benefits cut.It’s time to Make Universal Credit work. We want the Government to:Together, these changes will help Make Universal Credit Work.Join our Universal Credit Facebook group or email UniversalCredit@the-sun to share your story. JRF also want jobcentres to better use the hidden pot called the Flexible Support Fund to help Brits with their childcare payments upfront so Brits dont go into thousands of pounds of debt going back to work.They highlighted the thoughts of both people on Universal Credit and work coaches in their new report.Research from Britain Thinks revealed that working parents saw Universal Credit as contributing towards their poor standards of living, and not helping them.Many wanted to be able to keep more of their hard-earned cash rather than being hit by the taper rate, and felt trapped by their circumstances.When the couple moved onto the new benefit system in September their £ a month benefits were immediately stopped, leaving them unable to pay their rent.The Peterborough couple, who’ve been living in their current home for a year now, claim they have nowhere  to gothey are evicted and will have to be put in temporary accommodation, at a cost of £ a week to the city council.Its a disgusting situation to be in because you know its going to happen but youre absolutely powerless to do anything about it, Amanda told The Sun.We have no savings, no one to fall back on and we struggle to be able to afford the rent now that we’re in debt.If were are relocated to a completely dferent area then Brian will have to give up his job but I thought the whole point of Universal Credit was to get people into work  It makes no sense.A DWP spokesperson said that the scheme works for the vast majority of people.They added: Universal Credit reduces gradually as people’s income increases, which means they’re always better off in work."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/NINTCHDBPICT000470565142.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"defected tory mps tory far right claims","story":"So forget their paranoid and baseless ­fantasies about Ukip infiltrators.

Your mind is bought and sold by their computer programs — with no human intervention required.You are the digital content they auction off for sale to the highest bidder. Billions of pounds pass before your eyes every day. But you don’t see a penny of it.It’s unfair. Never has so much been taken from so many by so few.So it is time to have a big redistribution of digital wealth.Google shareholders and Facebook boss Mark ­Zuckerberg are now worth .TRILLION. How much are you worth Remember, your mind is  per cent of the revenue of these corporations. So it is only right to demand your share.The British people, who set the world an example in waging a revolutionary war against feudal slavery, now find themselves in the latest stage of wage-slavery, working for the benefit of these wealthy companies and ­billionaires.The richest and strongest profit and grab most, while the weakest are utterly robbed, tormented, crushed and strangled.The tech multi-billionaires are, perhaps, some of the richest of all, and geographically the most secure.They have profited more than all the rest from their unholy alliance with weak national governments, who say their own parliaments and laws are too small to control or regulate these giant global corporations.Call it what it is — collusion, crony capitalism. The big companies and big government are hand in hand.The House of Commons’ Digital Select Committee this week called the tech giants “digital gangsters”.But even a good Saatchi alumnus like Damian Collins — the committee’s distinguished chairman — concedes the politicians have no power over these companies.Instead, it’s time for the people — the customers who keep the tech companies afloat — to take a stand.It is unfair that these few companies are so rich, and the many people are so poor.So, I say: Let us march! We are  per cent on the side of the heroes. They are  per cent on the side of the villains. Black and white. No compromise.When the tech companies say: “We agree in principle”, it means they will do nothing in practice.They say fair exchange is no robbery. You provide them with all your personal details — your age, gender, every friend, every photo you send, every film you watch, every app you download, every website you visit, every message, every item you buy, everywhere you go and where you are now — and inthey give you the wonders of the internet world.And as your bonus, they only send you “personalised” ads. Soyou want a new shampoo they don’t “serve” you a dishwasher.They are for the haves who hold power. We are for the have-nots.This is not a question of “privacy”. Or “harmful material”. Or “election interference”.This is a question of money.They have too much. We have too little. So we will make what seems highly improbable in fact happen.Every time Google or Facebook sell you to an advertiser, you should get paid for the privilege. Fair shares for all. The technology exists to make this possible. YouTube already pays people for the number of times their uploaded data is viewed.These companies only care about the millions of users they can sell to advertisers.What was your name again  Here is your chance to get your own back. A business model that says I get  per cent and you get  per cent is not going to last.The tech giants should remember what all Prime Ministers and Presidents usually learn too late.We the people have all the power. It’s best not to push us to use it.I say we need a popular uprising. A people’s revolution. Agitate! Create disenchantment! Build discontent!Join me and say: Start spreading the news. I say we want control. Ownership of our own minds.The new tech billionaires once used to dream of changing the world. Now they’ve got the whole world, they don’t want to let it go.They used to say: Set sail for the end of the rainbow.But now they say: Don’t rock the boat. They are turning into exactly the type of people they once condemned.The time has come to call a halt to their complacency and self-satisfaction. Will this cost them money  Yes, peanuts.But whatever it costs, it will be less than having the money dragged out of them.A society without ownership is one in which inequality and resentment flourish.Honour, common sense and the interest of the country require that all free British men and women, wherever they be, now fight for control of their own minds.We will feel more responsible for our own lives.And everyone will agree that this makes everything much fairer and that the people have gained more dignity and self-respect.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Fantasising about it is self-indulgent and delusional.THE Sun has always said Corbyn would betray Labour’s Leave voters in the end. Watch it happen next week.It will be an unprecedented democratic outrage for a main party to back a second referendum before the first is enacted. But Corbyn says that is now “very much part of the agenda”.Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell admits the party is “moving towards a people’s vote”, even using the Remainer- run ­campaign’s deceitful nickname.The vast majority of Labour’s at-risk marginal seats, and those they need to win to take power, backed Leave.And those voters are watching.THEY’RE not short of ego, are they The new -strong Independent Group of MPs say their ultimate aim is to form a Government. As it stands they can just about form a Sunday league side.Andwe were in any doubt their only real policy so far is to overturn Brexit, Ian Austin’s refusal to join clinches it.As for a “new kind of politics”, all we see is a club of centre-ground Europhile Labour and Tory MPs who vaguely agree they preferred Blairrunning the show.Forget the spin.

We should leave the EU and forge a new path in the world.It was put to a referendum and the rest, as they say, is history.For some, though, the result of the ­referendum is not history. It’s something they are desperate to re-run.Calls for an extension, a delay or even a second referendum are persistent — but so too is mydetermination, and the ­determination of this Government, to deliver on the will of the first one.Democracy is not about trying again until you get the result you want.It’s about compromise and accepting that while we might disagree with each other, we should respect each other’s views.That need for compromise is precisely why we continue to negotiate with the EU. The Prime Minister is fighting hard to make sure we leave with a good deal on March .That determination is the reason I believe that the Conservative Party is the only party delivering in the national interest.The Prime Minister has made clear through her actions that whether you voted Leave or Remain, the deal she seeks will look to bring everyone back together.Whether you are someone who can’t wait to see us leave the EU, or whether you wish the result of the referendum had been dferent — we all, each of us, just want the best for the UK.We have a bright future ahead and one in which the UK will continue to grow as a force for good in the world.The pressure isn’t all on Parliament.The EU needs to come to the table in the spirit of compromise too.It would be the most illogical act of senseless harmthe EU refuses to accept that the UK Parliament will not be trapped in a backstop and instead pushes us to leave with No Deal, thereby ­creating the exact problem with the Northern Ireland border they claim they want to avoid.As far as our current ­negotiation is concerned, we are well into extra time.As Leader of the House, I am responsible for passing the legislation necessary for our exit from the EU.We have a lot to do before March  but I remain confident thatwe resolve the backstop, we will be able to pass the Meaningful Vote and crack on with that vital ­legislation.We are so close to the ­finishing line, so my plea to politicians here and in ­Brussels is: Please don’t snatch defeat from the jaws of victory. The EU must lt its eyes and look beyond the current frustrations and towards the close friendship we all want in the future.The Labour Party must carry out the wishes of the majority of its own ­voters, who wanted to leave the EU.And my own colleagues on the ­Conservative benches must not make the perfect the enemy of the good.Don’t hold the PM to ­ransom at such a critical point.Instead, we must hold our nerve and push through.  We must hold fast to the reality of the PM’s deal — that it delivers us a clean exit from the EU and all of its ­institutions while at the same time ­offering a close trading and security partnership that addresses the hopes and aspirations of many in our country who voted Remain.So the prize is great — and it’s all of our futures.Let’s come together and, with one final heave, we can get the PM’s deal over the line and begin to look ­forward, not ­backward.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Maybe it is due to what these women ate, drank or breathed in.”She said investigators would try to determine whether the affected families have anything in common.The mums of babies born with deformed limbs have already been tested for ious substances, such as drugs and excessive amounts of booze, according to Mail Online.Reuters says that reports in France have “raised alarm among the French public that some kind of toxin in food, water or air could be responsible.”Epidemiologist Emmanuelle Amar, who first revealed the birth defects in Ain, told the news agency the only thing mothers of the affected babies had in common was that they lived in cereal-growing areas amid fields of corn and sunflower.She said most of the defects had been reported between  and  and that since then there had been no new cases.Amar added that congenital defects in the affected regions had been much higher than what would normally be expected.She said: “It is a terrible tragedy for the families.”Reuters points out that birth defects can have multiple causes, including chromosome disorders, drug use or exposure to toxic substances.In the late s and early s, about , babies worldwide were born with malformed or missing limbs after their mothers received the drug thalidomide to treat morning sickness.Amar told France  thatobstetricians in the regions affected had been informed years ago, “they could have done in-depth screening.“When they noticed that a hand was missing, they could have taken amniotic fluid and meconium samples from the baby, and hair samples from the mother at birth, to test for xenobiotics [chemical substance] to gain a better understanding of what they might have been exposed to.”She told the broadcaster that affected families were disappointed they still have no clue as to why babies were born with the deformities.Amar said the mums were angry and felt abandoned as preventative measures [could have been] taken from the start.Amar told Reuters last year that in the Ain region, farmers had also reported calves being born without tails and flanks.An official at the national food safety agency Anses told Reuters it had now opened a separate investigation into legless calves in the three same regions.Poultry may also be investigated as there are suspicions about chickens being affected.An initial inquiry in early October found the incidence of newborn limb defects in the affected regions to be no greater than where in the country – but now the probe has been widened.France  says that campaigners, health professionals and parents met in Paris for the first time last Thursday to discuss the mystery.A separate  of experts will meet in March, also for the first time, to “identy and analyse” possible causes of the rare defect, the broadcaster adds.The ministry of health expects a  of scientic experts to report full findings on the mystery by the end of June – in light of public alarm over the cases.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Our absolute focus should be on working to get a deal and leaving on March .An extension beyond the end of June would mean the UK taking part in the European Parliament elections. What kind of message would that send to the more than million people who voted to leave the EU nearly three years ago now An extension cannot take No Deal off the table - the only way to do that is to revoke Article  which I shall not do, or agree a deal.She added: If we have to, we will ultimately make a success of a No Deal.The PM has been forced into the radical step as she faced a mass revolt from Tories who are opposed to No Deal.She hopes it will stop the Commons approving a motion tabled by Labours Yvette Cooper and Tory veteran Oliver Letwin, which would give MPs the power to delay Brexit without the consent of the Government.THIS WEEK: Talks in Brussels continue on how to fix the Irish backstop so Britain doesnt get trapped in the EU customs unionTUESDAY, MARCH : Latest possible date for the second meaningful vote on PMs deal.

MPs arrogantly think they know better that the people who elected them.Mr Rees-Mogg said a short delay to get crucial laws through would be acceptable, but added: If its being delayed, which is my suspicion, as a plot to stop Brexit altogether then I think that would be the most grievous error that politicians could commit.If the backstop remains unchanged, this brinkmanship, this effort of call-my-bluff is not going to change peoples mind to back her deal.Ex-Cabinet minister Theresa Villiers added: Its frustrating that the Prime Minister is partially backtracking on her repeated statements that we would leave on March .But fundamentally it doesnt change the challenge that she has - she needs to get changes to the withdrawal treaty before it is capable of commanding support in Parliament.Without binding treaty change it is hard to see how the Prime Minister gets her majority and overturns what was the most signicant defeat for any government ever in the history of Parliament.Speaking in the Commons, veteran Brexiteer Peter Bone blasted: She has said  times that we will leave the European Union on March  -thats not possible, does she think the country will regard that as a betrayal John Baron warned: The Prime Ministers next steps will now make a good deal less likely because the EU will defeat No Deal and extend Article .Multiple ministers warned Mrs May they intend to vote for Ms Coopers amendmentshe doesnt give them an alternative way to block No Deal.Business Minister Richard Harrington, who had threatened to quit, crowed this afternoon: No Deal is dead.And rebel Cabinet ministers including Amber Rudd signalled they would stay in Government after the PMs U-turn.Civil servants have warned that the Cooper amendment would be an unprecedented power grab by Parliament, taking control of the Government away from ministers and putting it in the hands of MPs.If her deal falls for a second time next month, MPs are almost certain to vote against a No Deal outcome and opt to extend the Article  process instead.That would see Britain stay in the EU beyond the scheduled exit date of March , but the PM insists the delay would be no longer than three months.Mrs May would use the additional time to try and cut a better deal with the EU.She would also be likely to ramp up No Deal planning, in case her efforts failed and we left at the end of June without a withdrawal agreement.But Remainers would step up their efforts to secure a second referendum to overturn Brexit altogether.No hopes that the prospect of a delay to Article  will encourage Tory Brexiteers to back the PMs deal.Brexit-backing MPs may conclude that supporting the deal is the only way to ensure Britain actually leaves the EU.Mrs May has promised to hold a second meaningful vote on her Brexit deal by March .Today her deputy David Lidington hinted the showdown could be as soon as next week.The PMs legal chief Geoffrey Cox is in Brussels today trying to secure changes to the Irish backstop which could win over Brexiteers."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/NINTCHDBPICT000471966283.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"jeremy corbyns team have repeatedly spoken out against second referendum on brexit before suddenly backing one","story":"But he and his top team have spent the last two and a half years arguing against just that, saying they would respect the result and move on.The leftie boss now risks the fury of millions of voters who look set to turn their backs on him completely and never vote for his party again.Just last month he told ITV that Labour is not supporting or calling for a second referendum on the UKs EU membership.His spokesperson said it was not Mr Corbyns preferred optionhe cant get an election.After months of wrangling over whether to pledge it in his partys election manesto back in , they opted against it, and it read: Labour accepts the referendum result and a Labour government will put the national interest first.Shadow Foreign Secretary Emily Thornberry said last night that it should be a choice between Brexit and Remain.Back in  Emily Thornberry insisted: The British people have spoken.

First Labour announced the party is prepared to back a second EU referendum. Now Theresa May has outlined a formal plan to delay Brexit. There are still a lot of unknowns, and we dont know how itll end - with huge consequences for you and your family. All the while, No Deal Brexit preparations are continuing at a cost of more than poundmillion to hard-pressed British taxpayers. So what exactly has been announced, what does it mean, and what happens next Heres a basic guide. What has Theresa May announced today   Theresa May outlined a sht in her Brexit plans in a statement to the House of Commons.She unveiled a three-step plan that could lead to delaying Brexit . Those steps are:March : Vote on Theresa Mays Brexit deal. By this date, the government will hold a new meaningful vote on the -page Brexit deal. If it passes, Brexit happens with a deal, almost certainly on March  . If it fails, or theres no vote, move to step . March : Vote on No Deal Brexit. By this date, Theresa May will table a Commons motion asking MPs for their explicit consent to leaving the EU with no deal. If they give consent, we leave with No Deal on March . If they dont give their consent, move to step . March : Vote on delaying Brexit. On this date, MPs will hold a vote on whether to delay the date of Brexit by up to three months - to the end of June.Why has she done it now   The Prime Minister announced the major change in a desperate bid to head off a Tory revolt. Remain-backing ministers had lined up to warn theyd defy the government and vote to delay Brexit, as soon as tomorrow night. That could have forced around  ministers to resign. The Remainer Tories were prepared to back an amendment by Yvette Cooper, which said MPs should get a vote on delaying Brexittheres no agreement by March . By announcing her own plan , the Prime Minister has tried to take control of the process. The Tories will be whipping MPs to defeat the Cooper amendment tomorrow night, with No officials saying it raises constitutional problems about the relationship between parliament and government.Is delaying Brexit guaranteed   No. But its now more likely. Technically, we have to get through three votes before Brexit will be delayed. But the odds are on all those votes tipping towards delaying Brexit. Downing Street today insisted the focus and very strong preference remains on getting a revised Brexit deal. Attorney General Geoffrey Cox is in talks today with Brussels to revise the Irish backstop - a clause in the -page deal that could extend EU customs rules over the UK. But no big changes are expected, so the deals expected to be voted down - just as it was by a record margin in January. Then theres the vote on No Deal, but the Commons has already shown it has a majority on No Deal Brexit. There are some unknowns of course. We dont know yet how the government will whip its MPs to vote on a delay. Will they be told to back one  Or will ministers have to resignthey do   Theresa Mays Brexit deal was shattered by a record-setting -vote majority in January. Yet, whisper it, there is still a way the deal could pass. Now that shes dangling the prospect of a delay, Brexiteer Tories may feel so boxed in that they have no choice to accept Theresa Mays plan by March . Its not what they want - but it now looks like the only way to ensure Brexit happens on time on March . Of course, those Tories alone wont be enough to pass the deal. Theresa May has a tiny majority and there are plenty of Tory Remainers. But  Labour MPs showed last month theyre prepared to rebel to stop Brexit being delayed. If those forces unite, then technically, the deal could get through. No. And MPs are furious. Theresa May insisted that even after a delay, the choices we face would remain unchanged. Leave with a deal, leave with no deal, or have no Brexit. Labour MP Stephen Doughty said: This is yet more trickery from the PM. She’s still refusing to take no deal off the table legally or otherwise no matter what Commons says or does. It’s all just her way or the highway.  Yes. Theresa May said today she would seek the shortest possible extension, and not beyond the end of June. That dates been chosen because new MEPs take their seats from July , and the UK is supposed to have no MEPs by then. Yet the motion that gets put before MPs will, crucially, be amendable, No officials said today. That means MPs could force a longer delay on the Prime Minister, and she is committed to legislating for the result. Downing Street did, however, reject reports of a -month delay - saying its not been brought up by EU leaders in talks with the Prime Minister. Does this make a second referendum more likely   A second EU referendum has become slightly *more* likely in recent days, after Labour backed a bid to hold one. But overall, its still looking very unlikey. There arent enough pro-referendum MPs in Parliament to back one, and Theresa May continues to oppose the idea. She said today it would be isive for the country.  We dont know yet. Theresa May repeatedly refused to say how she will vote personally on a No Deal Brexit. And Downing Street officials refused to say how Tory MPs will be whipped on either No Deal, or a delay to Brexit. That means the government has promised these votes but we dont actually know what the governments opinion is on the outcome yet. What about the Spring Statement   Talk about timing! Chancellor Philip Hammond is delivering his Spring Statement to the House of Commons on Wednesday  March . Its expected to start at .pm and last around  minutes. It had been widely thought the Statement would be used to outline plans for No Deal spendingTheresa Mays deal failed. Despite the change, its understood the Spring Statement has not been moved - despite being scheduled for the same date as a vote on whether to agree or prevent a No Deal Brexit. If both are on the same day, the Spring Statement will come first, and the No Deal vote afterwards. However, the No Deal vote could be held first.  The move will deepen the calamitous split in the Tory party. Downing Street claimed there was broad Cabinet agreement for the plan today - but refused to sayit was unanimous. It came after Remain-backing ministers threatened to resign rather than allow a No Deal Brexit. But now that shes compromised, Theresa May has the Brexiteers to deal with. Backbench Tories lined up today, furious at the idea of a delay.My residents don’t want an extension of Article , said Giles Watling. It takes two to tango and it’s time the EU learned to dance.

It came as Theresa May told MPs the government had radically changed its Brexit policy to include formal plans to delay Brexit until as late as the end of June. Mrs May has insisted she wants to get a deal - despite the fact that the agreement she negotiated was comprehensively defeated by  votes last month. She has been frantically trying to get the EU to backtrack on the Irish backstop allowing the UK to unilaterally withdraw or for a time limit. But so far the EU has refused to budge. With less than five weeks until the expected exit date the PM still does not have a deal with can command a majority and no deal is looking more and more likely.   However she insisted:we have to we will ultimately make a success of a no deal - prompting open laughter in the Commons. But she admitted Cabinet papers due to be published today, which will outline the impact of No Deal, are honest assessment of the very serious challenges it would pose. Warnings about the danger of no deal have been growing in recent months. Yesterday the aerospace trade body said the risk of a no-deal Brexit was turning into a full-blown economic crisis. While the CBI have warned about the dangers of falling of a clf edge. CBI deputy director general Josh Hardie said: It must be averted. Every day without a deal means less investment and fewer jobs created. While the Institute of Directors interim director general, Edwin Morgan, said: Businesses have lost all faith in the political process and as those first in the firing line of no-deal, they deserve to know more. In her statement, the Prime Minister said MPs will be given the chance to vote on a short delay -there is no deal by mid-March. If the government has not won a meaningful vote on the -page Brexit deal by March , it will table a motion to be voted on by March , she said.

She confirmed that she will put her Withdrawal Agreement - including whatever additional assurances she has secured from Brussels - to a meaningful vote by March . If that fails, MPs will be offered two separate votes on the following days - one on a no-deal Brexit and,that is defeated, the other on requesting an extension to the two-year Article  negotiation process to delay EU withdrawal beyond March . The sequence of votes will be proposed in an amendable motion tabled by the Prime Minister for debate and vote in the Commons on Wednesday.   To uproar in the Commons, Mrs May told MPs: They are commitments I am making as Prime Minister and I will stick by them, as I have previous commitments to make statements and table amendable motions by specic dates. But she added: Let me be clear, I do not want to see Article  extended. Our absolute focus should be on working to get a deal and leaving on March . She told MPs: The United Kingdom will only leave without a deal on March there is explicit consent in the House for that outcome.

The Peterborough MP was driven at speed out of HMP Bronzefield in Ashford, Surrey, this morning after spending a month of her three-month jail term locked up. She has refused to quit Parliament despite being jailed for perverting the course of justice and expelled by Labour . The MP - who was tipped as a rising star, and allies claimed saw herself as a future leader - was jailed for lying to avoid a speeding charge. She is appealing her conviction. Onasanya, , sat in the back of a white Sodexo-branded Vauxhall with the closest window to her covered by a hi-vis jacket as it drove past photographers this morning.  During the time she spent in jail the former solicitor refused to stand down - which meant Parliament was forced to pay her around pound, of her pound,-a-year MPs salary. Meanwhile her lower-paid staff were forced to run her office in Peterborough without her. Yet the MP insisted she was innocent, comparing herself to Jesus and Moses in a leaked messaged to MPs when she was convicted in December. She wrote: I am in good Biblical company along with Joseph, Moses, Daniel and his three Hebrew friends who were each found guilty by the courts of their day. Now the Independent MP could become the first to vote in the House of Commons wearing an electronic tag, as the Mirror revealed earlier this month.  Under Parliamentary rules, Onasanya had to receive a jail sentence of at least  months to be automatically removed as an MP. However,she loses her appeal - for which a date isnt yet set - she could be removed from Parliament through a recall petition. Under this mechanism, she would face a by-electiona petition is signed by more than % of the electorate in the constituency. Labour is understood to be mounting preparations for a by-election.  Protesters outside her office earlier this month declared her a liar. Onasanya was jailed for three months at the Old Bailey on January  after being convicted of perverting the course of justice by lying to avoid a speeding charge. The MP with a once-promising career is continuing in her role, sitting as an Independent politician despite calls for her resignation.  Onasanya, a solicitor by profession, is expected to have to obey strict conditions as part of her early release. It came after the Attorney Generals Office ruled that her sentence was not unduly lenient following a complaint being lodged. Jurors at the Old Bailey were told that Onasanya colluded with her brother Festus after her car was clocked speeding at mph in a mph zone in the village of Thorney, near Peterborough, in July . She was sent a Notice of Intended Prosecution to fill out, but it was sent back naming the guilty driver as Aleks Antipow, an acquaintance of her brother, who was away visiting his parents in Russia. Festus Onasanya was sentenced to  months in prison after he pleaded guilty to three counts of perverting the course of justice over speeding, including over the July  incident.

Haris Khans mum Renata and dad Shakeel learned earlier this month that their son has type  Spinal Muscular Atrophy . The devastating genetic condition affects the nerve cells needed to control the muscles we use for moving, swallowing and breathing. Until November, the NHS funded a treatment named Spinraza, which has been hailed for the impact it has on patients. But it is no longer given to patients after the National Institute for Health and Care Excellencesaid it was too costly to recommend. Shakeel, , told the Manchester Evening News: This is England, its not a third world country.   My family are from Pakistan. Im born here, my dad had cancer removed the day Haris was rushed to hospital but we cant help a little kid whos six months old with a genetic illness  Only a hundred babies a year maximum need that treatment... we, as a country, are losing a hundred babies because we dont think its justied to save them. One in  people are a carrier of the faulty gene and in the most severe cases, such as Haris, children rarely live beyond two years, making SMA the leading cause of death in babies and toddlers in the country. Earlier this month, the parents of seven-year-old Kennedy Mercer described how the drug had changed her le. Her dad Paul said her twin brother Karter would still be aliveSpinraza was prescribed from birth. And Shakil Malji, whose baby daughter Maryam has been diagnosed with the same condition, told : Its terrible that theyve got something available that can treat a sick child and theyre not using it because of money.   The first British girl to receive it, Annabelle Rose Thomas came off breathing support, can swallow food and has even ridden a horse. It remains available in Scotland. Biogen, the company which makes the drug, charges almost pound, for it in the US market. It is offering Spinraza at a lower price of pound, for the first year in the UK, and offered an undisclosed discount to the NHS, but it was still not enough. That it is a heartbreaking decision to accept for Shakeel, Renata, , and Haris nine-year-old step-brother Marijus, who live in Wythenshawe.  On March , the Khan family and friends will be staging a peaceful demonstration outside the headquarters of NICE in Manchester ahead of a crucial meeting. It is expected NICE will announce a decision on whether to once again fund Spinraza on the NHS in England. Babies like Haris are being used as a bartering tool, he said. March  in Manchester is going to be such a big day for SMA-suffering families, becausethis drug is not approved, God only knows what were going to do for Haris. Its such tough times. Were not working now, Im self-employed, my we has had two jobs. But my phone is off - who needs money without a family  Any money in the world is nothingyou dont have a family to enjoy. The best I can do is to save my son, or keep us with us for as long as possible.  SMA has changed a lot in the last  years. Im speaking to people whove been treating their children for the last three or four years and got them to five-years-old with love and dedication. These people give me strength and inspiration that my Haris can do that as well. The world miracle is in our vocabulary for a reason - yes its very rarely used, but it does exist. This is what were clinging on to. From what I can see from Haris, he is fighting. He is fighting hard. When I see him eating, and hugging and smiling. I think I cant give up on you, otherwise Im not a responsible parent. It all seems a nightmarish turn of events from when Haris arrived in the world last August.  He was described as a happy, smiley, friendly baby by staff at Wythenshawe Hospital. But when a health visitor came for an eight-week check-up last Ocotber, she noticed Haris head movement was not normal. Shakeel says this is one of the key symptoms of SMA to look out for. He had no head control at all, its known as floppy baby syndrome, said Shakeel. Everything was floppy, arms, hands and legs. The health visitor asked for an urgent appointment, but Haris was not seen until December .  There he was diagnosed with hypotonia and recommended for physiotherapy once a week. The family believed he was progressing. But at the end of January, Haris became suddenly very ill with a cough and a cold. After several visits to their GP, Shakeel and Renata eventually became so concerned they rang an ambulance. Haris was rushed to Wythenshawe Hospital where his condition rapidly deteriorated and doctors said his respiratory system had collapsed. He was intubated and the family were then rushed back and forth between Alder Hey in Liverpool and back to Manchester due to a lack of available beds. After a week at Royal Manchester Childrens Hospital, the family believed Haris was improving.  In fact, he had been due to have his intubation tubes removed. But following further tests, the Khan family were given the devastating news. They said we need to get you to a meeting, said Shakeel. I walk into the room and something tells me somethings not right. Theres a family liaison, three neurologists, two consultants, a bed nurse and wing nurse. The week before the result, Id been talking to the nurses saying I can accept any result, because I already thought Id lost Haris. They start saying your son has spinal muscular atrophy. I thought spine, muscles, that makes sense because he cant hold up his head. Then they said Im sorry, theres absolutely no treatment and your son has three months to live.  I struggled to comprehend it. Am I actually hearing, what theyre telling me  Then they make it worse saying there was a treatment, its available in Scotland but not in England because the NHS stopped it. Shakeel says his family are doing their best to accept the verdict they have been given. At one stage, they were willing to move to Scotlandthat would give them any more chance of getting Haris the treatment. We would relocate in a heartbeatit meant we could save Haris, said Shakeel. We said to Marijus, we might move and he said he would go anywhere in the worldhe can save his one little, baby brother. Unfortunately, its not that simple. The family have been Scotland would not accept patients who have simply relocated and the treatment is only available for genuine residents. Shakeel says the specialist neurologist who diagnosed Haris is adamant he wont make it to his first birthday. Hes so negative. He never told me there is a baby with SMA type , the same as Haris, who is now two-years-old, said Shakeel. That wouldve been the little bit of hope I needed. My son is going to be dead in three months, Im just beginning my journey in parenthood, Im not going to get to take him to school. There is a one in four chance my next child will have this - we cant have any more children. I cant put an innocent child or my family through that. So for me, my son deserves the best possible care and attention. My family need all the love and support we can get. Fortunately, the Wythenshawe community had already stepped up and shown tremendous support for the Khan family. Every neighbour on their street has a poster in the window about SMA. St Peters primary school have supported Haris brother Marijus and the Rainbow Trust Childrens Charity are helping the family any way they can. Whatever the outcome for Haris and the decision on March , Shakeel and Renata dont want other families to go through the same ordeal. We might only have my Haris for a few months, so Ive got to create a legacy for him, said Shakeel. The NHS dont screen for SMA at birth. Had they screened him in August when he was born, the treatment was available until November on the Early Access Programme. Eighty infants are on that - Haris would have been . Thats one thing were calling for. The other campaign is for treatment for all types of SMA to be available in England, Wales and Northern Ireland.  Haris is the youngest child with SMA to feature on a leaflet being handed out to all MPs this week by the charity Muscular Dystrophy UK. Shakeel wants as many people as possible to be aware of the fight and support the cause. Every SMA parent is waking up thinking is this our sons last day  he said. My sons got the most severe type, thats why we were told he wont make it, they said they havent seen this type in a long time. Until a few weeks ago I thought SMA was a type of baby milk - now I understand what it is. Haris hasnt got a voice, thats why we have to speak up for him. The community is helping us, dont get me wrong - but the people that we need the help from is the NHS. A spokesperson for NHS England said: We understand how dficult and frustrating it is for families waiting for decisions to be taken on the funding of new treatments, which is why the company must price this drug responsibly and at a level which is both cost effective and affordable to the NHS. It is disappointing that Biogen chose to close the Early Access Programme for new patients with Spinal Muscular Atrophy Type  before the NICE assessment process had been completed.A JustGiving page has been set up to raise money to support the Khan familys campaign to improve awareness of SMA. It is also where Shakeel is posting updates on Haris and his battle.

Our customers find it incredibly useful because they can see what areas might impact them and how.Q - What are the main implications of Brexit for small businesses  A- Yorkshire Bank has identied three main implications Brexit might have on SMEs. Firstly, the labour issue. Secondly, tarfs that might be imposed.And thirdly, the volatility of sterling depreciation and generally unfavourable economic conditions.Q - Our geopolitical environment is uncertain. How should small businesses prepare for foreign exchange  A - Yorkshire Bank can provide a gauging capability, soan SME finds a fluctuation or volatility within exchange rates they should hedge against that and keep the margins on the core business and not take a currency risk.Yorkshire Bank advises SMEs to try to avoid foreign exchangethey don’t understand the impact of the exchange rate on purchases or sale, whether it be trade inside or out of Europe.Q - What small business industries will be most affected  A - Brexit might affect certain areas more than others, such as manufacturing, real estate, food and drink, retail and construction.

It was embarrassing. I felt like a pudding. Slimming World turns : Inspiring weight loss stories from last five decades I’ve always been an emotional binge eater. I was addicted to food – high-calorie pizzas were my downfall – and was regularly eating triple the recommended daily allowance. I hated looking at myself in a mirror, was embarrassed about my size, and felt depressed. Benjamin finally decided to shed the pounds when his now we Cara was ill with lipoedema and needed an urgent operation. The long-term condition leads to painful swelling in the legs, thighs, and buttocks. I had to be strong for her.

Over three weeks the app calculates information about the user in order to work out their inidualised calorie requirements as accurately as possible. This information allows the team to calculate the user’s basal metabolic rate and, when combined with their occupation and activity levels, works out their optimum calorie intake for weight loss.

Jon Barnes, , was viciously struck in the head with the sword which left him in a coma for  days. The sword left a wound across the left side of his head which needed more than  staples to seal. Mr Barnes spent more than a month in hospital and says he is lucky to be alive. Doctors told him he was a medical miracle but had to break the devastating news that he had been left blind in one eye as a result of the attack.  The labourer, from Winchester, Hants, was visiting a friend when he was attacked after an argument with one of the other people in the house. Mr Barnes was walking down the stairs of the property in Eastleigh, Hants, when he says he was struck from behind after seeing his assailant grab a sword from under a bed. Neighbours called police after hearing screams and officers dashed to the end of terrace property to be confronted with a bloodbath.  The hallway, which featured Christmas decorations, was covered in blood with a trail out onto the driveway. A neighbour, who did not want to be named, said: We heard people screaming and two ambulances arrived within minutes. When we looked outside there was blood everywhere. Mr Barnes was taken to Southampton General Hospital, where his condition was described as le-threatening. Police launched an attempted murder inquiry and made a series of arrests but no-one has yet been charged in connection with the near-fatal assault, which took place four days before Christmas.  Mr Barnes said: The thing I remember most is the blood, which went everywhere. I was dying on the floor. A neighbour came round with a towel and wrapped it around my head. If they hadnt done that I would have died. Describing the moment he woke up from a  day coma in hospital, Mr Barnes discovered he was blind in his left eye. He added: I put my hand over my other eye and couldnt see a thing. Ive been left with a huge scar on the side of my head and often feel very tired and depressed. He had no reason to do it. Mr Barnes and his partner,  year old Abi Howcroft, finally have something to celebrate - the arrival of their baby daughter Elsie-Rose on February .

Nigel Ryan, , was arrested after investigators from the North West Predator Hunters group posed as a teenager online - and caught him sending explicit pictures, reports Manchester Evening News.During what he thought was a conversation with the teenage girl, Ryan asked: ASL  which stands for age, sex and location. He ly claimed he was  and then sent the undercover investigator a GIF image with the caption nice arse.   Ryan, from Stalybridge, also said: I will FK you, asked for school unorm pictures then sent pictures of his genitals adding: I can get done for this. Later he arranged a meeting at the towns train station by pretending to be -year old girl who was vouching for him. In one message he said: You can have cigarettes and beer. The sex will good too. He was subsequently confronted by the group and they live streamed him being detained in a video. When officers searched Ryan, they found two Playboy condoms in his pocket plus two mobile phones and two cans of lager in his bag.  At Minshull Street Crown Court, Manchester, Ryan admitted attempting to meet a child following grooming and was jailed for  months. He initially denied any wrongdoing but has since been dumped by his shocked we. The incident happened last April after he contacted the fake profile set up in the name of Francesca via an app. Prosecutor Virginia Hayton said: This defendant contacted this user and believed the user. The first message started with the defendant saying ASL which stands for age, sex and location. He said he was . He askedthe girl was really  and she replied saying she was. He sent a GIF saying nice arse and then said I will FK you - he was effectively complementing her.  She said she was bunking off school and he responded: Are you really bunking off Messages continued between the defendant and the girl. He was asking her to send pictures of herself and send pictures in her school unorm. The prosecutor continued: When Francesca askshe has any pictures of himself he sends some to her. At one point he says to her I can get done so he knows what he is doing is unlawful. He asks what size clothes she is. She states in one message that they should not meet up but the following day she then receives messages from who she believes to be a -year-old girl, who was in fact this defendant. He wanted to pretend to be a girl of a similar age to enhance his chances of meeting - he sent messages saying that she knew him and it was fine to meet up.   An arrangement was made to meet on  April at .pm at Stalybridge station but the defendant was approached at the train station and was detained until police arrived. He later said he was flattered by her interest in him. He said that his we had bought the condoms and he just happened to have them on his person. In mitigation, defence lawyer Jane Greenhalgh said: This is an extremely complex case with a complex defendant at its heart. Since this incident he has been diagnosed with autistic spectrum disorder. His special needs have led him to feel isolated and this led him to use the internet to speak to people. He is married to a woman who also has special needs and at the time of these offences the relationship was breaking down. He has split from his we and his five children have been taken into care.  Sentencing Judge John Potter told Ryan: You corresponded with the person using two internet personas, one in your own name, in which you ly stated your age to be , and one fake one in which you posed as a -year-old girl. The purpose of your correspondence was to commit acts of sexual abuse and your wish to abuse the person you believed to be a -year-old child was made more evident by your actions. Having told Francesca you would buy her clothes you then used a fake internet profile to encourage Francesca to meet up with you. You told Francesca that the best thing she could do was to meet up with you when she could have cigarettes and beer, and the sex would be good. This encouragement displays in my judgement planning and sophistication. I do recognise that you suffer from mental health dficulties and I appreciate that they will make the custodial sentence that I am about to impose on you more dficult to deal with however these dficulties can make no excuse for your behaviour. You made concerted efforts to indulge in unlawful acts to young children. Those like you who are prepared to do this by for example travelling on a train to meet somebody you believe to be a -year-old child armed with alcohol and condoms expecting sexual activity behave with the sole purpose of satisfying their own perverted sexual gratication. Ryan was also issued with a Sexual Harm Prevention Order and was further ordered to sign the Sex Offender register for ten years.

The couple invited , family members, friends, politicians and celebrities to their special day back in . According to many of the guests one of the highlights of the glamorous event was Prince Harrys Best Man speech. Insiders claim the speech, which followed a delicious three-course meal, was funny and sweet, and even left bride Kate in tears. Royal author Katie Nicholl gave an insight into the special evening in her biography Harry: Le, Loss, andLove.   She said: It was affectionate, warm and funny and touched William deeply. The speech was peppered with Harrys classic sense of humour, and he ribbed his brother: William didnt have a romantic bone in his body before he met Kate, so I knew it was serious when William suddenly started cooing down the phone at Kate. Famous for his mimicry, Harry then impersonated his brother calling Kate Babykins, to much laughter from the guests. When he said the couple’s decade-longromance was his inspiration, there was a shy smile from Chelsy, while Kate shed a tear.   Prince William reportedly got his own back on brother Harry when he acted as Best Man at his wedding to Meghan Markle last year. The Duke reportedly told filthy jokes about wet knickers during the evening reception at Frogmore House. He also played a trick on Harry which almost floored some of the guests. Apparently Harry fell off a ladder while trying to change a lightbulb in the lead up to the wedding, so Wills tied a ladder to the back of the newlyweds car.

The claims come just days after  people were injured when a heating duct fell on guests at the venue. The kitchen worker, who asked to remain anonymous, worked at the Burnham-on-Sea Pontins between July and September last year. She claims Pontins kitchen and restaurant were poorly maintained and employees were left to work in dangerous conditions. She shared footage with Bristol Live , showing what look likes food on the floor, a damaged ceiling and leaking equipment.   The former worker claims the kitchens ceiling had water dripping down, the venues hot and cold drinks machines were leaking, blocked food chutes took days to be cleared, food was left out overnight and there were holes in the ground. I noticed scalding water was leaking from the machine, she said. I warned colleagues about this and informed the manager on sht that day who told me she would get the maintenance team to look at it . Three weeks later the machine was still not fixed and nothing had been done about it. The food chute was also blocked. This meant there was a horrible rotten smell lingering around the kitchen which was enough to make your stomach turn.   The place is filthy and usually at breakfast there is food left on the bain marie from the night before. This is because evening staff don’t clean it away. She said she wanted to share her experience after witnessing the chaos caused when a wall fell onto customers in the resorts main entertainment room. In a statement, aspokesman for the resortpreviously said: Following the recent incident at Brean Sands, we take the health and safety of all our guests and staff extremely seriously.

The mum said her one-month-old baby was left with a red singed scalp and a rash after she used Aldis Mamia Bed Time Bath to wash him. She told Teesside Live the infant started to scream and shake, so she rang health advice line  for help. And even worse, she said he suddenly became unresponsive and went floppy in her arms. She says she couldnt wake him and rang  before he was rushed to North Tees Hospital in Stockton.   Thankfully the tot recovered from his ordeal. His -year-old mum, who did not want to be named, reported the issue to the supermarket and then posted details of the incident on social media to make other parents aware. Aldi say it has not changed the formula of the product, and has asked for a sample so it can perform tests. The mums pictures appear to show the extent of the little boys red scalp, in a post shared thousands of times and which attracted thousands of comments from parents quick to thank her for making the issue public. She says shed used the product before with no problems but had opened a new bottle for bath time on Friday, February . At the end of his bath I lathered some up in the water and used it to give him a wash over just like usual and rinsed his hair with it. Minutes later he started screaming out of control, shaking, screaming.   When all the front of his scalp had completely dried out it looked singed. Due to me thinking his scalp was burnt, a huge rash and massive irritation, I lathered Sudocrem and he instantly settled. I knew his scalp must of then felt burnt and the Sudocrem had soothed it, so I rang  to see about going and getting him checked over. They asked me to keep him awake and check his breathing etc, they dispatched an ambulance and said to ring he became seriously worse, she said. Just moments later he became completely unresponsive, floppy lost all his colour and very clammy we couldnt rouse him at all for well over five minutes.  We rang  who told me to put him in the recovery position until the ambulance arrived and blue lighted him to North Tees. After being checked over in hospital, the family were allowed home. After putting her experiences online, she says, shes been left wondering whether the ingredients in the wash have been changed or whether the batch she bought the bottle from was a faulty one. I actually thought he was dying in my arms, said the mum, who describes the whole experience as one of the most frightening things she has ever been through. I tried to keep a clear head but every moment seemed like an age, she told Teesside Live. A little baby had a traumatic time and I don’t want another to go through that. Aldi are more than happy that I have brought this to their attention as they can investigate and proceed with recalling the batch of product. An Aldi spokesperson said: We are sorry to hear ofexperience and would like to reassure her that there has been no change to the formulation of this product since it launched two years ago. All of our baby and toddler products are rigorously tested before going on sale, but as with all cosmetic products, it is possible to develop an intolerance to a particular ingredient. We have spoken withand have asked to receive a sample of the product so we can investigate this fully with our supplier.

Laura Naylor, , has suffered from hip dysplasia for the last ten years and thought she was finally going to have the surgery that would change her le. The condition has forced the stay-at-home mum to stop working and she is left in agonyshe walks too far. But she believed the pain was about to come to an end when her application for NHS funding was accepted, reports Hull Live. On the form the mum-of-two clearly stated she smoked one cigarette in the morning and one in the evening. So after forking out pound on Thursday to get to a pre-assesement at Spire Hull and East Riding Hospital, she was stunned to be told by a nurse she couldnt have the operation - and needed to go through a non-smoking clinic for six months. “I was in shock,” said Laura, from Hornsea, East Yorkshire. “I didn’t say much at first and then tried to question why and what was going on.  “They knew I smoked, it was on the forms.   “I never once got told I had to stop smoking, I just got told I needed to cut back.” Spire Healthcare has said Laura’s eligibility for the procedure should have been identied by her GP. A spokesman said: “In this case the patient was transferred to us from Castle Hill and at pre-assessment it became clear that she could not be eligible for this operation due to the current rules set out by East Riding of Yorkshire CCG. “This should have been identied and highlighted by her GP and we have informed her of the steps that need to be taken before an operation can take place.”  With time spent at a clinic and the waiting process to be accepted for funding, Laura could potentially be facing a further two years to have the surgery. She said: “It’s the kids that suffer in the long run because I can’t go far and I can’t do much with them. I do as much as I can. I can have a good couple of days but then I need a day to recover. “I used to go running all the time and the kids would go on pushbikes and come with me, but I can’t do that anymore.” Laura used to work in a cafeacute but had to give up the job because the pain was too much to bear. Now, she is a stay-at-home mum and relies mostly on her parents and taxis to get her around. She said: “I used to work in a cafeacute but it just got to a point where it was too painful. Now, I just stay at home with the kids. All I want to do is go back to work. “I can’t go too far. If I go to get shopping I have to get a taxi back every single day. Everything I do revolves around taxis or asking my parentsthey can help.   “They took me to most of my appointments, but they work so I can’t rely on them all the time.” To rub salt in the wound, Laura found out thatshe had been living in Hull instead of East Riding her status as a smoker would not apply, as the Hull Clinical Commission Groupdoes not have restrictions to smoking. Laura said the dferent rules for separate catchment areas was barbaric. “It should all be the same for everybody,” Laura added. “If that person needs that operation they should have that operation. “It is ridiculous that because I live out of the catchment area and in East Riding that I can’t have that operation because I smoke two cigarettes a day. “Why doesn’t Hull have to do that  There shouldn’t be a dference when it comes to who is who, it should all be the same.” Hull’s CCG only has restrictions for surgery on a patients BMI and does not have a policy in place that restricts surgery for patients who are smokers. A spokesperson for NHS Hull CCG said: “Although we anticipate that the patient’s GP clinician would advise on the range of support in place to help people to give up smoking, NHS Hull CCG does not have a policy that restricts surgery for patients on the grounds of whether they smoke or not.” East Riding CCG , on the other hand, requires patients to go through a non-smoking clinic for a period of six months before NHS funding for surgery can be granted. Paula South, director of quality and governance   lead nurse at ERYCCG, said: “We know patients who smoke or are obese are at increased risk of suffering complications during or after their operation. “In October , the CCG introduced Health Optimisation to improve the health and wellbeing of our residents. For our patients who smoke or have a Body Mass Indexof  or higher, we provide support for a -month period to help them quit smoking or lose weight before any non-urgent surgery. “This helps to make sure our patients are in the best possible health when they go for their operation and able to recover better afterwards. After the -month period, or sooner,they stop smoking or lose the required weight, patients are eligible for referral to surgery. “There are a number of exemptions including patients who need urgent or emergency surgery, they will not have to wait.” Laura has said she will be sending a complaint to the Patient Advise and Liasion Service .

Floyd was covered in flees when he was found abandoned at the roadside near a puppy farm. Now the six-month-old Cockapoo is on the long road to recovery after he was treated by vets and taken to Anim-Mates rescue centre in Ash, Kent. Charity trustee Dennis White, who also cares for cats, rabbits and horses at the sanctuary, said Floyd was in the worst state among all the dogs they have had in the last year. The volunteer secretary said: It is horric. It was the vet that thought Floyd must have been kept in a cage, with a cruel restriction of movement.   It is very cruel to keep a puppy in such a small cage,that were the case, when he is supposed to be playing and running around. But the adorable pup has made fantastic progress at the centre, where he loves to play with the other rescue dogs and enjoys lots of cuddles. Dennis said: Floyd is a happy little puppy now - he is always playing with the other rescue dogs. He is just like any other normal puppy - he wants to play all the time and snf the ground and he loves cuddles. When rescued animals come to us you can see the happiness of their face. Floyd was covered in flees when he was abandoned but the vets took great care of him and when came to us and he was very happy.   Vets were told Floyd was found near a puppy farm in a horric condition. Dennis said: Puppy farms have a terrible reputation for breeding dogs and when they have finished with them, they try to get them rehomed or they dump them. We dont know what happened to Floyd before he was rescued but I understand he was found near a puppy farm.

There is a mixture of locally generated and continental sources coupled with light winds.” DEFRA guidance for very high air pollution said: “Older people, adults and children with lung problems and adults with heart problems should avoid strenuous physical activity.

The fight, captured on CCTV , saw fists flying before a white van driver intervened and separated them outside the east Hull shop.The violent duo were captured smacking each other and landing punches to each other’s faces in the scuffle which lasted almost  seconds. The owner of the shop, which captured the footage on its CCTV camera, was left appalled and he believes two “expelled students” were responsible.The man, who does not want to be named, told Hull Live : “These naughty boys come twice a week and that incident was to do with them lads.  “They’ve come in before and been cheeky in the shop and I’ve had to say to them that I’m not having any of this. The guy came in and bought a J and I think he tried to smash it over this kid. “These are youngsters who clearly don’t understand discipline. They have got all their lives in front of them and they need to respect each other. The footage, which was recorded on February  around .am, shows a teenager in a grey tracksuit loitering outside the shop when another teen and woman appear exiting the store. The departing teenager appears to throw a punch towards the other boy waiting outside the shop before the pair begin to violently swing at each other with the woman, who was wearing a pink jacket, trying to split them up. One of them falls to the floor with the other brutally hitting him as he lies on the ground.   More passers-by then appear to try and break up the fight but the pair then begin smacking each other with one man’s trousers starting to fall down during the scuffle. The two of them eventually break away from each other and move to the pavement outside the shop before one starts savagely beating up the other with people standing and watching the commotion unfold. A white van driver eventually pulls up with two men rushing out of the vehicle to break up the fight. The van then leaves and the fighting pair go their separate ways with one man seen pulling off his top so friends can seemingly inspect his injuries. “I don’t think anyone suffered any serious injuries but you just don’t expect that kind of behaviour on the street,” the shopkeeper said. “I’m just glad the white van man who was passing by got there when he did to stop it. Massive thanks must go to him.”   The shopkeeper believes the youngsters involved in the fight have been expelled from schools in the area and he is amazed neither of the pair suffered le changing injuries due to the brutality of the punches thrown at one another. “I’m just worried because these youngsters could have been really badly injured and they could have suffered injuries which would have damaged them for le, he added. “That glass bottle could have really hurt somebody and that is a weapon. It’s just a shame to think people are going around fighting each other and I think youngsters nowadays need to be disciplined. Street fighting seems to be on the increase in Hull and I’m not sure what is going on. It’s concerning for me and for members of the public because they just want to make sure they are safe when they go out.” The shopkeeper said Humberside Police has been informed about the attack and anyone with information should contact them on .

The -year-old from Woolwich will receive pound, to literally do nothing but enjoy  duvet days. Earlier this year, Mari had been working as a print designer at a fashion brand, but knew she needed to find a better work-le balance. She explained: I was working full-time in an office, commuting long hours, juggling family commitments, not to mention maintaining a social le, or even finding time for myself!

She has also undergone liposuction on the stomach, inner and outer thighs, a bum lt, fillers under the eyes, jawline filler and Botox. And after having all the procedures, the attorney says she now feels like a real princess. “When I look in the mirror, I’m happy again. I still see me, but a better version of me, she said.   Xochytl started her quest for perfection after giving birth to daughter Isla nearly two years ago. She felt self-conscious over how her clothes fitted and felt that no matter how much make-up she put on or how she dressed, she would ‘never be presentable’. It was then that she started admiring the beauty and regal class of Duchess of Sussex and became determined to look more like the royal figure. She said: “I really like her, I have always thought she was a classy person, she’s very relatable and I think she’s absolutely beautul.  “Beauty wise I thought she was a gorgeous, then on a personal level through getting to know her a little more I guess it did enhance my admiration for her. “Knowing the things she went through, that she didn’t grow up with the perfect le and with family struggles made her even more relatable.” And the mum has even noticed Isla,  months, now shouts ‘mommy, mommy’ whenever seeing pictures of Meghan. Xochytl added: “I’m at the point where I feel I can put myself out there in the world again.  “Previously I felt no matter how much make-up I put on or how I fixed my hair that I wasn’t properly presentable. “I had very big self-confidence issues, but now I feel I can put on a nice dress and don’t need to wear much make-up because I feel great. “I still wear the same sized clothing but they fit perfectly now, I don’t have big long rolls hanging out of my pants anymore. “I don’t think I look identical to Meghan Markle, but I do see our similarities a lot more now, my nose definitely resembles hers more closely.  She continued: “I also had fillers in my jawline to have a stronger jaw like she does, so I do feel I more strongly resemble her now. “I got out of it what I wanted and I see more of a resemblance to her, whenever my -month-old sees Meghan she looks at her and says ‘Mommy, mommy’. “When it happened I just kind of laughing, but it also makes me feel good, like ‘Ok, maybe I can pass for her’ but to me it’s just funny. “The way I carry myself on a daily basis has changed - I like going out again, being in public and feeling good about myself.”  Dr Franklin Rose, of Utopia Plastic Surgery  Med Spa, performed the surgery on Xochytl in November last year. Xochytl’s new look was unveiled at a High Tea event in Houston, earlier this month, during which she felt more empowered than ever. The mum said since her surgery children Brandon, , Kai, , and little Isla have benefited all the more as she has more energy. She added: “When my surgery was unveiled it felt like I was the Princess for the day, it was a great experience and I really enjoyed it. “I feel very self-assured and very confident now. I don’t have to try on five dferent outfits every day before figuring out what I want to wear now too.   “I can throw on the first thing I pick and know I look great, there is a new sense of confidence that Doctor Rose helped me to achieve.” Dr Rose said: “Meghan Markle arguably is one the most famous of all the royals at the present time. “She is always in the news and she is very pretty, like the actress Grace Kelly when marrying the Prince of Monaco. “Meghan Markle is very pretty so people want her nose. “Xochytl says herself confidence is through the roof and she feels great about herself now - plastic surgery has this tremendous, positive effect on body image and self-esteem. “She resembled Meghan Markle before but now looks even more like her.

The latest screenshot from the website which has caught peoples attention shows a man doing something very, very rude at the side of the street. Standing on the side of a road in Latvia the man obviously saw the Google camera car coming so decided to pull his trousers down and flash his bottom. The prankster is standing outside a building on a grass verge wearing black jeans and a white top.   He stayed in his cheeky position as the car drove past, meaning it caught his prank perfectly. Last month Google Map users spotted something a lot more sinister on a Russian beach. The shot seems completely normal at first glance, showing a woman playing by the water with two children. The woman and little girl, who is wearing a red dress, are playing by the water with the little boy sitting further back on the sand. While it seems to just be a nice family day out,you look closely the figures arent solid and appear transparent.  Shots from nearby show a beach covered in umbrellas but there is nobody  in sight. There is also a large building, but it appears to be boarded up and derelict. While some might suggest the figures are ghosts , its likely that the strange image has just been caused by a technical issue.

The giant Fernandina Tortoise, which had not been seen since , was found last month on the remote volcanic island of Fernandina in the Galapagos. But with the only other specimen ever found a dead male collected at the turn of the century, news of the historic discovery was muted by the fact that, unless another male is found soon, the species would die out with her. But Forrest Galante, the biologist and Animal Planet presenter who led the expedition, today said the female could still save her species - because of her amazing ability to keep fertile sperm until she needs it. And he said that as the tortoise, now named Fern and aged around , gains weight and becomes healthier now she’s in captivity, she could surprise conservationists by laying eggs using decades-old sperm without the need to find a male suitor.   Speaking to , he said: “Its incredible, but female tortoises are able to withhold viable sperm within them for decades, then produce offspring without having to mate a second time. “Because she’s been under such extreme environmental stress, she’s thin, she’s relatively dehydrated, she wouldn’t have laid eggs because that’s too much of a biological resource for her to expend, and her body would have retain the sperm inside of her. “But now she’s in captivity, eating, drinking, and gaining weight, she could easily produce viable offspring without having to mate a second time. “Nobody knows anything about the Fernandina tortoise because it’s the first one ever found, but given the harshness of the environment and the uniqueness of the animal, it’s certainly possible that she is able to hold viable sperm for  years. “We won’t know until she begins to lay eggs.” The animal was captured during an expedition funding by TV channel Animal Planet for the series Extinct or Alive, which Forrest presents.  He said the trip to the remote island of Fernandina, about  miles off Ecuador’s mainland and featuring the La Cumbre volcano, one of the most active in the world, came after years of meticulous planning. Forrest said: “A couple of things led me to believe there was a chance the Fernandina tortoise wasn’t extinct.In  a man named Ross Tysler found tortoise droppings on a dferent part of the island. “And locals said they might have seen a tortoise up on a clf from the shore. So there were a couple of very small clues. But to me the thing that told me the tortoise could be there was the fact that nobody goes to the island, it’s so remote and such a harsh environment and permission to step foot on the island is next to impossible to obtain.”  Forrest and his team, along with Galapagos National Park Ranger Jeffery Malaga and the director of the Galapagos Conservancy, Washington Tapia, began the expedition with a -hour boat ride from Santa Cruz, the capital of the Galapagos islands. He said: “Once we got there we had to make land, through swells in a small dinghy, and literally hop off of the boat onto the shore, with all of our camping gear. “We then hiked for a day to build camp. There are no trees in the area, it was about  degrees, with heat radiating up from the ground because it’s a volcano, and the equatorial sun beating down on you. The conditions were extremely harsh.” The team began by hiking up to the top of the volcano in order to survey the island and look for possible places where tortoises might be living. Forrest said: “I identied some green spaces, which were incredibly isolated because of the lava flows. I knew getting to each green space would be very slow and very treacherous. “We hiked back down the volcano to camp, slept the night, and on day two started before dawn, hiking for about six hours over the lava fields to the first green patch. “Absolutely amazingly, within just a couple of hours of getting to the green space, we found tortoise scat, then an active bedding site. “By now I’d become so hyper-focused on my mission that for the first time in days I forgot the fact I had massive sunburn and partial heatstroke, and that I was soaking in sweat and everything .About  minutes later, we we spotted her hiding under a bush.   Describing the moment he found the tortoise, Forrest said: “It was an overwhelming sense of excitement and accomplishment, bigger than words can describe really. “This incredible feeling of finding an animal that the world had forgotten about came over me and the rest of the team.” He said the tortoise could have been completely alone, surviving on the patch of habitant encircled by lava flows, for up to  years. Foorest added: “She has been on her own for a very long time, she is over  years old, probably around  judging by her features.  “Whether there has been another animal in that patch in the last century or not I really can’t say.It’s certainly possible that the patch was five or six times the size it is today, and that a recent lava flow wiped out all the animals, and she just got lucky. “It’s also possible that another tortoise could have been there with her for thirty or forty years and then died. Or she could have been completely on her own for a human letime - there’s no way to judge that. Forrest is now turning his attention to finding a male suitor for Fern.  He said: “We spent two more days looking for a male but didn’t find another inidual. “There are several other patches of green space on the island.Because it’s a volcano there are these massive lava flows which a tortoise cannot cross, and which separate these small pockets of habitat.So my guess is there could be other tortoises in these places. “Now the world’s attention has turned to Fern funding is being collected for a future expedition to try to locate a male.  “That would be the best way to keep the species alive. Butwe can’t find one, there’s still hope.We could mate her with another male from another nearby island, so you would have a tortoise which is very genetically close to the Fernandina tortoise and aesthetically identical. “Or she could surprise us by using sperm she’s kept inside her for decades and just start laying eggs. That would be just incredible.” "},{"url":null,"title":"mums touching gesture 200 passengers","story":"NewsMums touching gesture to  passengers in case baby cries on -hour flightA mums incredibly sweet gesture ahead of a -hour flight has gone viral after it was revealed on social mediaShareCommentsByCourtney PochinAudience Writer:,  FEB NewsA mum make an incredibly sweet gesture to passengers ahead of a -hour flight \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailIf youre a parent, youll know that travelling with children is no easy task.

interest in the units – including an offer on the retail block – the facilities are still to find occupants.Neither unit is currently under offer, according to listings on Ryden’s website.This is despite both being prepared by builders for “immediate occupation” to make them lucrative to would-be occupants.It has been suggested in some circles that Dundee City Council’s insistence on occupants of the city’s new Waterfront development paying a “living wage” has put firms off.The council pays its staff wages that align with the Living Wage Foundation’s benchmark.In Scotland, this is currently £ an hour, higher than the National Living Wage of £. that is set for adults over  by the UK Government. vw, px\"  One business source told the Tele: “You would have thought the station would have opened with the units occupied.“I think part of the issue is the living wage. If, for example, a big company didn’t pay the living wage but wanted to move into Dundee, it would have to agree to pay it.“That could make things dficult for them as it would set a precedent for their stores where in the UK.”Despite the apparent lack of interest, “discussions with the council about prospective tenants” are ongoing, according to one partner in the estate agency.The Tele understands supermarket chain Sainsbury’s had considered the station’s retail unit, but has opted to open its first city centre “Local” shop on Perth Road.A number of other supermarkets and coffee shop firms approached for comment by the Tele say they have no plans for the units.Bill Marley, a partner with Ryden, said at the time of the station’s opening that the agents were working “closely” with Dundee City Council to market the units.Ryden is also responsible for marketing the full range of units across the £ billion Waterfront project.Dundee City Council was approached for comment ahead of going to press."},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/02/5c7539cf03cca2.14557126.jpg ","title":"gordon forrest says dundee united fans vital in championship promotion push","story":"Dundee United fans have been told they’re not just appreciated, they’ll be vital as the Championship promotion race reaches its climax.That’s the view of Tangerines assistant boss Gordon Forrest, who admits since ing to Scottish football last month he’s been blown away by the level of support Arabs give their team.Well over , headed for Falkirk on Saturday and, despite a small travelling support expected and the top two in the ision meeting in Dingwall, tonight’s clash with Inverness Caley Thistle at Tannadice will boast the biggest turnout in the second tier.While those kind of crowds can have a positive effect on the opposition, Gordon believes the positives of being the best-supported team in the ision easily outweigh any negatives.“The fans have been absolutely magnicent, particularly in the away games,” said the former Vancouver Whitecaps coach.“When the players are coming out for their warm-up, during the game, you can see the stands are packed.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.

Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article14036524.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_swr_ayp_130219hospice2.jpg","title":"ayrshire hospice marks 30th birthday","story":"NewsAyrshire Hospice marks th birthday as staff and volunteers reflect on three decades of serviceThe milestone birthday has been marked with a series of events and celebrations.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  FEB News \"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailFor  years it has touched the lives of thousands in Ayrshire and far beyond.

Liam Ewing told jurors: “You have heard how the girl described screaming as he raped her.” He added: “I ask you to examine the evidence. She goes into a lot of detail about what happened to her. I invite you toa guilty verdict.” The alleged victim, who is now , claimed that Curdy, , from Ayr, raped her three times. She alleged that on each occasion he whispered to her afterwards” If you tell anyone I will kill you and your mum.” Curdy, who is on trial at the High Court in Glasgow, denies raping her on ious occasions between April  and August , , at a house in the South of France. Mr Ewing told the jury that the Crown is relying on testimony from the girls mother, who is , to corroborate the rape. She alleges that Curdy also raped her in August  in the South of France. The mothers allegation, which he denies, is not before the jury. Under Scots Law alleged crimes against children committed in another country can be prosecuted here, but not those against adults.

Defence counsel Lorenzo Alonzi told the jury: “If you apply the law, you will find that the correct verdict in this case is acquittal.” Mr Alonzi said in his closing speech that there was absolutely no independent evidence in this case – only the allegations of the girl and her mother. He went on: “There is no DNA evidence, there is no torn clothing, there is no medical evidence and no witnesses who heard screams. “The idea that there was this monstrous threat to kill her and her mum, it doesnt stack up.” Curdy claimed that the two woman made up the allegations about him after he demanded theof his pound, gold and diamond Rolex watch.

In fact, on average, Borderers are forking out pound less than their Northumbrian opposite numbers.Since First Minister Nicola Sturgeon announced the end of the freeze in , Scottish Borders Council has taken full advantage of the ability to raise council tax by % each year, and this year is no dferent, as the council agreed to a three per cent increase in December .However, the deal agreed by the SNP and Scottish Greens allows councils to raise tax by up to . per cent for  .Council leader Shona Haslam, who represents Tweeddale East, has been adamant that Scottish Borders Council will not take advantage of the increased limit, and will not raise an extra . per cent on Borderersrsquo council tax, instead sticking to an increase of three per cent.Council will not introduce workplace parking levy:Scottish Conservatives in the Borders have been very vocal about their opposition to the Scottish Government plans to introduce a workplace parking levy, where employers will be charged an annual tax based on how many parking spaces they provide for their employees.The aim is to persuade more commuters to use public transport in a bid to reduce pollution, but the charge could lead to employers passing the bill onto their employees.Both councillor Haslam and Scottish Borders Councilrsquos SNP opposition leader Stuart Bell, who both represent the rural ward of Tweeddale East, have signalled their opposition to the plans, so it is extremely unlikely this will feature in the councilrsquos budget proposals.Borderers who travel to Edinburgh for work could possibly be affected by the levy though, as Edinburgh City Council is considering implementing the charges.A move to three-weekly bin collections:Rumours have been circulating amongst councillors that Scottish Borders Councilrsquos waste refuse collection service will move to three-weekly bin collections, from the current once-a-fortnight collectionThe local authority is currently reviewing its waste collection service, which is expected to feed into the new budget for  .In fact, at a meeting of the council in October , Selkirkshire councillor Gordon Edgar, the authorityrsquos executive member for roads and infrastructure, refused to rule out the possibility when questioned by Hawick and Denholm councillor David Paterson.,params: .pushThe veteran Hawick councillor said: ldquoIf they go to a three-weekly collection it would cause some very serious problems for many of the people that we represent and I am sure it would increase the incidents of fly tipping.No tourism tax:Another controversial aspect of the SNP Scottish Greens budget proposals is the introduction of a tourism tax on nightly accommodation.Much like the workplace parking levy, local authorities have discretion over whether to implement it or not, and again Scottish Borders Tories have ruled out introducing it here.Changes to grass cutting services:Grass cutting, or the lack of it, has been a constant thorn in the side of the council over the past year.As an issue which caused a large furore, Scottish Borders Council could well announce further changes to the grass cutting regime, particularly around the maintenance of cemeteries.Changing the frequency of grass cutting from a -day cycle to a -day cycle was widely criticised by communities, with residents reporting overgrown public spaces and ankle-high grass in the regionrsquos cemeteries.Many opposition councillors have called for a rethink on the councilrsquos grass cutting policy, and due to the large number of complaints from Borders resident it is expected to be addressed in Thursdayrsquos budget announcement."},{"url":null,"title":"sos-to-keep-youth-club-afloat","story":"AN SOS has been issued in a bid to keep a village youth club open.Walkerburn Youth Club needs adults who have an interest or experience in working with young people to get in touch.The club meets at the Public Hall every Thursday evening from . to pm -

and a foot-tapping reminder of the swinging sexism of the late s.For anyone who enjoys those wonderful kitchen-sink dramas of the decade - A Taste of Honey, Saturday Night and Sunday Morning, or Poor Cow - this is for you.Although, in fairness, at times it feels more Sid James than Shelagh Delaney as the humour and slapstick of Carry On provide plenty of laughs.And for anyone, like myself, who doesnt already know Made in Dagenham the Musical, dont despair... the songs, like the early Ford Cortinas, are instantly adorable.Kirsty Cleland has all the allure of a young Rita Tushingham as she enchants, enthrals and entertains in the lead role.As a strike-leader and long-suffering we, the Galashiels actress is both convincing and commanding.And the ever-reliable Stuart Mitchell, who plays hard-done-by husband Eddie, has to be at the top of his game not to be outshone.But, in true socialist fashion, Made in Dagenham the Musical isnt just about the leads... everyone has their part to play - and how well they play it.Tracy Borthwick is having a blast as the potty-mouthed Beryl.And Amanda Blacklock is pitch perfect as the hapless Clare who attempts to keep up with the flow of double-entendres.Ellen McFadzen, with her Viv Nicholson hair-style and shortening mini-skirts, is a delight as sassy Sandra.And the shopfloor resolve is perfectly pitched by Ellen Halliday, as Cassie, and Julie Craig, as Connie.Relationships, friendships and even governments are tested in this factual story which, historically, helped females eventually earn an equal footing when it came to filling up pay packets.Robin Murray could challenge Mike Yarwood with his hilarious performance as Harold Wilson.And hes regularly brought down a peg or two by the feisty Rachel Inglis as Barbara Castle.Made in Dagenham the Musical is a battle of the classes as much as the sexes, with Jodie Millar and Yvonne Mitchell providing some gentried grace.The dialogue is a delight, the foot-to-the-floor pace is perfect, and the choreography, costumes, straight from Carnaby Street, and score makes sure this is a production that will strike a chord for decades to come.But for any musical production to be a success, it needs songs.From the brilliant opening scene, this show doesnt disappoint.Busy Women, Everybody Out and Viva Eastbourne are nothing other than tremendous encore numbers that bring out the very best of this talented cast.But perhaps the highlights are Julie Craigs sensational take on the riveting Same Old Story, Rachel Inglis reaching the high notes in the incredible Ideal World, and the delightful duet of Stuart Mitchell and Kirsty Cleland with the making-up masterpiece Im Sorry, I Love You.Made in Dagenham the Musical is a celebration of women fighting for their rights.While it succeeds, this move away from the comfort zone is more of a testament to just how good Selkirk Musical Theatre Company has become.If you havent yet got your tickets... join the picket line quickly and dont be disappointed.Made in Dagenham the Musical runs every night this week at .pm with an additional matinee performed on Saturday at pm.CASTRita OGrady -

Now, with less regulation in place, there are thousands.’True to the name, Viola FC is a family-run agency # his son Johnny joined its ranks in early  # with their main work both in representing players coming to the UK, and ‘brokering’.John explained: ‘We mostly represent footballers transferring to the UK, while brokering involves working with clubs, players and other agents to help bring those players here.‘That said, we have done a lot of work in countries such as Brazil and China in recent years, where there is a huge appetite for football. You make valuable contacts and get to see some exciting players.’However, for John the image of the football agent thrashing out a lucrative deal for himself as well as for the player, fails to tell the whole story.He explained: ‘Of course working in football can be financially rewarding, but it’s a hard job. People think you’re just walking around in a suit with a laptop and phone, but so much goes into being a player representative.‘You need to travel a lot, and that means lots of airport lounges and hotel rooms.‘You’re working long days and doing lots behind the scenes, and all year round,  because that’s what it takes.‘The public see the excitement of the transfer windows on TV and then think that’s all agents do.‘If an agent does their job properly, they are available day and night, looking after the whole package for the player, like houses and children’s schooling.‘We’re more than a ‘necessary evil’, we do an important service for both the club, and the player.’Thinking about Campbeltown visits again, John brings up a memorable trip to the Wee Toon, where his son Johnnybecame an unofficial pool champ.John said: ‘My uncle John took us to the Commercial Inn to watch a game of football on the TV. Johnny was only young but he ‘won’ a pool competition in the pub.‘Of course, the adults had let him win, but he believed for about ten years he was the pool champion of Campbeltown!‘That’s just one but I have lots of good memories of visiting Campbeltown, and the surrounding areas, such as Machrihanish.#For me Kintyre is a special part of Scotland.’Reflecting on a career in football of more than  years, including representing many Celtic and Rangers players, his hunger as an agent remains.John, whose recent travels include talent-scouting missions to Portugal and Ghana, added: ‘I am blessed to do this job. I have made some great personal connections and am even godfather to some players’ children.I grew up in Easterhouse, and now I get to work with top players and managers, visiting great stadiums. It’s not bad to be able to say that.‘At the same time, I know I have worked hard for those opportunities and I don’t take them for granted.’John Viola with his son Johnny centre and former client, and now colleague, Craig Moore in Ghana."},{"url":null,"title":"letter district news disappoints","story":"I note that for the second week running the Islay section of the Courier#sIs this now Courier policy Are we to have a regular feature on the wonderful works and world of the all-conquering Alastair to sit alongside his weekly SNP bad letter It was said of Alan Reid in his days as MP that he would attend the opening of an envelope Alistair Redman could give him lessons.A Google search for our beloved councillor produces Alastair Redman archives # Campbeltown Courier as the th result, after two for ArgyllThere seems to me to be an uncomfortably close association between our local paper and a local politician.Tony WilliamsGrumpy Old ManMuasdale"},{"url":null,"title":"letter maintain tarberts social housing","story":"The issue that I hear about the most, from ward members in Tarbert, is the need for new social housing and the importance of maintaining and improving the existing housing stock.While the four new houses that are planned are welcome many residents have quite rightly said that many more are needed.Both externally and internally, housing must be improved including repairing and repainting the hallways that link many housing association flats.There have also been calls to rollout external wall insulation across all of the social housing in Tarbert, and while there has been a start on this clearly more needs to be done.As a social housing tenant myself I know all to well the dficulties in getting housing associations to act on concerns raised by tenants.I continue to press for more and better social housing across the Kintyre and Islands ward.Councillor Alastair Redman,Portnahaven,Islay."},{"url":null,"title":"letter support the raf benevolent fund","story":"Last month’s vandalism at the Bomber Command memorial highlighted the very worst and the very best of our communities.I cannot thank your readers enough for their incredible support in the wake of this shocking paint attack.To date we have received more than £, in donations to help the RAF Benevolent Fund meet the repair bill.Repair works have now been completed on the memorial and it is now ed to its former glory.As well as the donations received, the RAF Benevolent Fund had thousands of messages of support from around the world.It was heart-warming to see the regard in which the memorial, the veterans and the , men it stands to represent are held.We must never forget their sacrices and the RAF Benevolent Fund is proud to beof this tribute to their legacy, for generations to come.As the Fund enters its th year of support for the RAF family, we must not forget those veterans who are still with us.Our aim this year is to ask for the public’s help in reaching more of these veterans and their families, while we still can.Our support could help pay for the care costs of an RAF widow, or provide for mobility aids to keep an elderly veteran at home, or simply allow a veteran to enjoy his retirement in dignity and comfort, through a regular financial grant.Put simply, the RAF Benevolent Fund looks after the RAF family.

But spring still feels like a long way off.I crave it, not just because it makes the evening walks in the woods possible once more, but because of the beauty it s to the landscape.The land is still dormant, with nature seemingly sleeping. Itrsquos at this time of year that the ugly results of peoplersquos disregard for the land can be most clearly seen. Litter of all kinds lsquodecoratesrsquo the roadsides. In summer it is partly hidden as hedges, roadside bushes and grasses grow. But in winter nature retreats and exposes the extent of peoplersquos uncaring behaviour.I canrsquot understand it, I really canrsquot. Our country is so beautul, yet so many people just throw rubbish from their car window. Do they not see the results and feel a sense of shame and horror  In a country where we have the facilities to dispose of our rubbish, there is simply no excuse to trash our landscape like this.And in a time when there are cuts to vital services, councils having to pay money to pick up peoplersquos rubbish from the sides of roads is just another unseen effect. Itrsquos not just that itrsquos ugly to look at, itrsquos polluting our environment, killing wildle and leaving an appalling legacy for our children.And so as we set off last Sunday for a walk, the sight of litter strewn everywhere along the roadside was quite depressing. And my children noticed its ugliness too. ldquoWhy do people litter like this  I was asked by my five-year-old Skye, and to be honest I struggled for an answer.ldquoI really donrsquot know, but it must be because they donrsquot care.My daughter seemed forlorn at this reply as we drove past a mass of discarded fast food remains, plastic bottles, beer bottles, plastic bags and yet more fast food rubbish.But I wanted to lt her spirits and so told her we were going on a hunt for something beautul. We were on a snowdrop hunt! And so as we drove to our destination, I reminded them of my version of the old story:lsquoMany years ago, Snow had no colour. It felt ashamed and left out to be colourless, especially when the land was so beautully covered in flowers of all dferent colours.And so Snow asked the flowersthey would be willing to share just a little of their colour. First Snow asked the daffodils, who were a beautul yellow. But they said no, they needed all their colour for themselves.Then Snow asked the bluebells, who were a wonderful blue. But they said they were too small to share any of their colour.Then Snow asked the whin bushesthey could share some of their vivid yellow, and they said no because they needed the colour.Snow even asked the roses of summer, but got the same answer: no.Then Snow heard a small voice and looked down. It was a small white flower. We can share some of our colour, with you it said.ldquoBut you are so small and you need your colour for yourself, said Snow. ldquoYes, the flower replied, ldquowe are small and we need our colour, but there are many of us andeach one of us gives a little then we can give you enough colour.ldquoThat is very kind of you but I donrsquot want to ruin your beautul appearance, said Snow.ldquoDonrsquot worry, said the wee white flower, ldquowe can all take a little colour from the inside of our petals, so it will not be noticed that any white is missing.rsquoAnd so that is how Snow became white. And because of the kindness shown by this little flower, Snow agreed to share its name with it, and so they became known as snowdrops.Snow also shared its space with the wee flower, so snowdrops and snow are often seen on the ground together. Andyou look carefully inside the snowdrop, you will see the hidden part where the white has been scraped off to give to Snow.With the storyrsquos end we arrived at Smeaton Lake, near East Linton, our destination for the snowdrop hunt. Itrsquos such a beautul place where a planted wood stands guard by a lake created  years ago. The woodland here is possibly unsurpassed in East Lothian for the canopy of snowdrops it displays.Excited screams at small patches of the flower soon gave way to ldquowow, look as we reached the end of the waterside and a wood carpeted by the wee flowers.My spirits were lted as I watched my daughter carefully examine flowers for evidence they had shared their colour. She showed her wee brother the green strips inside, explaining that is where the white was shared from. Both were careful not to damage or pick the flowers, despite their desire to do so.ldquoWersquoll find some growing in a less happy place and take those ones home, I assured them.And so we eventually headed back, a delicious bowl of ice cream at The Goth in Prestonpans, accompanied by traditional music, the reward for a good dayrsquos hunting.That night my daughter was reflective. ldquoI wish people wouldnrsquot spoil nature, she said. I felt guilty shersquos only five, I thought to myself, and shouldnrsquot have to be concerned about such things at that age. Perhaps I should have kept my thoughts to myself.ldquoBut I wonrsquot, and Irsquoll tell my friends not to as well. Can you tell me the snowdrop story again  So I told her the story once more.She had one wee snowdrop in a bowl by her bed. We had found it growing precariously at the verge of the road, surrounded by litter, and she wanted to lsquosaversquo it. So we did, hopefully with roots intact.ldquoWell we will plant the snowdrop in the garden and perhaps we will have our own snowdrops next year! I said to her, and she was happy at this.I went downstairs as she slept. My thoughts and emotions flooded me. My anger and depression at the ignorant mess we are making of our planet was superseded by my daughterrsquos determination to make a small dference, just like the snowdrop in the story.And perhaps therein lies the true message of that old tale: a dference can be made,we all do a little, but do it together.The children are the future, but letrsquos not leave all our ugly mess and destruction to our children to deal with. Let us all do something small, as many already are, to change the way we behave and how we appreciate what we have been gted.For our childrenrsquos sake, I really hope itrsquos not too late."},{"url":null,"title":"single-primary-school-plan-for-prestonpans-to-go-ahead","story":"The proposal to close the two schools and establish a new primary school covering nursery to P, operating from the existing school sites, followed a public consultation.Councillors agreed to progress the plans at a meeting of East Lothian Council on December .This decision needed to be ratied by Scottish Ministers.The new school will follow a single curriculum and a single headteacher will be appointed to oversee its management.The school structure in the town currently has nursery to P children attending the infant school before transferring to the primary school for P to P however, both schools operate their own curriculums independently.Fiona Robertson, the councilrsquos head of education, said: ldquoPrestonpans is the only area in East Lothian where nursery to P and P-P are taught across two schools.ldquoWe believe having one primary school, working under a single management structure, will benefit pupils at all levels of their learning as it does where in the county by ensuring a smoother progression through school and better coherence across the curriculum at all ages and stages.ldquoEducation Scotland has recognised the potential educational benefits and opportunities for greater coherence in the curriculum.ldquoWe have written to staff and parents to advise them of this decision.

Such days are ones which have been borrowed from another month, and I think given the temperature and weather we have had recently the days have been borrowed from May.In , May will have borrowed Februaryrsquos days, so we can expect some unseasonal weather in that month as well, but in a dferent way.Sunday was a borrowed day for sure it was so mild and the later part sunny with a feeling of spring in the air. It was a perfect day for a discovery.We set off to find a place Irsquod only recently heard about. A friend had asked me what I knew about the lsquoKingrsquos Chairrsquo by Gullane. I had to admit that Irsquod never heard of it. He told me one of the holes at the golf course there has this name, but it seems it is named after a location nearby.This set me investigating. Sure enough, I found it marked on the map and searched for an image, which I found on a website called Ancient Stones: a large boulder, shaped like a throne, guarded by two other stones either side. It intrigued me and so our quest began.The starting point of our adventure was Gullane Beach car park. I knew roughly where to look but purposefully hadnrsquot brought the map so that we had a challenge to find the lsquochairrsquo. We knew what it looked like and that we needed to walk along the upper path, not the one that heads for the beach.We went the wrong way at first and got stuck in a mass of sea buckthorn, but on reflection that just added to the sense of adventure and achievement. We soon found our way and then suddenly there it was, up on Gullane Hill. The kids ran excitedly towards the stones, shouting: ldquoFound it, found it.I felt quite exhilarated at the discovery, and to be honest impressed by the sight of the Kingrsquos Chair. I can see how it got its name, as it looks something like a majestic reclining armchair. The two boulders on either side of it look like sentries keeping watch.The kids sat on it, of course, and I had to wait my turn after my we, who reckoned it could just as easily be a lsquoQueenrsquos Chairrsquo.When I finally got a chance to seat my majestic posterior on the chair, I realised the view was majestic as well, with Gullane Beach very visible in the near distance.I reflected on the fact we had recently visited Edinburgh Castle and seen the Stone of Destiny or Stone of Scone, along with the crown jewels. This rather uninspiring stone in Edinburgh Castle may be the coronation stone used for  years in England, but it is not, I am sure, the coronation stone used by ancient kings of Scotland, despite official claims that it is.I think itrsquos pretty clear that Edward I never got his hands on the real Stone of Destiny and I am convinced it has remained in Scotland, hidden somewhere, ever since. It occurred to me that this stone actually better fitted the early description of the original coronation stone at Scone than the one in Edinburgh Castle.ldquoImaginethis is the real Stone of Destiny and has been here all the time, I said fancully out loud. I know it isnrsquot, of course, but I have to saythis Kingrsquos Chair was on display at Edinburgh Castle it would certainly look more authentic.But sadly there seems to be no recorded tradition connected to this Kingrsquos Chair. I could find no story, or reference to the origin of its name. Perhaps some local people have some information on this There is an entry from the s that records the name, citing locals as the source, so there is some historic veracity in its title. But no suggestion is offered for the origin of the name, or any tradition associated with the stone. Its geology I could not say but it doesnrsquot seem to be a glacial erratic.And so we are left to wonder. We discussed how the stone got here and how it got its name. Maybe some children played here many generations ago and gave the boulder its title. Perhaps a Viking king who landed on Gullane Beach sat himself down on this natural throne to survey his warriors at their bloody work.Whatever the origin, the name, the location and the nature of the stone make this a worthwhile and fun discovery, even without a firm legend attached to it.And as I sat on the chair I watched smoke billowing from the coastline a little further to the west, close to the edge of Aberlady nature reserve. What caused the fire I didnrsquot know, but even from a distance it seemed destructive.It was a prophetic sight to witness from the Kingrsquos Chair. It looked like a burning coastline from a Viking raid. Thankfully the distant screech of fire engines told us help was on the way. The children wanted to go see the fire, but we kept our distance from the flames and let the firefighters do their job.So the trip to the Kingrsquos Chair had been an adventure in more ways than one. On our way back, the children advanced dferent theories about the origin of the name. It was universally agreed that a story must be made, but no agreement on the actual tale.ldquoPerhaps, I said, ldquowe should leave it to the imagination of those who search for and discover it, so they can sit and feel the power of the place and get ideas.My imagination was certainly ablaze. I saw the leader of the ancient Gododdin tribe, King Loth, sitting on the stone, looking out to the Firth as he watched his terried daughter in a small coracle being taken out to the open sea, his brutal punishment for her defiance of his authority.The story would fit as her journey began at Aberlady Bay, and so her small craft would have been seen from the Kingrsquos Chair as it passed by, being pulled out to sea by one of the kingrsquos boats.Itrsquos all a fancy of my imagination, of course, but thatrsquos my story.

Irsquom not sure who exactly has been preventing transgender women using public conveniences. So far as I know, you donrsquot have to show a birth certicate, or undergo a medical exam to have a pee. But what do I know as a pale, stale male.What I do know is that ldquocis-gender is an ugly neologism which many women find offensive. They are content with their present sexual terminology. ldquoCis is in the same linguistic ballpark as ldquoTERF ndash trans exclusionary radical feminist, which is a term of abuse used against women who believe persons with penises are, er, male. I should be careful here because a number of TERFS have been banned from social media for saying that a person with a penis is a man. So I wonrsquot say that.Instead, letrsquos just take it as read that in future we are going to have to accept that the concept of sexual dferentiation with which we have been living for thousands of years is finally being exposed as a malign transphobic hood. At any rate, the Scottish Government appears determined to press ahead with reform of the Gender Recognition Act, which will allow trans people to assign themselves legally and biologically female. Hitherto, trans people have had to undergo medical examination and get a diagnosis of ldquogender dysphoria. No more. From now on, anyone can change their birth certicate to whatever they wish.Earlier this month, Holyroodrsquos culture committee warned that ending binary ldquoMale or Female questions in the Scottish census will render much of the results meaningless and, willy nilly, import an unscientic definition of sex into the law. But the Scottish Government is not listening. Nicola Sturgeon told a UN equalities conference last week that the concerns of feminists about the GRA are ldquomisplaced.Women ndash sorry, ldquomenstruators ndash who say that self-ID erases their sexual identity will be told: just get over it. They can complain that ldquosex is a protected characteristic under the  Equalities Act, and that women therefore have a right to their own unique spaces. But now that men can actually become women under the law, this right will be impossible to articulate. Trans women with male anatomy will be entitled to enter womenrsquos changing rooms, girl guide troops or womenrsquos prisons. Women who complain will be guilty of transphobia, and are likely to be visited by the police recording a ldquohate incident.Now, I have nothing against adults changing their gender, or identying as women, queer, non-binary, intersex or whatever. It seems to be reinforcing outmoded concepts of gender to suggest that, because someone wants to wear dresses, play with dolls and put on makeup, they must have a lady brain in a male body. I thought we had left pink-for-girls gender stereotyping behind. But never mind. No-one wishes trans people any ill ndash certainly not me. But now that we are abandoning the very biological definition of sex, there are some anomalies that need to be addressed.Last week, a British transgender man, who had IVF by sperm donation and gave birth, won a court battle to prevent his child having ldquomother on its birth certicate. It will be the first child in history to have no mother. The The AIRE Centre, a human rights charity, contested this on the grounds that it would make le dficult for the child in future, when they apply for visas or anything which enquires about family background. The Government said simply that this isnrsquot a problem. From now on, fathers can give birth ndash end of.But Irsquom not sure this is the end of the matter. Children have not been included in the gender recognition debate thus far, even though they have rights too. It could be psychologically disturbing for a child to find, one day, that its mother has decided to become its dad. That song ldquoSometimes I feel like a motherless child takes on a whole new meaning.Of course, the trans parent will still be present, but is it OK to expect a child to suddenly start calling her natural mother her father  I would have thought that a child has a continuing right to a legal motherthey were born with one. If misgendering a trans person is unacceptable, surely demothering a child should be too. This is going to be confusing to say the least.Then there is the question of sport. The controversy over athlete Caster Semenya, a woman with high testosterone, raises the question of how to regard trans womenrsquos participation in women-only sport. Athletes who have testes, and therefore posses greater body mass, muscle strength and bone density, have an unfair advantage over old-fashioned women who have genetically female bodies.Next week, the International Association of Athletics Federations will argue in a hearing in Switzerland that people like Semenya should take testosterone-suppressing drugs before competing. Not only would this drive a coach and horses through the anti-doping protocols, it surely poses problem for transgender athletes who, of course, also take drugs like testosterone to help them transition to their ldquocorrect male sex. I hope the sporting authorities can get their heads around that because I canrsquot.Yet this is a very live issue in many sports. In the US, the ban on trans women taking part in power-lting events is being lted to prevent accusations of discrimination. You might have thought that having beefy, male-bodied women participating in these contests is discriminating against women athletes. Though, of course, only transphobes would say that, so we wonrsquot go there.The logical solution to this conundrum is to end sexual segregation in sport. Andwomen who are born biologically female never win any medals, tough. Strangely, there doesnrsquot seem to be the same issue about female-bodied trans men participating in male-only sport . Irsquom sure that has nothing whatever to do with the fact that they wonrsquot win anything.So welcome to the brave new world of post-sexual dferentiation, where men become women and fathers have children. It is one of the most radical and abrupt cultural changes in human history.Women have had a pretty bad deal in previous centuries, when they were regarded often as chattels without rights. In some Muslim societies theyrsquore still second-class citizens. Now, as women are finally emerging from the shadow of patriarchy, they are being told, by men, that they no longer have exclusive rights to their sexual identity.Itrsquos a weird turn of events. It seems women are just on the wrong side of history. But somehow, I donrsquot think theyrsquoll go quietly."},{"url":null,"title":"Rosemary Goring  Now is the time for the Catholic Church   s own Reformation","story":"For this book Martel has conducted more than , interviews in the Vatican City in Rome, and across the world. He has spoken to priests, cardinals, bishops, monsignors, papal ambassadors, seminarians and the Swiss Guard. His conclusion, which will shock some and come as no surprise to others, is that about  per cent of the clergy in the Vatican state are gay. In other words, the HQ of a church that will not bless same-sex relationships, and forbids its clergy to have sex lives, is riddled with hyprocisy at its very core.Of these  per cent, Martel writes, some are celibate or in denial, others are living with their partners, or resort to prostitutes. A rule of thumb is that the more vehemently a cleric condemns homosexuality, the more likely he is to be in the closet himself. Hence the behaviour of the Colombian cardinal, Alfonso Lopez Trujillo. He was in the vanguard of the churchrsquos mission to prevent gay marriage. As the dire consequences of the Aids epidemic became clear, contrary to commonsense and compassion, he refused to encourage the use of condoms. Here was someone eager to be seen to uphold traditional values. Yet Martel claims that Trujillo, who died in , used male prostitutes.There are examples closer to home, among them the late Cardinal Keith OrsquoBrien, who pursued a similarly denunciatory anti-gay agenda, despite his own homosexuality and predatory behaviour. In fact, it doesnrsquot matter where you look. Throughout the Catholic churchrsquos parishes, globally and locally, there has been the mother of all cover-ups, not just in the buttoned-up past, but right now, here, today.You could say the church has been built on lies: countless men forced to hide who they really are, or to seek refuge in an all-male environment where they could find illicit love behind closed doors. Those clergy who were straight must have found themselves in a bewildering labyrinth of duplicity. That such depths of deceit have been allowed to thrive says all you need to know about the controlling power of those at the heart of the church.Martel believes that Pope Francis has earned enemies by adopting a very untypical approach. ldquoWho am I to judge  he replied, when askedhe condemned homosexuals, thereby loosening the ground beneath the feet of those in the Holy See who donrsquot want their secrets aired, or their way of le altered.The revelation of such widespread double standards is an echo of the medieval churchrsquos calamitous abuse of power and wealth. Out of it has sprung a culture where bullying, intimidation and blackmail have flourished. Andthat has been going on in this sphere, you can be sure it will have spilled over into every other part of the churchrsquos affairs.In the wake of the revelation of child abuse on a grand scale in the church, you begin to see why hiding the truth was the default position. This is not to make a link between homosexuality and child abuse but to see why the ecclesiastical authorities were so quick, and adept, at making the problem disappear. In avoiding scandal, they were intent on protecting their own rather than those who had been so grievously harmed.With evidence of institutionalised deception of the extent Martel claims, the church brings shame on itself: not for the numbers of priests who are gay, but for the willingness to lie about it, and to break vows, and the spirit of vocation, to an extent that will appall devout parishioners.Now is the time for the Catholic Churchrsquos own Reformation. No-one can any longer doubt that the le expected of a Catholic priest is unhealthy. And since there is no biblical injunction on him to be celibate, why can this not be changed  Already the church is embracing married Anglican vicars in flight from the ordination of women. Why not allow Catholic clergy the same right to open relationships, whether they be gay or straight Until the double-speak on which the modern church stands is addressed, there is no hope of winning back the faithful who have lost all trust and respect in this once revered institution. Obliging men to profess one thing while being another, is psychological torment. The denial of clergyrsquos humanity and self-expression is as cruel as anything the Inquisition devised. If the Vatican could bring itself to accept homosexuality, and gay marriage, and a non-celibate priesthood, it would be a truly Christian act.Read more: Cardinal Keith OBrien asked for forgiveness"},{"url":null,"title":"Marianne Taylor  Last chance for Mundell to put country before party","story":"The majority of these demands are perfunctory, of course, made in the knowledge and expectation that they will be ignored by the target, while playing well with the initiatorrsquos supporters.The craziness of the last few months has precipitated a flurry of genuine and warranted resignation demands, however, which under normal political circumstances would have resulted in multiple ministerial heads rolling in any other era the Prime Minister would have been forced out long ago.Marianne Taylor: BBC is better off without Neil and HumphrysAnother case in point is Scottish Secretary David Mundell, whose stubborn insistence on being ineffectual in the face of the biggest crisis this country has faced in generations is matched only by that of Jeremy Corbyn.

The SNP is right to call for Mr Mundell to show some mettle and make clear that he will not serve in a Government that is willing to take us out of the European Union without a deal, a situation that would put the already fragile Scottish economy on the road to ruin. As the Scottish Secretary is well aware, businesses will fail, jobs will be lost and real people will suffer the sort of real hardships that will be dficult to recover from.Marianne Taylor: BBC is better off without Neil and HumphrysSNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford has written to Mr Mundell, laying out the gravity of the situation and calling on him to back growing cross-party demands to halt the Brexit process by extending Article  and making clear to his boss, Theresa May, that he will resign unless she faces up the extremists in her party and takes no-deal off the table.At this critical juncture, the least that the people of Scotland deserve from the man who represents them at Cabinet level is honesty about where his loyalties lie: will he put country or party first  Mr Mundell, it really is that simple.Read more: Mundell should resign there is no-deal BrexitOf course, Mr Blackfordrsquos letter also highlights the bleakness of the dilemma facing the SNP. If Mrs May gets her way and Parliament is faced with a last-minute binary choice between her terrible deal - which deprives us of the key benefits being in the EU - and an even more catastrophic no-deal, it leaves the party in a dficult position. How should Nicola Sturgeon instruct her MPs to vote in this scenario  Backing Mrs Mayrsquos ldquomy way or the highway deal would be criticised by many as a U-turn of epic proportions and a sign of weakness. Not voting for it, and thus facilitating a no-deal Brexit, would likely be viewed by many voters as unforgivable, leaving the party open to allegations that this is the outcome it has been secretly hoping for all along, in order to boost support for independence.Ms Sturgeon and her colleagues will be hoping the growing number of Tory ministers and backbench MPs ndash including Cabinet secretaries Amber Rudd, Greg Clarke and David Gauke - poised to revolt against their leader should she refuse to rule out a no-deal Brexit, will come to their rescue in the frantic days and weeks to come.Marianne Taylor: BBC is better off without Neil and HumphrysThe emergence of the The Independent Groupmay also end up helping the SNPrsquos predicament, at least in the short term. Formed last week when eight MPs resigned from Labour unhappy at Mr Corbynrsquos disastrous leadership, it did not initially appear to be an important development. But when three Tory MPs also resigned and joined up, using the moment to launch a blistering attack on Mrs Mayrsquos disastrous Brexit strategy and their partyrsquos lurch to the right, it started to feel more signicant.What binds these MPs from dferent sides of the House of Commons is dismay at the drt of both parties to the extremities. And despite not being a proper party - yet - or having any actual policiesit seems many voters quite like what they see.Read more: Mundell should resign there is no-deal BrexitMomentum has grown over the weekend, with polls already putting the group on  per cent, just one behind the increasingly irrelevant Lib Dems.Many are asking whether TIG has a future. Surely, however, whatrsquos most important is the future of the country, andthis new movement serves only to facilitate the halting of Article , so that a new road out of the current mess can be found, then it will already have done more for the UK than Mr Corbyn.

But some say what might have been a masterplan to increase pressure on Mr Maduro has only pushed the country down an even more chaotic course towards civil war.It was a gesture say critics of Mr Guaido that had more to do with provocation than humanitarianism and which left some global organisations like the UN and the International Committee of the Red Crosswarning all sides of the dangers in ldquoweaponising aid. Perhaps the most worrying aspect in all of this however is the apparent willingness of other outside players to play fast and loose with the fate of Venezuela and its people.Just what did US Senator Mark Rubio think would be the outcome of him posting two photographs of former Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi on his Twitter account on Sunday Itrsquos well known of course that Mr Rubio is an influential voice in Washington on Venezuela policy and a staunch critic of Mr Maduro. But his tweet showing the Libyan leader bloodied and injured shortly before his death at the hands of rebel militiamen is the crudest and most incendiary of messages to Mr Maduro.That Mr Rubio had previously tweeted another photo of former Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega, who was captured in  after a US military invasion, is likewise unequivocal it its meaning and can, as intended, only be read one way by Mr Maduro. The message is simple, your time is up and forcenecessary, will be used.How Mr Rubio and those in Washington think such gestures strengthen their case for democratic change in Venezuela is baffling. Surely rather that stoke an already dangerously volatile situation, the US government should be doing all it can to ensure that such a process happens through the ballot box The Trump administration is now clearly losing patience with Mr Maduro and no longer cares how he is removed from office so long as he is and their chosen leader Mr Guaido takes over.Just last week President Trump at a speech in Miami urged ldquoVenezuelan patriots to rise up against the regime. Mr Guaido at the weekend did the same on Twitter.ldquoTodayrsquos events force me to make a decision to formally propose to the international community that we must have all options open to secure the freedom our country.For many Latin America analysts such talk bodes ill and presents serious warning signs.ldquoThere is no question that a military intervention to resolve the Venezuela crisis is more plausible than ever, Michael Shter, president of the Inter-American Dialogue, a US-based think- tank, told the Washington Post over the last few days as the crisis deepened.ldquoGuaidorsquos insistence that lsquoall options are on the tablersquo echoes President Trumprsquos words, first uttered in August  and widely interpreted as serious consideration of military action, warned Mr Shter.Some observers however insist that the US history of attempted regime change in the Latin American region and Mr Trumprsquos loose language are both working against the opposition that faces a still formidable foe in Mr Madurorsquos regime.Many Venezuelans remain suspicious of Washingtonrsquos motives, evenyet more defections to the opposition from within the ranks of the Venezuelan security forces have taken place over the past few days.More than  members of Venezuelarsquos armed forces defected during the clashes last weekend, with Mr Guaido promising the defectors would be given amnesty and congratulating them on joining ldquothe right side of history.Mr Maduro meanwhile still believes himself to be on the right side of history evenlast weekendrsquos blockade of foreign aid has left him facing a diplomatic siege.As the crisis worsens UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has appealed for ldquoviolence to be avoided at any cost and insisted everyone should lower tensions.Washington however is paying little heed and more than ever seems intent in doing whatever it takes to get its way in Venezuela. ldquoThe eyes of the entire world are upon you today, every day, and every day in the future, Mr Trump told Mr Madruo in a speech last week. ldquoYou cannot hide from the choice that now confronts you, the US president warned.For now all eyes are on the outcome of yesterdayrsquos meeting in the Colombian capital Bogota between Mr Pence and Mr GuaidoIf indeed all options are on the table, as both men have made clear, then Venezuela might be about to face the most dangerous moment in this crisis so far.

A culture of ugly bullying, of neanderthal bigotry, would have been allowed to fester inside schools doing their best to instil respect and decency in children growing up within a hate-filled sectarian society scarred by The Troubles.That zero tolerance approach to bigotry within the school gates probably helped create a generation which turned its back on religious hatred and ushered in an end to violence and the beginnings of peace in the s. To be uncompromisingly tough with the worst excesses of human behaviour is often the only way to help forge a better world.So itrsquos little wonder that Scottish football, the Old Firm, and their toxic tribes of hardcore bigoted fans disgust me. Sadly, outside of Scotland, football in this country is seen through the prism of Rangers and Celtic. The Old Firm is Scottish football to most of the world. Fans of other teams may not like that fact, but itrsquos the case ndash what the Old Firm does reflects on the entire Scottish game, on every team and fan.When bitter anti-Catholic Rangers fans call Steve Clarke, the Kilmarnock manager, a ldquoFenian b******, when bitter anti-Protestant Celtic fans call Kris Boyd, the Kilmarnock striker, an ldquoOrange b******, everyone outside Scotland sees the game and its supporters through this lens.I cannot believe that supporters who view themselves as decent human beings would wish to be in any way associated with the glamorisation of sectarian hatred, with the glorication of terrorism ndash as revealed in the vile and petty songs and banners of the worst fans in both clubs. How can you support a team, or go to a game, where religious hatred exists in any form  In any other walk of le ndash any other business ndash such behaviour would spell a mass exodus of public support and concomitant financial collapse. But football is given a place of exceptionalism - and so for some, social norms can be disregarded and society debased while money is made.Decent supporters of Rangers and Celtic ndash of whom there are many ndash may not like to be lumped in with the UVF-adulating mob at Ibrox, or the IRA-supporting mob at Celtic Park, but to many people yoursquore judged by the company you keep. If I stand peaceably in a crowd enjoying a game of football but within that same crowd there are fans chanting ldquoFenian b****** or ldquoOrange b******rsquorsquo, I have to accept that this isnrsquot a good look for me. Some might see me as guilty by association. Some might see me as passively accepting what is happening. Some might see me as too cowardly to disassociate myself from such behaviour. Some might think I get a little vicarious thrill from what is going on. At the very best Irsquom guilty of being a bystander ndash of deciding the game, the club, is more important than common decency.But supporters are supporters, and clubs are quite a dferent thing, and some ndash like Rangers and Celtic, it could be saidndash sit atop mountains of gold mined from bigotry and hatred. Perhaps these clubs havenrsquot deliberately enriched themselves by allowing sectarianism to flourish within their grounds, but as long as such behaviour continues they are guilty of passive acceptance, of a failure of responsibility.If I own a company and a byproduct of my work as a business is something seen as a social ill, then I have to take responsibility for it. Social media companies are being pilloried every day ndash rightly ndash for failing to act over fake news or abuse. The CEOs are dragged before politicians, therersquos public talk of boycotts. But with football, itrsquos simply a matter of exceptionalism.Irsquom sick to death of hearing excuses for the so-called beautul game ndash itrsquos a bloody ugly game and it needs dragged to heel as roughly as possible. Humza Yousaf spoke for a silent majority of decent people across Scotland at the weekend when he issued what he called ldquoa very stark warning to football clubs. Mr Yousaf said that the ldquoGovernment is looking at every single option that is on the table, including strict liability and stadium licensing. I cheered as loudly as any football fan when I heard him say that. Mr Yousaf has put the clubs on warning thatthey donrsquot act, the Government will.ldquoStrict liability is just a complicated way of saying the clubs will be fined and suffer other sanctions, and stadium licensing means that a game could be played with no fans in attendance. Mr Yousaf should impose a ticking clock now, giving the clubs a limited window of time to get their act together. If, and when, the clubs fail to take what he described as ldquodefinitive measures to deal with sectarianism then the Government needs to take control and pass legislation ndash and make the legislation draconian, so once a club is hit, the fines and empty stadiums will leave them cowed and obedient.Similarly, the police and prosecution service must ensure that any breach of the law by fans within or outwith football grounds is cracked down on fearsomely. If a fan so much as drops litter in the street, then arrest them. Anything even remotely resembling harassment or intimidation should end in court and a criminal record.Docking of points should be a regular sanction ndash either legislation should cover it, or government should strong-arm footballing authorities to use such powers.

Known today as Rae Strait, it was the missing link in what would become the first navigable Northwest Passage.He also reported back on the ill-fated Franklin expedition, reported evidence of cannibalism — findings which were effectively rejected by the then establishment, and which led to Rae#s achievements being almost completely ignored.The modern-day team, who hope to raise further awareness of these achievements, will be led by Scottish-born and Canada-based expedition leader David Reid, with Scotland also represented by Broxburn-based former Royal Marine Richard Smith.The team will also include two Canadians — adventure film-maker Gerry Tutte and adventurer Frank Wolf.Over  years later and supported with modern-day kit from outdoor specialists Tiso, the explorers are hard at work preparing for the physical and mental challenge of hauling kg sledges for nine hours daily and for up to  consecutive days.Their route will cover undulating, windswept tundra, river valleys and sea ice during what can be the coldest time of year.The Arctic expedition will finish once the four explorers have finally reached Gjoa Haven on King William Island.Mr Smith said: #The Arctic Return expedition will be extremely tough but ultimately our aim is to raise awareness fo the exploits of John Rae and to help restore his rightful place as one of the greatest Scottish explorers in history. It is also our hope that this awareness will inspire the public to support fundraising efforts by the John Rae Society, to restore Rae#s birthplace at the Hall of Clestrain in Oprhir.The team have said any addition funds raised are to be used to produce a documentary film and book about the le and exploits of Rae, the expedition and the history communities, culture and wildle of the Arctic.The public will be able to track the team#s progress at their official website and through social media.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The Orkney MSP has today, Tuesday, urged the Scottish Government to #pay heed to the realities of fuel poverty.#The figures, published by the Scottish Government, showed that the fuel poverty rate in Orkney was  per cent — compared to  per cent in the City of Edinburgh.“Fuel poverty levels are shameful Scotland-wide in this day and age,# said Mr McArthur.#However, these figures underline that rural and island communities are disproportionately badly affected.“I have consistently made the case for recognition of this alarming disparity, and I am glad that the Housing Minister has now agreed to look at options to recognise that ahead of Stage Two of the Fuel Poverty Bill.“Orkney and other rural and island communities urgently need targeted action to reduce the astronomical rates of fuel poverty and extreme fuel poverty. The latest figures provide a timely reminder about the need to get the legislation and policy right.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Mr McArthur believes this reflects a change in approach by the government, after months of campaigning by the Orkney MSP and a range of organisations involved in tackling fuel poverty across the Highlands and Islands.During his remarks, Mr McArthur pointed out that when it comes to fuel poverty, rural and island areas are disproportionately affected, with Orkney having the highest proportion of households in fuel poverty and extreme fuel poverty anywhere in Scotland.Commenting after the debate, Mr McArthur said: “Fuel poverty blights communities across Scotland, but there is no doubt that it has a disproportionate impact on rural and island areas. Until recently, however, the Scottish Government appeared unwilling to recognise this fact or indeed the higher costs faced by those living in our rural and island communities.“Over recent months, working with a range of organisations with a wealth of experience and expertise in tackling fuel poverty, I have made the case for the Minister, Kevin Stewart to think again.  It was a case that the Local Government Committee was also persuaded to support.“I am delighted, therefore, that the Minister has had a change of heart and committed to bring forward amendments to his bill at stage two that better reflect the specic nature of fuel poverty in places like Orkney.  I look forward to seeing the detail of those amendments and will work with Mr Stewart, and local stakeholders in Orkney, to make sure we get this right.“Given the impact fuel poverty can have, not just on people’s quality of le but their physical and mental health, this bill has the potential to make a real dference.  For that to happen, it must be both effective and ambitious in eradicating fuel poverty from communities across the country.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

We will be looking to strengthen the Bill as it progresses through the Scottish Parliament and ensuring that the Scottish Governmentrsquos pledges are met.\"Before Wednesdayrsquos debate Mr Stewart said: ldquoWithin this ground-breaking legislation, not only are we one of the few countries in the world to define fuel poverty, we are also setting a goal towards eradicating it.ldquoBy changing the definition of fuel poverty so itrsquos more closely aligned to relative income poverty and taking steps to ensure it works for remote rural and island communities, we are ensuring our support is focussed on those who need it most.\"He added: \"In this day and age, it is unacceptable that any Scottish household should have to choose between having the heating on and cooking their dinner.Councillor Ian Cockburn, who represents the Wester Ross, Strathpeffer and Lochalsh welcomed the Bill as \"something has to be done about fuel poverty\" while arguing it is also time to rethink infrastructure like the national grid.\"It is ambitious but has to be tried to get fuel poverty down in rural areas. We are one of the most energy rich countries in the world so we should be able to get something done. Too many people take it as just being part of the landscape up here so we need to change that thinking as well to get people the assistance that they need.\"Scotland should not be in this state. But you have to look back, the National Grid was set up at the end of the war, the Highlands is considered off-grid despite supplying much of the rest of the country through hydro and wind power. It is time for a rethink.\"Calum Macaulay, chief executive of Invergordon-based Albyn Housing Society, said: ldquoWe welcome this development in the Scottish Governmentrsquos approach to addressing fuel poverty in rural areas. The push to include minimum income standards feels like a signicant step forwards. This is something that the Rural and Islands Housing Association Forum has been promoting for quite some time.\"This has included research undertaken with the support of Highlands and Islands Enterprise and others into minimum income standards in rural communities. The results of this highlighted the pressures of lower average household incomes and higher average fuel costs across the northern parts of Scotland.\"What do you think  Share your views by emailing newsdesk@spp-groupTuesday  Feb  : PMBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

If the facility is not taken on by the community then it will close on March as per report to the Highland Council [on] October .ldquoNo survey will be undertaken, the facility will transfer in lsquoas seen, as isrsquo condition, the facilities will transfer in their current operational condition. The position of toilets remaining open whilst negotiations are ongoing is for this financial year only. There is no budget to retain facilities... which is why we want to get the leases sorted out before the end of March.Despite that the director of the Groam House Museum Doug Maclean, who recently attended a meeting of the community council where the future of the toilets was on the agenda remains hopeful.ldquoWe are confident that by some means or other, through a charitable trust taking over the running of the toilets and the good services of the local people, we will be able to keep the toilets open, he said.However, Mr Maclean was in no doubt about how serious an effect the closure would have on Rosemarkie as well as Groam House Museum.ldquoFrom the museumrsquos point of view it is absolutely vital for our existence. We have groups of school children that come here and of course children need to go to the toilet, he said.ldquoWe also have groups of mainly elderly American tourists and they are not in a position to make their way to the beach cafeacute. And we would lose both those groups without the toilets which put the museum in jeopardy.Black Isle ward councillor Gordon Adam said: ldquoI am in discussions with the council over the time limit of March , my view is that the council needs to be flexible.

There are many reasons why this course of action is necessary, the main one being the struggle to secure sufficient finances to run the organisation.About pound, to pound, is needed annually but Ms Cochrane said that the NHS is doing a review of third sector input, and can only confirm funding up to June.Without the support of the NHS, they will find it dficult to win the support of other funding bodies.The news will be a blow to the  service users currently on the books of ACSRS many of whom faced a personal battle before seeking help and then keeping on attending to receive the support on offer.However Ms Cochrane said they will do everything in their power to ensure their clients receive alternative assistance with their dependency. Around  people with alcohol dependency are referred to them each year.She said: ldquoThe board is actively pursuing alternative arrangements for our service users and volunteer counsellors who wish to continue their support or volunteering.ldquoACSRS has been indebted to many people over the years who have given their time and expertise freely as volunteers. Some have assisted in the management of the service as board members providing governance and support for staff and volunteers.ldquoOthers have given thousands of hours of their free time as trained volunteer counsellors. There are six counsellors and not all of them will be wanting to move on though some might seek paid employment.ldquoThe training for these counsellors was previously provided free. It now requires a source of additional funding.ldquoAs for other voluntary organisations, the burden of bureaucracy has increased without the corresponding increase in income, and the task of securing additional funding has become more challenging.ldquoACSRS is the only voluntary organisation within Ross-shire and Sutherland offering a free professional one-to-one counselling service for those affected by their own or a loved onersquos addiction.

I would be concernedpeople who voted Leave felt abandoned by the Labour Party. But we are trying to steer a way through what is a very dficult situation created by Theresa May,” he said.“Our strategy has been to try and hold the country together.

David Lammy, a prominent Remain-supporting Labour MP, said Corbyn was “taking the first step to reunite our party by showing he is listening to our voters and members on this, the biggest issue of our time”.: Brexit: Labour to back second referendum in parliamentIt is often said that the EU referendum was held in an attempt to solve an internecine war within the Conservative party. Now, it seems, Labour’s internal troubles could bring about another one.Clearly, the chances of this actually happening will depend on the attitude of many Conservative MPs – and not just Remain ones. Labour’s decision could simply prompt Brexiteer MPs to drop their opposition to May’s deal, fearing the ‘will of the people’ is now pro-Remain.But,a second vote does come about, the big question will be the question. BrexitRef would undoubtedly be a isive affair and there would be a serious risk of a boycott by Brexiteers, which could cause potentially irreparable harm to democracy in this country.So considerable efforts would need to be made to try to bring Farage, Rees-Mogg and the like on board.

Red-carpeted self-congratulations, the popping of flashes and the anticipation of the popping of corks at the many after parties for the rich and famous. And, once again, another Academy Awards in which no women were mentioned in the important category of best director, writes Dr Claire Jenkins.In the  years that the awards have been running, only five women have been nominated for this coveted award – and only one, Kathryn Bigelow, has come away with the statuette: this represents about one per cent of nominees and winners. It’s a shockingly low statistic, even when you take into account that a mere eight per cent of Hollywood’s top  films in  were directed by women. In  America’s Equal Employment Opportunity Commission found Hollywood to be guilty of discrimination against female directors, but as yet there have been no signicant shts in the number of women directing.\u2028\u2028But while there is clearly much to do, there may be some small tremors discernible on Hollywood’s Geiger counter. Take Mimi Leder‘s newest film On the Basis of Sex, about the career of US Supreme Court justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Leder was effectively ostracised by Hollywood after the commercial failure of Pay it Forward , so herto directing with a biopic of one of America’s most prominent feminist icons suggests that Hollywood is softening in its treatment of women on, and off, screen.\u2028\u2028Leder’sto the director’s chair comes alongside the impressive success of Ava DuVernay, who has been breaking ground for women of colour in the film industry. DuVernay became the first African-American woman to make over USm at the American domestic box office with A Wrinkle in Timeand was subsequently offered a m deal with Warner Bros. This deal came despite the film’s lukewarm critical reception, and claims that it was helped to box office success by The Incredibles , with which it was paired at ious drive-ins in the US. It should be noted that DuVernay’s deal with Warner Bros was to develop television content. It is in the television and streaming sectors that women seem to have more opportunities. It was as a television director that Leder has been working since her film career faltered, gaining acclaim for her work on The Leftovers, and DuVernay has oscillated between television and film – taking on a number of producing roles for the small screen.\u2028\u2028: Oscars : Olivia Colman named best actress in shock win\u2028\u2028The current Hollywood climate continues to favour male filmmakers, with its penchant for high-octane action blockbusters and superhero movies that are more often than not films for – and about – men. Coverage of the forthcoming Captain Marvel movie may be trying to draw on the film’s feminist credentials – with its female lead and female director – but Anna Boden is only one half of the directorial team . So despite Marvel boss Kevin Feige’s claims that “many” of the upcoming Marvel films will be directed by women, as yet no movie from what is known as the “Marvel Cinematic Universe”has a female director, although Australian director Cate Shortland is expected to helm the Black Widow film.\u2028\u2028EvenMCU and other action-producers continue to hire women directors, though, this will not necessarily affect the Oscars – Black Panther currently standing as the only MCU movie to be nominated.\u2028\u2028Big-budget, but low-brow action movies are generally overlooked during awards season – instead it’s those films that we might term “Indiewood”, independent-style films funded or distributed by specialist arms of the major studios, that tend to be celebrated. In , two of the three English language films nominated for best director were distributed by major studios, or their specialist arms. The Favourite was distributed by Fox Searchlight, and BlacKkKlansman was distributed by Focus Features, a subsidiary of Universal.\u2028\u2028Independent filmmaking has, historically, offered more opportunities for women directors, and therefore the lack of women nominated for the Best Director award seems even more pronounced. Although figures for women working within the independent sector are less well publicised, the Celluloid Ceiling Report suggested that women are better represented in the independent sector, making up  per cent of the directors of narrative features screened at festivals in  and .\u2028\u2028: Academy refuses to pull James Bulger film from Oscars despite family’s plea\u2028\u2028Statistics such as these demonstrate that women directors are working in the American industry, but the big studios are failing to hire them and the Academy is failing to recognise them.\u2028\u2028Women directors slated for nods this awards season all made films that fall into the independent or Indiewood category: Debra Granik’s Leave No Trace, Lynne Ramsay’s You Were Never Really Here and Marielle Heller’s Can You Ever Forgive Me.\u2028\u2028Anne Fletcher’s latest film Dumplin’ was independently produced and distributed by Netflix. Fletcher had box office success with mainstream rom-coms including  Dressesand The Proposalbut after the failure of Hot Pursuit it appears that she too has been pushed out of the mainstream.\u2028\u2028That Dumplin’ was distributed by Netflix, and You Were Never Really Here was distributed by Amazon Studios, demonstrates that there are dferent outlets for women within the changing media culture but there is still a lack of support for women in the mainstream – the big studios. And even those women who have had success in Hollywood are rarely recognised for their achievements.\u2028\u2028The death of Penny Marshall in December was met with a public outpouring of grief via social media and popular press. She was hailed as a trailblazer as the first woman to make over m at the American domestic box office with Big . But Marshall is not a household name. Big is remembered as the film that made Tom Hanks’ name, not Marshall’s. Marshall is just the first in a long string of women who have changed Hollywood, but they are not recognised for their achievements.\u2028\u2028The American film industry must do better – in hiring women directors, in rewarding women directors and in highlighting and protecting their legacies.\u2028\u2028Dr Claire Jenkins is a lecturer in film and television studies at Leicester University.

And we have called for it to do the same with the two-child cap on claims for tax credits and Universal Credit, and the rape clause that comes with it. Let’s call this what it is, a particularly abhorrent piece of Tory social engineering, which forces women to re-live the trauma of being raped as part of a claim for financial support for a child.These measures, as illustrative as they are, barely scratch the surface of the level of cuts to social security imposed by the Tories since  – and, of course, supported by the Liberal Democrats in the coalition government. Billions of pounds slashed from benefits and support programmes for the very people who most need our help: sick, disabled and unemployed people, and those who rely on extra support because they are not paid enough to live on. Cruel cuts underpinned by a cruel sanctions regime, so painfully and accurately portrayed in the film ‘I, Daniel Blake’, based partly on people’s experiences in Scotland.This is the brutal reality of austerity. A political choice to use the power of the state in one of the wealthiest countries in the world, not to make iniduals’ lives better and to improve society as a whole, but to tear people’s lives apart. And this is without even mentioning the tens of billions of pounds cut from our public services.: Tony Blair: Scotland would be independentnot for devolutionAnd it is before we have even begun to consider the Tories’ despicable hostile environment that targets migrants, conceived by Theresa May as Home Secretary and continued under her as Prime Minister. Remember those ad vans sent out by May’s Home Office with the nasty threat “Go home or face arrest”  Policies rooted in the worst instincts of the Tory Party, egged on by sections of the press whose front pages regularly scream about the threat posed by migration but never shout about the positive benefits it brings to our country, our culture and our way of le.But it is not some fanatical Tory clique in England that claims all of this is “necessary”, this is the Conservative Party right across the UK including here in Scotland. Ruth Davidson has proudly talked about how she backed Theresa May as leader, and how she “will back her in the future”. Scottish Secretary David Mundell and stand-in Scottish leader Jackson Carlaw line up foursquare behind the Prime Minister, even as her Brexit shambles goes from farce to horror.This is the Conservative Party that former Labour Prime Minister Tony Blair bizarrely said last week had claimed the “middle ground” of politics. If that is the middle ground, I shudder to think what would be right of centre.Scottish Labour has serious work to do, no one in our party is pretending otherwise and no one has ever claimed it is easy-going. We are rebuilding after years of decline and a series of electoral shocks, not least the  General Election when all but one of our  MPs were voted out, including the then leader Jim Murphy.Far from abandoning the mythical “middle ground” which, in truth, only pundits talk about, we are rebuilding on the basis of popular, common sense policies that focus on the real change that Scotland needs. An end to austerity and the cuts to social security and local services, and public ownership of our trains, buses, energy and Royal Mail, to put people before profit. We need Labour governments in Scotland and across the UK to put this into practice.Of course, it was gravely disappointing that just over a week ago a small group of Labour MPs chose to walk away, to join forces with former Tory MPs in a new Independent Group. In going, they have raised some important issues about Labour, not least the issue of antisemitism which we are determined to root out of our party and wider society. There is no place for antisemitism in the Labour Party.But they have also been clear that their disagreements range wider and are on matters of policy. In a magazine interview, one of the former Labour MPs has already criticised plans to bring the railways into public ownership and raise the top rate of tax. Another has suggested the group could replace the DUP in propping up the Tory Government. The first act of one of their former Tory colleagues was to declare that the coalition government, which ushered in austerity and led to record levels of poverty and homelessness, “did a marvellous job”.: Lesley Riddoch: Citizens’ Assemblies could help build a new ScotlandThese are very dferent ideas to the ones that proved so popular in the  election and which they were elected to Parliament on, so it is right that their constituents get the chance to ask them in by-elections what they now stand for. The group claims to represent a new, forward-looking “centre ground”. Butall it is going to offer is support for austerity, tax breaks for the rich and privatisation of public services, it will look very much like the failed politics of the past.No one yet knows what the political fall-out will be. But it will not deter Labour from our mission to bring the curtain down on this rotten Tory Government and so to see the back of the party of social security cuts, the two-child cap, austerity, homelessness, foodbanks and inequality. And it will not deter us from campaigning to win back people’s trust and so to win power again in the Scottish Parliament.We stand for something completely dferent. We don’t look at the housing crisis and see an opportunity to blame and punish the very people it affects the most. We won’t cut the lelines from our communities and our industries, we will invest in them, and we will build an economy and a society where everyone benefits, not just a wealthy few.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"brexit theresa may caves to pressure offering mps chance to prevent no deal","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...Theresa May has caved in to pressure from pro-EU ministers and MPs, offering the Commons a chance to delay Brexit and prevent a no-deal scenario.The Prime Minister said thatparliament rejects her Brexit deal in a vote by  March, there would then be votes on whether to exit the EU without a deal, or go ahead with a “short, limited” extension of the Article  process.Responding to the Prime Minister’s statement, Jeremy Corbyn confirmed that eventhe Prime Minister’s deal is approved by MPs, it should be subject to a “confirmatory referendum”.: Brexit: Labour to back ‘public vote’ in parliamentWith pressure mounting over the risk of a potentially damaging no-deal exit, Mrs May told MPs they would have a chance to put one off.: Brexit: Theresa May delays ‘meaningful vote’ again“I know Members across the House are genuinely worried that time is running out, thatthe Government doesn’t come back with a further meaningful vote or it loses that vote, Parliament won’t have time to make its voice heard on the next steps,” she said.“I know too that members across the House are deeply concerned by the effect of the current uncertainty on businesses.”The Prime Minister said the Brexit deal would be voted on in the Commons by March , and thatit was rejected again by MPs, there would be a vote the following day on whether to leave the EU without a deal.If the Commons rejects a no-deal scenario, there would then be a vote on  March on whether to ask the EU for a “short, limited extension”.Mrs May added: “Let me be clear, I do not want to see Article  extended.“Our absolute focus should be on working to get a deal and leaving on  March.“An extension beyond the end of June would mean the UK taking part in the European Parliament elections.“What kind of message would that send to the more than  million people who voted to leave the EU nearly three years ago now “And the House should be clear that a short extension – not beyond the end of June – would almost certainly have to be a one-off.“If we had not taken part in the European Parliament elections, it would be extremely dficult to extend again, so it would create a much sharper clf edge in a few months’ time.”The Prime Minister added: “An extension cannot take no deal off the table. The only way to do that is to revoke Article , which I shall not do, or agree a deal.”Mrs May had faced a possible wave of resignations by ministers determined to vote for an amendment from the Labour MP Yvette Cooper, seeking to tie the government’s hands on an extension to Article .The Prime Minister said her proposals met the timetable set out in Ms Cooper’s amendment, and called on MPs to reject it in votes tomorrow, arguing that “Tying the Government’s hands by seeking to commandeer the order paper would have far-reaching implications for the way in which the United Kingdom is governed and the balance of powers and responsibilities in our democratic institutions”.In a bid to prevent a rebellion by Tory Brexiteers against her deal, Mrs May said work would continue on ways to avoid the controversial Irish border backstop from coming into force.“The UK and EU have agreed to consider a joint work stream to develop alternative arrangements to ensure the absence of a hard border in Northern Ireland,” Mrs May told MPs. “This work will be done in parallel with the future relationship negotiations and is without prejudice to them.“Our aim is to ensure that, eventhe full future relationship is not in place by the end of the implementation period, the backstop is not needed because we have a set of alternative arrangements ready to go.”The Prime Minister’s critics failed to welcome her u-turn. Mr Corbyn said that “until the Prime Minister is clear what alternative she would put forward in that circumstance, then she is continuing to run down the clock”.Veteran Europhile Tory Sir Kenneth Clarke said Mrs May was simply “pushing back the clf edge”.The SNP’s Westminster leader Ian Blackford told the Prime Minister to prepare for a longer extension, saying his party was selecting candidates for the European elections in May.Mr Blackford also called for the votes on a Brexit delay to happen now.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"snp urge richard leonard to say if he backs a second eu referendum","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard is facing calls to explain whether he backs the UKspartys call for a second Brexit referendum.The SNP has voiced concerns that Labours support for a second referendum, announced last night, may not include the option of Remain on the ballot paper.Scottish Labour’s Brexit spokesman Neil Findlay said last night a second referendum should only happenLabour’s Brexit proposals failed to win support in parliament – and that he would “much prefer” the UK to leave under Labour’s plan than to have a new public vote.: Richard Leonard: Tony Blair’s ‘middle ground’ is a right-wing nightmare\u2028SNP MSP George Adam said: “The SNP has been at the forefront of calls for a second EU referendum, and we welcome Labour’s new support for that position. \u2028“But it is absolutely essential that a second referendum includes the option of stopping Brexit altogether and remaining in the EU. \u2028“Neil Findlay point blank refused to say whether he would support that option – and said he would ‘much prefer’ for Brexit to go ahead on Labour’s terms. \u2028“With the clock ticking, we urgently need clarity – and Richard Leonard must ensure Scottish Labour join us in fully opposing Brexit.

Until now.All these club names have representation in the Scottish women#s under- squad which flew out to Portugal this week to take on three matches in an international development cup.And proudly flying the flag for the Western Isles women#s team is Rachael Johnstone, a -year-old goalkeeper from Balallan with a steely focus on forging a successful career in the ever-improving world of women#s football.Sport-daft Rachael took her first footballing steps while attending Stornoway Primary, where she says coach Gordon MacRae gave her huge encouragement to play.She started as an outfield player but began playing as goalkeeper for Stornoway Aths juniors in her first year at high school. She continues to train and play at the island#s capital club, as well as with the Western Isles women#s squad.Progress has been swt, and Rachael first featured for the Scotland under-s last year. Her performances have also caught the eye of the Celtic women#s team and she was recently invited to join the club#s national performance squad for a year#s trial. last week. #I can fly down and be in Glasgow on a Friday and fly back to be in school on Monday morning. It#s hard work, but I love sport and I#m determined to keep improving and go as far as I can in the game.#Being selected for the Scotland under-s makes me really proud # it#s insane really. It#s not really kicked in yet, and probably won#t until I am out on the field.#Rachael was in the starting line-up for the Scotland under-s opening match against the Netherlands on Thursday. Paul Brownlie#s side drew -, before going on to narrowly lose - on penalties. Their next match sees them take on hosts Portugal on Saturday before they conclude the three-match tour with a match against Germany on Monday.Mum Rhona was also making the journey to cheer Rachael on. She said: #I#m very proud. You always encourage them, but you don#t ever expect your children to be asked to represent their country. It#s a huge honour and I just want to support her as much as I can.#Rachael, who is a fourth-year pupil at Sir E Scott School in Tarbert in Harris, said she owed a big debt to local coaches Euan and Jenna MacLeod for their advice and encouragement as well as to her school for allowing her time off to pursue her footballing dream.Another of Rachael#s ambitions is to represent the Western Isles at the World Island Games # an event which has been pivotal in fostering women#s football in the Hebrides.#Ever since I was about seven it#s been my goal to make the Western Isles team and to go to the Island Games # that would be a huge thing for me,# added Rachael, who identied Scotland under- goalkeeper Lee Alexander as a key influence and role model, and star Scotland and Cha midfielder Erin Cuthbert as possibly her favourite player.As far as the future goes, Rachael says her priority is simply to keep learning the game, but she has already developed a keen sense of what it takes to be a top keeper.#Mindset is really important for a goalkeeper,# she added. #You need to keep the head up and keep going. If you let a goal in, you have to learn how to deal with it. Commitment is also really important.#My dream would be to get a pro contract, and be full-time in football. I just want to keep going to a higher level, and get more caps # that#s my ultimate goal.#"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/LOVAT-V-SKYE-9.jpg","title":"nae pasaranwhen scottish workers stood against a fascist","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThere can#t be many pensioners from East Kilbride who are Commanders of the Republic of Chile. It is a safe bet that there are only three: Robert Somerville, John Keenan, and Bob Fulton.Back in March , when they were union shop stewards at the town#s Rolls Royce plant, the three men # and thousands of their co-workers # were responsible for virtually grounding the air force of Chilean dictator General Augusto Pinochet, who had seized power just a few months before in a savage CIA-backed coup. The documentary #Nae Pasaran#, screened in Portree last weekend, tells the story of how these principled trade unionists came to be awarded the highest honour the Republic of Chile can bestow upon foreigners.With much of the world appalled by the overthrow, in September , of the democratically-elected socialist Government of Salvador Allende, it fell to Bob Fulton # a burly, no-nonsense Christian with wartime experience of fighting fascist dictators # to set the ball rolling in East Kilbride. Arriving for work on the morning of th March  he uncovered a chilling truth about the eight Rolls Royce jet engines that had just been delivered to the plant for servicing: the engines came from the British Hawker Hunter jets used by Pinochet loyalists to bomb, amongst other targets, the presidential palace in Santiago where Allende died on the day the coup began.Now in his mid-s, Bob immediately #blacked# the engines that is, he declared them subject to an industrial dispute. As such, they could not be touched by any worker # or anyone , for that matter # until the dispute was resolved. His colleagues soon followed suit, much to the consternation of management and the UK Government. And so the engines sat, untouched, out in the open air for the next four years, until they became useless lumps of rusting metal. Moreover, the East Kilbride plant was the only place in the world licensed to service the engines. So, aside from the eight now-engineless jets, the rest of Pinochet#s air force could not be kept airworthy while workers thousands of miles away stuck to the principles of international solidarity. How many lives this saved on the ground is a moot point.#Nae Pasaran# is a paean to what can be achieved by collective action, and to what might be described as the golden age of trade unionism. But the documentary # written and directed by Felipe Bustos Sierra, son of an exiled Chilean journalist # also works as an emotionally-charged voyage of discovery.For over  years, Bob, John and Robert, and other former plant workers doubted whether or not their actions had any lasting effect on the lives of persecuted Chileans, many of whom were trade unionists like themselves. #Nae Pasaran# works in a dramatic sense because we watch as this gap in their knowledge is filled. The Scottish refuseniks did make an impact. Their stand mattered.What makes #Nae Pasaran# so moving is that the surviving union men, interviewed atby Sierra in his adopted homeland, are shown interviews he conducted back in Chile with survivors of Pinochet#s brutality. Now old men themselves, the victims recalled how they took solace in smuggled radios tuned to Radio Moscow, which broadcast regular updates on the Scottish union#s boycott. The action # or rather inaction # of the Rolls Royce workers gave many Chileans hope that they would not be forgotten or abandoned by the outside world. It may even have contributed directly to the saving of seven lives.Among the hundreds of Chilean exiles arriving in the UK were seven rumoured to have escaped execution or imprisonment because the air force acquired spare parts from Israel, South Africa, and India. So desperate were the Chilean authorities for this materiel they may have swapped the seven detainees for what they needed. Sierra never proves this conclusively, however, because the UK Home Office refused to release certain files relating to the boycott.And what of the jet engines, left to rust in East Kilbride  They were whisked away early one morning in . To this day no one knows who took them, but the Rolls Royce workers were told they were back in service with the Chilean air force. A year later Margaret Thatcher came to power and relations with the Pinochet regime were quickly normalised. Arms exports resumed in earnest.But the #blacked# engines were never used again. One of them, which Sierra discovered in a derelict yard outside Santiago, was shipped back to Scotland in , the year before #Nae Pasaran# hit the cinemas. It is due to be installed, as a lasting monument to the boycott, in a college campus in East Kilbride in the very near future.#Nae Pasaran# celebrates people power. After the screening, the topic was the subject of a short talk by Councillor Chris McEleny, leader of the SNP Group on Inverclyde Council, who also answered questions from the audience on British involvement in the destruction of Yemen, the desire by Tory Brexiteers to deregulate and deunionise even further, and the situation in Venezuela. Indeed, Mr McEleny drew an #obvious parallel# with Venezuela, where the democratically-elected socialist Government of another resource-rich South American country is being targeted for regime change.He said: #In Chile, before the coup, US corporations had huge commercial interests in copper mining and they sought to undermine and destabilise the Allende Government, and this is pretty much what we are seeing in Venezuela right now. Poverty in Venezuela has been engineered by the US, just as it was in Chile. We are seeing the same media pattern, a capitalist conditioning programmeyou like, drip-feeding propaganda to make intervention look like the right thing to do. We are seeing that right now with Venezuela so we need to see the same solidarity that Bob Fulton and others showed in the s.#Sadly, as Bob and his comrades lamented, in an era of weakened trade unions such a workplace boycott could probably not take place now.

I think it is a good space for local artists and photographers to show their work.”As well as welcoming new artists, the gallery’s ties to Tommy will also remain intact through a connection with one of his siblings, as Robert explained.“Tommy’s brother Rory has some work in the gallery – which is quite a nice connection,” Robert said. “He does landscapes – mostly small works which are water-based.“He heard I was renovating the gallery and gave me a call – I had no idea he painted, and I was delighted when he phoned up and asked.”The Portree businessman added: “I have about a dozen dferent artists and photographers – six of which are showing work at the gallery already. Jeremy Rossiter is one, he was the first person I spoke to.“I also have work from a couple from Skeabost, Gill Williams, who is a photographer, and her husband Ian Williams – who is more of an abstract painter.“What I like might or might not be what other people like, so I am intrigued to see how things go.”Robert said that he planned to open the gallery through to at least October and would operate on a commission basis, giving the artists the freedom to price the work themselves.He added: “A lot of galleries just focus on professional artists, but I want it to also be a place where amateur artists and photographers can sell their work.”He went on to say: “When people are buying something, especially work that’s expensive, it’s better to see it in the flesh than on a computer. It’s a  for people to sell their work, and I am just acting as an agent, selling it for them and supplying the location.”He added: “We are calling it the Isle of Skye Gallery – keeping it simple. That way everyone knows where it is, and it doesn’t prioritise one type of artwork over another. We have a Facebook page — Isle of Skye Gallery, and we’re on Instagram too — it’s not my forte but it’s a good  to promote it.” that while the gallery was due to open this week, an official launch would take place next month.With th March marking the one-year anniversary of Tommy’s death, perhaps the new crop of artists present will draw inspiration from the indelible impression left by the gallery’s former incumbent as the space is brought back into use."},{"url":null,"title":"m22 closure after four vehicles in collision","story":"The M northbound is closed between the Ballygrooby Road and Moneynick Road junctions after a collision involving four vehicles on Friday night.

As Moy Park celebrates  years in business, Aaron reflects on changes in the sector and milestones along the way. He said: “I first joined Moy Park in  when I was still at school, working part time at the weekends as a factory operative. “As a student, it was a great insight into the world of work and business. It taught me the value of hard work, money earned, and motivated me to want to do more of both! “After gaining a degree in Health and Leisure from Queen’s University Belfast, I was keen to move into a business environment and decided to apply to Moy Park’s Graduate Management Programme, to find out more about a career in one of our fastest growing industries, agri-food. “The two-year programme was the ideal way to find out more about ious strands of a business, from operations to finance, HR and marketing, and what might suit my skillset best. “From my time as a sht worker on the factory floor, I had a healthy respect and interest in the processing side of Moy Park, and the opportunities and challenges therein. “Once I completed the Graduate Management Programme - which we still use as a recruitment tool today - I took up a position as a sht manager, capitalising on my people management skills and interest in operations. “Since then, I have worked my way up across a number of Moy Park’s sites – moving from factory manager to area manager and have now been General Manager at Ballymena for two years. “Ballymena is a great place to work. From a business point of view, it’s strategically located with fantastic transport links and from a social standpoint, you’ll never find yourself wanting for something to do – from shopping to socialising over a drink or a bite to eat. It’s also quickly becoming the spa capital of Northern Ireland! “While Ballymena has faced a number of economic challenges, it’s an area with a rich history and heritage of business success. This spirit is still very much evidenced by the people, businesses and organisations in the town today. “Mid and East Antrim Council has an ambitious integrated economic development strategy for the area to help encourage business growth across the borough, and it’s one we are keen to help support. “It’s a strategy important not just to Moy Park as a business, but to me personally. “I sit on Mid and East Antrim Council’s Manufacturing Task Force Team, a working group committed to supporting and fostering growth. I was delighted to attend Westminster with a delegation from the Task Force recently when Northern Ireland representatives presented their plans for a Belfast City Deal. “Hearing these plans certainly gave us food for thought when it comes to nurturing growth locally. “As Ballymena’s General Manager, I’m responsible for all business s at the site – from technical to HR and finance. “With over , members of staff, it’s a erse and busy job but that’s what makes it worth doing. In the last  years, business management has evolved signicantly. “While there might be more paperwork, regulations, travel and late nights, there is also an incredible amount of collaboration - with customers, industry, educational bodies and government and our local communications. “Managers today cannot afford to work in silos, you need to adopt an attitude of knowledge sharing and foster an environment of innovation to truly succeed. “My key piece of advice to anyone viewing management as a career is to do your research and bolster your skillsyou need to. Being a good manager isn’t a static position, you constantly need to challenge yourself, and a good employer is one who lets you not only challenge yourself but equips you with the skills to overcome these challenges. “One of my own personal highlights over the last  years was been being named ‘Young Processor of the Year’ at the Meat and Poultry Processing Awards in . “Given my background working on the factory floor, it was great to win an industry award. At a business level, I’ve been very proud to see Ballymena evolve to become a Centre of Excellence, focused on driving innovation in food manufacturing. “As General Manager, it’s my ambition to see our facilities continue to grow.” "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1460456.jpg--.jpg?1550570314000\n","title":"mp hails amber light on scotland bridge plan","story":"North Antrim MP Ian Paisley has welcomed talks about a prospective bridge connecting Northern Ireland and Great Britain.Mr Paisley recently, along with South Antrim DUP MP Paul Girvan met with the Secretary of State for Transport, Chris Grayling to discuss the bridge.After the meeting between the three MPs, the Transport secretary said he would be in contact with the Prime Minister and the Chancellor of the Exchequer in order to discuss a feasibility project which would investigate the economics of the bridge and whether it would make financial sence to construct the bridge.The proposed bridge could be placed anywhere along the Northern Irish coast line, either at the shortest distance to Scotland at  miles or at the longest of  miles.

Inevitably, as he sedately passes, the lad with the ball loops one over the roof of the passing vehicle – Squinter seems to rememberthe player had hit the kerb with that shot he’d have got two points instead of one.It got Squinter to thinking – again – about the death of street games, for while the sight of two kids playing the iconic Belfast street game was enough to brighten the darkest day, the smile that it put on Squinter’s face faded a little with the realisation that it only highlighted the sad fact that such a sight is very much a rarity these days.It’s not the first time – and probably won’t be the last – that Squinter has lamented the passing of al fresco children’s entertainment: Rally-Oh!, Kick-the-Tin, -- Red Light. But here’s another street game that hasn’t been documented and yet was played in just about every house in Squinter’s street.When new gutties were required for the childer, we all got them at the same time: start of summer, new school term, bingo win – occasions like that. Brothers being intensely competitive beings, we were all keen to establish the superiority of the new footwear that had been bestowed upon us. And so we’d pull on the new gutties, lace them up with loving care and outside we’d go for a race.The winner was never going to be the fastest runner – the winner was going to be the one with the fastest shoes. We’d line up out in the square and, after the usual fussing and fighting over  starts and wrong counts, off we’d bolt, feeling aswe were being powered by some unseen but powerful motor in our pristine new gutties. Then we’d do some jumps, because of course those new gutties could not only make you run like the wind, they could make you leap like an antelope.Squinter’s not sure that kids do that now with their £-plus gel-cushioned, gas-injected fashion statements. In fact, he’s fairly sure that by the time a child grows out of them they’re as unmarked as the day they left the factory, given that they’ve spent more time on a sofa than they have on the street.Squinter’s running days are most likely over, sad to relate , which means that he will never again appreciate the unalloyed joyof pulling on a new pair of trainers. He did buy a sturdy pair of brogues recently which will face up to the rigours of any Belfast winter, but sadly aren’t designed to propel a person along a flat tarmac surface at any appreciable speed not like a good pair of Sizzlers."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"irsp claim psni are intimidating families","story":"AN IRSP member who says he is followed by the PSNI daily has accused police of attempting to “intimidate” party activists.Lower Falls man Michael Kelly was one of a number of IRSP members who were searched by the PSNI as they arrived for a meeting at Costello House earlier thismonth.Speaking to the Andersonstown News, Mr Kelly reiterated his parties claims that PSNI are involved in “political policing”, and accused police of harassing party members and their families.“I have been getting stalked – it’s every day,” he said.“There are days when it’s worse than others, but there are comrades who get it far worse than myself.“We have a member in St James’ and the cops have a patrol outside his house every morning when he is going to work and bringing kids to school.

A second referendum doesn’t do that and the voters – in very, very large numbers – will not accept that.”Stoke Central MP Gareth Snell suggested that shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer had engineered the sht in Labour’s stance.“If I was being a bit unkind, part of me thinks this has been what Keir wanted all along, to move the Labour Party to a point of so much confusion this seems to be the only way forward,” he told the BBC.“Which is disappointing, because in the early days I thought he really wants to speak to those of us in leave areas who have real concerns, not just for what this means for our party but what this means for the connection our party has with those communities.”Meanwhile, senior shadow Cabinet ministers defended the policy amid suggestions senior party sources were briefing against them.Sir Keir told BBC Radio ’s Today that “elected politicians” – rather than aides – were setting out the Labour position.Whoever briefed that my colleague “misspoke” undermines the sovereignty of the current shadow cabinet. https:t.co wtPbtybq— Tom WatsonFebruary , Shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry said: “I’ve seen some nonsense that I ‘misspoke’ earlier on a public vote.“Pretty hard to misspeak identically in  interviews, but for clarity:Theresa May won’t accept our deal, then the public must decide: do we accept whatever deal she gets through, or do we Remain  Got it ”Deputy Labour leader Tom Watson said: “Whoever briefed that my colleague ‘misspoke’ undermines the sovereignty of the current shadow cabinet.”The Prime Minister claimed the policy sht meant Mr Corbyn “has gone back on his promise to respect the referendum result and now wants to hold a isive second referendum that would take our country right back to square one”.“Anyone who voted Labour at the last election because they thought he would deliver Brexit will rightly be appalled,” she said."},{"url":null,"title":"theresa may pledges vote on brexit delay if mps reject nodeal amid uproar in the commons","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsSix NationsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeSpring EditionHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

He was well-known and much-loved in this city’s dance music circles and there is no doubt that Derry ravers who cut their teeth on the dancefloors of the North West would have styled it out to his uplting house music. In the days when the Troubles were still raging, Protestants and Catholics started to come together having found a dferent kind of religion in dance music and Hurley’s pulpit was the DJ box.Chris took the ‘Barn’ in Kelly’s, Portrush, where a meagre  or  punters turned up for his first ‘Club Night’ and, within weeks, transformed it into a heaving success with , dance music lovers from Derry and all over the North turning up every week to make it an unbridled success.The Point Inn just over the border in Quigley’s Point, Donegal, was another club – a place of the stuff of legends for Derry ravers – where they went in their droves while Chris stood smiling at the decks.Derry DJs, promoters, those with fond memories of their raving youth and those who continued to enjoy Chris’ music over the years, shared their shock, disbelief and sadness following the news of his death on February .Charlie Dillon, also known as DJ Bill-X, believes it is only fitting that Derry’s dance music community, of which Chris was a huge part, should pay tribute to the man who has been hailed a ‘pioneer’ and ‘legend’ of the Irish dance music scene.“I met Chris in the early s, I had been working in Kelly’s nightclub when I was a student in Portrush,” he said.“Chris had only started doing nights in the famous Barn - within a few weeks he was catapulted into playing packed houses and bringing guest DJs from all over the UK. Chris was one of the reasons I started to DJ myself. He was a very modest and witty fella, but he knew his music inside and out and stuck to the type of music that he wanted to play, he DJed all over Ireland and the UK. A few years ago we were very lucky to get into guest DJ at our re-rub nights.“Chris was a true pioneer and was the godfather of house in Northern Ireland and his legacy will live on. My thoughts and prayers are with the Hurley family and his little daughter, Scarlett.”Derry DJ, Paul Moran, better known in music circles as DJ Paul P, described Chris as an ‘innovator’ and a ‘legend’.“I first met Chris in  when I clamoured over the DJ box in Kelly’s to ask him to be our guest DJ at new night we were starting in the Point Inn,” he said.“Thankfully he agreed and the rest as they say is history. Our paths crossed many times over the intervening years. I will always remember Chris as an innovator, a DJ of principal who would not compromise his musical style to please the masses.“Chris set the bar high for all others that would follow. He was a real gentleman and a legend of Irish dance music. He will be sorely missed and his legacy will live long in the hearts of the thousands of people who were lucky enough to attend Kellys in the early days of the rave - a magical time made by Chris Hurley.”“He was definitely at the forefront of a le changing movement - a movement that helped break down religious and sectarian barriers during the dark years of Northern Irelands Troubles.”Another of the city’s home-grown talents, DJ Darren McMenamin said Chris was an inspiration to him and set him on the path to do what he truly loves.“Although I was into dance house music around the late s early s, it wasn’t until  and my first visit to Kelly’s, witnessing one of Chris Hurley’s now legendary all night DJ sets, that I even considered the thought of being a DJ,” he said.“Up on the Decks, top off, , people eating out of the palm of his hand...hanging on every tune! Everyone focused on him. I was instantly drawn into the scene.“After going week in, week out, for a few months, the Point Inn opened on Sundays with Chris at the helm. I was there the first night and didn’t take long to be over chatting to Chris about music and some general trainspotting on my behalf.“He was always generous with his time and knowledge and a true inspiration for me and many like me. After a couple of years raving I then went on to become a DJ myself and anytime I ran into Chris he always had time for chat and always showed me a lot of respect.“In more recent years we spoke a lot through Facebook and he invited me along to play at his Barn -year reunions in Sandino’s which was a real honour.“He was a gentleman and a true pioneer of the dance music scene and will be sorely missed.”Stephen Porter from Derry-based dance organisation Jika Jika, said Chris had the ability to unite people through his music: “We were very shocked and saddened to hear the news about Chris illness.“I was lucky to have got to know Chris over the years and he was always an inspirational figure to me and someone I looked up to greatly. His passion for music was infectious and his mannerisms would make you feel at ease.“His legacy is that of someone that brought a war-torn country together through music and firmly established dance music in NI. Deepest sympathies to all Chris friends and family.”While Ann Harley, Proprietor of Sandino’s, said: “Chris ran our Saturday nights for almost a year in . I had missed the Kelly’s Barn years, so didn’t realise at the time how well known and respected he was.“He put  per cent into every night he ran for us ,best DJs, classy posters and flyers, great attention to detail. Apart from that, from the start, he just fitted in and became a friend to a lot of us. Can’t believe we won’t see him again, as everyone says, a proper gentleman. RIP Chris.”‘Godfather of House’googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshPoignant tributes also came from those in the dance music community outside Derry. Not least from Chris’ dear friends.Mark Mc Dermott from Dungiven said he was honoured to have been his close friend: “To me, Chris Hurley was the epitome of a gentleman, kindness, the most great friend, and musician. Also the epitome of class but so humble at the same time. To know him well was a true honour. He was such an inspiration to me in all angles of le and he helped me in more ways than he will ever know. “Chris had talent to burn as a DJ from such a young age and was a pioneer in music, the first to create the house music dance scene in Ireland that will forever be remembered as the Love Years, aptly named as he not only bridged the religious ide at the time with music but he brought all the youth together. He was a living legend but his legend will forever live on in my heart, and the hearts of many.“Gone but never ever forgotten - the Godfather of House, but most importantly my dearest friend and brother in spirit.”Hector McLennan, a dance music promoter from Strabane who has passed the genes onto his own daughter, celebrated Ibiza club DJ, Loéca, paid a heartfelt tribute to ‘the Godfather of House’.“Chris Hurleys name is synonymous with the introduction, development and explosion of dance music in Ireland,” he said.“He has earned a permanent place in the history of our dance culture. He was Northern Irelands godfather of house. Im not saying that he was the only one, there were others who played their part, but he was definitely at the forefront of a le changing movement - a movement that helped break down religious and sectarian barriers during the dark years of Northern Irelands Troubles.“Chris had the tunes that every DJ wanted. Ive often been in situations with people in the music business and we would hear a tune. One of us would always say, \"That was a big Chris Hurley tune.\" Like DJs of his time, his message was spread through DJ Mix Tapes. What car didnt have a Chris Hurley tape back in the day “Over the last few years I enjoyed some great nights with Chris. We reminisced about the good old days and we hit it off because we were both excited about the current house music scene. Stand out moments include driving to Portrush after Sven Vath in Eglinton to hear Chris in Portrush with John Morrison on tow, a mad Paddys weekend in Portrush in  and of course having him as a guest in Sugar on a night co-promoted with Jika Jika. His love and passion for House Music had never faltered. He didnt want to re-live his success of the past but was still an innovator pushing out the barriers and seeking out those fresh new sounds.“I will always remember Chris for his love and passion for House Music. Chris Hurley, thank you for the memories.”\"He was erudite, intelligent and so so passionate about his music...he led from the front and was key to the start of the dance scene in Northern Ireland, a movement that would have a huge role in changing attitudes and lives.\"Neal McClelland, DJ and Presenter at Downtown Radio and Cool FM, also paid his respects recognising how powerful Chris’ music was in turbulent times: “Chris was an innovator and total gentleman that loved the groove and helped shape the wave of rave that swept across our country and created the bridge between two religions that paved the path for the future through music.”Darren Drake, DJ and good friend, said: “Chris was a devoted father, a loving son, brother and uncle. Ever since our first meeting, in those halcyon days of the house music revolution of the early s, of which he was a true pioneer, Chris Hurley has been, and forever shall be, my inspiration and my friend.”Ray McLaughlin, also known as DJ X-Ray: “Chris paved the way for a whole new generation of DJs some of us wouldnt still be DJing todayit wasnt for his vision in the early s.”Glen Molly said he wished Chris could have been there for the th anniversary of the Barn: “The  years of the Barn was missing him,” he said, “I would really have loved him to have played it.”Timmy Stewart, a DJ from Belfast and close friend to Chris, said: “I loved the fact Chris was so upfront with his music.“We had heard Secret Knowledge’s ‘Sugar Daddy’ played on the Essential Selection one Friday night and he played a white label of it the very next night. I always felt privileged to be exposed to that level of cutting edge music especially at that age and time.”Col Hamilton, Promoter at Lush! Official , paid this tribute on behalf of the club where Chris first burst onto the scene: “We were saddened to hear the news of the passing of original Kelly’s resident DJ Chris Hurley.“Back in early  when Kelly’s Barn was a live band and rock venue, the late James Kelly let a young local lad start a Saturday ‘Club Night’, the rest, as they say, is history. Chris Hurley started with about  people on the first night and within six months was attracting thousands of clubbers from across the North and Donegal flocking to hear the latest UK European house music. To say he started a legacy would be only fair and Lush! would not be here  years later as one of the UK’s leading venues without Chriss original vision.“We would like to take this opportunity to extend our condolences to His Family circle and his young daughter. Until we meet again, old friend.”Liverpool DJ, Steve Vertigo, said a phone call in  from Chris went on to ‘open the door on a magical Northern Irish adventure that has rumbled on for  years’.\"When I met him we shared similar hairand were both bang in the middle of an incredible love affair with house music,\" he said.\"That first night waiting in the Barn for it to open with hundreds of people outside banging on the walls chanting Let us in!” like some sort of fantastic zombie survival film was only a hint of the craziness to come. That first booking turned into a friendship and many repeat visits hanging out for days after gigs in Portrush with Chris and Joanne. He was erudite, intelligent and so so passionate about his music. Always ready with a laugh and a plan and an appetite for good old-fashioned fun. He led from the front and was key to the start of the dance scene in Northern Ireland, a movement that would have a huge role in changing attitudes and lives.\"In  I played one last time with him in the main room at Kelly’s, a reunion and a waypoint on a long journey that now feels so short. It brought back memories of beautul, messy hazy times in Portrush when we were all young and had no idea how big this dream of utopia would grow.\"Ill remember his smile and the way hed look you up and down, head tilted slightly back as hed work out whether you were talking rubbish and how he was going to wind you up. He was a romantic and a dreamer and the gods know we need more of those.\"My heartfelt sympathies to his loved ones, family and friends. He was one of the good ones. Rise in Power, Chris. Big Love.\"The Hurley family said that they have taken heart in the tremendous outpouring of love and sympathy since Chris’ death.In a statement they said: “We are finding it very hard to take in, we miss him so much - he was so special to each and every one of us.“As I said before Christopher was our hero what a fighter to the end - he always believed he was going to get better.“We as a family are so proud of what Christopher achieved through his music bringing everyone together. Tributes that have been made to Christopher are so special to us knowing how well he was thought of and showed us everyone thought the same as us...what a gentleman he was.”The late Chris was son to Joe and Margaret, loving father of Scarlett and the late Ava, brother of Joseph, Sharon and Rhonda, a loving brother-in-law and uncle and a legend in Irish dance music.PICTURED ABOVE: The late Chris Hurley whose passion for his music made him a favourite with dance music lovers in Derry and beyond."},{"url":"https://img.resized.co/derrynow/eyJkYXRhIjoie1widXJsXCI6XCJodHRwczpcXFwvXFxcL3MzLWV1LXdlc3QtMS5hbWF6b25hd3MuY29tXFxcL3N0b3JhZ2UucHVibGlzaGVycGx1cy5pZVxcXC9tZWRpYS5yaXZlcm1lZGlhLmllXFxcL3VwbG9hZHNcXFwvMjAxOVxcXC8wMlxcXC8yNTE1MjI1MFxcXC9BZGFtLU1VUlJBWS1MR0JULnBuZ1wiLFwid2lkdGhcIjo2NDcsXCJoZWlnaHRcIjozNDAsXCJkZWZhdWx0XCI6XCJodHRwczpcXFwvXFxcL2NhY2hlLnJlc2l6ZWQuY29cXFwvbm8taW1hZ2UucG5nXCIsXCJvcHRpb25zXCI6W119IiwiaGFzaCI6ImU0MDM1NTkzZTc1MGNmNzI0MzY0NmU2NTQ0NjhiYzhiMzIxYzVlYTkifQ==/adam-murray-lgbt.png","title":"lgbt history celebrated outing past event museum free derry","story":"The award-winning Museum of Free Derry will host the Derry Hub of OUTing the Past, the International Festival of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Trans History this coming weekend.Four speakers will each highlight an aspect of LGBT+ history in what’s sure to be a very memorable afternoon event taking place on Saturday in association with Cara-Friend.From noon, Edmund Lynch will discuss his work recording over  interviews with older LGBTQ as well as with important political supporters who played their part like ex-Presidents Mary Robinson and Mary McAleese, all telling the story of the struggle of LGBT+ people in Ireland to become full citizens in their own country.At .pm, Kate Drinane, from the National Gallery of Ireland will talk about key works from the National Gallery of Ireland’s collection, with focus on the narrative of Irish LGBT+ history through art and how art can help us explore and understand how Ireland’s LGBT+ community has been shaped by it’s past.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshAt .pm, a talk by Adam Murraywill offer an insight into the mindsets and needs of LGBT+ people who wrote to Cara-Friend between  and , offering illuminating research into the period.

I would like to see this work completed soon.Cllr Curran said the petition contained the names of concerned parents, community representatives and local residents and hoped the new path can be delivered sooner, rather than later.ldquoParents are keen to see the path provided to increase the safety of children who walk to and from the school. While new speed limits have been introduced in the village, speeding drivers remains a concern, he said.ldquoThe safety of the children who attend the primary school is of paramount importance as indeed is the safety of residents who walk along this particular route.The local politician, who thanked Angela Wills for helping compile the petition, hopes roads officials will act, highlighting the importance of having a safe connection between St Maryrsquos and Chapeltown.Cllr Curran said that while the villagersquos new speed limits were a welcome addition, the provision of the new path must be a priority to help ensure that a busy rural area is safer for all road users.Cllr Enright said community groups around the Dunsford area had joined forces to support the campaign for the new path to connect the school to the nearby church and community centre. He also confirmed that another petition calling for the footpath had secured around  signatures.He continued: ldquoSome progress to deliver the new path was achieved last month with a site visit by roads officials which I organised when school principal Ronan Fitzpatrick and parish priest Fr Gerald McCloskey had the opportunity to walk the route with them.ldquoHopefully this campaign is now on the cards for success. The most recent on-site review with roads officials produced an extra  points for this project bringing it up to . This makes it a project that roads officials might look at,there is enough political and community pressure.Cllr Enright said thatthe new path project was to proceed, all parties must make what he described as a ldquogenuine effort to pull together and support the school.He added: ldquoThis project has all the features of a campaign that can succeed.

It is important everyone continues to support traders during this scheme..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/9476499.jpg","title":"seans surreal abbey road experience","story":"With his great grandfatherrsquos fiddle in hand, local musician Sean Magee recently recorded a single at the iconic Abbey Road Studios, a place made famous by The Beatles.Calling the experience of recording in the same studio as The Beatles ldquosurreal, Sean explained how the opportunity arose.ldquoIrsquove just recently joined up with a guy called Rory Gallagher, hersquos from Kilcar, Donegal, and his project is called Rory and the Island for he owned the Island Bar over in Lanzarote for five or six years before he came home. He asked me would I come along and join him so we have been out on tour and we were over playing in Camden, in London last week, said Sean.He continued: ldquoHe signed with a record label called Buddy Records and they got it all sorted for us to go in and record with Abbey Road, so we were recording our new single lsquoCall My Name.rsquoWith the new single due to release on Spoty at the end of next week, Sean said: ldquoWersquove got it all nearly ready to go so therersquos just a few mixes that need to be done.Talking about the recording day, Sean said: ldquoWe were in early morning and we were just straight into it, I never really got thinking about it and about midday we took a walk around the building and seen all the big studios.ldquoWe recorded in the Gate House studio and we went into Studio Two and Studio Three to do wee bits of sample and background vocals. That was where The Beatles, Ed Sheerin and Adele all wouldrsquove recorded in as well. So it was just madness, he added.During the recording of the single Sean played his great grandfatherrsquos fiddle, an instrument which has a tale of its own to tell. Sean explained: ldquoMy great grandfather had ordered this fiddle in  before the First World War broke out and hersquod sent the money with the order. Basically then the war broke out and the fiddle didnrsquot turn up so he thought all was lost. As soon as the war was finished in , the fiddle arrived at the door. He couldnrsquot believe it. So I took it with me to Abbey Road and the song we were recording was a slow song, and therersquos a lovely deep tone out of the fiddle so I took it with me.ldquoIt was my grandadrsquos father and my grandad was delighted that I took it with me, he added.When asked how he first met Rory, Sean explained that it was through his dad, Conor Magee. He said: ldquoRory was in a band way back years ago called The Revs and they wouldrsquove been doing sets at the likes of Slane Castle. My dad is a sound engineer, and he done the sound for The Revs about  years ago. We were going over to Lanzarote and I didnrsquot know Rory at all and dad had messaged him to seehe would get me up for a song in the Island Bar.Sean continued: ldquoHe got me up and shortly after that he sent me a message to seeI wanted to do a couple of gigs over in Lanzarote. He asked me thenI wanted to go out on tour with him when he was home. So it came out of nowhere really.Sean has since been touring with Rory and the Island for the last six months, travelling all over Ireland and the UK. Talking about their upcoming gigs, Sean said: ldquoWersquove Germany for St. Patrickrsquos weekend and America then in April, over to New York.He added: ldquoWe also have a local gig in Charliersquos Bar on March . Wersquore really looking forward to it.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This usually means by the Minister in the Department of Communities but with no Stormont this onus now falls to civil servants. The regional rate is further complicated because as yet there is no budget set for Northern Ireland for the coming year.This makes it almost impossible for civil servants to establish what the regional rate needs to be. The budget, in the absence of Stormont, is set by the Secretary of State.

However Mr Nesbitt said that he was “realistic” about the current situation and added: “I do wonder whether Brexit will prove to be the biggest own goal in  years from unionists. “I know a lot of the emphasis is on the border and on tarf and on trade - and these things are important and need to be resolved - but the other issue is identity.“The Belfast Agreement made very clear that we all self-define in identity and we can be British or Irish or both...I know there are a lot of people who feel they were diminished on  June  by that result for Brexit and a lot of them believe that what happened there was that English nationalists came in over their heads and did exactly what the Agreement said couldn’t happen - denied them their sense of being European. They feel diminished and the consequence is that the constitutional question is back on the table for the first time in  years. Where it leads, nobody knows.”Mr Nesbitt backed remain in the referendum but saw his party ided on the issue.Appealing to nationalists, he said: “If you’re going to have a border poll...don’t let it be like Brexit. Before there’s a border poll it has to be spelled out in enormous detail – and truthfully, unlike Brexit – ‘these are the implications should you choose to vote for constitutional change’.”Citing practical issues from the nature of the health service to the sort of police force which would operate after a vote for Irish unity, Mr Nesbitt said it was the responsibility of those arguing for an end to partition to explain what it would mean in practical terms.But although the Strangford MLA made clear that he continued to firmly believe in the Union and that it was up to nationalists to convince him otherwise, he added: “I know of people from a unionist background who are now basically thinking the unthinkable and just basically asking the question ‘would I be better off or worse off ’”Mr Nesbitt said that his fear for unionism was that as well as Brexit being an “own goal”, the wider social and political environment is changing but unionism might not be reacting quickly enough to the altered landscape.The former victims’ commissioner said he accepted that in any border polleither side got % plus one then they would be the winner. However, he said that such a scenario would be a “disaster” and a decisive result would be far better.David Murphy funeral: Some people will only remember the bad he did Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"try catch            ..

After a spell in the marketing ision of John Thompson’s, he moved, to Craigavon as the PR of Goodyear.Irvine also met his future we in  - Ingvor came from Jonkoping in Sweden - and they were married two years later in her home town. They have two daughters and two sons.Irvine had many jobs - as a PR consultant with a Dublin firm, in sales with Canada Le Insurance in Belfast, and in , he started his own financial firm in Lurgan - Medimoneycare. The study bug hit with the turn of the millennium, and with the sons going to Kenya for a spell as volunteer teachers, Irvine thought it sounded like a good idea, went with them . He fell in love with the place, and developed a real compassion for the poverty of the people.He said at that time: “The injustice of the greedy evangelists really angered me. How anyone can exploit the crushing poverty and yet live in luxury is infuriating. It’s a mockery of every principle of Christianity.”In recent times he enjoyed setting up and contributing to the Facebook group Old Lurgan Photographs widely sharing pictures of residents and locations.A post on their Facebook page said: “I am saddened to announce the news of Irvine Grey’s passing. On behalf of all of us within this group, we extend our heartfelt condolences to his we Ingvor, his daughters Fiona and Lynda and sons David and Simon.“Irvine was a man of faith and this gave him immense strength throughout his long illness. Irvine started this group seven years ago and it is impossible to measure the pleasure it has brought to the people of this town and beyond.“In time it will be a decision for his family should it remain as his legacy. I feel proud and honoured to say I knew Irvine and know the devotion he gave to it. Irvine, thank you for your contribution and commitment.

I canrsquot see that there is any way the council can fix this, there just isnrsquot the infrastructure.ldquoItrsquos obvious that it is not going to work, it would be a waste of money to even try it.But another Plassey Street resident, Bat Goddard, said: ldquoTo spend pound, on an experiment, which in  months they could reject, is ludicrous.ldquoWe have the widest street in Penarth here but they want to turn it in to a one-way system.ldquoWe need to stop this folly now.Vale council member Geoff Cox, who is the cabinet member for Neighbourhood Services and Transport, has since said a report will be put forward that retains the roundabout and instead looks at enhancing other ideas to solve crossing issues and traffic problems.Cllr Coxsaid: ldquoAs the Cabinet meeting date approached, I became more aware of the strength of local feeling associated with the highway option being proposed, hence my decision to defer the report meaning it was not even considered by Cabinet on January .ldquoI have since reviewed the ious options further, which has included my meeting with local ward members to obtain their detailed views on all options. I now intend to present an amended report to cabinet on February .ldquoThe report will propose that option one in the previous report now be taken forward, which retains the current roundabout though enhances the gateway route into Penarth whilst providing much safer crossing opportunities for cyclists and pedestrians. There is no requirement to complete any spending on this project by the end of this financial year.ldquoIt is very dficult to please everyone with highway improvement schemes but I very much hope that this option provides the active travel benefits we are seeking and is viewed by residents and visitors to Penarth as being the most appropriate. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It was made with willow grown in the grounds of Cogan Primary School.More than  people attended the hill rolling ceremony down Clf Hill towards Penarth Esplanade - with the school pupils from Cogan and pupils and families from Ysgol Pen Y Garth helping to roll it along.The head was accompanied by a wooden frame from the Mabinogion stories called the Window of Sorrows made by Tony Simms, and the artist Ifor Davies undertook the ritual sawing of the Window of Sorrows on the clftops and read the Bendigeidfran story from the Mabinogion tales before the rolling went ahead.The head of Bendigeidfran and the Window of Sorrows was accompanied by Penarths Mari Lwyd which is a symbol of hosting, and negotiating hospitality through song and teasing. Richard Parry led the Mari Lwyd this year, and on arriving at the bottom of the hill the celebration visited local shops and resaurants along the sea front wishing the proprietors and customers a Happy New Year. We sang for Romeo Italian restaurant, The Fig Tree, James Sommerin, The Crazy Cafe and Hamptons seaside shop. After reaching the bottom of the hill the head was carried by the children along with the Mari Lwyd to the shops and cafes along the seafront where dferent New Year songs - called Calenig - were sung in each venue and led by local opera singer Richard Parry.Speaking about the event, artist Haf Weighton said: \"I loved working with Cogan School. Itrsquos a hidden gem in Penarth with very enthusiastic staff who were happy to jump in to get involved in this project at short notice. Richard Parry and the schools deputy head Tom Lewis, ran a assembly to the whole school on the new year traditions. Then children from across the school came to see me working on the piece. \"It was lovely to hear children who donrsquot come from homes where Welsh is spoken enthusing about the mabinogi tales and Welsh traditions. Children from Pen y Garth joined in after the head was created. They helped us roll it down the hill from the clf tops.\"Richard Parry, who helped to organise the event and led the Mari Lwyd, said: \"It was great to see so many people come together to celebrate Hen Galan in Penarth. The giant Bendegeidfran got his name because he was the Blessed Bran - the best friend anyone could ever want - and in the stories of the Mabinogion he was loved by those who knew him. He is a symbol of friendship and celebrating together. \"The community celebration on the clftops was thoroughly enjoyed by children and adults alike, and even though its a bit chilly it was wonderful to see so many people out of doors, celebrating, singing and enjoying wishing everyone we met Blwyddyn Newydd Dda and Happy New Year.\"The head will now go on display at a iety of places, including Pen y Garth School, Cogan Primary School, Penarth Library and The Hearth Gallery Llandough Hospital. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Dealing with this type of call prevents our staff from dealing with genuine emergencies.ldquoCalling an ambulance when you donrsquot need one wastes time and resources which could have been better spent responding someone genuinely in need of the high level clinical care ambulance crews provide. Ambulances are not a taxi service and arriving at hospital by ambulance does not mean yoursquoll be seen quicker.\"She added: ldquoIf someone is seriously ill or injured and their le is at risk, you should call  immediately.

Why the Conservative Independent Council has been so ineffective is beyond me.ldquoNot content with creating these awful conditions a trench has been excavated across the entrance to the busy Medical Centre.ldquoThis resulted in the entrance being narrowed.The failure to engage with the Medical Centre is a disgrace.The trench excavation was carried out by the Gas Transportation Company Ltd in a separate development.The medical centre used Facebook to warn residents attempting to access the site that contractors had partially blocked the entrance.Plaid Councillor Richard Grigg said: ldquoThis site has been operational since last summer.ldquoIt is only now that hopefully a decent wheel wash has been installed.ldquoWhy has the County Council been so uncaring about this situation ldquoThey have a duty to protect the community.ldquoThe site which was sold to the builders by the council for millions has been a real problem with huge contractorsrsquo vehicles causing chaos on local roads. The planning process has totally failed Dinas Powys.Steve Williams, managing director of Barratt Homes South Wales, said: ldquoWe always strive to minimise the effects of construction and apologise to anyone who has been inconvenienced by work in Dinas Powys.ldquoWe have a jet wash on site during opening hours to clean the tyres of vehicles leaving the development throughout the day.The construction is part of the Local Development Plan that will see , new homes built in the Vale of Glamorgan over the next eight years.Planning permission had been granted in February , despite criticisms of the impact that the new site would have on congestion in and around Dinas Powys, which, planning officers confirmed, is already at maximum capacity.While acknowledging extra homes would generate more traffic, officers said increases would be negligible and traffic around Murch Road and Cardf Road would be over capacity in several years regardless. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a commentOrder byOldest firstNewest firstHighest scoredLowest scoredLoading comments...

That being the case, this council, like many others in Wales, is unable to continue to provide the level of subsidy to outdoor sports provision that it has in the past.ldquoExploring dferent ways of working, including the transfer of responsibilities in appropriate circumstances to community groups is a key element of the councilrsquos strategy moving forward as it addresses dficult budget priorities.ldquoFollowing the successful transfer of responsibilities for five libraries to community-based organisations and looking at a number of successful sports clubs across the Vale of Glamorgan who operate without any subsidy from the Council, it is hoped that the majority of clubs currently using council facilities will be able to continue to provide opportunities for all to participate in sports activities. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work.

Young people were also involved in the protest at Craigavon Civic CentreUp to  protesters were around the Civic Centre, most from the unions, GMB, Unite and NIPSA who quietly protested at the front of the building.During the more raucous demonstrations outside the chamber, some councillors felt staff were at risk of a window coming in and they were asked to move for their own safety.One councillor said the police should be called and another Cllr Arnold Hatch suggested the flashing lights, which demonstrators were using against the window, could trigger elipespy in sufferers.Many councillors expressed ‘disgust’ and ‘shock’ that information from a prior leisure services committee meeting had been leaked to the Lurgan Mail.Unions members protesting at any privatising of leisure services in the ABC Council areaIt had been revealed that a vote supporting an option to create a council-owned companyhad split the leisure services committee with the DUP and Ulster Unionists’ majority vote swinging in favour of the Co-Co.Unions representing staff at council facilities were in uproar and lobbied council intensely since that meeting several weeks ago to have the service remain in-house.However at last night’s full council meeting, it was decided to reverse the Leisure Services Committee option and keep the leisure services management in-house.After going into ‘Confidential Business’ the Council spent several hours without journalists discussing the matter and issued a statement following the meeting.Unions, including the GMB, Unite and NIPSA were out in force a protest against privatising leisure servicesLater an ABC Council statement revealed councillors had unanimously agreed to transform leisure services in-house.The statement said: “With the brand new £m South Lake Leisure Centre construction due to complete on schedule in summer , elected representatives reviewed a number of options on how the new facility would be managed.“This review was undertaken to ensure that ABC Council’s largest capital investment project undertaken to date would be placed within the most appropriate structures to ensure its long-term sustainability, provide full value for money for ratepayers and maximise the potential of this flagship public resource.Was using phone while driving Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"LURG | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"LURG | Article Teaser\"“The options included in-house transformation, creating a Council-owned company fully answerable to elected representatives and ratepayers, or appointing an established leisure operator to run the facility.Young Oliver McKenna protesting outside Craigavon Civic Centre with his dad Paul“It was agreed that Council would continue deliver leisure services directly by owning, operating and maintaining the assets, and employing all staff.“Under the plan agreed, Council will be fully responsible for the efficient operation and growth of the exciting new development and in its future.”There was jubilation among workers in Unite, GMB and NIPSA late last night as they heard reports that ABC councillors voted to overturn a previous recommendation to outsource the new Craigavon Leisure centre. Gareth Scott, Regional Officer for Unite welcomed the decision by councillors and thanked those parties and iniduals who had supported the in-house delivery model from the start.“All three workforce unions, Unite, GMB and NIPSA, at ABC council came together to build an unstoppable campaign to demand the new Craigavon Lakes leisure centre remain under council management and not be outsourced to a private or CoCo management company. “The experience in other parts of NI where leisure services have been outsourced has been unormly bad. “This represents a convincing victory for the workforce who mobilised against this decision and the huge numbers in the local community who raised concerns. Unite would like to thank those parties and inidual councillors who from the start supported the in-house model but we also welcome the fact that one of the two parties who had previously voted for outsourcing decided to reverse that stance and act in the best interests of everyone concerned.“This vote will ensure that the new leisure centre will operate in-house for its first year of operation. All unions must remain focussed on ensuring that there is no backtracking on this commitment and that the new leisure centre remains under council management thereafter. Our local public services must remain fully democratically-accountable there should be no diminution of either the status of workers or decisions that put generating surpluses above the needs of service users.“This is a victory for common-sense delivered thanks to all our members and shop stewards and those of our partner unions, the GMB and NIPSA,” Mr Scott concluded.Sinn Féin Councillor Catherine Nelson said: “We have been engaging extensively with the unions, leisure staff, council officers and other parties.“Despite Unionist support to out source the centre at committee level a few weeks ago we are delighted that after much negotiation the in-house working model enjoyed full party support.“This was a vote of confidence in our extremely capable and talented leisure staff. “We look forward to working with them to ensure the delivery of the high quality facility our ratepayers deserve.”Independent Cllr Paul Berry said he is delighted with decision“Following many weeks of discussions around the new operating model for this new state-of-the-art leisure centre I am delighted that the right decision has been made to keep the services In-House with a review in one year of it opening its doors.“Whilst I appreciate it was on legal grounds that the Option  could not be voted on, as it did not have the % support in the Chamber, this outcome is most welcome for our fantastic staff.“From day one I was supportive of keeping it In-House because I believe in our staff and have every confidence in them working with us all to ensure we have a first class facility for our rate payers. I know many of our staff and they are professional, innovative and passionate about their jobs and it’s vital we support them and ensure certainty in thier employment.“Could I commend the Unions for their work. I always had productive meetings with them throughout this process and I know they are keen to move forward and help deliver the Transfomation with us for the benefit of all.”try catch            ..

When he was in his s, Pat McKeever took over the farm after the death of his father Peter, who had run an apple canning business on the site. Pat said: “My daddy was one of three brothers who used to can apples. They’d get the apples from the local orchards, peel them and can them. Daddy then started growing his own apples and supplying the fresh market and the cider markets.”Now Pat’s son, and Peter’s grandson – also called Peter – is the third generation farmer who is set to carry on the business. Pat’s we Catherine and their four daughters also have integral roles to play as the craft cider making end of the agri-business continues to grow.Pat, Catherine and Peter McKeever of Long Meadow FarmLong Meadow started off with two craft cider drinks in  before introducing a mulled cider and a cider aged in oak barrels, some of which had been used in the original apple canning business. Over the past two years the company has branched out into flavoured ciders, apple juice and apple cider vinegar – famed for its health benefits.Catherine said: “I know everything goes through a bit of a fad, but I think the craft ciders are still holding their own. The mindset of cider has changed with craft ciders. “A lot of people would have associated cider in their younger days – maybe when they were at university – as a cheap drink you can buy in big quantities and get a hit off.“But that wasn’t craft cider. People are prepared to pay that little bit extra for the quality that comes with craft cider.“We’re using all our own fruit. We make it in smaller quantities so it can hold all the flavours, that’s the way we want to keep it. We only use hand-picked fruit, not any that has fallen on the ground.”Of the harvesting process, Pat said: “We would have between  to  pickers. They would come the third week in July and do a bit of summer pruning.Resurfacing works on A Portadown Road, ArmaghBrexit and data protection - will firms still have to comply with the new EU GDPR  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"“Once that’s finished, in August they start into the picking of the apples, that goes right through to the end of October, first week in November.“The picking season we call it the nine weeks of hell. It’s your livelihood. You are depending on that fruit.“We harvest approximately , tonne of apples yearly.”Catherine explained how the orchard came to be illuminated: “A man called Walter Holt came to the farm last year to buy some apple cider vinegar. “I got talking to him and he gave me his card and told me what he did – an outdoor lighting artist.“I didn’t think much of it at the time, but I think the seeds had been sewn. I played about with it in my mind for a long time that it could be something we could work with.”Walter Holt and his assistant Orlanda Delaforce spent a total of  hours working on the installation of the lighting scheme.Walter commented: “The challenge on this particular scheme was working with smaller trees in an orchard setting. It’s a compact area and our solution was to develop a one way circular trail. “We tried to have as much creative iety as possible, implementing dferent approaches to dferent trees, with the whole colour scheme carefully thought out.”The light display is accompanied by music composed by Londonderry musician Sharon Graham.Catherine said: “We chose Valentine’s week for the treelumination launch as we felt it was a novel way in terms of adding to the romance of walking in the moonlight, but it’s by no means just for couples, it’s designed very much as a family experience for everyone.“I think we all have a vision of apple orchards complete with apple blossom or an abundance of fruit.“This illuminations event highlights the orchards in a totally dference perspective – a raw natural resting state before the cycle of growth begins.”The light show – designed by Walter Holt of Travelling Treeluminations – is the first of its kind to be held in an orchard environment and will open to the public from today until Saturday, from pm to pm each evening at  Loughgall Road.Entry is £ per adult and £ for children. A family ticket for two adults and two children costs £.Visitors will be given the opportunity to see the pressing and blending facilities on the farm as well as taste some of the products.Artisan food will be on sale as well as some free refreshment including tea, coffee and hot chocolate. Set to benefit from the four-day event is local charity ‘Katie-Rose’s Journey’.For more information on this week’s illumination event and other aspects of the farm go to www.longmeadowcidertry catch  TrendingThree vehicle crash near PortadownPartner and child were lsquomaking too much noisersquoDiscovery of mans body sparks murder probeJail sentence for man who spat and screamed at hospital staffConcern as disabled woman who carrys oxygen tank slapped with parking ticket          ..

Representing the Central Craigavon area, Cllr Lennon said: “My former party has lost contact with the grassroots and no longer represents the best interest of the electorate, choosing instead to put media sound bites in place of real action.“Throughout my term as a Councillor I represented all of the constituents within my area and during my tenure as group leader I always put the community interest first.“My efforts to move away from the sectarian politics associated with the old Craigavon Council were consistently stled by the lack of clear direction from leadership and I can no longer allow my name to be associated with this isive politicking.“As a republican I believe that building a shared future and creating across-community trust is much more than just a soundbite, it should be our main task as political representatives. Following the resignations of Cllrs Curran and Cairns from Council I found myself not only frustrated in efforts to further this objective but increasingly isolated from the politics promoted by my party colleagues. The forthright honesty of the Aontú leadership impressed me and I believe this fresh political party offers a real alternative for Republicans who genuinely want to create a new Republic that is erse and accommodating of all our citizens.”Aontú leader Peadar Tóibín said: “Fergal Lennon is exactly the calibre of public representative that Aontú is looking to attract as the party continues to develop and grow - a Councillor that will bring about the most effective political representation for all the people of this island.“While the party as a whole continues to forge head, founding  Cumann in  weeks across the country, it is people like Fergal, who will help build in their local communities.“We are delighted that Fergal is now joining our team. I am confident that Cllr Lennon will be joined by several more Councillors following the local election in May.“The north of Ireland is being hammered by food, housing and health poverty. Enterprise and the economy are not getting the supports they need. With Stormont in stalemate, we have direct rule in all but name as the third Westminster budget is being implemented. The DUP are the only party in power through their Confidence and Supply Agreement and yet they are completely unrepresentative of the people of the north on a range of dferent issues. “The two governments need to implement Joint Authority to get departmental decisions made and to provide the necessarily incentive to get the DUP to fulfil their responsibilities. The All Ireland economy must be built to mitigate against the worst excesses of Brexit. The establishment parties are all wedded to theto the pre-existing Stormont.

How did you get started in the industry  When we first opened Asia Supermarket in , it was the family’s ambition to bring a taste of home to Belfast. We brought the Chinese culture to the local community through cuisine and provided authentic and tasty ingredients for the hospitality trade here. We branched out due to demand to also provide Indian, Korean, Philippine, Thai and Middle Eastern food and are always looking for opportunities to extend our range.

What is the most dficult part of your job  One of the most dficult parts of the job is sourcing good quality produce at competitive prices and enhancing the range of products available. However, we’re very proud of our new supermarket and warehouse which provides even more quality and choice for our customers. What are the challenges facing your sector, and the economy in general  One of the biggest challenges facing our sector is the cost of goods from our suppliers, particularly those procured in foreign currencies which in turn has a knock-on effect on what we charge our wholesale and retail customers. To maintain our share of the market we constantly endeavour to get the best prices from our suppliers so that we can pass on competitive prices to our customers to maintain and grow our market share. With Brexit looming it will bring a major impact on imports costs and supplier prices which will present a major challenge for our business.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/cctv.jpg","title":"from cctv to gdpr the people keeping your business safe","story":"Posted on Tuesday  February  by John Mulgrew Ulster Business examines an ever-changing approach to business security and what companies are turning to in an increasingly digital age Is Big Brother watching you  For many, the idea of a society peppered with cameras and other forms of security harks back to the view of a dystopian Orwellian society. But with the UK having some of the highest levels of CCTV cameras in the world, businesses in particular are ensuring that both their physical security, along with digital and paper footprints, are protected. Angela Bennett, joint managing director of Belfast-based Diamond Systems says the role of the security system has evolved hugely in the last few years to become something of a capital investment. Offering more than surveillance, the new security systems we are using provide everything from analysis of the way a firm works to conventional protection. And she says an “ever-increasing” demand around health and safety in the workplace is encouraging more investment in reliable security that is as integral to a firm’s operations as its IT network. “Businesses now treat security systems as a capital investment in technology designed to ensure business continuity, monitor workflow processes, and help manage the ever-increasing demands around health and safety in the workplace,” Angela says. “We are seeing more reliance being placed on security systems, particularly CCTV, as an integral part of site safety management systems. Intelligent system design is essential at the outset of any CCTV project, to ensure adequate coverage and image usability, even in low light conditions.” There have been sophisticated advances in video camera technology in the last few years which have offered businesses new capabilities including motion detection that records only the things that matter, ‘heatmapping’ to determine where the most traffic flows in an area to people counting and unusual motion detection. These new abilities sht the former role of the CCTV camera to a new level, allowing it to file more information about the operations and trends in your business, and Angela agrees.  “CCTV is also being used as a value-added tool, where analytics are incorporated into the video management system ,” she says. “Software analytics are currently benefiting the retail sector for example, helping to plan store layouts, the locations for promotion points, and the forecasting of required staffing levels.” Increasingly sophisticated security also demands its own security, Angela says. “Businesses do however need to be aware of the emerging cyber risks associated with CCTV systems, and how to proactively address them. Choosing a specialist such as Diamond, will ensure that cyber risks are addressed at system design stage, and that systems installed are both future-proof and intelligent,” she says. Beyond CCTV other trends prevalent in business security include compliance with GDPR , cloud security, and articial intelligence and among the top trends for  will be a boost in heightened cloud security. Wikibon, the open source technology knowledge sharing community, projects that the cloud’s share of enterprise computing will grow from % currently to % by . “In terms of future trends, articial intelligence, sensor integration and environmental smart tech are all future demands that will shape the security industry’s offering,” Angela says. “Through partnerships with the leading global innovators, Diamond are at the forefront of this new technology and we will see change coming at a rapid pace over the next few years.” Headquartered in Lisburn with locations in Dublin, Limerick and London, Mercury Security  Facilities Management is a security firm and facilities management business. And according to boss Frank Cullen, the service it provides has transformed considerably since the company was formed back in . “In order for security companies to truly provide fit-for-purpose security solutions to clients, it is crucial that they move with the times – embracing advances in technology, adapting to changing legislation and understanding the changing nature of crime itself. “Cyber-security, in particular, has become a massive issue so the importance of a high degree of IT competence within your security company cannot be overstated. By their very nature, most security systems require external connections to the public internet and are therefore potentially vulnerable. So very good firewall protection must be employed and the support of a dedicated and knowledgeable IT department is essential.” Some of the firms specialising in cyber-security here include Sophos – a UK-based business which develops products for communication endpoint, encryption, network security and email security. And for the digital and hard copy, Belfast-based Morgan Document Security works with both the private and public sector around storing, archiving, retrieving documentation, records, legal papers and files. As with others, Mercury’s Frank Cullen says that the introduction of GDPR in May last year has had a “massive impact on security with signicantly increased financial penalties for companies that do not carefully protect the rights of iniduals – and this includes how CCTV images are handled and controlled”. While it is now very easy to provide managers with access to images on their mobile phones and portable devices, doing so could well mean that you would be breaking the lawvery carefully controlled procedures are not in place to protect the image data, how it is to be observed and by whom. “From a hardware point of view, it is important for security providers to have the competence and capability to assess potential manufacturers and their equipment at the most detailed of levels and to have awareness of the regulatory requirements in which they must work.” Elsewhere, there’s been some movement in other elements of the security business in Northern Ireland. Newtownabbey firm Environmental Street Furniturehas announced the acquisition of Co Down based specialist perimeter security company, Sentry Posts. Sentry Posts is a supplier of bollard systems, perimeter security and traffic products in Ireland. Since establishing in , the company has partnered with ATG Access, supplying prestigious projects including Arsenal Football Club’s Emirates Stadium, Wellington Arch in London, as well as the Europa Hotel and Charles Hurst and Trust Ford dealerships in Northern Ireland.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/cleaver_1.jpg","title":"is the future bright for the ni energy market","story":"Posted on Tuesday  February  by Ulster Business It is clear that there are a number of signicant challenges facing the energy sector in Northern Ireland but where there are challenges, there are also opportunities, according to law firm Cleaver Fulton Rankin.The ExecutiveNorthern Ireland has just completed its second year without a ing local government and in the words of David Sterling, head of the Northern Ireland Civil Service, the Civil Service is “… doing everything we can in the prevailing circumstances…but civil servants cannot take the place of ministers when it comes to strategic policy development or in taking transformative decisions”.  This is very much the case with regard to energy policy. The Department of the Economy’s Strategic Energy Framework, which was endorsed by the Executive in , has over the last nine years, led to some very positive changes to the energy generation and supply mix, particularly from renewable sources.However the  year framework is nearing its end and needs to be replaced. The Department is making such preparations as it can on a draft Strategic Energy Framework across the areas of heat, electricity, transport and energy efficiency which it aims to make public some time in the spring. Whether or not this region has its Assembly back to adopt such a framework will remain to be seen, but in the meantime it will ensure the subject remains live and high on the agenda.Brexit and I-SEMThe new wholesale electricity market known as the Integrated Single Electricity Marketwent live on October , . It is designed to deliver increased levels of competition which, it is hoped, will help put downward pressure on prices as well as encouraging greater levels of security of supply and transparency. While the island of Ireland is now integrated more closely with European markets, there is a risk that Brexit could halt this integration. British and Irish business groups and energy trade associations such as the CBI, IBEC, Electricity Association of Ireland, RenewableUK, British Irish Chamber of Commerce and EnergyUK all refer to the delivery of I-SEM, or to the UK’s continued access to the IEM, as post-Brexit priorities for security of supply and or consumer protection. I-SEM is clearly a priority that must be preserved.While Brexit may present challenges and continuing uncertainty, there are certainly opportunities for investment and acquisition in the electricity market as more complex, specialist expertise will be required to effectively trade power on the I-SEM. Policy barriers or inaction cannot be allowed to prevent I-SEM from realising its potential of fully integrating the market by efficiently moving energy from producer to demand.Renewable incentive schemesDespite being on track to hit its target of % of electricity generation from renewables, Northern Ireland risks being left behind. The lack of a replacement for the development support mechanism, Renewables Obligations Certicateafter its closure in April , means Northern Ireland is lagging behind Great Britain which has established the Contract for Dference regime and Ireland, which has started work on its Renewable Electricity Support Scheme . While neither scheme is perfect, doing nothing is not an option. The devolution of energy presented Northern Ireland with the opportunity to shape its own policy but without a government, will the sector and the infrastructure be able to remain fit for purpose GasWith its development over the last  years, the gas network in Northern Ireland, with its low population density, must be seen as a success story. Consumers and businesses have been offered greater choice in terms of price and security of supply. Nevertheless there are certainly further opportunities for gas distributors and suppliers to expand the natural gas network, particularly in the west of the country and east Co Down. So despite the apparent obstacles and challenges, there is opportunity for development and progress in Northern Ireland’s energy sector. The benefits for Northern Ireland will be in terms of security of supply, price and environmental sustainability. Cleaver Fulton Rankin,  Bedford Street, Belfast BT FW.
