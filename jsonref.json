Since then he has completed the project every other year - including in 2018 - which he said was \u0027crazy\u0027.He said: \u0027After a few months of doing a few drawings a day I realised it was interesting - beyond just being a bet. I was creating moments in drawings that would otherwise get forgotten.\u0027Variety is the spice of life in sensational Sri Lanka: Why...Meet the Mississippi Delta Cowboys: Stunning images...Awed theater audiences, drive-thrus – and his young family...Share this articleMr King, who is a freelance artist, said he was inspired by his home area, adding: \u0027I did quite a lot in Lewisham. For people\u0027s reactions during the World Cup I was usually in a pub in the area.\u0027Everybody was becoming more and more excited and surprised by the football and everyone was out because it was so hot. When England scored, the sketch will look quite rushed and there\u0027s arms going everywhere.

I like to draw on things other than paper. It adds another lawyer to the drawing. \u0027With the coffee cup drawing - everyone has held a coffee cup and it adds to what that\u0027s about.

He said: \u0027That was fun to capture because there was so much going on. I was working in Soho and when I left at 4pm the streets were just packed. \u0027I had never seen anything like it. I went into the middle of the crowd and started drawing. I walked to Trafalgar Square with all these people in costume singing and chanting. \u0027It was also interesting because people weren\u0027t just holding placards made from cardboard. They were holding up iPads and phones that read \u0027F*** Trump\u0027.\u0027But Mr King said it was not just the big events of the year that are worth memorialising in pencil. One sketch is of his mother and father sitting at home.

He then wept throughout their conversation and angrily denied making up that he had been attacked Empire creators cut Jussie Smollett\u0027s character from the...\u0027If you\u0027re gonna break the law, do not write a check\u0027:...Share this articleOthers told DailyMail.com that they shared the opposite sentiment. \u0027The fact that this interview was an integral part of the police investigation proves she wasn’t taken advantage of – quite the opposite.           On Thursday morning, Roberts said the developments in the case were a \u0027setback for race relations, homophobia, MAGA supporters – the fingers were pointed at them.\u0027\u0027She did her job as a journalist and conducted an incredibly newsworthy interview,\u0027 one production source said.Within a few hours of Smollett\u0027s interview being aired, Chicago Police Department announced it had identified the two men in the surveillance video that had been circulated for weeks beforehand. The two men are Abel and Ola Osundairo who were picked up by officers as they returned to Chicago on February 13 from Nigeria.Police were questioning them when Smollet\u0027s GMA interview was aired. It was not until the 47th hour of their 48-hour hold on the pair that police say their investigation shifted and put Smollett in the frame.  On Monday, an interview Roberts had landed with the Superintendent of the Chicago Police Department who tore through Smollett will air. Superintendent Eddie T. Johnson reserved no mercy for Smollett as he announced the police\u0027s case against him on Thursday morning. During an extraordinary press conference, he made reference to Smollett\u0027s tearful GMA appearance and condemned it, saying he could not watch the whole thing because it \u0027angered\u0027 him.           Their interview was the first time Smollett had answered questions about the case publicly \u0027To be quite honest, it\u0027s shameful. It painted this city that we all love and work hard in in a negative connotation.\u0027To insinuate an to stage a hate crime of that nature when he knew as a celebrity it would get a lot of attention, it\u0027s just despicable.   Jussie Smollett is shown in his mugshot on Thursday morning\u0027It makes you wonder what goes through someone\u0027s mind so yes, I did see part of the interview and I was angered by it,\u0027 he said. He also said that Smollett helped their investigation into him along by confirming to Roberts that the two men in the video - who they knew were Abel and Ola Osundairo - were the attackers.\u0027He identified who those two iniduals were. We knew that then but he didn\u0027t know that we knew.\u0027But yeah he helped us out when he identified them,\u0027 he said. During the interview, Smollett reacted to suspicion over his cooperation with the police investigation by insisting he was telling the truth. \u0027You do such a disservice when you lie about this kind of stuff,\u0027 he said.   Elsewhere he described himself \u0027fighting the f*** back\u0027 when he was jumped, screaming as he realized there was a noose around his neck and then calling the police with his 60-year-old friend Frank Gatson.He blamed the fact that he was being doubted on the political climate and said: \u0027The camera, facing north, how is that my issue? It feels like if I had said it was a Muslim or a Mexican or someone black, I feel like the doubters would have supported me a lot more.\u0027 He also raised his voice when asked by Roberts about the fact people were suspicious he had gone out in subzero temperatures at 2am to get a salad from Subway.    Roberts will interview Superintendent Eddie T. Johnson on Monday. He eviscerated the actor on Thursday morning and mentioned the ABC interview in his remarks, describing it as \u0027shameful\u0027 that Smollett would go on television to allegedly lie \u0027Subway is open for 24 hours. People kill me when they say stuff like that because Subway is open 24 hours for a reason so that when you\u0027re hungry at night and you ain\u0027t got no food, you go to Subway!\u0027 he said.He said he was frustrated that Chicago Police had not yet found surveillance footage of the incident and revealed his disappointment after learning that a camera at the very spot of the attack was turned in the opposite direction when it took place. Choking back tears, he explained when asked why it took so long for him to contact the authorities: \u0027There is a level of pride there.\u0027We live in a society where as a gay man you are considered somehow to be weak and I am not weak. I am not weak and we as a people are not weak.\u0027  Smollett was bailed out of Cook County Jail on Thursday afternoon after posting $10,000 in bond money, ten percent of the total $100,000 that was set by a judge. His attorneys insist he is innocent and say he has been treated unfairly by the police and the prosecutor\u0027s office."},{"url":null,"title":"The true cost Meghans baby shower","story":"    At a tricky crossroads: Meghan in New York with Suits actress Abigail SpencerThe Duchess of Sussex was in New York this week, catching up with friends, having lunch and doing a little light shopping. It was a private visit so there was no additional cost to the British taxpayer.She is already back at work, flying the flag for Britain on a high-profile official visit to Morocco, where she and the Duke will promote diplomatic relations, boost UK interests and support humanitarian causes.Just another week in the everyday story of royal folk? Hardly. As Princess Diana’s private secretary, I learned to recognise that the line between official and private travel is never just about the money. It’s a code that opens a Pandora’s box of unintended consequences.Rich people’s jets — in this case a Gulfstream reportedly paid for by George and Amal Clooney — always come with a bill attached, even if it’s not the kind you can pay with a Duchy of Cornwall credit card.Favours must be returned, obligations quickly multiply and pretty soon royal free-riders are handing over their most precious assets: credibility and dignity, if not, please God, their lives.The uproar created in some quarters by Meghan’s brief, but undeniably extravagant, Big Apple excursion could hardly have been greater if she had run naked down Broadway and burned a Union Jack in Times Square.But let’s keep a sense of proportion here. A high-profile former actress, she happens to have rich celebrity friends and, if they behave as rich celebrities usually do, then good luck to her, surely.Anyway, other members of the Royal Family, notably Prince Charles and Camilla, have often been known graciously to accept favours from the mega-rich, especially if there’s a jet, a yacht or a private island on offer. Just don’t tactlessly mention the environmental damage.This whole subject is a high-hypocrisy zone, so instead, relax, enjoy the exotic pictures and remember the words of Jimmy Stewart’s character, the cynical hack Macaulay Connor in The Philadelphia Story: ‘The prettiest sight in this fine pretty world is the privileged class enjoying its privileges.’Royal dramas of this kind tend to fizzle out pretty quickly, fit only for tomorrow’s recycling bin.There will surely be some courtiers this morning (not least in Casablanca with the Duke and Duchess) who are trying this explanation on for size. Perhaps it will all blow over, they hope, and the British public’s love for its excitingly-disruptive American newcomer will resume undiminished.After all, it seems only yesterday that Her Royal Highness was winning hearts with her ‘bananagrams’ for sex workers in Bristol, recipe-sharing with women in the Grenfell community kitchen, and speech-making on women’s education and women’s suffrage on a hugely successful tour Down Under in October.

Five nights in a one-bedroom suite at The Mark Hotel costs $9,982.05Yet the excesses of the baby shower now threaten the benign indifference of the British public — an accident of history that is the Windsors’ most precious, but also most volatile, asset. Unfortunately for Meghan, in Windsor World it doesn’t require wicked intent to set the centuries-old edifice a-tremble: not knowing what you don’t know will do the job just as well.In this context, it’s hard to remember Meghan’s eager determination to ‘hit the ground running’ in her new royal career and not compare it with her sister-in-law Catherine’s less exciting but, in retrospect, wiser intention ‘to learn the ropes’.All Meghan’s running has brought her, at private-jet velocity, to a lonely crossroads. It’s a stark choice between the path of celebrity versus the path of duty, service and sacrifice.Did she recognise this dilemma before Prince Harry slipped that engagement ring onto her finger? As a gifted, intelligent and worldly woman, the answer is, surely, of course she did. She will also know that in marrying the Queen’s grandson, she has allied her interests with the Windsors’ instinct to protect their dynasty at any cost.          Duchess of Sussex visits  the Hubb Community Kitchen, LondonMeghan’s crossroads is as old as monarchy itself. A whole tribe of gutsy royal women have been here before her. In the last 100 years, several have been the spine and heart of the British Monarchy.These include: Alexandra, who endured Edward VII’s serial philandering and pioneered a new style of compassionate royal work Mary, who steeled her husband in World War I and Elizabeth the Queen Mother who did the same in WWII and the present Elizabeth, whose reign will likely never be surpassed as the standard for service before self.The common factor was a recognition that royal privilege and perks have to be paid for, not by rich chums, but by a lifetime of service to the people whose bows, curtsies and taxes will always be willingly given in return. Better make that probably willingly.Other women also passed this way. In the present reign, there has been a high failure rate of church weddings of first-rank Royal Family members. Only three, out of seven, have escaped the orce courts.One of those statistics was Harry’s mother, whose experience has hopefully also been carefully studied by Meghan. In comparing the two women, differences quickly outnumber any similarities. Diana’s 16-year royal career was already consigned to history before she reached the age Meghan is now.Meghan is no teen virgin, but a orced, media-smart and ambitious celebrity, empowered by all the arsenal of right-on feminism. Her fate is emphatically in her own hands, as it should be.Recent lurid headlines will fade, hurried on their way by the imminent arrival of what will surely be the most photogenic of babies.But that crossroads will, I predict, obstinately remain.Patrick Jephson was equerry and private secretary to HRH The Princess of Wales 1988-96.

The source said: ‘It was absolutely chilling. At first, the managers tried to suggest someone had just left a knife carelessly, but it was balanced on its edge with the blade uppermost.’There is no suggestion that Mr Aram was involved in that incident as he was not in the office that day.

Mr Rowe signed the card with an insult.Mr Aram’s use of the n-word came in a conversation with a group of junior male colleagues following a ‘cultural realignment session’ organised by RGA last year. When a colleague questioned the use of the term ‘girls’ for young women, Mr Aram mockingly equated it with the n-word.He said: ‘Well that’s like coloured gentlemen calling each other n*****s.

Henderson Rowe denied this, saying last year a ‘third-party investigation’ was launched into the firm’s trading practices going back six years and ‘no evidence of systematic churning’ was found.Mike Bowers, RGA’s chief operating officer, said: ‘We acknowledge Henderson Rowe has in the past tolerated language and jokes that are inconsistent with Rayliant’s values.

Instead, Meghan will take a ‘fluid’ approach to the child’s upbringing.The Duchess will choose gender-neutral colours such as grey for the child, whether it’s a girl or a boy, said the source – following the trend set by politically aware circles in her home state, California.                                                    The picture showed a gold-rimmed plate with a pale green baby rattle pop cake, a cupcake with a stencilled pram decoration and a biscuit in the shape of a stork carrying a baby.But The Mail on Sunday can today reveal that Meghan, radiant in a white-spotted navy blue maternity dress, had far more than designer biscuits to choose from.The groaning table, covered in a thick cream linen tablecloth, was anchored by a spectacular centrepiece of a huge glass vase containing 3ft high cherry blossom branches. Scattered arrangements of Meghan’s favourite pink peonies and delicate sweet peas completed the elegant look.In addition to the macaron towers, there was more drama in the cakes and confectionery thought to have been made by Michelin-starred chef Jean-Georges Vongerichten, whose eponymous restaurant at The Mark is considered one of the finest in New York. Meghan, 37, who is around seven-and-a-half months pregnant, is a self-confessed foodie and while guests including her former Suits co-star Abigail Spencer, Ms Mulroney, hairdresser Serge Normant and designer Misha Nonoo were serenaded by harpist Erin Hill, the food was the real star. Custom-made cakes including Key lime tarts, cherry tarts, red velvet cakes and carrot cakes, sat beside gold-embellished containers filled with sugar crystals into which stork-shaped biscuits had been artfully arranged.Health-conscious Meghan insisted on items being marked ‘gluten free’ for those with dietary constraints.There were also cotton candy pom poms (candy floss on sticks) – explaining the delivery of a candy floss machine to the hotel during a snow storm on the eve of the party – and a jar of multi-coloured ‘donut holes’ that were gluten-free and just 40 calories each. Sources said Ms Williams’ designer biscuits, including iced storks on lollipop sticks, trays of sweet bunnies with chocolate piping and biscuits in the shape of traditional English prams in blue icing, were a hit.The colour scheme featured multiple hues of blues, pinks, yellows and greens and gave no hint as to the gender of the future Baby Sussex. ‘It was a delicious palate of colours and a very sophisticated table,’ a source said.‘There was no dominant colour theme. It was just opulent, luxurious and completely over the top.’ Cupcakes topped with yellow and orange piped flowers (130 calories each) sat beside mini lemon meringue pies (325 calories) and pink meringues (100 calories).    The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are welcomed by officials on their arrival at Casablanca airport, for their tour of MoroccoThe four macaron towers sat on white royal icing bases and the banquet featured a spectacular white ‘pop cake’ pyramid decorated with hand-crafted pink paper flowers that, according to one observer, ‘looked almost too good to eat’.Drinks ranged from vintage champagne to designer teas and £12 bottles of water.The official baby shower cake was a two-tier white fondant confection decorated with paper figures of Meghan, Harry and a pram positioned in front of cut-out paper cherry blossom trees.     The official baby shower cake was a two-tier white fondant confection decorated with paper figures of Meghan, Harry and a pram positioned in front of cut-out paper cherry blossom treesWhile the cost of the five-day celebration, including Meghan’s one-bedroom, £15,312-a-night suite and her ride in George Clooney’s private jet was estimated at £350,000, the food alone may have cost up to £20,000.  Meghan, 37, is around seven-and-a-half months pregnant One Los Angeles-based private chef who works for A-list celebrities said: ‘If you look at the ingredients alone, then you’d probably be looking at two to three grand, but when you factor in The Mark hotel and Jean-Georges, then the sky is the limit. If I was to put a figure on an event like this, in a location like that, I’d say ten to 20 grand.’There have been suggestions that the New York bash was used by Meghan to wrest back control of her own image. It certainly drew huge media attention with scores of photographers camped behind barriers outside the hotel.The duchess arrived in New York on February 15. The following day she had dinner with Ms Williams, Ms Mulroney and close friend Markus Anderson.Guests arrived at the baby shower with gifts including a £326 Babyletto crib and a £470 Trek bicycle. Flowers were provided by a company called Lady Fleur and Meghan later donated the arrangements to charities. However, the fate of any left-over food is unknown. The LA chef said: ‘It’s doubtful that number of guests could possibly have consumed that amount of food.‘It would be nice to think that someone somewhere might be enjoying a rose-petal flavoured French macaron.’"},{"url":null,"title":"Meghan Markle need report gifts worth 15 000 baby shower IRS","story":"    Meghan Markle, the Duchess of Sussex, will have to report to the IRS any gifts whose value is in excess of $15,000 that she may have received during her baby showerBut the American-born British royal will still need to declare any and all presents whose value exceeds $15,000.The reason for this is the United States is one of the few countries in the world that taxes the income of its citizens who live abroad.This will create all sorts of headaches for Meghan and Harry, who have reportedly hired American tax experts to help them sift through the complex tax laws that require the couple to open up their books to the IRS.The IRS is known for being extremely strict in tracking down people they believe owe them money. The Duchess of Sussex is still an American citizen so has to pay tax in the U.S., and this could extend to anyone else she draws money from, including her husband.This could deplete both her $5million U.S. fortune and Prince Harry\u0027s main source of private wealth, a £300,000-a-year trust fund on which he pays UK income tax.

Carolyn Radford, 36, has a Masters in professional legal practice and runs a football clubI run a football club — and love fashionCarolyn Radford, 36, is a lawyer and CEO of Mansfield Town football club. She lives with her husband John, 52, and their three sons. She has a degree in politics, did a law conversion course at Durham University and has a Masters in professional legal practice. She says:We’re all guilty of judging books by their covers, but I’d say to any young woman rising up through the ranks of law or business: ‘Don’t ditch the lipstick to be taken seriously.’ Look at Amal Clooney. She’s stunningly beautiful yet she is one of the best legal brains in the country.I like to look my best, wearing make-up, fashionable clothes and making sure my nails and hair look perfect. It means that people — particularly some men — can’t see beyond that.I once had a football agent refuse to speak to me over a transfer deal — he wanted to speak to the male manager instead. Attitudes like that are disrespectful and frustrating — but I love challenging old-fashioned views. On that occasion, I made sure I was involved in the deal at every level and that we came out of it very favourably — just to prove my point.I’m a 36-year-old mother-of-three with a degree, a Masters and over a decade’s experience in law and business, yet some people wonder how I could possibly do my job better than a middle-aged man.I admit that when I first started working in football, I’d wear trouser suits to be taken more seriously. Now, as long as I’m dressing appropriately, why should I hide my love of fashion? You can stereotype me as a blonde bimbo, but you’re going to be surprised when I start talking business.  "},{"url":null,"title":"I want inspire British girls not make mistakes","story":"    Shamima Begum pictured with her week old son in Al Hawl camp for captured ISIS wives\u0027She doesn\u0027t deserve to come back to Britain\u0027: Shamima...\u0027British women are hiding among us\u0027: ISIS women in refugee...Share this article    Market day in Al Hawl camp. Shamima has given several interviews, but I am the first journalist she has invited inside the tent she calls homeI have come to see the most famous jihadi bride of all, Shamima Begum, the teenager from East London, but I am not allowed to visit this part of the camp without a security guard armed with an AK-47 assault rifle.Since she was discovered here earlier this month, nine months’ pregnant and having fled IS’s final showdown, Shamima has given several interviews, but I am the first journalist she has invited inside the tent she calls home.She sits crossed-legged on a thin black mattress in her socks, her week-old son, Jerah, on her lap. The child is named after a 7th century Islamic warlord.Shamima tells me she has been given the tent because she is ‘famous now’.Removing her headscarf she explains politely that she is sorry she cannot offer me tea because she has no means of heating water.At just 19, she has been living in a war zone since the age of 15. She has given birth three times and lost two children: a toddler daughter died a few weeks ago and she lost her other son at eight-months-old last year. Her husband is in jail.          Shamima  told the Mail if allowed back into Britain she would dedicate herself to stopping other girls being radicalised           I find Shamima at pains to be conciliatory. She finally seems to understand the offence she has caused and the damage it has done to her prospects of returning home (pictured: Market day in Al Hawl camp)Her own family in Britain have said they are appalled at some of the things she has said and at the weekend her father condemned her lack of remorse for what IS has done.Today I find Shamima at pains to be conciliatory. She finally seems to understand the offence she has caused and the damage it has done to her prospects of returning home.‘I am hoping to be given a second chance’, she says quietly.‘I’d like to be an example of how someone can change. I want to help, encourage other young British people to think before they make life- changing decisions like this and not to make the same mistake as me.‘I can’t do that if I am sitting here in a camp. I can’t do that for you.’Cynics may question her sincerity and she clings to the belief that she is a victim in all of this, rather than someone who chose to leave her home and join a terror group.‘I feel like I’ve been discriminated against because everyone was saying I was a poster girl for ISIS,’ she says of the decision to strip her of her passport. ‘I’m being made an example of. I’m being punished right now because I’m famous.’And she questions why scores of other jihadi wives and their children have been allowed back to the UK after travelling to Syria to join IS.It is claimed that about 425 British IS members, men, women and children, have so far returned to the UK, the highest tally in Europe.She admits she is scared, not least because her recent ‘fame’ had angered a lot of the other jihadi wives in the camp.‘Now a lot of women hate me, I’m afraid of a lot of people,’ she says.Possibly with good cause. I have been told by others here that her recent interviews – in which she exposed her face on TV – have angered the more hardline IS women in the camp. There has been ‘talk’ of her tent being burned down.           Some recent arrivals from the Deir ez-Zor countryside have to sleep outside before tents become available. Dozens of babies have died in the cold already this winterThe sprawling camp is home to up to 40,000 refugees from Syria’s war zones who are looked after by the International Red Cross and various non-governmental organisations. Conditions are desperate.Some recent arrivals from the Deir ez-Zor countryside have to sleep outside before tents become available. Dozens of babies have died in the cold already this winter.Now it is midday, the sun is shining and inside the tent it is stiflingly warm. But Shamima won’t open the flap to let air circulate in case they are spotted without their headscarves.The women in the ‘Daeshi’ area of the camp – Daesh is the Arabic term used by its detractors to describe IS – are enclosed by barbed wire fencing and are not permitted to go outside its perimeter.There are hundreds of fanatical IS families here on this side of the barbed wire fence, recently arrived from the battlefield in and around the village of Baghouz where the group is making its last stand.Among them are as many as a dozen Britons, but most are going to painstaking lengths not to be identified.          Among them are as many as a dozen Britons, but most are going to painstaking lengths not to be identifiedFood is brought by women from the refugee side, where it is then sold to those ‘Daeshi’ families who have smuggled money out of their terror group’s crumbling remains.The others rely on handouts from non-governmental organisations, the Kurdish authorities, and the International Red Cross.Shamima coughs and says, although is it is mild today, she is sick from the cold. She is fortunate to have a tent but there is no oil burning stove for cooking.She says she is ‘stressed’ from the lack of sleep as she nurses her gurgling son, who is wearing a white and blue fleece baby grow – donated to her by another mother in camp.          Shamima made it known on arrival that she would like to marry an English-speaking fighter aged between 20 and 25 years oldAs we sit there crossed-legged chatting, she starts to open up about what life was like under IS.She handed over her British passport willingly when she arrived in Syria with two school friends in February 2015.‘They took my passport but I thought to myself ‘‘what am I going to do with it? I don’t really have any use for it’’,’ she says.She never expected to go back. Her future, the future she wanted, was as a housewife in the caliphate.Ten days after arriving in Raqqa, she was taken to a room to meet Yago Riedijk, a 23-year-old Dutch convert to Islam. It was the moment she had been waiting for.          She never expected to go back. Her future, the future she wanted, was as a housewife in the caliphateShe made it known on arrival that she would like to marry an English-speaking fighter aged between 20 and 25 years old. Riedijk, who changed his name to Abu Zoraya was, she says, just her type.‘When I first saw him, I was like ‘‘OK, yeah, he is good looking’’,’ she giggles, momentarily the giddy teenager. She even had a piece of paper in her pocket with a list of questions for him.‘I took out the paper, that’s what women do, you have to ask your questions. He was straight up and he was truthful with me.’Her first question was: What do you expect from me?‘He told me that he was strict and he wanted a good housewife that stays inside. He didn’t want someone who is Westernised and wants to always go out and stuff’,’ she said.Her next question: Are you a fighter?‘He said he was injured still and he was still recovering but he was planning to go fight again soon,’ she said. A few more questions and that was that. ‘I said yes, and he said yes.’She had got what she came for. A husband who was fighting for IS and a ‘normal’ life.          Shamima Begum in the Al Hawl camp in Kurdish Syria‘I went to ISIS thinking I would have a normal life but it turned out not to be true. I just got tricked, I guess,’ she says ruefully.Outside there is shouting: a three-year-old boy has just aimed a makeshift catapult filled with stones at a toddler’s head from less than three feet away.Our photographer Jamie Wiseman, who is waiting outside the tent, is forced to intervene.Shamima loves her husband Riedijk, a convicted terrorist who police believe was part of a cell plotting an atrocity in Europe, but she’s delusional about the prospect of a future with him.‘I hope for him to see his only surviving child. He loved his children a lot, when I lost them I think it had a bigger effect on him than me,’ she says.‘If he does get sent back to his own country, he will do his time there in his own country… (I will) wait for him. I am still married to him.’ We discuss the political situation and Home Secretary Sajid Javid’s suggestion that he might consider IS children being brought back without their mothers.According to estimates by The Soufan Centre, a thinktank on global security issues, up to 100 children could have been born to British jihadi wives in Syria and Iraq.It is believed that some 150 British girls and women have travelled to join IS, and almost all have married and given birth.          The sprawling Al Hawl refugee camp which contains a secure area for captured ISIS wivesSuddenly, for the first time, she shows some emotion and bursts into tears. ‘How can you ask a mother to separate herself from her son, especially after everything I have lost? This boy is all I have.’What she most misses about Britain, she says, is ‘the feeling of being safe and secure, not having planes flying over me, not having to randomly move in the middle of the night’.For now Shamima and her baby son must stay put in their little tent until their fate is decided.She shares it with Dura Ahmed, 28, a Canadian mother who tries to appease her own tearful child with a chocolate biscuit. There are a couple of rucksacks, some bread, a tub of cheese spread and some jerry cans filled with water.In Shamima’s corner is a pair of neon blue fake Nike trainers. She bought them for just over $4 (£3) a few days ago. They were the few dollar notes she has left.It is time for me to leave, promising to come back with news of the outside world. ‘Inshalla (God willing) I’ll see you soon,’ I tell her."},{"url":null,"title":"Theresas big gamble","story":"    Prime Minister Theresa May is hugged by the Prime Minister of Bulgaria Boyko Borissov          European Union Council President Donald Tusk, right, speaks with  Theresa May during a bilateral meeting on the sidelines of the summit    If the backbench motion is passed, Mrs May would have until March 13 to get her plan through Parliament or be forced to seek a delay in the process          Mrs May is holding talks with Angela Merkel today in the hope the German chancellor can break the deadlock in Brussels‘As a result of that we won’t bring a meaningful vote to Parliament this week, but we will ensure that happens by March 12. It is still within our grasp to leave the EU with a deal on March 29. And that’s what we’re working to do.’Mrs May is holding talks with Angela Merkel today in the hope the German chancellor can break the deadlock in Brussels.Former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith last night said that by delaying the meaningful vote, Mrs May was effectively ‘calling the bluff’ of the Cabinet rebels.‘They are smashing the whole concept of government,’ he said.          Margaret Hodge, pictured, said deputy leader Tom Watson’s demand that Labour eradicate anti-Semitism was a ‘final wake-up call’Three more Labour MPs are threatening to quit the party over anti-Semitism and Brexit.The trio are considering joining the new Independent Group and one said last night: ‘We’ll see what happens this week.’Margaret Hodge, pictured, said deputy leader Tom Watson’s demand that Labour eradicate anti-Semitism was a ‘final wake-up call’. Another Labour MP, Louise Ellman, is on the brink of leaving after more than 50 years.A friend said: ‘Louise will not be in the party for much longer.’The third MP, Siobhain McDonagh, said on Friday she had decided not to resign ‘this week’ – meaning a decision to go could come soon.Dame Margaret, a former minister who has faced months of abuse from hard-Left activists, said: ‘This is the final wake-up call for Jeremy Corbyn. The leadership has so lost trust but I don’t believe any of the figures they come out with on the cases they’ve dealt with. I’ve had pretty horrific abuse on Twitter. It absolutely doesn’t feel to me like there is zero tolerance on anti-Semitism.’ Dame Louise said: ‘I am still fighting with the party’s failure to deal with anti-Semitism.’An unpublished Labour Party report into Dame Louise’s Liverpool Riverside constituency found she was physically threatened by one member and ‘there have been CLP meetings during which anti-Semitic incidents are alleged to have taken place’.The report said: ‘These have arisen as a result of “obsessive interrogations” of the MP over the Israel-Palestine conflict. Some members have felt that others are holding the MP – a Jewish woman – personally accountable for the actions of the Israeli government.’The 11 members of the Independent Group will meet today to discuss organisation, including how to elect a leader. Yesterday Chuka Umunna called on voters to ‘join us, and help us forge a new, different kind of politics’.A poll for The Observer puts the group’s support at 6 per cent, ahead of the Lib Dems. It has also emerged that Sir David Garrard, once one of Labour’s biggest donors, is supporting the new group.                         Tom Watson said Mr Corbyn had to ‘change very, very rapidly’ to stop more MPs from following the nine who quit the party last week.He also revealed he had handed the party leader a dossier of 50 cases where no adequate action had been taken over racist comments on social media about Jewish iniduals.In a TV interview, he demanded Mr Corbyn take personal charge of rooting out anti-Semitism because the ‘party machine’ had failed. And he urged him to change tack on Brexit and push for a second referendum.‘The departure of our colleagues is a real blow, and we need to understand why they felt the need to go. Because if we’re going to be in government we need to address those concerns.‘For us to hold this party together, things have to change. There’s almost a crisis for the soul of the Labour Party now. I absolutely fear that we will lose more parliamentary colleagues. We may lose peers from the House of Lords, and we may lose members and councillors and I don’t want that to happen.’Mr Watson said Luciana Berger, the Liverpool Wavertree MP who left for the Independent Group last week, had been ‘bullied out of the Labour Party by a small number of racist thugs’ and he was ‘very very sad to see her go’.Hard-Left activists, he said, were causing irreparable harm by ‘pouncing’ on MPs, and bullying them on social media. Details of the anti-Semitism dossier, seen by the Mail, show it included vicious racist abuse. One said of Jewish Labour MPs: ‘I don’t know what runs through their veins, not human blood.’Mr Watson said Labour general secretary Jenny Formby’s attempts to combat anti-Semitism had ‘very patently not been adequate’ and Mr Corbyn should take a personal lead.On Brexit, he said Mr Corbyn needed to ‘reunify our party’ and move towards a second referendum.He also called for more centrist Labour MPs to be given jobs on the front bench and said he was going to set up a new ‘social democratic’ group of moderates to develop policies. In an interview with Sky News on Friday night, Mr Corbyn said he did not believe bullying existed in Labour on a wide scale.When confronted with quotes from prominent Jews accusing him of not doing enough, he said there were ‘very many other people in the Jewish community’ who were happy.A Labour Party spokesman said: ‘The Labour Party takes all complaints of anti-Semitism extremely seriously and we are committed to challenging and campaigning against it in all its forms. All complaints about anti-Semitism are investigated in line with our rules.’"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2019/02/14/17/058D0E19000007D0-0-image-a-10_1550163914652.jpg","title":"Entire family including FIVE children detailed inflatable boat abandoned Kent beach","story":"    The small rigid inflatable boat was seen bobbing in the water just after 7am on Sunday at St Margaret\u0027s Bay, around 2.5 miles from the Port of Dover in east KentThe family group were found by police on the shore and have been transferred to immigration officials for interview.A Border Force vessel  has been launched earlier today after an empty boat was spotted floating three hours later, just after 7am at St Margaret\u0027s Bay, around 2.5 miles from the Port of Dover in east Kent. A number of lifejackets were also found near the Shakespeare Beach, just over five miles from St Margaret\u0027s Bay. It ha snot been officially confirmed at this stage if they are linked.A Home Office spokesman said today Border Force are confident the vessel was used for a migrant crossing.He added: \u0027Border Force responded to an incident in Kingsdown, Kent, following reports of a boat in the channel.

And a very healthy cringe it is, too, because it is when you hold up a mirror to the age that you are motivated to improve it.Or, at least, laugh in its face.Alan first turned up in 1991 with a small role in Armando Iannucci’s brilliant parody of current affairs broadcasting, On The Hour, on BBC Radio 4.He was a sports reporter with a nice line in patronising misogyny, utter disdain for the Paralympics, and a worrying obsession with ‘groin strain’ in his football changing-room interviews.He was, however, a hit. Before long, he had his own spoof chat-show on the same network, Knowing Me, Knowing You With Alan Partridge, named after his favourite band Abba (who also inspired the show’s catchphrase, Aha!)It not only showcased his incompetence, but provided lovely cameos of exactly the kind of guests on such shows.    Alan’s hallmark as an interviewer was that he was never really very interested in the people he metSteve Coogan is \u0027dating Melanie Sykes and spent a romantic...Steve Coogan\u0027s Alan Partridge insists he is back to save...Share this articleHis programmes always ended in some kind of offence or disaster, and since at the time I was presenting a real talk show — Midweek — on Radio 4, for quite a few weeks I made a point of ending with one of Partridge’s catchphrases: ‘ . . . And on that bombshell . . .’ until the joke wore thin. Which, I have to admit, it did rather sooner for the producer than for me.I just adored the Partridge character because many of the pitfalls he tumbled into in those spoof interviews — with pretentious artists, crabby old buffers, or the easily offended — were so very recognisable. They were similar to traps I was cautiously navigating round every week.He WAS a sharp reminder of the perils facing all live interviewers — especially the kind more thrilled by the fact that they’re on the air than by any of the subjects or people they cover.Alan’s hallmark as an interviewer was that he was never really very interested in the people he met.Ultimately, Radio 4 was too small and respectable a platform for our Alan, and his co-writers — Iannucci, Peter Baynham, later Neil and Rob Gibbons — over successive years recognised he had to grow: ever more monstrous, more self-important, precariously successful, disaster-prone and deluded.Eventually, there was even an autobiography, I, Partridge: We Need To Talk About Alan, which is a far better read than that of most real media figures.It takes him through the whole arc from his radio beginnings to that brief TV stardom — Knowing Me, Knowing You transferred to television in 1994 — and on to disaster, exile, minor local radio jobs and corporate videos.Never truly defeated, though, even at his lowest he’s boasting of ‘projects on the boil with 24 broadcasters around the world . . . although the exact level of commitment from these channels was hard to gauge, they had at least taken my calls . . .’That book, which I read and re-read, chronicles the TV shows we all remember. In Knowing Me, Knowing You, which ran for six episodes, he displayed his limitless ability to ramp up disasters of his own making, including quarrelling violently with his studio bandleader Glen Ponder and accidentally shooting a guest dead.He eventually fouls up in the world’s naffest Christmas Special, Knowing Me Knowing Yule when he punches a wheelchair-bound athlete, fails to realise his cookery guest is a man in drag and disastrously pitches for a new series while interviewing live the ‘Chief Commissioning Editor’ of the BBC, Tony Hayers. His television career is over.However, Hayers — played by David Schneider — reappears in a wonderful series of mockumentaries, I’m Alan Partridge, in which Alan is reduced to living in a Travel Tavern and presenting on Radio Norwich in the small hours.The all-powerful executive features in the troubled Partridge’s fantasy yearnings to get back on the small screen.Aways sexually uncertain (his wife understandably ran off with her fitness instructor), Alan has dreams where he is a lap-dancer gyrating before the commissioner, offering his services in bondage leatherwear.By day, the exiled Alan fights for meetings at the BBC and invents format pitches to try to get back on: ‘Monkey tennis . . . Ladyshapes with Alan Partridge . . . Arm wrestling with Chas \u0026amp Dave . . . Inner City Sumo, very cheap to make, you could do it in a pub car park . . .’Actually, when BBC3 has done Snog Marry Avoid, and Hotter Than My Daughter, it seems surprising nobody in this desperate age of viewing has picked up any of Partridge’s ideas. But that’s the pleasure Partridge brings: he is the ultimate media wannabe.Through the various series that followed (including the marvellously dreary YouTube and Sky ‘phone-in’ Mid Morning Matters on North Norfolk Digital, another spoof documentary on the British class ide, and a travel programme) he reflects the trashy emptiness of so much of our cheap 24-hour broadcasting.From glitzy personality chat-shows to the wittering DJs and pointless phone competitions, Alan shows us that it is all part of the same spectrum.At the heart of it all is a monstrous inidual: a puffed-up egotist so incapable of any real relationship that his son (called Fernando — in another nod to Abba — obviously) doesn’t even invite him to his wedding.When his old commissioning editor dies, he attends the funeral, but roams about trying to borrow phone chargers and is already pitching to his successor.His politics are so witlessly to the fusty-Right that even the most conservative can wince his choices of ‘sports casual’ outfits make Nigel Farage look like Karl Lagerfeld.Coogan, a considerable actor, as we have seen in films Philomena and currently in Stan \u0026amp Ollie, inhabits the character of Partridge with almost frightening conviction, with all his mannerisms and style and mangled metaphors and defiant chippy insecurity.And like all good actors, he has no fear of looking terrible and being despised. Alan’s uneasy sense that he is ‘politically incorrect’ and out of step with modern times means that he has to snap, in a footnote to his foot-in-mouth remarks, ‘That’s not racist’ or ‘That isn’t sexism’.The joke should be over by now. Even the finest sitcom characters run out of steam: if they’re wise, like John Cleese as Basil Fawlty, they limit the run to leave us with a few classic episodes.But the brilliance of the Partridge brand, its performer and its writers is that, through the shows, books and the unexpectedly intelligent film Alpha Papa in 2013, he has developed, grown, shown us more and more of his desperation, history, background and convictions — without ever actually moving us far in the direction of compassion.That’s a clever trick: as one critic said: ‘He feels like a living, breathing person. But a living, breathing person that you want to strangle.’And we believe in him and his neediness. When in Alpha Papa he accidentally falls out of a window during a siege which has made him newly important as a hostage, he struggles to get back in. Fame comes before everything for Alan — just as it does for the new generation of reality stars.The way we enjoy Alan Partridge tells rather more than is comfortable about modern Britain. His positioning in the class system —an unclassifiable middle-middle-middle — is clever: from ‘above’ you can look down on his cultural ignorance and cliche speech, but from his own level or from below it you can giggle at his pretentious blazer-badges and slicked-down hair.Nobody of any class, race or type needs to identify with him it isn’t like a parody chav or toff. Yet all of us probably have our little Partridge moments. Politicians certainly do in the Brexit era.Lapses into Partridge-ism are not as lovable as Tony Hancock moments, or as pathetically sweet as Laurel and Hardy pratfalls. But they’re real all right. This Time With Alan Partridge, is on tonight, 9.30pm, BBC1. "},{"url":null,"title":"Frozen fruit vegetables HEALTHIER higher levels Vitamin C study finds","story":"    We are always told that one of the best ways to stay healthy is to eat lots of fresh fruit and vegetables.But tests have shown the ‘fresh is best’ mantra may not be true after all – and that frozen or tinned fruit and vegetables are just as nutritious.Scientists examined vitamin C levels in raspberries, pineapples, sweetcorn, carrots and peas – and found little difference between fresh or frozen.In some cases, frozen varieties actually contained higher levels of the vitamin.Of all the samples, it was frozen raspberries and peas which had the highest levels, while fresh raspberries had the least.There was barely any difference between frozen and fresh pineapple for levels of the vitamin – but both had more than tinned. This was also the case with carrots.For sweetcorn, the fresh pack had the most but the tinned variety had more than the frozen.The reason for the results is that often fresh produce has been transported long distances and left sitting around in warehouses and on supermarket shelves for long periods.

For me, the photographs of Martin Parr did just that, and I’m sure they have done the same thing for millions of other people all over the planet.Since that encounter, his work has been a guiding beacon for me, pointing out patterns and dissonances in society, but more importantly showing me how to look. Over his long and prolific career – he has produced more than 100 books and many more exhibitions – Martin has developed an anthropological “satnav” that will take him to where his hyper-developed image-making skills can play and disrupt. His genius is not just in spotting the shot, but in booking the flight and getting the access.What I sensed in those photographs from the off was an ambivalence about the subjects that I shared. I look at images of county ladies stuffing their faces, tourists trapped in clichés, drunken revellers and the jolly grim British working classes, and they all seem to be hovering uncomfortably between comedy and tragedy.Humour bleeds through all these photographs, but also compassion. “How dare you take yourself seriously?” they say, but then “Let’s celebrate that impulse” – in a quietly bonkers, British way, naturally.Like all great artists, Parr has altered how we see the world. We see a queue of posh people, a buffet served on a Union Jack tablecloth or a lurid beach scene and we think of his work. He is one of the foremost chroniclers of our times.He sees our tender aspirations, our vanities, our sincere enthusiasms, our anachronistic traditions, our often unpredictable ersity – and he both ribs us and applauds us, blinded by his flash and decked in saturated colour."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6ada96343a6dfdd38220f969761b2a75b818faa9/0_6_700_420/master/700.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3f0cdae09eafba7905435619d974c287","title":"hugo palmers mother visits beach where belongings were found","story":"Tanya McNab travels to New South Wales to attend vigil for missing British touristThe mother of a British tourist who went missing in Australia a week ago has visited the beach where his belongings were found.Tanya McNab travelled to Shelly Beach in New South Wales to attend a vigil for Hugo Palmer and his friend Erwan Ferrieux, a French national, on Sunday.“I’m feeling numb, completely numb.

Palmer, from East Sussex, and Ferrieux arrived in Australia in November and had been in the Port Macquarie area, 240 miles (390km) north of Sydney, since 17 February. A major search, involving police and other emergency services, was launched after items belonging to the 20-year-olds were found on the beach at sunrise last Monday. Their rental car, a silver Commodore, was later found in the car park containing other belongings, including travel documents.With no reported sightings of the pair, police said on Wednesday that they were scaling back their air and sea search, although sweeps of the area would continue. Insp Peter Neville said the search team remained hopeful of finding the men alive.Locals and backpackers from Port Macquarie joined McNab and other members of Palmer’s family on the beach for the vigil.

Brussels bureaucrats controlled our lives and money. Migrants were stealing jobs and sponging benefits, or so went the shock doctrine of the tabloid press, manifested among the myriad reasons 17.4 million people cried out from the ballot box two and a half years ago: “Enough is enough.”But as the countdown on Brexit approaches its chaotic finale in little more than 30 days’ time, it’s worth remembering that, until recently, that perception hadn’t travelled far overseas.Britain was held in high esteem among migrant workers, particularly from the former eastern bloc. Our economy offered them better pay, greater opportunity, higher living standards and more rewarding work than at home.There was a special view of Britain in Poland in particular. Our nations had stood shoulder to shoulder through some of the most significant moments of the last century. Britain welcomed the Polish armed forces during the war.After Poland joined the EU in 2004, the number of Poles in Britain surged to reach almost a million. Polish became the second-most spoken language in 2013 (coincidentally, the year David Cameron promised the in-out EU referendum to placate the Blukip surge in his party only to see the purple populists usurp him), while Poles replaced Indians as the largest diaspora in 2015.Britain benefited from the arrival of these workers. Community tensions may have been very real at times, but it was austerity that stretched public services to breaking point, not migrants. EU workers helped to grow the British economy out of the last recession. The research from economists is clear: migrants contribute more than they extract.Britain’s old reputation now lies in tatters. The message is clear: we want your money, but not your people. Eastern Europeans no longer flock to Britain quite the reverse.Figures last week showed that 76,000 EU workers left last year, while the number of non-EU migrant workers rose by 159,000. Fresh statistics expected on Thursday are likely to show the decline continuing.Among those contemplating their future is Maciej Artur, a 51-year old engineer in the energy industry from Nottingham. Britain’s reputation as a dear old friend rang true when he brought his family here in 2007. He now has mixed feelings after receiving abuse, which has intensified since the launch of the referendum campaign.“Why did I have to explain to my younger daughter why people in her class started to call her a Polish bitch?” Artur asks. “I’ve been told I was a foreigner and I could get the fuck off.”Like many, Artur is considering moving his family back to Poland. But while the xenophobia he and other eastern Europeans have experienced is among the biggest push factors for leaving, economic reasons also colour the decision, as the gap closes between the dwindling British economy and the emerging strength of their home nations. Artur says he has plenty of job offers in Poland or elsewhere in the EU as alternatives.The post-Brexit continuation of rights for EU citizens pledged by the prime minister also rings hollow. Artur was incensed by May warning that migrants would no longer be able to “jump the queue”. He plans to visit Poland next month and is worried that he might not be allowed to return. “Until it is made law, it’s still her words. Look at what she’s promised before and now how things are. My level of trust in her word is not very high.”Much has been made of the reasons why Britain is now less attractive for EU migrant workers since the Brexit vote, from rising intolerance to the drop in the value of the pound making British wages less appealing. Less has been said about the improving economic conditions in the countries many migrant workers came from.Brexiters might argue that pay in Britain has been held back by migrant labour during that time and has started to rise as eastern European workers leave. But most academics disagree. According to the government’s independent Migration Advisory Committee, EEA migration has had only a small impact on wages and employment. It brought “neither the large negative effects claimed by some, nor the benefits claimed by others”. Oxford Economics reckons that the average migrant from the rest of Europe contributed about £2,300 more to UK public finances in 2016-17 than the average UK-born adult.To be sure, wages and living standards in much of eastern Europe still lag behind the EU. Should the current rate of convergence continue, it would still take until 2053 for Poland to match the eurozone average wage, until 2059 to match Britain and 2077 to level with the leading EU country, Germany, according to the Grant Thornton analysis.Britain, on the other hand faces, growing skills shortages as workers leave. Unfilled vacancies are at their highest since records began, nearing a million empty roles. Too few migrant staff to fill the hospitality and food industries, in particular, could lead to shortages and higher prices for consumers. Eastern Europeans heading home will prove a loss to Britain.For Artur, the combination of economic decisions and rising hostility is weighing on his mind ahead of 29 March. He’s concerned about his two teenage daughters’ career chances in the event that he keeps his family in Brexit Britain, potentially shorn from access from the EU jobs market.“I’m old enough to remember how it is to live in country that is a satellite, that is not a member of the European Union,” he says."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/245341ad96a5e22663c268509200ade3b7af500e/0_57_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=783ef2d5b0d3beabf9e85bc7b0a11785","title":"disrupt brexit mps the independent group","story":"One of the great lessons of the 20th century is that history has no direction: as Isaiah Berlin and Karl Popper argued, and as the transformative upheavals of 1989 showed to thrilling effect, there is no secular version of providence, no ideological script to follow. So it has been alarming, in the past few years, to watch the two main parties surrendering to different versions of the teleological delusion.The Conservative party has embraced Brexit as a mythic nativist destiny towards which we must all march loyally. Labour, meanwhile, is in thrall to the old left determinism, in which all the core debates have long since been settled, devotion to the leadership must be absolute, and all that remains is for those who are foolish enough to think otherwise to be stripped of their false consciousness. For those of us who believe in pluralist politics, it has been a depressing spectacle, a battle between desperate certainties that slide pointlessly over the gritty, unpredictable reality of 21st-century life. Which is the principal reason why the foundation of the 11-strong Independent Group of formerly Labour and Tory MPs has been so refreshing.I have been sceptical in the past about the notion of a new centre party – but am pleased to have been (thus far) confounded. As Heidi Allen and Luciana Berger showed on the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show, the group has no intention of being pressed into announcing policies prematurely, rushing to form a party hierarchy, or of seeking to disguise their differences. Instead, they are turning these disagreements into a strength and striving – in Chuka Umunna’s words – to be “culturally different”. They will prosper to the extent that they make good this promise. They must put strategy before tactics (incredibly hard). They cannot afford to look like the liberal elite demanding its job back. They must be rigorous in addressing new challenges rather than re-litigating old battles. They must continue to act with dignity in the face of seething social media fury – especially strong from some Corbynites, whose treatment of the escapees has been reminiscent of Scientology’s hounding of “suppressive persons”.But what the independents have already done is important: more important, perhaps, than the formation of the Social Democratic party in 1981. The “gang of four” was a breakaway faction of the Labour party. The Independent Group has genuinely bipartisan roots. And – unlike the SDP – it is starting its life in the crucible of a full-blown constitutional crisis.Whether it succeeds or fails, it has already acted as a much-needed solvent of the certainties that have paralysed Westminster during the Brexit process. It has reintroduced the indeterminacy principle to mainstream politics and, most specifically, shown those who fetishise the 2016 referendum result as if it were the burning bush of our era – a quasi-ine mandate – that leaving the EU is still, as a matter of fact, entirely voluntary. We can still step away from the precipice, if we choose, as a nation, to do so.Even as the 11 coalesced, three cabinet ministers – Amber Rudd, David Gauke and Greg Clark – published a truly remarkable article in the Daily Mail signalling their support for an extension of article 50 to prevent a no-deal outcome “if there is no breakthrough in the coming week”. It is hard to exaggerate the significance of this intervention. Theresa May’s defining mission – her reason for remaining in the job – is to take Britain out of the EU on 29 March. With a degree of repetition remarkable even by her standards, she has said that no-deal must stay on the table as a bargaining chip.Rudd, Gauke and Clark have issued a flagrant challenge to this, the last sacred principle of Mayism. And they have done so, thus far, with impunity. They know full well that a formal delay would smash to pieces the framework within which the Commons has operated since backing the government’s article 50 bill in February 2017.It would, for a start, dramatically oxygenate the argument in favour of a further referendum. It is already gaining fresh momentum, as Labour edges towards something approaching endorsement. In his fractious Sky News interview last week, Jeremy Corbyn made clear that he still loathes the idea, and would only countenance a public vote on a Labour deal: a precondition of which, presumably, would be the election of a Labour government. Deputy leader Tom Watson came much closer to the centre of gravity of opinion in his party on Sunday, when he said that Labour should back a fresh referendum if May rejects the party’s five-point Brexit plan (which she already has). This week, even though the meaningful vote has been postponed again, MPs will be given the chance to vote on Yvette Cooper’s amendment that would seize control of the parliamentary agenda and require the prime minister to seek such an extension (unless a deal is reached by 13 March). In January, Cooper’s binding proposal was defeated by a margin of 23 votes – while Caroline Spelman’s nonbinding motion against no-deal secured a majority of eight. In other words: we’d like to do the right thing, but we’re not allowed to. Sorry.On Wednesday, there will be only 30 days left until the official Brexit date. If that doesn’t focus the mind, I don’t know what will. Those wavering MPs who still feel constrained by narrow ideological loyalties, the haranguing of the whips, the dead slogans of a three-year-old campaign, should look at the 11 MPs who decided to cast aside those chains. They should ask themselves whether, for once, the claims of the public interest, of common sense and of future generations might just trump all else. They should ask: if not now, when?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/76c19cab5836526e22d7d648d854c873adadfeae/0_14_3400_2040/master/3400.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a7a8373edbe395392de503c370dcf267","title":"the guardian view on egypt and europe embracing authoritarianism","story":"Days after Egypt executed men who said they were tortured into confessions of killing the country’s former top prosecutor, Europe’s heads of state are enjoying the hospitality of its president. The resort of Sharm el-Sheikh is hosting the inaugural summit of the European Union and the Arab League. Donald Tusk, president of the European council, is co-chairing with Abdel Fatah al-Sisi Britain’s Theresa May is among the guests.If the event itself is a first, the approach is familiar. As Mr Sisi entrenches his rule, presiding over what Human Rights Watch calls Egypt’s worst human rights crisis in decades, European countries murmur about their “quiet diplomacy” on such issues. Then they carry on building ties and providing the air of international legitimacy that he needs given his grim record since seizing power in 2013’s coup. Mr Sisi’s recent spate of executions is instructive: he must have felt confident there would be no repercussions for putting people to death so close to the summit – despite their blatantly unfair trials.But EU leaders see Mr Sisi’s regime as a rare source of stability in the region, even if his actions are feeding long-term pressures. Emmanuel Macron applauds Egypt as a bulwark against terrorism while reminding Mr Sisi, sotto voce, about the need for human rights to be respected. Migration is high on the agenda though Egypt is not currently a major transit point, talks have begun on a deal that would see Cairo cut numbers in return for economic benefits – reflecting Europe’s broader willingness to have migrants trapped in squalid and dangerous conditions if it keeps them away from our shores.France, Egypt’s main arms supplier, also has those sales to think about – and human rights are in any case dropping down the EU’s agenda. Egyptians deserve and expect better. The constitutional coup now under way removes even the “promise or veneer” of democratic rule, notes one Egyptian author. An increasingly autocratic ruler may well believe he does not need much support when he can coerce compliance. But his predecessors thought so, too. Corruption, inflation and unemployment as well as state brutality are fuelling frustrations. A more accurate assessment of Mr Sisi’s rule might be stability – for now. Bolstering his reign is foolish and wrong."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7016bba7034d303aec7b5ad751c1f2f5b8a10f11/0_0_3350_2010/master/3350.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=565734eb6beb1630f45d33574fc86711","title":"the guardian view on mrs mays deal delay brexit not just the mps vote","story":"Theresa May’s decision to delay the meaningful vote on the terms of her Brexit deal to at least 12 March is the reckless act of a leader running out of ideas. We only have Mrs May’s word that “progress” is being made on changes that might make her withdrawal agreement acceptable to a parliament which last month rejected it in the largest ever defeat for a ruling party. MPs will have to decide which way to vote on one of this country’s most consequential geopolitical acts – leaving the European Union – just 17 days before it is supposed to happen. In the meantime, the country is driven closer to the cliff edge, egged on by fanatics who think Britain ought to leave the EU with no deal at all, wreaking maximum damage on the economy.But this is the point of Mrs May’s ploy: to rachet up the tension and raise the stakes. The prime minister aims to manoeuvre MPs to a point where a bad deal is better than no deal or no Brexit at all. Mrs May is hoping that her nerve will hold while that of her opponents fails. She is attempting to assemble a coalition to leave on the terms she has negotiated. It corresponds to what her chief Brexit negotiator Olly Robbins was heard boasting about in a Brussels bar earlier this month: that MPs would end up with a last-minute choice between her deal and a lengthy delay. She would then have the option to cast anyone who voted for a delay as an opponent of Brexit and anyone who voted for her deal as a committed leaver. It’s not a bad plan it’s just bad for Britain and for this country’s politics.The prime minister has shown her hand, but it is far from clear that it is a winning one. Others hold their own cards. On Tuesday, Mrs May will make a statement to the Commons. She will do so to forestall a cabinet rebellion that is threatening to erupt later this week when MPs get a chance to vote, thanks to the work of Labour’s Yvette Cooper, for an extension of the article 50 process either to enable parliament to reach a consensus on a Brexit deal or because they wish to achieve a long delay and a second referendum. Yet parliament ought to back such a move. It is time for Mrs May to give up her fool’s errand of attempting to reshape her deal, which is unlikely ever to command a Commons majority. Contrary to her claims, Mrs May is not on her way to get the legally binding changes demanded by hard Brexiters to the Irish “backstop”, a mechanism that guarantees there will be no hard border in Ireland by – if required – keeping the UK in a form of customs union with the EU. For the most part EU leaders remain adamant that they cannot concede this – because it would undermine the scheme’s purpose as an insurance policy to set an end date for the backstop, or to allow Britain a unilateral right of exit from it.For Conservatives who want to soften Brexit, Mrs May’s game plan has been to suck out the oxygen of parliamentary debate. The prime minister has used every trick in the book to block attempts to test the parliamentary appetite for alternatives – like preventing crashing out of the EU, remaining in the customs union, or a referendum on the final deal – to the Hobson’s choice of her deal or no deal. Even when votes take place, Mrs May ignores the results. This needs to end, as Britain’s government has been left fractious and dysfunctional. It is almost certainly doomed to collapse.Mrs May puts the Tory party’s interests before the country’s. For Labour MPs she makes the opposite argument: for the sake of nation, collude with the Tory whips, risk your careers, your party’s already-stretched internal cohesion and your authority within the wider Labour movement. Mrs May dangles a slew of worker-friendly laws to entice Labour MPs. This is brinkmanship by the prime minister whose message to would-be Labour rebels is: take my deal or face the wrath of your leave-voting constituents. The prime minister is foolishly ignoring the parliamentary arithmetic and the intense pressure under which the any parliamentary majority for her deal would have to withstand to sustain the legislation. It stretches credulity to imagine such a coalition could continue to ensure a majority that would deliver for Mrs May in the months ahead. The pressure has already contributed to the splintering of the two main parties. It’s time to delay Brexit, not just the meaningful vote."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cac014367143008bca3f1c4cd200ac9f09450da4/0_0_3035_1819/master/3035.jpg?width=940\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=d38b156b661564a08bdbd3816706d017 1880w","title":"your pictures share your photos on the theme of smooth","story":"Wherever you are in the world, this week we’d like to see your pictures on the theme ‘smooth’The next theme for our weekly photography assignment, published in print in the Observer New Review is ‘smooth’.Share your photos of what smooth means to you – and tell us about your image in the description box.The closing date is Wednesday 27 February at 10am.

The watchdog launched its investigation after being passed evidence in the form of eyewitness accounts that the environmental group Friends of the Earth had collected. The owners of the estates had voluntarily committed to ending the practice last year due to the threat of a compulsory ban. They categorically rejected the allegations laid against them by FoE, claiming that none was in breach of its voluntary commitments.In a statement, Natural England, which is responsible for promoting nature conservation and protecting bioersity, said it had been “investigating a number of reported incidents of burning taking place in upland areas. In a number of situations, we found that no further action was required. In others, we will continue further investigations and discussions concerning the management of these sites.”Environmentalists have been pressing for a ban on the practice of burning heather, or rotational burning of blanket bog, as it is known. Blanket bog is a wet peatland habitat that is globally rare and threatened. The old heather is burned to expose new shoots – a food source that attracts grouse. Estates charge people who want to shoot grouse.The watchdog’s investigation comes after Michael Gove, the environment secretary, was accused of letting the owners of large grouse moors off the hook over the practice.The owners face the threat of a compulsory ban after the European commission launched an investigation into whether the UK government was failing to protect blanket bog habitats.According to Whitehall documents, in February last year, Gove had suggested to the owners that they should stop the practice voluntarily to head off the possibility of a ban. The five estates were among more than 150 that signed up last year to the idea of voluntarily committing themselves to ending the practice. However, the evidence collected by FoE was gathered in October after the estates had signed up to the voluntary commitments.The Moorland Association, a lobbying body that represents grouse moor owners, issued on a statement on behalf of the five estates. Its director, Amanda Anderson, said that where heather burning has taken place over blanket bog, it was to remove overgrown vegetation to enable the blanket bog to recover in accordance with government-endorsed guidance.She added: “It is important to note that visitors to the uplands will continue to see smoke in the burning season as a result and that carefully implemented and legal burning on shallow peat will continue as a conservation tool. Burning is also used to reduce wildfire risk.”The five estates are the Grimwith estate in the Yorkshire Dales, Midhope Moor, Hurst and Chunal Moors, and Moscar Estate in the Peak District, and West Arkengarthdale in the north Pennines, according to correspondence between FoE and Natural England.A sixth estate, Walshaw Moor in Yorkshire, is also under investigation by Natural England, even though it did not sign up to the voluntary commitment, and instead reached an agreement with the watchdog to manage the estate’s environment. The estate also rejects the claim levelled by FoE.The European commission launched its investigation in 2016 after receiving allegations that the Walshaw estate was burning heather on blanket bog.FoE campaigner Guy Shrubsole said: “Burning moorland on rare blanket bogs wrecks ecosystems, worsens flooding downstream, and helps fuel climate change by causing the UK’s biggest carbon store to go up in smoke.“But the government’s efforts to get wealthy grouse moor owners to give up this archaic practice voluntarily have clearly not worked. The evidence we’ve gathered shows landowners are continuing to set protected moorland ablaze in breach of their own pledges.”Gove has said that the government will take steps to introduce legislation “if our constructive, voluntary approach does not deliver”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4700ddc3d43de1f64f5e18a955decccd219aa627/0_0_3508_2105/master/3508.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1c1b98663815847541af056512e85195","title":"the 12 key shows from milan fashion week in pictures","story":"From Gucci’s power suiting to a gameshow that inspired Jeremy Scott for this season’s runway for Moschino, Jo Jones picks her 10 highlights from the autumnwinter 2019 shows"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1db0c348cc1b326eeb8f2d1aff294a80d2df2971/0_574_2480_2478/master/2480.jpg?width=700\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1ba9637c5c712221329c3ce6d2a1bf54 700w","title":"oscars red carpet 2019 in pictures from glenn close to regina king","story":"A selection of the most striking red carpet looks from the 91st Academy Awards at the Dolby Theatre in Los Angeles"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0dd74396b8a0954db26f0554664ce3ed61040041/0_161_4928_2957/master/4928.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a47c9bbcb74145f66a1d174a0e9de59e","title":"oscars 2019 predictions timetable and all you need to know for the big night","story":"The 91st Academy Awards have finally arrived: here’s what you need to know, when you need to know it by and who (we think) will win the key prizes• Oscars 2019: red carpet, ceremony and the winners – live!• Oscar winners 2019: the full list – live!And now, the end is near … This year’s Oscar season has been the most fractious in memory: not only have many of the contenders been given the third degree for various failings, but the ceremony itself – the old standby of reliably dull TV – has been pulled this way and that with a series of messed-up tweaks that have served mainly to enrage the Oscars own membership. Whether it’s the Kevin Hart debacle, the farrago over ad-break presentations, or the attempt to axe the non-famous songs, it’s safe to say it hasn’t gone well. So far.So putting all that aside, what have we actually got? We still don’t know if there’ll be a surprise host (Whoopi Goldberg was being talked up as a last-minute possible), though it seems clear various attention-grabbing names have been frogmarched in to do some sort of podium duty. The Academy have backed away from all their various publicly floated proposals to trim the running time, but they have pledged to keep it to three hours, so we will have to wait and see what they ditch. (Here’s a suggestion: those skin-crawling comedy bits designed to go viral.)As the awards themselves, there’s been a pleasing lack of consensus on what and who should win what. The Favourite and Roma both have 10 nods, but that doesn’t mean much at the best of times. Quite a few of the contenders have muddied the waters themselves: Green Book for the idiocies of its director and writer, Roma for its trousering of Netflix’s marketing budget, Bohemian Rhapsody for Bryan Singer. No one can really be confident, least of all because the guild awards – normally pretty reliable indicator as its basically the same voters – have garlanded completely different films this year. The only dead certs look like Rami Malek and his ’tache for Bohemian Rhapsody and – much lower down the list – Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse for best animated feature. You would assume Glenn Close would be the sentimental favourite for The Wife. Other than that, all bets appear to be off.As usual, your hardworking  team will be on the case. Stuart Heritage is our own master of ceremonies on the live blog, the fashion team will be checking out the red carpet, Peter Bradshaw will be casting his world-weary eye over the results, and Hadley Freeman is our spy at the after-parties. So while we wait for all that to get going, here are a few pointers as to what to look out for and some final predictions.It all kicks off on Sunday 24 February, in the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood. The Oscars live telecast starts at 5pm (PST)8pm (EST) – that translates to 1am (GMT) on Monday in London and 12 noon (AEDT) on Monday in Sydney. You can watch it live on ABC in the US, Sky TV in the UK, and Channel 9 in Australia. Red carpet junkies can start watching three hours earlier – 2pm (PST)5pm (EST)11pm (GMT)9am (AEDT) – on the E! TV channel. And the show itself is going to be three hours long. Got that? THREE HOURS.At this stage, we’re all punchdrunk. Who knows? Peter Bradshaw has already had his say, so you might want to refresh your memory. The bookies have their own theories, but – you know – I don’t think they know much about films.  writers have been advancing arguments on behalf of all the best picture nominees, and now we’re even more confused.

In recent years that’s been the only actually funny bit of the whole thing, before the Oscars got addicted to stupid presenter stunts.•The last time the Oscars had no host, this happened. It was arguably the most jawdropping idea anyone ever had, and wrecked the careers of (almost) everyone involved. Will something as similarly awful emerge this year? We can but hope.•The Oscars gift bag is always good for a laugh – just bear in mind these aren’t official, just a bunch of self-promoting hucksters riding on the coat-tails of the big event. Personally, I can’t wait to see if someone gets busy with their Mr Poop toilet plunger on the red carpet, or hands around tasty treats from their cannabis edibles gift box.•We don’t know yet what order they’ll do the handouts, as there seems to be a great deal of fiddling about with the show. But they traditionally kick off with the best supporting actor gong, which a little while back looked nailed on for Mahershala Ali. But if Richard E Grant nabs it, it’ll show the anti-Green Book faction is a power to be reckoned with, and that Grant’s shameless pitching on social media. For the full list of nominations, look here.•If we can be so bold, can we draw your attention to the fact that the  itself is up for an Oscar tonight? Our film Black Sheep is up for best documentary short. You can watch it now, if you like. And if it wins, you’ll be able to hear the hellish screams of delight emanating from  HQ.•The Academy managed to put everyone’s backs up by trying to shove a few awards into the commercial breaks, drop most of the songs and – most insultingly of all – try and get rid of the no-names who only went and won last year. So if there’s an extra big cheer for Alison Janney, or whoever wins best film editing, or whoever belts out that funny song from The Ballad of Buster Scruggs, you’ll know why.•Will anyone do a Gwyneth Paltrow and totally lose it on the podium? Hard to anticipate of course: we’d expect nothing less than regal elegance if Glenn Close steps up, and Christian Bale looks unlikely to get another chance to invoke a Satanic hellstorm, but if Olivia Colman gets the gong, I think we’re in for a treat.•Hollywood seems to have got the memo that political posturing leads to aggravation from the TV audience and a visit from the online Maga crew, so there’s not likely to be anything in the Marlon BrandoVanessa Redgrave league.

King was the strong favourite for the award, having taken the Golden Globe for best supporting actress. However, she lost the Bafta to Weisz, and was surprisingly not even nominated for the Screen Actors Guild award.Adapted from James Baldwin’s 1974 novel, If Beale Street Could Talk was director Barry Jenkins’ follow-up to the Oscar-winning Moonlight, and King was cast as Sharon Rivers, the mother of lead character Tish (played by KiKi Layne).Prior to If Beale Street Could Talk, King was probably best known for her TV work, which included an award-winning role on the series American Crime, and an Emmy-nominated spell on The Leftovers.In her speech, King paid tribute to Baldwin, calling him “one of the greatest artists of our time”. Jenkins, she said, “nurtured” Baldwin’s baby, “nurturing her and supporting her with so much love and support”.It was therefore, she continued, appropriate for her to be standing on stage “as an example of what it looks like when support and love is poured into someone”.King then addressed her mother, who had accompanied her to the event, saying she loved her and thanking her for teaching her about God’s abiding faith in her.“God is good all the time,” she concluded."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/031079c32ab0548656496a7cb65037c19723ab28/502_108_3158_1896/master/3158.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=349101966560281ca2411ef639af24d2","title":"black sheep guardian film nominated for best short documentary oscar","story":"Ed Perkins’ film about a young black boy’s response to a racist gang after he moves out of London is up for an Academy awardBlack Sheep, a film commissioned by the , has been nominated for best short documentary at the 2019 Oscars.Directed by Ed Perkins, Black Sheep tells the story of Cornelius Walker, a black 11-year-old from London who moves with his family to a housing estate in Essex after the murder of schoolboy Damilola Taylor in 2000. Walker, the same age as Taylor and of similar background, found himself confronting a gang of local racists and, after first fighting back, went to extraordinary lengths to fit in and gain their friendship.The film features interviews with Walker looking back 15 years on from the events he describes, which are re-enacted in the locations where they took place, with Kai Francis Lewis playing Walker.Responding to the nomination, Walker said that he was, “humbled and proud.

They’re played off and the speech just sort of crumbles away to nothing. It is AMAZING.Elsie Fisher and Stephan James are presenting BEST MAKEUP AND HAIR. They’re presenting it very briskly indeed. Was this one of the awards they wanted to give out during a commercial? It certainly feels this way.

There are peppercorns dotted through the rice already, a couple of lime leaves, crushed to release their oils, and then, just as it comes to the table, there will be a freckling of citrus zest. The rice has been sitting under its tight lid for 10 minutes, resting, before I run the final seasoning through the soft grains with the tines of a kitchen fork.There isn’t a winter breakfast on earth I enjoy more than warm rice and miso soup. Getting a bowl on the table is only a little more trouble than stirring a pan of porridge, but it is still a breakfast I confine to the weekend, when the first hours of the day move at a different pace. The rice calms, the citrus notes invigorate. It is what I call a balanced diet.Sour, sharp, citrus notes are a signature of this kitchen. Blackcurrants, gooseberries and limes in summer. Rhubarb, yuzu, lemon and tamarind in winter. The snap of a lime leaf brings a bowl of soup to life. A squeeze of glossy brown tamarind paste will brighten the flavour of a stew or curry more subtly than a splash of lemon, lime or cider vinegar and they all have a place in my kitchen. The answer to the age-old question “what do you always have in your fridge” is invariably something sharp and sour. Something to add an edge to my dinner.I love that moment when the onions have softened, the paste of chillies, garlic, turmeric and ginger has been stirred in and the tomatoes are just starting to give up their juices.

Warm the groundnut oil in a large, deep casserole over a low to moderate heat then stir in the onions and curry leaves. Let the onions cook for a good 15 minutes until they are soft, pale gold and translucent. A regular stir will help them cook evenly and prevent them sticking.Make the paste using a pestle and mortar or a food processor. I tend to use the latter. Chop the chillies, peel and roughly chop the ginger and peel the garlic, then blend to a paste with the oil and turmeric. Stir the paste into the softening onions and sizzle for a minute or two, then roughly chop and stir in the tomatoes. Continue cooking for 8-10 minutes, letting most of the juices evaporate and stirring regularly, then pour in the coconut milk and mix in the tamarind paste and salt to taste.Cut the white fish into large pieces, each about 40g in weight, then lower into the sauce and cook for 4-5 minutes. Then, as the fish firms up, add the washed clams and prawns, cover tightly with a lid and turn up the heat. Continue cooking for 3 minutes or until the clams have opened and the prawns have gone from grey to pink.Tear the coriander leaves and stir in, check the seasoning and serve with steamed rice. aims to publish recipes for sustainable fish.

Raheem Sterling was setting off on his victory run, the trophy was back in Manchester City’s possession and Pep Guardiola had another piece of silverware for his collection. Yet that told only part of the story bearing in mind the incredible scenes involving Maurizio Sarri, his headstrong goalkeeper and the public show of disobedience that could conceivably accelerate the process of Chelsea looking for another manager.It was a remarkable finale and an unorthodox one, too, bearing in mind Sarri’s failed attempts to substitute Arrizabalaga just before the game headed into the penalty shootout. Arrizabalaga had gone down twice with cramp in extra time and Sarri wanted to bring on Willy Caballero, a goalkeeper who had saved three penalties for City when they won this competition in 2016 with a shootout victory against Liverpool.Arrizabalaga clearly had other ideas, signalling that he was fit, making it absolutely clear he had no intention of going off, then holding his ground and leaving Sarri close to the point of spontaneous combustion on the touchline. Caballero, the penalty specialist, was stripped from his tracksuit, ready to come on, but Arrizabalaga did not care. It was a staring contest – and Arrizabalaga’s refusal to blink meant he was always going to be the hero or villain in the shootout.To his credit, the goalkeeper did manage to keep out Leroy Sané’s penalty. Not that it mattered, ultimately, when he also let one from Sergio Agüero go beneath his body, preceded by some failed Grobbelaar‑esque silliness to put off the scorer, and could not keep out the ones from Ilkay Gündogan and Bernardo Silva either.Ederson, City’s goalkeeper, saved from Jorginho with the first kick of the shootout and David Luiz hitting the post with Chelsea’s fourth effort was the decisive miss. César Azpilicueta and Emerson had beaten Ederson and Eden Hazard did so with the most outrageous chip. Yet the occasion will be remembered for the refusal of Chelsea’s goalkeeper to leave the pitch, the public show of rage from his manager and the unmistakable feeling that we were witnessing something unprecedented in a Wembley final.Sarri was so incensed he stormed down the tunnel and, briefly, it was not entirely clear that he would even return. He thought better of that one – but it needed Antonio Rüdiger to hold him back from getting to the Spaniard before the game went to penalties.To describe Sarri as livid would be an understatement. Justifiably, too, because it would be rare at any level to see a manager being disobeyed this way. For it to happen in a final, with his job potentially on line, was a calamity. The referee, Jon Moss, should have been firmer and told Arrizabalaga his number had flashed up on the electronic board and, frankly, that he needed to get off the pitch. Worse for Sarri, not enough Chelsea players backed up their manager. David Luiz tried to talk some sense into Arrizabalaga with no success. But where was Azpilicueta, the captain? Or the other senior players?Not that City will care about those kind of details after winning this trophy for the fourth time in six seasons. It was their sixth victory overall and that means there is only Liverpool, with eight, who have been more successful in this competition. Pep Guardiola continues to insist a quadruple will be impossible, but it will not be for the lack of trying and, judging by the scenes at the end, they will have a lot of fun trying to find out.For now, it should be enough that they have secured the season’s first silverware with a performance that was below their best – and certainly a long way short of the six-goal rampage in Manchester a fortnight ago when they inflicted Chelsea’s heaviest defeat since 1991.The last time they played one another, Chelsea were four goals down after 24 minutes. This time City managed one shot on target throughout the first 90 minutes. There was even the strange phenomenon of Kevin De Bruyne misplacing several passes before being substituted. David Silva was also replaced.Hazard had looked the most threatening player and Chelsea appeared to have learned from their Manchester ordeal. They were quick to the ball, they chased down their opponents and played with a collective understanding that, before anything else, they had to find a way to disrupt City’s rhythm.Twitter: follow us at @_sportFacebook: like our football and sport pagesInstagram: our favourite photos, films and storiesYouTube: subscribe to our football and sport channelsOnce they had managed that, Chelsea started to look increasingly dangerous in the second half, whereas their only threatening moment in the opening 45 minutes came when N’Golo Kanté set off after a long ball through the middle and looked as though he might get a clear run behind the defence.As often happens with this referee, Moss was some way behind play when Oleksandr Zinchenko cut across Kanté and the Chelsea player went down. A free-kick in that position would have meant a red card and that was certainly what the end of the stadium wearing the darker shade of blue wanted. Instead, Moss waved on play and, more by luck than anything else, that was probably fair given that Kanté had controlled the ball on his hand as he ran between Aymeric Laporte and Zinchenko.Laporte went off at half-time and when Fernandinho was injured later on that meant City, with all three substitutes used, had to wait until extra time before they could bring on a fourth, Danilo, in place of the Brazilian.Ultimately, though, the game will be remembered for the substitution that never was and, knowing what we do about Roman Abramovich, a farce that could have serious repercussions for the man who, for now, holds the title of Chelsea manager."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/49c4a51573c1714b6ee2416f68bb1db7bfb921e5/0_202_4928_2957/master/4928.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=131629b515a2fcbcc361a7948700c1f1","title":"manchester united liverpool premier league match report","story":"If Liverpool wished to signal serious intent of ending their 29-year wait to be champions of England, they failed. This game in hand over Manchester City featured an under-par performance that will hearten Pep Guardiola’s men, though the point does leave the Merseyside club leaders by a point with 11 matches left.The draw suits Manchester United far better and given how Ole Gunnar Solskjær’s XI were hindered by three injury-enforced substitutions, all before the interval, the result is a particular morale-booster.The Norwegian may have overhyped United’s second-half display as “magnificent” but they certainly outplayed Liverpool then and though Jürgen Klopp played down his disappointment, he will be concerned that his team failed to fire.The sight of Klopp appearing near-furious throughout – “animated” was his description – and choosing to take off his star turn Mohamed Salah with 11 minutes remaining summed up how Liverpool stuttered.Solskjær made two changes from Monday’s FA Cup win at Chelsea. Sergio Romero returned to the bench and Nemanja Matic was injured so in came David de Gea and Scott McTominay. Jesse Lingard’s recovery from a hamstring problem was advanced enough for him to sit on the bench but Anthony Martial was absent because of his groin injury. Klopp also changed two from Tuesday’s Champions League draw with Bayern Munich James Milner and Virgil van Dijk for Trent Alexander-Arnold and Naby Keïta.In what would end as a dire, injury-blighted 45 minutes, Liverpool rattled United instantly from kick-off. Ashley Young’s back-pass left De Gea short and in desperation the goalkeeper handled the ball. The referee gave the indirect free-kick outside the six-yard area to the right. A short routine ended with a Milner pot-shot hitting the wall and United escaped.Much of Liverpool’s possession was down to United errors. The next meant Joël Matip received the ball and ran through the home side, causing Ander Herrera to shove him over inside the D, and United were relieved to see Salah spoon the free-kick over. Herrera’s act might have been the reason he was forced off on 21 minutes – the Spaniard replaced by Andreas Pereira.Given Matic’s absence this meant United now had a third-choice in midfield alongside the second-choice McTominay, Paul Pogba being the only automatic selection left on the field in that position.Further injury problems occurred moments later when Juan Mata had to come off, though Lingard’s entrance meant United were arguably strengthened. All this disrupted any rhythm the contest had – a point Klopp used to explain his team’s performance.And there was more: just after the half-hour Roberto Firmino became the match’s third substitution because of a sore ankle that brought Daniel Sturridge on. Sturridge’s first contribution was a 30-yard pea-roller though this was, at least, some form of attacking act it would prove Liverpool’s sole attempt on target.As the interval neared United moved up a gear, putting together the contest’s best move. Pereira intercepted in his half and found Romelu Lukaku. He played in Pogba down the left, who ran on before returning the ball to the No 9. Lukaku paused, slid a clever pass to Lingard but when the substitute tried to beat Alisson, the keeper grabbed the ball.Twitter: follow us at @_sportFacebook: like our football and sport pagesInstagram: our favourite photos, films and storiesYouTube: subscribe to our football and sport channelsThis proved too much for Lingard, though. Having been spied clutching a hamstring earlier he became United’s third casualty. Solskjær stated all three were caused by the same problem and that he may have to assess why.Lingard had lasted 18 minutes. Alexis Sánchez entered and when the Chilean turned inside from the left and hit an errant pass this was the first half in a microcosm.The hope was for a higher quality second half but the start hardly augured well. Balls bounced off Sánchez – as they tend to do – and when United moved up-field via Luke Shaw and McTominay it petered out. Young took two free-kicks, from the right and left, and first Pogba, then Sánchez, were offside.Liverpool, finally, posed a serious question. Jordan Henderson broke along the right and aimed a cross at Sadio Mané but Pereira, not for the first time, blocked. The crowd were vocal and the contest, too, had livened up. When Young pinged a ball on to Marcus Rashford’s toes the No 10 required a slicker touch than that which allowed Alisson to clean up. United were in the ascendancy and Klopp was in a perma-rage, unhappy at his side’s sluggishness.Pogba was next to threaten but slipped when crossing and Alisson, again, gratefully collected.Liverpool, perhaps remembering this was their match in hand, did now pin United back. Henderson looked to play in Salah but Shaw stymied this with his head. Young did the same to a Milner ball and Georginio Wijnaldum’s cut inside was followed by a wild effort.The first tactical substitution came on 72 minutes, Klopp replacing the disappointing Henderson with Xherdan Shaqiri. The German continued to be upset – taking aim at the substitute for lax defending – while having the countenance of a man baffled at what he witnessed. At the close Chris Smalling had a golden chance to convert Lukaku’s cross but there was no grandstand finish."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7fa271dc43a71a5506f94135f30aa86c589e312d/0_0_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0b19ecb24c107da430a255f46a5b3db2","title":"kepa chelsea sarri carabao cup final manchester city","story":"Refusal of keeper to be substituted near end of extra time undermined manager’s good work in League Cup finalAt times during his winter dissolve on the Chelsea touchline Maurizio Sarri has had something of the tracksuit-clad King Lear about him, striding his chalk square, whipped by the to-and-fro conflicting winds, raging at ingratitude and insubordination. By the end of this Carabao Cup final he had been transformed into something else, something more terminal had become instead the fool.Poor Sarri. For the preceding two hours his players had given the impression of playing for their manager, of a sense of unanimity. As the second half wound down Chelsea had the better, just about, of a scoreless game, with a feeling of something emerging, a shape beginning to clarify.In a moment of extra time in extra time that chimera fell away. Basically, Kepa Arrizabalaga refused to come off the pitch. He was substituted by his manager. But then he wasn’t. This was a substitution that became a non‑substitution, a substitution that was declined, swatted away with a swish of the glove.Three times Sarri approached the touchline and signalled for his goalkeeper to go. Next to him Willy Caballero stood awkwardly, looking at his feet, a lime-green gooseberry caught between his raging manager and a 23-year-old goalkeeper who refused to bow to the chain of command.Watching this it was impossible not to feel a curling of the toes. In the under-12s Arrizabalaga would have been led off by the referee or his mum. At Chelsea he stayed on, the world’s most expensive goalkeeper under a manager still paddling for air. How is this one going to play out?Afterwards Sarri was conciliatory. He handled it brilliantly in fact. He called the moment a misunderstanding, said that Arrizabalaga “was right, but in the wrong way”. Arrizabalaga had gone down with cramp, then recovered. Sarri saw that in retrospect Arrizabalaga was fine to stay on.Either way, to refuse to leave the pitch when ordered to go is unheard of. Certainly unheard of by Sarri, whatever he might say afterwards. He flailed his arms, screamed in rage, kicked things, wandered off almost down the tunnel. As the final whistle blew the manager was held back from engaging with his goalkeeper by Antonio Rüdiger.And in that moment the feeling of a ship whose captain had briefly resumed the wheel was pretty much dashed. So much about a shootout is to do with certainty and calm, the feeling that victory is at hand. Think of Gareth Southgate with his managing the manageables, planning every detail from the ring walk to who stands where. A stand-up row with a raging manager, a mutinous keeper, teammates keeping them apart: these aren’t quite the marginal gains we had in mind, Maurizio.Presumably Roman Abramovich was tuned in to all this, buffering his live feed in the cinema room of his super yacht somewhere near the equator. It is to be hoped Abramovich caught the rest of the game too, because until that moment his team had seemed to be getting somewhere. There had been a fear Chelsea might be eviscerated by Manchester City on this huge green spring-like pitch. Instead they grew into the game steadily, helped by selection and tactics that had a note of pragmatism when it mattered. For a man who never changes, Sarri changed here.The whole left side of his team, as brittle as a brandy snap in Manchester two weeks ago, was junked and replaced, albeit the first sight of Chelsea’s team caused a mass social-media sass at the sight of Eden Hazard as a false nine.At first glance this looked a fairly horrible decision, a case of spiking your own most powerful gun. But this was where Hazard had played when Chelsea beat City 2-0 at Stamford Bridge. More to the point, Sarri was also camouflaging a weakness.Twitter: follow us at @_sportFacebook: like our football and sport pagesInstagram: our favourite photos, films and storiesYouTube: subscribe to our football and sport channelsA system badly implemented is always a bad system, and at the Etihad Hazard had done a lot of standing around while the game happened quite near him. Marcos Alonso might not be the greatest defensive left-back. With no cover he looks like a man viewing the game through a film of extra thick custard. The change worked here. For a while nothing happened. Then nothing kept on happening. The shapes moved, coloured dots on a grid picked out against the green. The crowd chuntered and rumbled at the edge of things.Either way, 0-0 at half‑time felt like a step-up against the champions. And so it continued. On 51 minutes nothing happened. On 52 minutes nothing happened. On 53 minutes something happened. It was Hazard, finally getting away in his favoured left-hand channel. Kyle Walker has seen this movie before. Hazard went to cut inside, as he always cuts inside, but was crowded out.And as the game entered its final third it was Chelsea who were starting to carry the weight of the play. Win or lose, there would surely be solace here for Sarri, a sense of progress, of a team called to heel.At which point, enter Arrizabalaga. The Chelsea dressing room has been described as toxic, as a place where managers are flushed out, rat traps laid. This was gentle by comparison, and much worse, Arrizabalaga shooing his manager away as though bothered by a troublesome uncle.That City held their nerve and took the shootout was no surprise. This is a wonderful team, ticking off the first note of triumph in a season that could yet yield an astonishing bounty. For Chelsea it felt by the end like another note, albeit a comic one, in Sarri’s own drama of departure."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/62de27ed0a2cd5ad48e7c068cc9859e064f68b92/0_0_1848_1404/master/1848.jpg?width=300\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=31e5ced9edef85b8ec3a86b9145ff7fa","title":"struggling to sleep share your experiences","story":"If you have problems sleeping at night we’d like to hear from you is planning a new video project about sleep.We’re hoping to understand more about how people are affected by sleep problems and would like readers to tell us how they navigate sleepless nights.We want to include first-person video testimony from our readers.

But could the breed have had its day?The Kennel Club has placed the Scottish terrier on its at-risk register as people favour trendier designer cross-breeds such as the cockapoo and labradoodle, and migrants such as the French bulldog and miniature dachshund.Of the native British and Irish breeds, 29 are considered “vulnerable” with fewer than 300 registrations. They include the bearded collie and Irish wolfhound, which are back on the list after a short resurgence.There is worrying news too for the old English sheepdog, which last year hit its lowest registration level of 318. Registrations for the Irish red and white setter are now so low at 51 that its breed club fears it will die out.The Kennel Club’s secretary, Caroline Kisko, said the number of native breeds on the list was rising and some would be lost “if people don’t look beyond the most obvious choices – such as the increasingly popular French bulldog – and start to explore the huge ersity of breeds we’re lucky enough to have in this country”.One possible factor is the apparent lack of celebrity owners of a breed which was once used on Highland farms to hunt badgers and rats.That was not always the case. They were once frequently pictured with glamorous owners such as Bette Davis, Joan Crawford, Humphrey Bogart and Shirley Temple.Queen Victoria was a fan – her dog was called Laddie - as were a striking number of US presidents. Dwight Eisenhower had Telek and Caacie, Ronald Reagan had Scotch and Soda, and George W Bush had Miss Beazley and Barney. A statue of Franklin D Roosevelt’s trusty Scottie, Fala, sits beside the president at his memorial in Washington.In film there was Jock the Scottie – “with a bonnie bonnie bone, that I’ll bury for me own” – in Lady and the Tramp. In literature Beatrix Potter suggested the breed could push a wheelbarrow and use a saw in the shape of John Joiner the carpenter.Kipling is one of the best known Scottie devotees and the breed is said to have inspired his poem The Power of a Dog, in which he wrote: “Brothers and Sisters, I bid you bewareOf giving your heart to a dog to tear.”Til Tovey, the secretary of the Scottish Terrier Club of England, said she was saddened by the decline. “The Scottish terrier is a great breed for those who want a small companion dog with plenty of character and an independent streak, and have time to train them consistently.“Scotties are brimming with personality so sometimes can be a little stubborn. It would be very sad to no longer see this historic and much-loved breed in our streets and parks in a few generations’ time.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/06bde533d71441dd1a1d857cb0db787171118c31/453_234_1122_673/master/1122.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=45a6600ad91fc93c2c97fb5815d3bb24","title":"how to have a cosy sunday shakshuka flowers and beyonce","story":"I’m obsessively looking for any remnant of spring and summer to warm my spirit as I wait for the clocks to go forward againA friend of mine once joked that winter is so miserable, we collectively repress how bleak it is every year. Then, when the mercury drops, we’re somehow shocked that the sun is setting at 4pm, our monthly budgets are desperately contorting themselves around Christmas obligations, and we’re spending 20-30 minutes every weekday morning in silent negotiations with every instinct inside us that’s demanding we stay cocooned up in bed as the working day approaches.I’m one of those ungrateful types who says silly things like “I can’t wait for winter, I love to layer!” by late August, which is testament to this annual amnesia. Sure enough, when winter comes around, I’m obsessively looking for any remnant of spring and summer to warm my spirit as I wait for the clocks to go forward again.Sunday is my day to fuel up on enough cosiness to see me through five days of early starts and pitch-black evenings, so all food, entertainment and activities must be warming and mellow. Cooking shakshuka for breakfast means I can let the stove’s heat wash over me (an alternative to using even more energy on central heating) as I impatiently watch my red sweet peppers soften in the wok, waiting for the perfect moment to add first the passata (I’m fussy about tomato chunks) and then the eggs. I eat hurriedly, using hunks of toasted sourdough bread as cutlery, racing to get the warmth in me before heading out into the chilly air.I don’t go far, as I’m lucky to live over the road from the epicentre of cosiness, Columbia Road flower market. The trees that line my street have been stripped bare by winter, so the market’s weekly bloom feels like walking back into May and June, even if I am balled up in a fleece and thick jogging bottoms. Strolling down the alleys that lead from the main road to the market, the sound of buskers singing blues music creeps up on me, accompanied by clinking pint glasses and pub chatter. To my right, windows framing candlelit cafe tables draw me in, leading my eyes to racks of 1970s tableware, costume jewellery and plant pots that spill out from a higgledy-piggledy shop and on to the wonky paving slabs.After I finally accept there isn’t a place in my house for a crystal glass decanter – a decision I re-examine every time I pass this shop – I join the crowded flow of bodies heading to the flowers. Towering bamboo overshadows us for a brief moment, giving way to a flurry of colour that feels psychedelically incongruous in the grey, dead January chill. I walk through, watching out for bewildered jack russells and small children, to soak up the sea of bottle-green house plants and flamboyant bromeliads, inevitable roses and hundreds more I can’t name – some that look like hummingbirds, some that look like pineapples (but aren’t), fussy ones that I’d likely kill in a week, and hardy types I could hopefully neglect without guilt. Then I loop back, looking for something to take home.My choice is slightly limited as I usually go towards the end of trading, when the lifestyle influencers have stopped taking photos and the sellers, eager to avoid lugging home too many spare cheese plants, offer discounts. By this point you can get a couple of really great bunches of flowers for a fiver, so I try to play florist and work out which colours and shapes are going to go together. Now it’s been winter for a good few months, I’m drawn to flowers that make me feel like I have the sun on my face – pretty little purple flowers that you’d see in a British park in summer, and sweet, warm orange petals that conjure up the taste of Soleros.While the flower market is full of life and colour, it is still winter, and I’m still cold. I timed my central heating to come on 20 minutes before I get in, so warm air greets me as I push the front door open with my bum, to avoid crushing my bouquets. I place the flowers on the kitchen side, and begin cutting the stems with inadequate scissors, the mixture of hard work and warm radiators bringing feeling back to my cold fingers. I make a feeble arrangement and stick them in a vase that I use because it belonged to my nan, despite its irritating tendency to tip over. They’ll live by the window, which looks out on marketgoers clutching their huge, leafy houseplants and marching home in single file like leafcutter ants in scarves and coats.Coffee made, slippers on and the house toasty, I squish myself into a corner of the sofa and get under a blanket that’s been warming on my radiator. As I lazily watch Netflix (or binge Beyoncé live performance videos on YouTube if I’m home alone or with sympathetic friends), I look up at my new bunch of flowers poking out from behind my TV. Their colours distract me from the grey skies and dull brick walls in the window behind them. I’m reminded that winter is temporary, the warm will return, and it will be so intoxicating I’ll say nonsense like “I can’t wait for winter, I love to layer!” by August again.To stay snug and cosy, download the Meerkat app and set up EnergyCheck – you’ll never have to spend time searching for better energy deals again.

They are likely to be issued by an insurance company for free, but the industry is warning it could take up to a month to obtain one, so if no deal happens and you’re booked to go away with the car this Easter, you will need to act fast.The official advice from the UK government is: “From 29 March 2019, in the event that there is no EU exit deal … drivers of UK-registered vehicles will need to carry a motor insurance green card when driving in the EU and EEA.”Note that a green card (and they do have to be on green paper) typically lasts only 90 days, and if your insurance renewal comes up while you’re abroad, you will need one for each cover period. The card applies to the vehicle, not the driver.Direct Line insurance says: “In the event of a no-deal Brexit, we have plans to ensure customers are provided with a green card if they drive in Europe on or after 29 March. Customers will need to contact us at least two weeks in advance of when they are due to travel.”In Ireland, where 30,000 drivers commute across the border daily, and where shoppers from Dublin frequently head to Belfast and vice versa, the green cards issued are likely to be valid for one year. Irish insurers have prepared 400,000 green card forms in the event of no deal, and some UK insurers are now proactively sending green cards to customers in Northern Ireland.Insurers say they are already incurring hefty costs to organise the cards and prepare their staff in call centres to handle an inevitable barrage of questions. The Association of British Insurers says it would much rather none of this was happening. “It remains the case that insurers do not want a no-deal Brexit it would be bad for the economy and bad for our customers,” it says. “We continue to hope these arrangements are never needed and urge the government, UK parliament and EU27 to agree an orderly way forward.”In a sentence You will have to buy an International Driving Permit to drive in Europe, at a price of £5.50, with different ones required for France and SpainIf there is no deal with the EU then recognition of UK driving licences in the EU ends. So British drivers will have to go to the Post Office and obtain an International Driving Permit (IDP), which you will need to carry with you in conjunction with your UK driving licence.There is a curious twist to the international rules which means that if, say, you drive through France and into Spain, you’ll need two different IDPs. That’s because the 1949 IDP convention covers Spain, Malta, Cyprus and Ireland, while the 1968 IDP convention covers all other EU countries, plus Norway and Switzerland.So at the Post Office you have to specify which permit you want, depending on which country you are visiting, or get both if driving between France and Spain or Portugal and Spain.And just to add a little more complexity, the permit you buy for Portugal will last three years, but in Spain you’ll have to renew it every year.The Post Office has set up a webpage dedicated to this process. But you can’t buy it online – you’ll have to head to a Post Office with your driving licence, passport and a passport-sized photograph.As regards driving back and forth between the UK and Ireland, there has been significant confusion.Last September the government’s official position was that an IDP would be required if driving across the Northern Ireland border. But in January this advice was withdrawn, and it now says: “If you hold a UK driving licence you should not need an IDP to drive in Ireland from 29 March as Ireland does not currently require IDPs to be held by driving licence holders from non-EU countries.”It was also revealed this week that British citizens resident in Ireland – estimated to number about 300,000 – will be required to swap their UK driving licence for an Irish one at a fee of €55 (£48) if there is no deal on Brexit. PCIn a sentence They will no longer be valid and buying travel insurance will become essentialFor years, Brits travelling, studying and working in Europe have relied on the European Health Insurance Card (Ehic) that entitled the holder to state-provided medical treatment if they fell ill or had an accident in an EUEEA country.Two weeks ago, the UK government issued its latest advice on healthcare when travelling abroad, warning that if the UK leaves with no deal, our Ehics will no longer be valid.It has advised anyone travelling on or after 29 March to any of the EU countries as well as Switzerland, Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein, to buy travel insurance to cover healthcare “just as you would if visiting a non-EU country”.It has said it is seeking agreements with countries on healthcare arrangements for UK nationals after Brexit day, but no such agreements are in place yet. Those studying or working temporarily abroad already won’t be able to buy travel insurance as they have already left. They will probably just have to risk it as, alternatively, they face having to buy expensive local insurance, which will run into several hundred pounds.Ehic was never intended to cover long-term residents who had moved to another country, but many relied on it particularly if they spent only part of the year abroad, or for when they had just arrived in a new country. MBIn a sentence: Visa-free travel to Europe ends, paving the way for possible £52 90-day visasIt’s arguably the craziest prospect of all, but if the Brexit impasse is not broken, British tourists face having to apply for a visa to visit most of mainland Europe.That was the warning from Brussels this week where reports say there is a very real prospect of UK citizens having to apply for a €60 (£52) visa to enter the Schengen area, which includes most of the EU countries we generally visit.The problem concerns talks that have become mired in a dispute with Spain over whether the British overseas territory Gibraltar should be described as a “colony” in the EU’s statute book.If no solution can be found the UK will be left in legal limbo as it is not on the list of countries where a visa is required to visit the EU, nor on a list of countries with an exemption.It could mean UK citizens heading to Europe for Easter having to pay for a Schengen visa or be left waiting for a bilateral deal. In a tit-for-tat move, EU citizens coming to the UK would face a similar scheme. Further down the line, the EU is proposing an electronic visa waiver system valid for three years at €7.Questions also remain about how travellers will be treated when they arrive in Europe. Portugal is the only EU state so far that has said it will create a third lane at airport passport control to speed Brits through. Without a deal, they face having to queue with all non-EU passport holders, with the inevitable long delays. MBIn a sentence The government promises to keep EU flight delay payouts, but airlines could use changes to fight having to pay outEuropean Union flight compensation regulations have been fought in almost every UK court, so could a no-deal Brexit give the airlines another opportunity to stop paying passengers after a lengthy delay or cancellation?That’s the warning from lawyers this week – in spite of government promises that in the event of no deal, passenger flight rights will remain. The EU Withdrawal Act provides that EU regulations – as applied now – will convert into domestic law, meaning the same rules will continue to apply until legislators in the UK decide otherwise.On the face of it, passengers will still be able to claim to up to €600 (£536) in compensation when airline problems cause their flight to land more than three hours late, or is cancelled. They will also be entitled to meals and hotels if the delays are caused by problems beyond the airline’s control.However, with just over a month to go, specialist flight compensation lawyers say there has been no explanation as to how it will work. The compensation rules currently apply to all airlines based in the EU, and flights out of EU airports on non-EU-based carriers.The wording of the new legislation would have to watertight, says Coby Benson, solicitor at Bott and Co, because in the past the airlines have used any ambiguity to dismiss legitimate claims, and have fought them through the courts.“We anticipate that if the new adopted legislation is not entirely clear, the airlines will seize upon this to allow them to wriggle out of paying. This has been the history of this legislation from the start, and I can only foresee further court battles. If the airlines spot a get-out opportunity, they will try to use it to their advantage,” he says. MBIn a sentence The EU pet passport scheme ends for UK travellers and their cats and dogs – replaced with expensive tests every time they travelIf you were planning to take your dog or cat on holiday to Europe after a no-deal Brexit, you may want to think again after you have read this.The UK’s participation in the European Union pet passport scheme in effect ends on 29 March. It means that cat and dog owners (the documents also mention ferrets) will need to show that their animals are healthy – and produce new documents to support their animal’s health when they arrive in the EU.Pet owners will also have to show that their animal been effectively vaccinated against rabies by undergoing a rabies antibody titration test at least 30 days after inoculation, and no fewer than three months before they enter the European Union.Pets will need to travel with an animal health certificate issued by an officially registered vet. This certificate can only be issued up to 10 days prior to entry into an EU member state.This comes at a time when many veterinary practices are already experiencing worker shortages and recruitment problems, it says. The advice is to book well ahead if you’re planning to take your pet abroad. MBIn a sentence Phone companies say they have no plans to reintroduce charges – but don’t rule them out eitherArguably the EU’s most significant consumer benefit of recent years has been the abolition of mobile phone roaming charges. The EU first capped then finally scrapped roaming charges across mainland Europe in June 2017.It means EU citizens can use their mobile in another EU state as if they are at home. Call plans that typically include 500 free minutes and 2GB data can be used abroad without incurring extra charges, which, before the EU’s intervention, regularly cost more than the flight to your destination.But if the UK crashes out of the EU at the end of March, the culture secretary, Jeremy Wright, has confirmed there will be nothing to stop mobile operators reimposing the charges.So hooked on smartphones have we all become, a return of roaming charges might be considered one of the worst impacts of leaving the EU.The biggest providers – Vodafone, O2 and EE – confirm they have no plans to reintroduce them on 1 April, but equally have not ruled out their reintroduction. Only Three has promised not to reinstate them irrespective of the Brexit outcome.Currently, EU mobile phone networks are not allowed to add extra charges to calls made by customers of other EU operators. That ends with a no deal.O2 says: “We will be working closely with the government and other European operators to try and protect the current arrangements, so our customers can continue to enjoy free EU roaming.”A future trade deal with the EU would include the abolition of, or limits to, mobile roaming charges, they have said. MBIn a sentence Retirees to Europe should worry about the future of their state pension, but private pension issues were largely resolved this weekThe 200,000 British citizens aged over 65 who have retired to the EU – half to Spain – still don’t know if their UK state pension will be uprated every year after we leave the EU, or whether they’ll join the “frozen’ pensioners” in Canada and Australia who have seen their pensions shrivel.The government has committed to uprate pensions across the EU in 2019 and 2020, but after that will only go ahead if there is a deal. It says: “We would wish to continue uprating pensions but would take decisions in light of whether, as we would hope and expect, reciprocal arrangements with the EU are in place.”If they are not uprated, it could leave retirees in poverty and force a return to the UK. Someone retiring to Australia 20 years ago still receives the basic weekly UK state pension rate of £66.75 prevailing at the time.But there’s better news on private pensions. For months the UK pension industry has been in limbo around whether they can look after a private pension taken out in the UK if the person has retired to the EU. But this week the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA) in Frankfurt said providers could continue to operate much as before, even with no deal.Steven Cameron of Aegon says: “There were concerns that UK providers might have been unable to service the policies of such iniduals. We very much hope EU regulators will confirm they are following EIOPA’s recommendations and will not treat these policies as ‘cross border’ which should allow servicing to continue.”Investments in funds, such as equity Isas, should be unaffected with a “temporary permissions regime” in place even if we crash out.In a sentence The EU-mandated £85,000 safety net will remain and the vast majority of UK account holders should be unaffectedThe immediate impact of no deal on UK bank account holders is likely to be minimal, but the cost of card payments between the UK and the EU is likely to rise and processing times become slower.Banks report that they have been receiving calls from worried Brits living in the EU who regularly access their UK-based bank account. Will a hard Brexit mean they can no longer use these accounts? The banks are assuring customers that they can continue to use them and transfer money overseas as they did before.Even if a bank appears to be from an EU country, there are few issues. For example, both Santander UK and Bank of Ireland (UK) are domiciled in the UK for regulatory purposes and post Brexit will be treated exactly the same as Lloyds or Barclays.However, there are those who are domiciled outside the UK and use EU membership to “passport” their services to the UK. But even here agreement has been reached, with a temporary permissions regime allowing them to carry on in the UK for three years after Brexit, and apply for authorisation during that time.The £85,000 protection for deposit accounts is partly the product of EU directives.But the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS) says: “FSCS protection for UK-based customers of UK authorised firms will not change, regardless of whether the UK leaves with or without a deal.” PC"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/673275cdac35f1f1725bea767b788704069e980d/0_13_4134_2481/master/4134.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=49ee7f78fb2457770ba317e28e210ddb","title":"brexit could be delayed until 2021 eu sources reveal","story":"EU reportedly determined to avoid uncertainty of three-month extension requestsBrexit could be delayed until 2021 under plans being explored by the EU’s most senior officials, at a time of growing exasperation over Theresa May’s handling of the talks, the  can reveal.A lengthy extension of the negotiating period is gaining traction as the EU’s default position should the Commons continue to reject May’s deal, and a request emerge.Replacing the 21-month transition period with extra time as a member state would allow the UK and the EU to develop their plans for the future relationship with the aim of making the contentious Irish backstop redundant.Brussels is determined to avoid offering a short extension only to have to revisit the issue in the summer when the government again fails to win round parliament.“If leaders see any purpose in extending, which is not a certainty given the situation in the UK, they will not do a rolling cliff-edge but go long to ensure a decent period to solve the outstanding issues or batten down the hatches,” one EU diplomat said.Informed sources say there is dismay that senior government figures are focused on seeking domestic political advantage and appear wilfully blind to the opposition to reopening the withdrawal agreement.One insider said there was concern that there was no domestic consensus over the withdrawal agreement but also over the UK’s position on what kind of trading relationship it wanted when the transition period elapsed.“Some say: ‘We can have Norway, we can have Canada, we can have a customs union, we can’t have a customs union. Some of them say we are not to be trusted because they think we are going to use the backstop to keep them in the EU forever, but if you look at the confusion, you can see precisely why the backstop is necessary,” said an insider.There is also disquiet that Ireland will be scapegoated for no deal when member states believe the country is being used as a proxy to tease out positions on future trade talks. For this reason “any attempt to blame the Irish for no deal will backfire,” said a source.There is also bewilderment that the recent flurry of meetings in Brussels involving May’s Brexit secretary, Stephen Barclay, and the attorney general, Geoffrey Cox, are being characterised in London as “negotiations” when the reality is the EU is still waiting for the prime minister to show them the alternative arrangements for the Irish backstop for which she claims to have a majority in support.The frustration being felt in Brussels was evident after Cox arrived in Brussels with no concrete proposals. “We are still in wait-and-see mode. There is a feeling that Britain is overplaying how things are going,” said an insider.One senior EU diplomat said May was to blame for failing to confront hardline Eurosceptic Tories. “She gave the impression that you can stay in your delusional comfort zone, but you can’t,” the diplomat said. “Unless she is ready to choose there is nothing we can do.”Concerns emerged as May flew in to the Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheik for an EU-Arab league of states summit on Sunday, and confirmed she would not be putting a revised Brexit deal to the Commons this week. Even so she insisted that it “within our our grasp to leave the EU by 29 March and that is what we are planning to do”.May said she would instead put the deal to parliament on 12 March and brushed off the calls by three cabinet ministers – Amber Rudd, David Gauke and Greg Clark – for a no-deal scenario to be ruled out.“What we see around the cabinet table are strong views on the issue of Europe,” she said. “What we are doing as a government is ensuring we are doing everything we can to leave the European Union with a deal.“People are talking about the extension of article 50 as if it solves the issue when of course it won’t. It defers the point of decision. There comes a point when we must make that decision.”There is growing support, however, among MPs for an amendment due to be tabled this week by the former Labour and Conservative cabinet ministers Yvette Cooper and Oliver Letwin, which would instruct May to seek an extension of article 50 if she does not have a deal ratified by 13 March.As he arrived at the summit in Egypt, Sebastian Kurz, the Austrian chancellor, offered his support for a delay to Brexit given the impasse in the negotiations.“If by the beginning of March there’s no support for the deal then I think it would be good to postpone Brexit because a no-deal scenario is bad for the EU but extremely bad for the UK,” Kurz told reporters.EU officials are understood to be looking at options if such an extension request is received: a three-month “technical” extension to allow extra time for ratification if the parliamentary process develops positively, or a longer prolongation of nine to 21 months should there be no clear way to break the current impasse.A source close to the European council president, Donald Tusk, said that as a request had yet to be made by Downing Street, the issue had not been discussed by leaders. “No Tusk position on this,” the official said of the mooted 21-month extension. “At this stage, at least.”But sources said the EU was determined to avoid a series of three-month extension requests by the UK, which would cause damaging uncertainty, leaving Brussels unable to plan for the future.The emergence of the idea of a 21-month delay to Brexit will be seen by some as an attempt to push Brexiter MPs into backing May’s deal.The EU’s chief negotiator, Michel Barner, had advised ambassadors last week that the threat of a lengthy extension could be used by May as leverage in talks with her Brexiter MPs as she seeks to nudge the deal through parliament.May is meanwhile driving on with seeking legally binding changes to the withdrawal agreement to reassure Brexiters of the temporary nature of the Irish backstop, which would keep the UK in a customs union to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland.The prime minister updated Tusk during a 30-minute meeting at the summit in Egypt on her plans for the meaningful vote. “No tensions,” an EU source said. “Focus on practicalities.”Tusk was said to have told May that the EU would have “clarity that a proposal for the way forward can command a majority in the UK, before the issue is tackled by the European council”.The Irish taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, who will hold talks with May on Monday in Egypt, dismissed claims made earlier on Sunday by Michael Gove, the environment secretary, that a time limit or unilateral exit mechanism from the Irish backstop could still emerge from the talks.“A backstop that includes a time-limit is not a backstop at all. Nor would a unilateral exit clause work for us,” Varadkar said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1384210c361909a8c7e841534100ebdb3715b221/8_450_1421_852/master/1421.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=031686025b5216dad6cf75ef0ba1ea41","title":"pool may italian pm","story":"PM confessed she would be ‘hopeless’ in encounter with Giuseppe ConteTheresa May was challenged to a game of pool by the Italian prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, during the EU-Arab League summit on Sunday in a moment that may have been a distraction, albeit a not especially welcome one, from Brexit.Conte posted a video on his Facebook page of the prime minister being offered a cue and joking that she would be “hopeless”.May appeared surprised at the proposal and told Conte “You’ll have to show me how”, which results in the Italian prime minister giving a demonstration.In the footage, chief of staff Gavin Barwell shows the Conservative leader how to position her hand on the table while striking the cue ball, although the footage ends before she takes a shot.Retweeting the video, the chief secretary to the Treasury, Liz Truss, joked: “Pleased to see nothing’s been taken off the table.”May is hoping she will not end up behind the eight ball during the summit in Sharm el-Sheikh.The prime minister, who announced that MPs may have to wait until 12 March for a meaningful vote on the government’s final Brexit deal, is also expected to meet Angela Merkel on Monday.The pool video is not the first time that May has been caught on film at a pastime in which she is less than expert.Her dancing caused laughter when she visited South Africa and Kenya in August but she was able to poke fun at herself later.She entered the stage for her keynote speech at the Conservative party conference in Birmingham while swaying along to Abba’s Dancing Queen."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/470a3883a294323988efb0f9868895fac19e488f/0_743_2476_1485/master/2476.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1e56aa63040c534e825dd805202f8850","title":"theresa may dismisses pressure to step down as pm after brexit","story":"May insists she will stay on after delaying ‘meaningful vote’ on revised exit dealTheresa May has insisted that she will stay on in Downing Street beyond Brexit despite pressure from cabinet colleagues to step down, after she angered MPs by conceding that there would be no “meaningful vote” this week on a revised withdrawal deal.The prime minister sparked a fierce backlash on Sunday by admitting that the vote may now not be held before 12 March because her team are still negotiating with EU officials on changes to the deal that she hopes will reassure MPs.“My team will be back in Brussels on Tuesday. As a result of that, we won’t bring a meaningful vote to parliament this week, but we will ensure that that happens by 12 March,” she said. “But it’s still within our grasp to leave the EU by the 29 March, and that is what we are planning to do.”The shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, said: “This decision to further delay the meaningful vote is the height of irresponsibility and an admission of failure. Parliament cannot stand by and allow this to happen.”Cabinet ministers told the  last week that they expected the prime minister to stand down after the local elections in May, and Brexiters would like to see a successor more sympathetic to their case to take over the next stage of the negotiations.Speaking en route to Sharm El Sheikh, however, where she is attending a summit of the EU and the Arab League, May insisted that she wished to remain in Downing Street to pursue her domestic agenda, including major health reforms. “I was very clear in December with the Conservative party that my job is not just to deliver Brexit. There is also a domestic agenda that I am delivering on that reflects what I said when I was on the doorstop of No 10 when I first became prime minister.“That is why we have been making key decisions such as extra money for the National Health Service and the long-term plan for the NHS.” Asked if she would resign by Christmas, she refused to reply.May told Conservative MPs before the confidence vote in December that she would stand aside before 2022, and later made it clear that she intended to contest any snap election.In a further challenge to her authority, three cabinet ministers – Amber Rudd, Greg Clark and David Gauke – have publicly threatened to defy her in the Commons this week by backing efforts to extend article 50 if no deal is agreed by mid-March.While there will be no meaningful vote this week, MPs will be offered another chance on Wednesday to vote on a government motion and, crucially, to amend it to bind May’s hands by trying to prevent a no-deal Brexit.Yvette Cooper, the co-signatory of the Cooper-Letwin bill, which could win the backing of scores of ministers, said: “The prime minister’s last-minute announcement that she won’t put a deal to parliament this week, and is leaving it until just two weeks before Brexit day, is utterly shambolic and irresponsible.“The prime minister is still committed to an amendable motion on Brexit next week, so our cross-party group will be tabling a paving amendment to vote on this week in order to get the bill through.”May refused to condemn the three cabinet ministers speaking out against a no-deal Brexit. “I have recognised and others have recognised that there are strong views that are held on this issue. What we are collectively doing as a government and as a cabinet is working to get that deal,” she said.“Parliament wants to see changes to the backstop. We have been working with the EU on that. Our focus is on leaving with a deal. My intention is to work with a deal.”The announcement of the further delay to the meaningful vote infuriated business groups, which have been keenly awaiting confirmation that a deal has been agreed. Edwin Morgan, the interim director general of the Institute of Directors, said: “There is too much at stake to run down the clock and risk an accidental no-deal. We sincerely hope this is the last and final date change.“The prime minister must make absolutely clear ahead of time what the government’s next steps will be if the vote fails again. Businesses have lost all faith in the political process, and as those first in the firing line of no-deal, they deserve to know more.”The environment secretary, Michael Gove, earlier urged his cabinet colleagues not to back a Commons vote on delaying Brexit. He said Clark, Rudd and Gauke supporting the bid, which would push back the UK’s exit date of 29 March, would be “the wrong thing to do”.Following a torrid week in which three female MPs resigned the Conservative whip after claiming that the party had been taken over by Brexit extremists, May was forced to respond to claims from one defector, Anna Soubry, that she had “a problem with immigration.”May said: “No. As I have consistently said, immigration has been good for this country. What people wanted to see is to ensure that decisions about who is welcomed to this country are taken by the UK government and are not taken by others elsewhere.” May will make a statement to MPs on Tuesday in a last-ditch bid to prevent her own ministers from voting for Cooper-Letwin and defeating the government. A Whitehall source said: “The clock is ticking and no deal is unacceptable, so we will listen carefully to what the PM has to say.”Soubry, one of the three who joined the breakaway Independent Group last week, said: “No surprise she’s nothing to bring back because the EU will not reopen the withdrawal agreement. We know this to be the case, because when she came back with it, that’s what she said. This is it, it’s as good as it gets, and the negotiations are over. What a dreadful, avoidable mess.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fc16ed44bdc9cd819bbddff03eae7d48bdac50a5/1148_558_1373_824/master/1373.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d7a18fc437d54cad46789cb8b0f6e5e0","title":"theresa may postpones meaningful vote on final brexit deal","story":"Prime minister promises to hold vote by 12 March in move that will deepen cabinet splitsMPs may have to wait until 12 March for a meaningful vote on the government’s final Brexit deal, Theresa May has said in an intervention that will deepen splits in her cabinet.The prime minister confirmed on Sunday that she would not hold the vote this week as she flew to Sharm el-Sheikh in Egypt, where she is due to discuss Brexit on the margins of an EU summit with Arab leaders.It is a critical week for May, with many in the House of Commons having been expecting to vote on her deal.Without a reworked withdrawal agreement to bring back to MPs, she has promised to table an amendable motion, which will allow backbenchers another chance to try to block a no-deal Brexit.May said: “My team will be back in Brussels on Tuesday.

My intention is to work with a deal.”In a separate development, May pledged £200m to help victims of the war in Yemen as she arrived in Egypt. “We are playing our part and will continue to do so but there is still more that we as an international community can do,” she said.“At the summit in Egypt, I will call on our partners in Europe and the region to continue to provide the aid that is so desperately needed.”May is due to meet a Saudi delegation on Sunday and is expected to also raise the killing of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi.Brexit will not be on the official agenda at the inaugural meeting of the EU-Arab League conference, but May is expected to hold meetings with the European council president, Donald Tusk, later on Sunday and Angela Merkel on Monday."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/27acfd990386e0d0bcec1015720bd872eae4619f/0_251_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4e1a73b799ffa9c57f6956a616ef92f1","title":"dinosaur fossils collectors museums price sale","story":"Leading US palaeontologists are calling for a worldwide halt to the sale of vertebrate dinosaur fossils. The booming market for specimens, driven by their popularity with wealthy private collectors, including Hollywood stars, is pushing up prices and putting them out of reach of museums and scientists, they say.While the art market is organised around brand-name artists, dinosaur sales are all about celebrity species, with a tyrannosaurus rex skeleton fetching up to $10m, although the velociraptor is the most prized. The price tag for a triceratops’s skull is $170,000 to $400,000, and a diplodocus is $570,000 to $1.1m. Last year a complete egg of an aepyornis maximus, otherwise known as an elephant bird, sold for $130,000 – roughly five times what it would have gone for a decade earlier.Jerry Smith, an expert in the evolution of freshwater fishes in the department of zoology at Michigan University, told the Observer: “When specimens go into a private home or collection, our understanding, interpretation or discovery of new information they contain will never reach the scientific community.”Last year the US Society of Vertebrate Palaeontology (SVP) called on the Parisian auction house Aguttes to cancel a sale inside the Eiffel tower that contained just one lot: a 29-foot-long dinosaur of a yet-to-be identified species. The winning bidder paid $2.3m for the piece.Executive members of the society drew attention to the claim that the winning bidder could name the species, calling that assertion “misleading because the naming of new species is governed by the rules of the International Code of Nomenclature”.“The sale of all fossils is inappropriate,” says Catherine Badgley, former president of the SVP, which represents more than 2,200 international palaeontologists. “Many, particularly vertebrate fossils, are rarely common, and it’s certainly not the case for dinosaurs. The commodification is in principle inappropriate because it motivates unscrupulous people.”As ARTnews magazine pointed out last week, we can thank Steven Spielberg’s 1993 film Jurassic Park for the surging dinosaur market. The initial phase peaked in 1997, just months after the film’s sequel, The Lost World, was released, when a 12m-long T rex named Sue was sold at Sotheby’s for a record-breaking $8.36m to the Field Museum in Chicago.But the interest has hardly abated. The recent Art Basel Miami included a special project called DeXtinction, organised by two mining companies, Avant Mining and Interprospekt, that included a 120 million-year-old mother and juvenile allosaur and a well-preserved dinosaur egg set from the Cretaceous period, 75 million years ago.According to the New York Post’s Page Six column, the exhibit drew the attention of Leonardo DiCaprio, who along with Nicolas Cage and Russell Crowe, has staked out a reputation as a collector.And that’s what alarms palaeontologists who fear not only the loss of scholarship but also the diminution of appreciation for the work that goes into discovery, excavation and reconstruction of a dinosaur skeleton as they become fashionable objects of home decor.Dinosaur fossil collection comes with risks. In 2013, the 67 million-year-old skull of a tyrannosaurus bataar bought by Nicolas Cage became the focus of an investigation into smuggling. Cage had bought it at an auction in California, beating DiCaprio with a $276,000 bid. It was later discovered that the skull was obtained from Eric Prokopi, a self-described “commercial palaeontologist” who had previously pleaded guilty to illegally importing fossils from Mongolia and China.The looted skull was ultimately returned to Mongolia.All of which still serves to alarm working palaeontologists, who express concern that institutions are being priced out of the market and important specimens lost to private collections. Badgley points to specimens dug from the Green River Formation in Colorado, Wyoming and Utah, which has some of the earliest bataar fossil specimens known. “Bat fossils overall are extremely rare, and even if half from this really early period are going into private collections, then that’s an enormous amount of really important information that’s being lost,” she says.Badgley’s message to collectors, then, is simple: collect by all means but steer clear of unique specimens.“There isn’t a strong link between expensive trophy specimens and an increase in the science of palaeontology. If anything, they’re seen more for their rarity and economic value than for their scientific information. It’s not necessary for people to become interested in palaeontology by having a unique specimen that’s theirs and theirs alone.”In her experience, she says, “people are often just as happy with something that’s very common”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c8f163fc45e7016831a6e359939461d5f47a225e/0_34_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e66df84f929e182a6cead798a6815d9d","title":"wigan hull fc super league match report","story":"• Wigan 22-23 Hull FC• Scrum-half’s drop goal seals golden point win in extra timeAs the Hull FC coach, Lee Radford, embraced each of his players after a historic afternoon in the Lancashire sunshine, the celebrations perhaps told their own story. Hull have waited since last June – 13 games and 240 days – to experience the euphoria and elation of victory: but no matter what happens next for Hull, few afternoons will be quite like this.Anything other than victory here would have been tough for them to take, given the nature of how they put their bodies on the line for more than 80 gruelling minutes in a backdrop of injuries and adversity. So when Oliver Gildart crossed to level the scores with seconds remaining, you wondered how Hull – and Radford – would pick themselves up.However, Zak Hardaker’s wayward conversion handed the Black and Whites a reprieve and gave us the first golden point extra-time in Super League – and how they seized the opportunity.Within seconds of play restarting, Marc Sneyd’s drop goal secured that long-awaited victory. “He’s the iceman,” Radford said of his scrum-half.“I’m relieved for them, the players. We had no bench left at the end with injuries and if we’d come away with nothing from here after that effort … it’d have been tough.”All the drama of golden point almost managed to overshadow the biggest pre-match talking point – the return of the former Great Britain and Hull captain Gareth Ellis from an 18-month retirement at the age of 37.With injuries and suspension robbing Hull of his first-choice props, Ellis answered the call with an impressive display in the pack. “It was a typical Gareth Ellis performance,” Radford said. “I’ve lent him my full body massager after that and if he pulls up OK, we’ll see about him playing next week.”Hull were magnificent all afternoon, not least in establishing a half-time lead of four points after tries for Carlos Tuimavave, Joe Westerman and Ratu Naulago – the former Saracens winger who marked his rugby league debut with two tries.Wigan’s response came from Gildart and Liam Byrne – but this was a below-par performance from the champions, who have one win from their first three games.“There weren’t good signs throughout the match,” said their coach, Adrian Lam.Naulago’s second four minutes after half-time put Hull in control, though as injuries began to bite, the visitors began to tire noticeably.Wigan took advantage: first, Ben Flower charged over with 15 minutes remaining, before a period of sustained pressure yielded another Gildart try. But Hardaker could not break Hull hearts by kicking the conversion and Sneyd’s drop goal sealed victory."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5ab2ecb2b0402464abfd66a60b491fdf447cd20f/509_856_3671_2204/master/3671.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dab0278f8ef5811cb792173cc52ea36f","title":"equus review peter shaffer horse blinding theatre royal stratford east london ned bennett","story":"Theatre Royal Stratford East, LondonNed Bennett brilliantly directs the landmark 1973 play about a teenager who has blinded horsesI’ve often complained about the move towards a directors’ theatre. But directors can also renew a familiar work – which is precisely what Ned Bennett does in his exhilarating staging of Peter Shaffer’s modern classic. I was present at the first performance in 1973 but, without violating the text, Bennett’s production has enabled me to see the play through fresh eyes.Shaffer shows a psychiatrist, Martin Dysart, attempting to discover what drove a teenage boy, Alan Strang, to blind six horses with a metal spike: it is not so much a whodunnit as a why-did-he-do-it? Dysart patiently explores Alan’s parental background – a puritanical father, an obsessively religious mother – and the boy’s preoccupation with horses. But, while Dysart envies the boy’s capacity for worship, he only gets to the truth when he tricks Alan into reliving the events of the night of the blinding.Shaffer’s published stage directions are modelled on John Dexter’s original production: “the actors wear tracksuits of chestnut velvet” and “tough masks of silver wire and leather”. But Bennett, designer Georgia Lowe and movement director Shelley Maxwell have totally reimagined this. The opening image is of Ethan Kai’s Alan nuzzling a horse in the shape of Ira Mandela Siobhan, who sports grey shorts and reveals a muscular torso. The eroticism of the relationship pays off later when Alan orgasmically bestrides the horse in question, Nugget, and when that memory intrudes on his attempt to have sex with a stable-girl. An idea latent in Shaffer’s text, of Alan’s equine fixation as a metaphor for same-sex love, is made explicit in Bennett’s production.The play’s difficulty lies with Dysart. Alec McCowen played him brilliantly in the original production as a desiccated rationalist with a hunger for ecstasy.Zubin Varla takes a different, and equally valid approach by suggesting that Dysart is just as disturbed as his patient. Varla smokes compulsively, his body is a mass of nervous tics and, when he tells Alan that he had a dream of carving up children, you feel he is not entirely joking. I’ve always felt there was something excessive about Dysart’s self-loathing, but here his regrets about returning Alan to a world of supposed normality take on a different meaning: it is as if he feels guilty not just for destroying his passion but for altering his sexual orientation.The whole production, however, has a different feel to it from the original. What is usually a play for two stars, depicting Shaffer’s familiar battle between reason and instinct, becomes an ensemble piece for eight actors who double as people and horses. There is especially good work from Ruth Lass as a kindly magistrate seeking to stave off Dysart’s breakdown, Robert Fitch as Alan’s oppressive father, Syreeta Kumar as his Bible-quoting mother and Norah Lopez Holden as his would-be lover. Lowe’s design, composed of pristine white curtains, is appropriately clinical while opening up to reveal a world of smoke-filled mystery. Jointly presented by Stratford East and English Touring Theatre, this production confirms that Bennett is a director to watch. It also proves that Equus, among many other things, is a landmark homoerotic play."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c5d1a0a78f740be318593c6111b041f80c70824a/0_0_3030_1817/master/3030.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=960d565d3d25f32e1c5bb2c833ea67ac","title":"huawei unveils mate x folding phone to rival samsung galaxy fold","story":"Device has eight-inch flexible screen that folds all the way round the outside of the phoneThe Chinese smartphone maker Huawei has followed Samsung’s lead by unveiling a super-luxury 5G phone with a folding screen called the Mate X with a price tag of €2,299 (£1,995).Introduced at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona on Sunday, the Mate X has a flexible OLED display that covers both the front and back of the device, and which unfolds outwards to become an eight-inch (20cm) tablet screen.Richard Yu, the chief executive of Huawei’s consumer business, said the Mate X represented “a voyage into the uncharted”. “As a new breed of smartphones, Huawei Mate X combines 5G, foldable screen, AI and an all-new mode of interfacing to provide consumers with an unprecedented user experience,” he said.The Chinese firm, which has been at the centre of a political storm, was pipped to the post by its South Korean rival with the launch of its Galaxy Fold smartphone last Wednesday.The design of the two cutting-edge devices is quite different. Samsung put the folding screen on the inside of the device, which opens like a book to reveal a 7.3-inch screen, and a smaller 4.6-inch screen on the outside for use like a standard phone.Huawei’s Mate X has just one screen on the outside. When closed, the front screen measures 6.6 inches, comparing favourably with large non-folding smartphones such as Huawei’s Mate 20 Pro. The screen that folds around the rear is dormant unless used to take photos or for other similar tasks. That leaves the flexible screen exposed to the outside world at all times and at risk of scratching.Analysts viewed the unveiling as broadly positive, giving Samsung competition in the new folding-phone space, but were sceptical that a device costing as much as three times current top-end smartphones would sell in significant numbers.Francisco Jeronimo, an associate vice-president with IDC, said the Mate X’s “form factor seems a lot more user friendly than the Samsung Galaxy Fold”.Ian Fogg, vice president of analysis for OpenSignal, called the Mate X’s foldable design striking but warned: “Remember a foldable design places new tough demands on all aspects of the hardware, not just the display - it still has to deliver a great network experience, battery life etc.”Huawei says the Mate X is the “world’s fastest foldable 5G smartphone”, and that its position as a manufacturer of 5G network infrastructure has given it a unique advantage because the company was able to test the phone on internal 5G networks before release.That same position, however, has also made it a geopolitical talking point. The US has told European countries that it may find it difficult to work with anyone who uses Huawei products in their networks after raising security concerns about the company.Huawei is the second-largest smartphone manufacturer by volume ahead of Apple and behind Samsung, and it has its eyes on first place. It is also expected to launch a range of flagship smartphones in Paris in March.Huawei said its Mate X would be available later in the year to coincide with the launch of 5G networks, which are expected to begin limited rollout this summer in the UK and elsewhere. Several other Chinese firms, including Xiaomi, area also expected to unveil folding-screen phone designs this year, as the battle to lead the next wave of smartphone innovation heats up."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c3d0aa1a92777b34fc26caa07c07aa6e682beb76/0_150_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f714a2abfec8e23d1d5cb99c2eba4bda","title":"swiss time travel aboard glacier express st moritz switzerland","story":"From glitzy St Moritz to a socialist watch-makers’ town onboard the Glacier ExpressIt’s like taking a starving man to the best restaurant ever and not letting them eat,” says Louis, shoulders hunched, scowling at the mint-white mountain peaks. Outside St Moritz train station, lights twinkle, snow begins to fall and everywhere is soft, crystalline white. It looks magical, yet it’s torture for one of us. I should have known that taking a ski addict to Switzerland for a no-ski break would be problematic, especially if the ski addict in question happens to be my temperamental teenage son.“You knew the deal before we came. It’s hardly a deprivation,” I say, watching liveried chauffeurs holding tiny gold placards bearing names: Madame Petrov, Monsieur Felipe. Daimlers purr, waiting to whisk guests to opulent hotels further up the mountainIt wasn’t my intention to drop in on the Alpine playground of the super rich. I wanted to head straight for La Chaux-de-Fonds, the city designed by watch-makers and much admired by Karl Marx, via one of Europe’s most scenic rail trips, the Glacier Express. But in the spirit of balance and contrast, first we stay at one of St Moritz’s oldest hotels, the Kulm. In its fin-de-siecle foyer, chandeliers sparkle, log fires blaze and It girls drip in Fendi fur. It is like walking into the back pages of Hola!“We have a six-course tasting menu booked for you in the grand restaurant for 7pm,” says the lady at reception. My son Louis is perkier by the minute. Strangely his mood darkens when we are shown our room, complete with wrap around views of the Alps.“I can’t believe it,” he fumes, pacing the marbled bathroom. “People have been living like this all along and I never knew. Now I can’t enjoy anywhere else.”“And that’s the problem with coming to places like this,” I say. “You feel either moral outrage or envy. Neither makes you happy. It’s better just not to know.” But Louis isn’t listening. He is distracted by the in-house video on the TV. “Mum, look, you can hire a mountain for a day. It’s only £4,000. Can we come back?”At supper, the waiter hovers while Louis eyes up the wine menu where bottles start at around £75. “I know it’s not a question you hear very often,” I say. “But what’s your cheapest glass of house red?” “House?” the waiter repeats, baffled. The next morning, we head for the ice-skating rink, owned by the Kulm but open to the public. My instructor is charming and patient, holding my hands while I grit my teeth and try to forget about the last time I went ice skating 20 years ago and broke my ankle. She offers to take Louis nighttime skiing – a Friday tradition where for less than £20 you can enjoy Switzerland’s longest floodlit slope till 1am. He’s thrilled to get the chance to ski while I enjoy the outdoor infinity pool in peace. Later in reception, I hear an over-confident English accent: “My son is still on the slopes. I’m afraid we’ll be a little late for the country club.” I’m horrified to realise it is me. Time to go, before I start enquiring about mountain rentals.Early next morning, we board the Glacier Express, the world’s slowest express train that has been running between St Moritz and Zermatt since 1930. It snows heavily the day we travel and much of the time we emerge from the darkness of each tunnel (there are 91 of them) into blinding white fog. But when it does clear, the scenery is spectacular. We enjoy a three-course lunch at our table as the train carves its way through the Oberalp Pass (2,033 metres above sea level) with its glaciers and peaks, then on through the Nikolai Valley, the deepest in Switzerland, arriving at Zermatt eight hours later. The next morning we board a train to La Chaux-de-Fonds, in the Jura mountains, and close to the French border.If there is anywhere in Europe, let alone Switzerland, that is less like St Moritz in spirit, it’s hard to think of it. While St Moritz’s raison d’être is leisure for the super rich, La Chaux-de-Fonds is its polar opposite, created as a socialist antidote to all that glitz and privilege. Home of modern watch-making, the town prized industry and enterprise above all else. In 1794 a fire destroyed most of the buildings and, inspired by the radicalism of the French revolution, it was redesigned by the workers for the workers. Equality was built into the new city brick by brick. They chose not to have a civic centre given over to grand squares and palaces where the elite could parade their wealth and the poor would feel excluded.The city is built in a series of grids, its layout like a chess board streets were designed so workers and managers lived in close proximity, next to their workshops, with no neighbourhoods for the rich and ghettos for the poor. The boulevards are wide, allowing light to pour into the workshops so the watch-makers could work more efficiently. As a social experiment it was a resounding success Marx described the town as “la grande manufacture” in Das Kapital. The craft of watch-making thrived and prospered well into the 20th century, surviving the quartz revolution of the 1970s – even today La Chaux-de-Fonds is home to the workshops or headquarters of Rolex, Patek Philippe, Zenith, Tissot and Omega, many of which were founded here.The city is also home to the granddaddy of modernism, Le Corbusier, born here in 1887. In a snowy suburb overlooking the town, La Maison Blanche is a modernist gem built in 1912, and all the values that inspired the town are here in his design. Open-plan spaces for work as well as living, floor-to-ceiling windows so each room is flooded with light and, above all, the idea that everyone should be able to enjoy where they live. That night we stay at Grand Hôtel Les Endroits, a hotel on the edge of town where we we have our best meal so far, the food more French than Swiss, with shaved truffles baked with potatoes and cream, followed by chocolate patisserie.Our final morning is spent at a watch tutorial where, with the help of watch-maker Sebastian, a powerful microscope and some tweezers, we try to attach both watch hands to its face. After an hour of intense concentration, we manage to assemble a watch that keeps time. “Satisfying work isn’t it?” says Sebastian, as Louis tries it on his wrist. “I guess,” he says, studying it. “So how much would it cost to take it home?” This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

He doesn’t get out of bed until his mum shouts him into action over Skype. He turns up to work barefoot and in pyjamas. He foments staff dissent by opening payslips and blabbing about who gets paid what. He sets off the fire alarm, causing mass panic. Best of all, when he goes to an ideas meeting, he is asked to suggest how working practices could be improved. How about, he offers, all of you get some self-respect?To be fair, those to whom Tim is appalling deserve it. He has been hired by a greeting card manufacturer called Anarchy Hamster. The boss, Sean, who intolerably styles himself “chief lunatic”, has created a work environment of teeth-clenching, compulsory fun. Anarchy Hamster is a company devoted to flooding the world with fatuousness. So, when Tim discloses he may or may not defecate in his boss’s desk drawer, we may well think Sean has it coming. (If Tim has, which he hasn’t.)The conceit of Jerk (BBC Three) is that Renkow’s cerebral palsy means he can get away with saying what others dare not. He is Larry David with a twist – nobody risks confronting him because he is disabled. He is cerebral palsy’s James Bond: he has licence, if not to kill, then to wound by being awful to all-comers. He is to political correctness what Boris Johnson is to statesmanship. He is a sociopathic American who parlays his palsy into guilt-tripping PC Britons – which, as you know, is as easy as shooting fish in a barrel.There’s another reason I like Renkow. His on-screen mother is Lorraine Bracco, who has moved from one toxic relationship as Tony Soprano’s shrink to another as mother to the most unpleasant American living in Britain (a hotly contested title). We see Bracco only on Renkow’s laptop, exhorting her son to get on with his life in the hoarsely captivating voice that still reduces me to jelly even when she is speaking such unsexy words as: “I can tell you as the world’s leading authority on cerebral palsy, that being a pussy is not a symptom.” And yet, despite this sensible advice, Tim remains a pussy and a jerk: he is never going to get a worthwhile job, a date or a visa with those twin attributes.Part of the pleasure of the opening episode is watching Renkow do everything he can to get fired, knowing that his bosses will do all they can to keep him on the payroll. “I think I’m on some sort of quota scheme, so they don’t have to hire a transsexual,” he muses sourly.In this, Renkow is akin to George Costanza in the Seinfeld episode in which he feigned disability to get preferential treatment (including the keys to the executive washroom), knowingly exploiting bosses’ awkwardness about disability. But, while Costanza was a phoney asshole working a guilt-ridden system to his advantage, Renkow is no phoney, but all asshole. When Sean asks Tim if he has any special needs, he demands a chair made of salmon leather, new shoes and a bigger desk. Bigger than hers, he says, pointing at Anne who sits opposite.Of course, it is wrong of him to mutate into Nigel Farage with nice but invertebrate Anne. When she breastfeeds her baby in the office, he sarcastically complains: “I didn’t think you could eat lunch at your desk.” Less wrong of him to suggest a new line for her greeting card. “Hello baby! Bye-bye wallet,” she suggests. “Bye-bye perineum,” he counters.How can disability be funny? Jerk suggests one way, not by making us laughing at disability (that, as you know, is wrong), but by exploiting the comic potential of a situation in which a jerk uses their disability to yank someone’s chain. Renkow gets his kicks from making others feel bad about his disability. Typical is the opening gag in which a man comes out of a cafe’s disabled toilet to be confronted by Renkow, who has thrown a glass of water over his crotch and gives his adversary a how-could-you? stare.The first episode is mostly a delight, although Renkow could have made more of the scene in which he struggles to get his walking frame into the office through the only entrance, a set of rotating doors. Also delightful are the two sidekicks Renkow and his co-writers Shaun Pye and Stu Richards have created. Idris is a geek who tries and largely fails to be Tim’s employment consultant (there is literally nobody on British TV less like Idris Elba than him), and my other new hero is Ruth, Tom’s epically careless care-worker. Ruth is a bigger jerk than the eponymous jerk himself, getting one client (Renkow) to make her sandwiches while she chillaxes, deferring her visit to another, incontinent, client. “You’re so emotionally retarded,” he tells Ruth. “Tim,” she replies tartly. “You know we don’t use that word.” “Sorry. You’re not emotional.” “Thank you,” she replies. Just possibly, the jerk has met his match."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/86cd6f170fd3ccb02bf3fdb61ec4c595fe453e46/0_544_3744_2246/master/3744.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=45832ba556c241c3939b6970335325fe","title":"sara cox im at the top of a mountain im like dont dick it up","story":"Sara Cox was the party poster girl of the 90s who charmed millions with her Radio 1 show. After a few rocky years, she’s now at Radio 2 and has written a memoir about her rural childhoodShortly after I meet Sara Cox she wriggles under a sofa where her two dogs are trying to eat something they shouldn’t, but carries on talking in a muffled voice, apparently perfectly happy to continue the interview from the jaws of a slobbering animal. Given that we’re in a London photo studio, I could be slightly surprised by a TV and radio presenter who’s just had her hair and makeup done writhing on the floor, but as I’ve read her new memoir, Till the Cows Come Home, I’m not. And since I’ve also been listening to her brand new drivetime show on Radio 2, where she regales listeners with stories such as the time she accidentally took her daughter’s swimming costume to the pool – it turned out to be age 10, not size 10 – but stuffed herself into it to save a wasted journey, this seems perfectly normal. “I don’t know if you’ve seen a pork loin with string around it in the supermarket? I’ll just leave that thought there,” as she said on air.If you’re a woman who came of age in 1990s Britain, watching Sara Cox and her best friend Zoe Ball take over the media, presenting radio and TV shows with witty, breathless, irreverent chat, it is immensely difficult not to love her. We were gripped, watching the pair of them adventure their way on to the front page of the tabloids with a drink in one hand and a male conquest in the other – it was a whole new way of being female in public life. And while Ball was from a TV family, Coxy was straight out of working-class Bolton, having only got into media after being scouted for a bit of teenage modelling, which then led to co-hosting The Girlie Show when they found out she could talk.Yet her memoir is not a tell-all of those Met Bar years, when the stars of 1990s London all seemed to squeeze into one small drinking hole on Park Lane, but in fact the story of the previous 20, when she grew up the youngest of five children on a 40-acre tenanted farm in Lancashire. The book is like a big warm hug, full of local characters and misadventures, as well as hard graft and slaughter, with her parents working in haulage, cleaning and pubs, as well as on the farm. It’s also almost a work of social history, despite its author being only in her 40s. I mean, perhaps there are still children who dress in chiffon costumes on Bolton carnival floats while the mams swig vodka from ornamental teacups and the confused float driver accidentally hurtles them all off down a dual carriageway, and perhaps there are still English children who herd escaped cattle while dressed in a nightie and wellies, or swap eggs for shotguns, or are allowed to walk their own dog home when it breaks into the school again, all without a mobile phone in sight. But I doubt it.Coxy has written this partly as a love letter to her parents and grandparents, and so her three well-spoken children, with their very different London lives, will know where they come from. Her eldest, 14-year-old Lola, is a big reader who “just thinks it’s so mega that there’s a book with my name on it. But my biggest fear,” she says, “is that people are going to go, what makes Sara Cox think that she can write a book? Who does she think she is?”Given that she has a clear way with words and used to lie in her bunk bed reading Shakespeare aloud with her sister, I don’t think it’s her lyricism that’s in doubt. (In the book she describes a teenage outfit of hers “like Bet Lynch after she’d been run over by a council gritter”.) But the book’s publication has only happened to coincide with her big new job on Radio 2 – it was planned long before, when she wasn’t sure what was going on in her career. In fact, when her third child, Renee, was a baby, seven years ago, Coxy says she felt “like the squirrel with the nut at the start of Ice Age, trying to cling on to the ledge of my career. I feel like I’ve got to the top of a mountain now, like I’ve conquered it. But I’ve been working towards this for so long I’m like, crikey, God, I’ve got it! Don’t dick it up!”During the wilderness years, she would sometimes get in a London black cab and the driver would say, “Oi, Coxy, you still on the radio?” and she’d steel herself to reply, “Yes, every Saturday night at 10pm.” She got very good at body combat workouts – “Obviously I had a lot of anger.” (She favours pilates and cycling into work nowadays.) It was Davina McCall who rescued her, even though they weren’t close then, because Davina is apparently the last person in England who can actually use a phone.“The thing with Davina is, right, if you text her, she’ll fucking ring you. Which is really scary, because sometimes you just want to be lazy and chicken and say, “I’m feeling really shit about myself,” and you want just a nice text and some emojis back. But I think because of what she’s been through, Davina will make you confront how you’re feeling, and so you’re staring at her number coming up – and I call her Dave on my phone so it says DAVE RINGING – and you’re like, oh God…”Davina put Coxy on to a life coach called Michael Heppell. He made her work on an exercise where you imagine segments of a beach ball as the fundamental aspects of your life. She told him about her husband, Ben Cyzer, who works in digital advertising. “All my happiness and support with the kids and Ben was all fully inflated,” she says. (She was married before, to the DJ Jon Carter, with whom she had her first child, “and everybody who’s been through one marriage knows that, when it works a second time, you’re just so grateful. Ben is amazing and hilarious and he’s my other half, he’s my second chance.”) But the rest of her beach ball “was like somebody had taken a steak knife to it. And then I realised that, as much as I’m ambitious and a career woman, I’d happily take that, my personal side being fully inflated, rather than being really unhappy at home but a billionaire at work.”I wonder if her fear has its roots in the bullying she suffered at school, where two girls humiliated and hurt her on a daily basis. She writes that she’d like to travel back in time “to tell the 12-year-old me to retaliate. To push back. I was a strong girl from lugging buckets of water and bales of hay and probably could’ve battered them. But I didn’t.” (Of course, this being her, never more than two seconds from a joke, she then adds: “While I was at it, I’d also tell myself to maybe rethink the spiral perms.”)Yet, in a delicious twist of fate, the chief bully decided to text into the BBC Radio 1 Breakfast Show years later, when Coxy was the presenter, asking for a “shout-out”. “She got her shout-out all right,” she writes, in a rare flash-forward to the noughties, “though not the one she was expecting”. She tells me that she wouldn’t do it now. “I’d be much more grown up. But it was still much more raw then. I remember feeling myself just grow in stature and power, that very second – it was like in Honey, I Blew Up the Kid. I can’t remember what I said, but I was horrible.”That boldness would continue, with Sara Cox always taking things a little further than other BBC presenters. She got an official reprimand for wishing the Queen Mother a happy 100th birthday with, “Ah, she smells of wee, but we all love her.” (“I can’t talk about that, Sophie, please don’t,” she says, swallowing a guilty laugh. “They might have forgotten about it.”) I tell her I remember her playing Murder on the Dancefloor by Sophie Ellis-Bextor and then idly asking listeners to phone in with how they would murder that singer on the dancefloor. She is comically appalled, says it didn’t happen, then admits it probably did.“I mean, I remember very little,” she says. In fact, this is why she didn’t write the Met Bar memoir – she says she has forgotten most of it, and that what remains would involve “a lot of back and forth with lawyers, and a lot of people hating me. I think my peak 90s moment was posing on a Harley-Davidson outside the Met Bar with Wyclef Jean. There was a lot of Donna Air and the Appleton sisters and hanging out in Essex with the Prodigy and stuff. And Zoe, of course. But I’ve got no interest in writing that at all and I don’t think anyone would want to read it apart from you.”I am so far in disagreement I’m on the verge of offering to write it myself. Tell us what the Met Bar was like, at least.“Really small, with a dancefloor about the size of a Jacob’s cream cracker. I did dance in there, but it was more about talking loudly over each other and wanging on and general misbehaviour. Maybe you’d get Kate Moss occasionally. And it was part of the politan Hotel so you’d also get a few confused businessmen from Stuttgart over for a conference, who were probably thinking: ‘What the fuck are these 20-odd year olds doing running around and screeching?’ But it’s kind of to be celebrated. No bugger bothers to invite me to anything nowadays, because I’m like: ‘Will it be done by eight? Is it seated?’”And thus she has found her perfect home at Radio 2, the new headquarters of people who used to be cool but now enjoy a comfortable chair. Since January, Zoe Ball has presented the breakfast show and Sara Cox the drivetime one from 5-7pm (Steve Wright and Jo Whiley are also on the daily schedule – it’s like the whole of Radio 1 shifted across.) “We’ve totally Benjamin Buttoned the entire nation and sent them back to their teens,” she says happily. (If there was a Nobel Prize for the rapid deployment of pop culture allegories, Coxy would be its laureate.) “The first week of the show was – babies’ births and one of my marriages aside – the happiest week of my life.”But are there still people in her world who think they’re a bit edgy, who refuse to make the leap to Radio 2?“Oh yes, and I’ve had a few tweets from people saying: ‘OK, I’ve made the leap, you’ve got me now,’ but also from people saying they need a Radio 1.5, you know, like a panda-breeding programme where we slowly introduce them to Radio 2. But I don’t think we need it now because Radio 2 already sounds quite different from a couple of months ago.”A music team decides the playlist, “but I’ve got one of their mobile numbers now, which may or may not be good for him, because suddenly I’ll text saying: ‘Please can I play the KLF with Tammy Wynette?’ and he’ll go: “Oh Christ, OK then.’ But they’ve got a tough job to do because there are so many decades of amazing music out there. If it was up to me I’d play Beyoncé, Whitney and Minnie Riperton – just my birthing CD.”Did she use the same birthing CD for all three babies, I wonder. “Well, I swapped husbands between,” she replies breezily, “so I thought it deserved a remix at least.”With advice like this – change your birthing CD when you change your husband – she could have filled another sort of book altogether, since other publishers have asked her to write “a wacky mum’s handbook about how to be a bit crap at being a mum”. She makes a face. “I’m not a big fan of those ‘I’ve pushed a baby through my cervix so pass me my laptop, I’m now an expert and I’m going to do a clothing range as well’ types. I hate that kind of celebby advice book. Loads of women have had babies, love, you’re not unique – there’s one right now, crowning.”At the risk of sounding as cheesy as those publishers, I am curious about how she made her second marriage work. “We like being nice to each other and I think that’s really important in a marriage. You want to make each other happy and you want to do nice things for each other, whether it’s, you know, making a brew or being the ones to go and put the dogs away. Every weekend, he’s schlepping around, picking up the kids, driving them places and he doesn’t begrudge it, and that is just so attractive in a man. He never fails to step up.”Besides which, their bedroom is arranged so Ben sleeps nearest the door, “which was accidental, but actually it’s brilliant because the kids get to him first if they wake up in the night. He’s the speedbump they have to get over to get to me.”She still dreams of returning to the countryside, but he’s a born Londoner and they love their house in Willesden too much. Some years ago she walked out of a trendy London hairdressers, only to spot a big old lorry trying to navigate a tight bend in Fitzrovia. Having spent every school holiday accompanying her dad on his delivery wagon (where they would listen in hushed reverence to Radio 2), she found herself directing this driver, using hand signals, shouting out, “To me, to me, whoa,” until she’d got him round the corner. “It never leaves you. I take these tiny dogs for a walk but, in my head, I’m getting a horse in from the field. I’m always trying to get back towards some sort of farm-type life. Always trying to swim upstream.”In this extract from her book, Sara Cox comes down to earth with a bang“Just jump!” So I did. It didn’t go well. Let me explain. I was perched on the end of the loft platform in the barn on the farm where we lived. It was summer, just before haymaking when all the lovely fresh hay would be brought in by an army of pals and helpers, fuelled by tea.Now, though, the barn was almost empty save for a few old bales on the dusty floor and a pile of half a dozen or so right next to the loft. These were to be my crash mat. All I had to do was launch myself from my position and push away from the wall, gliding majestically on to the scratchy landing below. It was a drop of perhaps 8ft, but to my seven-year-old mind the chasm below might as well have been the Grand Canyon. Or, seeing as this was Bolton, the “Reet Grand Canyon”.My older sister Yvonne was the one encouraging me to jump. I was grateful that she was playing with me so I was keen to impress. As the youngest of five I was used to being a walking, talking booby prize to my older siblings. An unwelcome addition.Back then I was half girl, half forehead – a trait that was a target for classmates, both figuratively, with a plethora of nicknames (slaphead, fivehead, fodder), and literally, as they’d heartily slap it while running past, high-fiving my fivehead. So the fact my sister had agreed to hang out with me and my forehead was a big deal. Sure, the downside was she wanted me to jump to certain death for her own amusement, but at least I’d die knowing I wasn’t a chicken.I took a deep breath. I jumped. I didn’t push away from the platform, though, I sort of nudged my bottom over the edge, so instead of springing away from the wall I slid down it like a blob of custard dripping down a kitchen tile.In fact, I stuck so closely to the wall that I didn’t even make it on to the bales below but tumbled between them and the wall, like a lost mitten down the back of a radiator. I looked up to see my sister’s horrified face frozen in a grimace – part sympathy, part worry in case I grassed her up to Mum.The good news was I didn’t die. The only evidence of my misjudged jump was the two red raw tramlines down my back that made me look like I’d been mowed down by a joyrider in a Silver Cross pram.Extracted from Till the Cows Come Home (Hodder \u0026amp Stoughton, £18.99).

The UK has made important progress in this regard in April 2017, it enjoyed its first full day without any coal-fired electricity since the 1880s, which was a striking achievement for a country that had been at the vanguard of the Industrial Revolution.As the prime minister, Theresa May, said last year: “We can be proud of our success in facing up to the reality of climate change, but we are not complacent about the action needed to sustain that success in the future.”The best way for any country to avoid climate complacency is to develop robust, holistic and people-centred policies across government, so short-term trade or financial priorities do not trump the wider imperative of cutting global emissions.The UK now faces a crucial opportunity to live up to the prime minister’s words and prove it is serious about phasing out the use of fossil fuels worldwide, and not only on its own territory.The UK parliament’s environmental audit committee is currently holding an inquiry into UK Export Finance’s (UKEF) financing of fossil fuels in developing countries. This government agency provides financial support for international trade with the aim of boosting British companies’ exports.Over the longer timeframe of 2010-16, it is estimated that UKEF provided £4.8bn of support for fossil fuel projects. The UK’s total spend on its International Climate Fund for a similar period, 2011-17, was £4.9bn.These figures and policies are hard to reconcile with the UK’s commitments under the Paris agreement, its membership of the Powering Past Coal Alliance and its own pledge in 2013 to end support for public financing of new coal-fired power plants overseas.They are also at odds with the view of the governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, who warned in 2014 of the stranded asset risk inherent in fossil fuel projects.The time has come for the UK to change course, in the interests of the whole world.But as the recent report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change set out so starkly, our target must be 1.5C if we want to avert irreparable damage to our planetary ecosystem – so even more radical action against fossil fuels is required.Meeting these challenges can only be done collectively, in a spirit of international and intergenerational solidarity under the framework of the United Nations.I was UN secretary general when the Paris agreement was signed, and the sustainable development goals agreed. I valued the UK’s contributions and commitment to both these vital multilateral achievements, and continue to believe the country can play a transformative role in shaping the global climate agenda.As deputy chair of the Elders I continue to call on G20 nations to move away from fossil fuel investment, and I believe the UK can play a leading role in this crucial move.I encourage the UK government to recalibrate its export finance policy so it is fully consistent with international climate trends and obligations.Promoting fossil fuel investments abroad locks in high-carbon infrastructure in developing countries for years to come, which is the opposite of sustainable development.There is now a growing consensus that fossil fuels should not be funded in any way by export finance organisations.The World Bank Group has already ended its finance to upstream oil and gas the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development recently ended finance to coal and the Swedish Export Credit Corporation has announced it is going fully fossil-free.UKEF and the wider UK government should use the occasion of the parliamentary inquiry to demonstrate a clear shift in policy away from fossil fuels and use its investments to support clean energy.If the UK takes these necessary steps, it can be at the forefront of the transition to a low-carbon economy. I look forward to seeing its government, industries and people rising to this challenge."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/15935ea32ef788b4008707937caeb4dc8b57941d/0_5_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0b3d28e163dce52cb57763b3f861d7f0","title":"okinawa referendum rejects new us military base but abe likely to press on","story":"Tokyo sees controversial plan for new base at Henoko as key to US security alliance Voters on the southern Japanese island of Okinawa have rejected the controversial relocation of a US military base in a referendum, according to local media, but the result is likely to be ignored by the prime minister, Shinzo Abe.Kyodo news agency said its projection based on exit polls indicated that more than a quarter of Okinawa’s 1.16 million eligible voters had opposed the plan: a threshold that requires the island’s governor, Denny Tamaki, to “respect” its outcome. The public broadcaster NHK said a majority of voters had come out against the move supported by the Japanese and US governments.Sunday’s non-binding referendum asked voters if they opposed, supported or held neither opinion on the construction of a military base in Henoko, a fishing village on the island’s northeast coast that is home to coral reefs and one of the few remaining habitats of the dugong.The new facility is supposed to replace the marines’ Futenma airbase, located in the middle of a densely populated city on the island. Futenma has attracted complaints about crimes committed by service personnel, noise and the threat of aircraft accidents in an area close to homes and schools.Critics say the Henoko base will destroy the area’s delicate marine ecosystem and threaten the safety of 2,000 residents living near the site.Opposition to the US military presence on Okinawa surged after the 1995 abduction and rape and abduction of a 12-year-old girl by three US servicemen.A year later, Tokyo and Washington agreed to reduce the US military footprint on Okinawa by closing Futenma and relocating its functions to Henoko. But most Okinawans want the new base to be built elsewhere in Japan.Some voters complained that the government in Tokyo had routinely ignored their objections to the presence of US military personnel and bases.“There are so many American troops here. Of course, ninety-nine percent of them are good people, but then there is that one percent who do bad things. It’s hard for us,” Tomomichi Shimabukuro, who runs a seaside inn, said ahead of the vote.Political and legal challenges to construction work at Henoko have irritated US officials, who insist that marines are needed on Okinawa to respond to crises in potential regional flashpoints in the South and East China seas, as well as the emergence of a nuclear-armed North Korea.Abe has claimed the replacement base is the only way of easing pressure on residents living near the Futenma base while maintaining Japan’s commitment to its security alliance with the US.While the “no” vote is not legally binding, the government risks accusations of dismissing local sentiment out of hand if it continues with land reclamation work in the sea off Henoko.Jun Shimabukuro, a professor at the University of the Ryukyus in Okinawa, said the referendum was an important opportunity for the island’s residents to make their voices heard. “It can be a test to gauge if democracy is working in Japan,” Shimabukuro said ahead of the vote.Tamaki, who was elected last September vowing to oppose the base relocation, described the vote as a “precious” opportunity to communicate Okinawa’s opposition to the central government.Col John Hutcheson, a spokesman for US Forces Japan, said the relocation plan would enable the US military to close Futenma while protecting “vital capabilities” to ensure regional security.“We are committed to maintaining good relations with local communities on Okinawa and do our best every day to balance their concerns with the necessity to maintain readiness in support of our treaty commitments,” Hutcheson said, while declining to comment directly on the referendum."},{"url":null,"title":"clarion call sounds over university literacy standards","story":"Lecturer Greg Foley could scarcely believe what he was seeing when marking his students’ lab reports recently.“Some of the stuff I was grading was the worst I’d ever seen – even from good students. They just couldn’t see the rubbish they were handing up,” says Foley, an associate professor at Dublin City University’s school of biotechnology.“Despite explicit instructions, I got graphs with no labels or units tables not labelled. They were putting capital letters in the middle of sentences, commas where there should be full stops. It was almost as if they were word blind.”So, Foley wasn’t in the least surprised when a senior official at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) expressed concern last week at a “huge drop” in literacy standards among Irish university graduates.Dirk Van Damme, a senior official at the OECD’s directorate for education and skills, said latest data showed up to 6 per cent of graduates were functionally illiterate.These rates, contained in an OECD study,were significantly higher than in Finland (2 per cent) or the Netherlands (3 per cent), though similar to the UK (7 per cent).Low levels of basic literacy, or functional illiteracy, refer to reading and writing skills that are “inadequate to manage daily living and employment tasks that require reading skills beyond a basic level”.In addition, the data – collected in 2012 – showed only 19 per cent of university graduates in Ireland reached higher levels of numeracy.This was significantly lower than in countries such as Finland (37 per cent), the Netherlands (35 per cent) and England (25 per cent).Low skillsMr Van Damme said the figures were “not good for Ireland” and indicated that university qualifications were not necessarily a guarantee against very low skills .The findings come on the back of recent studies which show drop-out rates in some low entry point courses of up to 80 per cent, and an ongoing debate about whether Ireland is sending too many school leavers to third-level courses.The data also poses several searching questions for the higher education system, as well as the Government whose aim is to ensure Ireland has the “best education and training system in Europe” by 2026.So, what is driving this apparent decline in literacy and numeracy standards? Is is really something we should we worried about? What impact does this have on the status of a third level degree. And what can we do to shore-up standards?Brendan Guilfoyle, a maths lecturer at IT Tralee, doesn’t hold back when asked to describe numeracy standards among students over recent years.“Within my subject, there has been a catastrophic collapse in numeracy,” he says. We now do Junior Cert maths for the first semester we have to ensure basic numeracy is there if they are to continue. We start at a low level, literally adding fractions, to get them to a level where they are comfortable.”He feels the single biggest reason behind falling standards is the huge expansion in numbers going to third level.It is estimated that almost 60 per cent of school leavers in Ireland go to college, one of the highest levels in Europe. This compares to about 30 per cent in countries such Germany.While policymakers see this as a positive and a calling card for attracting foreign direct investment, Guilfoyle feels it is misguided.“Third level institutions are taking in way too many academically unprepared students into what are essentially academic degrees,” he says.“Apprenticeships have collapsed so students feel they have to go to a one-size-fits-all third level . . . institutes of technology have had mission drift and are trying to make themselves look more like universities, when what’s really needed are more vocational, apprenticeship-type options.”Lower pointsMore students are accessing third level on lower points nowadays. Colleges have responded by providing maths and writing support to help shore-up standards.Dr Anna Kelly, director of UCD’s access and lifelong learning, however, is firmly in favour of expanding third level for equality reasons, especially to students from poorer backgrounds.She insists higher education remains highly competitive, with demand exceeding the supply of places. Special access routes for people from disadvantaged backgrounds – where students can secure places in courses at 20 per cent below regular CAO entry points – are fought over.“These pathways are highly competitive. Sometimes, when people talk about the massification of third level, they think we’ve simply opened the doors. But the evidence isn’t there to back it up. We have far more students than we have places.”She says at UCD they have a threshold of about 300-320 points which a student needs to score to manage at university.“Anything less than that and we’re not doing them any favours, because courses are intricate, complex and demanding.”Official data compiled by the Higher Education Authority backs this up: the strongest predictor of non-progression is prior educational attainment.A student with less than 250 points is almost twice as likely to drop out of their course compared to a student entering with 305-350 points.There is also , says Guilfoyle, a strong financial incentive for colleges to take on students on low points, regardless of how they perform. In addition, he says, colleges are incentivised – at all costs – to ensure students progress through college. In fact, some face financial penalties if they do not improve student progression rates.Global questionsThe fact that there are concerns over graduates’ basic literacy or numeracy raises troubling questions over the value of a college degree. These are questions being asked globally, not just in Ireland.Dirke Van Damme of the OECD says figures show a university degree is not a guarantee against very low skills.“The fact that we have more higher education graduates does not mean that the economy and society is well served by the skills they need,” he told The .He says some large firms, such as Ernst \u0026amp Young, no longer look at university qualifications in recruiting staff, because “there’s no evidence university equals success”.“Universities still ask unconditional confidence in their assessment function and for disciplinary, technical skills they probably have good arguments,” says Van Damme. “But for generic skills, things are less clear.”Despite the warnings, Irish employers’ surveys indicate that most are broadly happy with the standard of third-level graduates.A 2019 study shows a total of 84 per cent of employers said they were satisfied with the standard of graduates’ written communication, though it dropped to 66 per cent in the ICT sector.However, Tony Donohoe of employer’s group Ibec says standards such as writing are a concern in some sectors, with a growing number of businesses unhappy at falling standards among staff.“Accurate communication makes good business sense and reflects credibility and attention to detail, especially in emails and letters where the tone and culture of a business is set,” says Donohoe.Foley feels standards generally at third level have lowered and worries that higher education is turning into an extended form of secondary school. He believes several factors are at play, such as poor student engagement, an almost unconscious dumbing down and shortened attention s triggered by use of digital technology.“We’ve lowered our expectations so much that we tolerate poor work from students . . . and I am as bad as anyone. I could have failed two-thirds of my class in a module earlier this year.“But there has been a dumbing down. It hasn’t been an edict from on high, but there is a prevailing sense of exasperation from lecturers and it’s very hard to hold the line against it.

These are prime wildlife areas protected by EU legislation as they are deemed to be of European as well as Irish importance.Both Minister for Agriculture Michael Creed and Minister for Heritage Josepha Madigan have been questioned in the Dáil about “widespread concerns” over works at the farm.Department of Agriculture records, released under Freedom of Information, show an official travelled there on April 20th last year after it was alerted to a “number of issues”.‘Unauthorised activity’In a letter dated June 26th, a department official told his colleague in the specialised farm ision that he found “unauthorised activity” on the protected land during the unannounced visit.“The scale of the work exceeds the thresholds stated in the EIA (Environmental Impact Assessment) regulations, 2011, and was on a significantly larger scale than the work detailed in the submission of September 2017,” he wrote.An application was made to the Department in September 2017 for works on the farm.The National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS), which is responsible for protecting Ireland’s nature reserves and leases a section of Grianán known as Inch Wildfowl Reserve under a 30-year agreement since 2001, was asked for its opinion.The NPWS had no objections on the basis of the proposed works outlined in the application and providing the farm owner remains “fully compliant” with all regulations and statutory requirements.The department official said there was no record of any environmental impact statement having been prepared “and in my opinion, there has been a breach of the relevant legislation on the site concerned”.Offence with finesThe Environmental Impact Assessment Regulations 2011 require an assessment be carried out before any works commence, and a breach of the legislation constitutes an offence with fines of up to €250,000 on conviction.The official added: “Based on the evidence on the ground, I believe that the activities carried out on the site have been carried out without the requisite consent and there is no evidence to indicate that the NPWS were aware of the developments on the site.”Sinn Féin Senator Pádraig Mac Lochlainn, who lives nearby, said there was “widespread concern in the communities around this farm at the scale of what has happened and the impact on sensitive wildlife and the environment”.Karol McElhinney, a farmer and businessman who heads Glenmore Estate, said he did not know how many trees or hedgerows were removed as “it was a contractor who did it” but that everything was carried out with the required approval.“Anything we removed we got approval for, that needed approval,” he said.Mr McElhinney said any felling of trees and hedging was for “maintenance and health and safety” reasons.The Department of Agriculture said it was “currently investigating” a complaint about the “possible contravention of the EIA ( Agriculture Regulations) 2011.”The Department of Heritage, which oversees the NPWS, said concerns about the works were raised with it on three occasions.“On occasions where works were identified as requiring a licence or consent from a public authority the works were stopped by local NPWS staff,” said a spokeswoman.“On all such occasions, the land owner was informed of the consent required or the works reported to the relevant authority.”The spokeswoman added: “The department does and will continue to investigate any breaches of relevant legislation including the Wildlife Acts and the European Communities (Birds and Natural Habitats) Regulations 2011.”‘Some of these trees were maybe 80 years old’Malcolm Riddell knows every nook and cranny of the expansive lowlands reclaimed from Lough Swilly over a century and half, now known as Grianán Estate.Since setting up home at Burt, under the ancient Grianán hill fort, in 1974 he has watched over the once tidal mudflats, transformed by decades of engineering into Ireland’s largest arable farm.Swans, geese – Canada geese, greylags and even occasionally pink-footed geese – mingle with the small hedgerow birds that make the distinctive, stretching landscape one of Donegal’s most ecologically prized.“I noticed the new owners started clearing drains shortly after the new year - which I thought was a good thing, and I didn’t mind the hedgerows being trimmed back,” says the 73-year-old, who retired from Derry’s Housing Executive seven years ago.“But what really started to alarm, not only myself, but a lot of people who enjoy the wildlife here is when they started cutting down the trees as well – trees in the hedgerows rapidly disappeared along with the hedges.“Some of these trees were maybe 80 years old.”Owners Glenmore Estates, the Department of Agriculture, which issues consents for such works, and the National Parks and Wildlife Service, which leases a large section of the farm as a nature reserve, cannot or will not say how much was removed.However, Karol McElhinney, who heads Glenmore Estate, said everything was carried out with the required approval.“Anything we removed we got approval for, that needed approval,” he said.Mr Riddell believes hundreds of trees and miles of hedgerow have been torn out.Ashes, sycamores, birches, whitebeams and willows – known locally as “sallies”and which thrive in wetlands – are among the casualties.“The sallies were a big loss. They have loose bark on them, which cracks, giving insects places to live, and where small birds can then feed,” he says.“The place looked an absolute disaster, mounds of muck and soil, broken trees, pulled out trees. Hedges that had been cut lying everywhere. It looked as if the area would never be back to what it was.”For the first time in 44 years last spring, swans and geese that grazed the flatlands had moved elsewhere, says Mr Riddell. Neighbours say buzzards and otters have also been displaced.There has been some improvement since, he says.“The hedges will grow again, but it will take many a year – 15 or 20 years – before there is anything substantial there again.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3804032.1551044277!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"met %C3%A9ireann tells staff to look on the bright side of climate change","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t The Met Éireann advice suggest using metaphors such as ‘the weather on steroids’.

Photograph: AFPGetty ImagesThe EU can offer Britain “assurances” on the Brexit withdrawal deal but will not provide something which alters its fundamental shape, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has said. Mr Varadkar also said the timing of another vote on the deal in the House of Commons is “not under my control”.British prime minster Theresa May has postponed a vote that was due to take place this week until mid March, just weeks from Brexit day at the end of March. “For the European Union, that doesn’t change anything,” Mr Varadkar said at an EU-League of Arab States summit in Sharm el Sheikh, Egypt. “It doesn’t change anything from Ireland’s point of view either. “We are not playing chicken, we are not playing poker. We are just standing by our position which has been solid from day one.”The Taoiseach said any reassurances on the deal cannot “contradict the legal reality” of what has already been agreed. He will meet Mrs May and other EU leaders on the margins of the summit to discuss Brexit.At the centre of the continuing Brexit impasse is the backstop, the insurance policy to avoid a hard border if the EU and UK fail to agree a trade deal after Brexit which would keep the border open. The backstop would see the UK as a whole remain in a customs union with the EU, with add ons in both customs and regulations for Northern Ireland. Many Brexiteer MPs fear it could tie the UK permanently into the EU’s economic orbit, although it is only intended to remain in place “unless and until” a trade deal which keeps the border open is agreed. The difficulty in passing the Brexit withdrawal agreement, including the backstop, through the House of Commons has increased fears of a crash out, no deal Brexit at the end of March. TransitionAgreeing a deal would see the UK enter a transition phase until the end of 2020, although this could be extended. This would effectively maintain the status quo, with the UK staying in the European single market and customs union even as it is not a full EU member. “Let’s not forget this March 29 deadline is a self imposed deadline,” Mr Varadkar said. “It is one that the United Kingdom has imposed on itself. Nobody in Ireland or the EU is threatening no deal. This is a situation the UK has created for itself.”Mr Varadkar again ruled out a time limit or unilateral exit clause for the backstop, as has been pushed for by London. “The whole point of the backstop is to give us an assurance that we won’t see the emergence of a hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland, no matter what else happens as a consequence of Brexit.”When asked if an addendum to the withdrawal agreement could be drawn up to reassure the British government, the Taoiseach said: “The withdrawal agreement, including the Irish protocol and backstop, are not up for re-negotiation. “We’re happy to discuss with the United Kingdom assurances that they may need to have further confidence that the backstop if ever applied, will not be permanent. It will only apply unless and until something supersedes it. “So we are happy to talk about mechanisms to give them that reassurance that some of them need. However, we can’t agree to something that would contradict the legal reality or the spirit behind what has already been agreed.”He repeated that there are “no plans” for border checks with Northern Ireland in a no deal scenario. However, he said: “We do appreciate that in the event of a no deal we’ll be under obligation to protect the integrity of our single market, our customs union, which we are part of and intend to be a full member of.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Photograph: Getty Images Less than half of the customs officers planned to be hired to fill extra Brexit posts are in place ahead of the UK’s departure from the EU next month. Last July the Government said it was planning to staff an extra 700 customs to ports and airports, as well as hiring 300 extra veterinary inspectors. Some 270 Brexit customs positions would be filled through an open recruitment process. However, figures from the Revenue Commissioners show despite 3,030 applications under the recruitment process, just 77 new customs officials had been hired by the end of last month. Figures up to February 22nd show 117 customs officers have been hired as part of the recruitment campaign. The recruitment figures were released to The  following requests under the Freedom of Information Act. A spokesman for the Revenue Commissioners said the recruitment effort was ongoing, and iniduals from the 3,030 who applied were still being drawn down for posts from panels. The figures do not include an extra 130 staff that were redeployed to customs positions in preparation for Brexit from other departments or appointed following internal competitions. These staff bring the total number of additional customs officials hired in preparation for Brexit to more than 250. Revenue is “on track” to have recruited over 400 extra staff by the end of March, the spokesman said. Revenue has also hired extra staff to fill vacancies where officials had been redeployed to Brexit-related roles. Separately, only a quarter of Irish businesses that trade with the UK have registered for custom numbers with Revenue, a requirement to trade with non-EU countries. In recent weeks Revenue has written to over 70,000 businesses that trade with the UK, advising them of the need to register, if they wish to continue trading with Britain post-Brexit. Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, Heather Humphreys called on firms to avoid putting off the registration process, which can be done online. “So far around one in four businesses in Ireland that trade with the UK have registered with Revenue. With just five weeks to go to Brexit, I am strongly urging the remaining three-quarters or so of firms to sign up,” she said. “Be they a local retailer who buys their fresh and frozen goods from a UK supplier, or a restaurant owner who sources key ingredients from the UK, they will need their number to protect their business from delays and other Brexit impacts,” Ms Humphreys said. On Monday Ms Humphreys will announce a series of free one-day customs training sessions, that businesses can avail of at local enterprise offices across the country.

Photograph: Khaled ElfiqiEPABritish prime minister Theresa May has admitted she will not get a new Brexit proposal in time for MPs to hold a “meaningful vote” this week, amid warnings time is running out for an agreement before Britain leaves the European Union. Mrs May on Sunday delayed the vote until March 12th, 17 days before Britain is to leave the EU, as her ministers threatened to take control of the exit timetable. Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said: “For the European Union, that doesn’t change anything.” Speaking at the EU-Arab League summit in the Egyptian resort of Sharm el-Sheikh, he added: “It doesn’t change anything from Ireland’s point of view either.”The Taoiseach is due to meet Mrs May and other EU leaders at the margins of the summit. Speaking on her way to Egypt, Mrs said she would continue the “positive talks” with the EU this week and, as a result, the vote would be delayed. “We still have it within our grasp to leave the EU with a deal on 29th March,” she said.As a way to break the impasse remains unclear, reports last night suggested support in EU circles for a long extension of the Article 50 period, possibly delaying the UK’s departure until 2021.However, senior Brussels sources dismissed these reports as inaccurate. reported this lengthy extension was favoured over a short extension to allow for plans on the future relationship to be developed and make redundant the backstop, the insurance policy to prevent a hard border on the island of Ireland. Mr Varadkar said the EU can offer Britain “assurances” on the Brexit withdrawal deal but will not provide something which alters its fundamental shape. The Taoiseach said any reassurances on the deal cannot “contradict the legal reality” of what has already been agreed. Mr Varadkar again ruled out a time limit or unilateral exit clause for the backstop, as has been pushed for by London. “The whole point of the backstop is to give us an assurance that we won’t see the emergence of a hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland, no matter what else happens as a consequence of Brexit.”‘Not up for renegotiation’When asked if an addendum to the withdrawal agreement could be drawn up to reassure the British government, the Taoiseach replied: “The withdrawal agreement, including the Irish protocol and backstop, are not up for renegotiation.“We’re happy to discuss with the United Kingdom assurances that they may need to have further confidence that the backstop, if ever applied, will not be permanent.

However, we can’t agree to something that would contradict the legal reality or the spirit behind what has already been agreed.”The deadline Mrs May has set for the meaningful vote is an attempt to circumvent MPs’ attempts to extend Brexit talks. A proposal by Labour’s Yvette Cooper, which parliament is due to debate on Wednesday, would give MPs the ability to seek an extension to the Article 50 exit process if no deal has been approved by parliament by March 13th. Responding to the vote delay, Labour party leader Jeremy Corbyn said Mrs May was “putting the country at risk by recklessly running down the clock to force MPs to choose between her bad deal and a disastrous no deal”. The European Parliament’s Brexit chief, Guy Verhofstadt, tweeted: “I have seen many surprising decisions in a lifetime in politics. But this is close to being one of the most reckless.” Austrian chancellor Sebastian Kurz told reporters at the summit: “If by the beginning of March there’s no support for the deal then I think it would be good to postpone Brexit because a no-deal scenario is bad for the EU but extremely bad for the UK.” – Additional reporting Financial Times Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Video: Fianna Fáil\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t‘We have to accept the harsh reality of this very moment,’ Micheál Martin told delegates at the Fianna Fáil ardfheis. Photograph: Stephen CollinsCollinsBut enough of the past.Stuffed on a massive feed of Seán Lemass, Éamon de Valera and the founding fathers of Fianna Fáil, the contented delegates sat back in their seats, popped a waistband button and prepared for galloping indigestion to return.The present day, not so palatable.Oh, but they could have feasted for ever on the songs and stories of the good old days (is there anything to be said for another quivery clip from Dev?) and never stopped swapping yarns of more recent nights when it felt like they owned the entire world and not just every sweaty inch of public space in the sprawling Citywest complex.Born to it, they reminded themselves on Saturday night with loads of stirring, comforting newsreel incontrovertibly placing their party – not those showy late arrivals from Sinn Féin – at the scene of the birth of the nation.“Fianna Fáil – The Republican Party.” That time-honoured slogan, with its well worn “An Ireland for All” tag line, was writ large on the platform when the current leader came to administer a dose of political reality after the nostalgic wallow.“Fianna Fáil – The Responsible Party. Tolerating Fine Gael in the National Interest” is what it should have read.This was the thrust of Micheál Martin’s message and also the main reason why his troops, despite all those soothing shots of history, were feeling somewhat dyspeptic at their 79th ardfheis.Keeping a Fine Gael government in power through a confidence-and-supply agreement is proving increasingly hard for them to stomach. They’ve tolerated two years of it now, and the thought of enabling a cast of cocky Blueshirt pups to run their country for much longer has them all feeling distinctly queasy.So in what amounted to a “bear with me” speech, Micheál had to persuade them to persevere, no matter how much it might stick in the craw. He told them he feels their pain and, if it’s any consolation, he would love to give Fine Gael the order of the boot. It’s in his power to pull the plug, but he can’t. The “massive risk” involved in triggering a general election while Brexit still remains such a threat to Ireland is too big a price to pay.“In normal times, there would be no question about what should happen to this government, but we have to accept the harsh reality of this very moment,” he told delegates, aware of the other harsh reality that if he doesn’t convince them to back his agreement with Fine Gael, they may pull the plug on him.National interestHaving spent the evening enjoying a “special 1919 commemoration”, Micheál plunged his audience straight back into history, invoking the names of the Fianna Fáil greats, from “the first chairperson, Constance Markiewicz”, to bolster his argument that they must do the right thing. “It’s a difficult decision for us, but it’s the right decision and it reinforces the fact that Fianna Fáil is putting the national interest first.”There was loud and virtuous applause from the faithful, who were really clapping themselves, their selflessness and commitment to country. Given their visceral hatred of all things Fine Gael, endorsing Micheál’s confidence-and-supply arrangement a little while longer was the most heroic thing these dyed-in-the wool Fianna Fáilers could do apart from dying for Ireland.This was only a one-day ardfheis, but one day is enough for anyone. It began with Cork TD Billy Kelleher plastering the long, private approach road to the hotel with election posters urging party members in Ireland South to vote for him in the forthcoming European election selection convention. He had more posters inside the building – full length and in your face.Micheál Martin said last week that he would prefer if Kelleher ran again for the Dáil instead of looking for a seat in Europe. He laughed off suggestions that his TD for Cork North Central had given a resounding two fingers to that suggestion.As for Billy, he acted the wide-eye innocent all day as smiling delegates sidled over to tell him he was an awful man altogether for putting it up to Micheál like that.An elderly man cornered him outside the session on affordable housing, grabbing his hand. “Jaysus, you’re a terrible hoor! Fair fucks to ya!” Billy looked at him. “Wha’? I thought everyone was putting up posters, like.”Old and youngThe 1919 commemoration was hosted by Éamon Ó Cuív, grandson of Éamon de Valera. Not that he makes a big thing about it or anything. Ronan McGreevy of The  spoke at length about the Seán Lemass tapes. St James’s Brass and Reed Band from Dublin and the Bishopstown sign-language choir from Cork performed the national anthem to mark its 110th anniversary.The hall was like a sauna, full to capacity, with disappointed delegates left outside. The audience profile was on the elderly male side of mature, although there was also a large contingent from Ógra Fianna Fáil, all dressed to the nines. There seemed an unusually high turnout of teenage girls wearing glittery mini-dresses, but they wandered by mistake into the aftermath of the leader’s speech while trying to find where Romanian crooner Ovidiu Rusu, was performing. (Upstairs. Sold out.)From our vantage high up in the back, the amount of bald heads and grey hair was striking. Younger colleagues were highly amused by the number of old flip-phones and Nokia phones in use in our vicinity.Sea of blueThe much sought after warm-up speech slot went to rising star Lisa Chambers, who is the party’s Brexit spokesperson. The Nokia contingent were mightily impressed, even though Lisa is from Mayo and they had taken to quietly exclaiming “Up the Rebels” every so often. She appeared on stage in a striking white dress (perhaps in tribute to the nurses). “That’s the Chambers one,” said one of the Nokia lads. “Oh, that’s right” said flip-phone. “A lovely-looking girl. I think she’s very good.”To underline the gravity of the message, Micheál Martin burst into the hall without the usual loud blast of young people’s music. But everyone cheered anyway when he raced on to the stage. He was alone. Alone in a sea of blue, which may have been a metaphor.As he neared the end, perspiring from the heat, we scanned the front rows for likely platform athletes. Kevin O’Keeffe for Cork East looked a likely contender, head shining and sweating up like a horse before a big race. Then Robert Troy from Longford-Westmeath pulled on his jacket, which seemed unusual.The speech finished. Robert shot like a bullet from his chair and tore across to the steps with about five female politicians in hot pursuit. In the blink of an eye he was at his leader’s shoulder. But he barely managed to clap him on the back before being mown down by the women and relegated to the back of the scrum.As Brexit bears down on history, Micheál will soon find out if being the responsible party resonates with the nation’s voters and if tolerating Fine Gael in the national interest secures his future in the Fianna Fáil interest."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3803777.1551025029!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"third resignation from social democrats board following kisyombe controversy","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe departure of  three board members from the Social Democrats marks a deepening crisis for the party as it struggles to address issues around the candidacy of Ellie Kisyombe.

A party spokeswoman confirmed Mr Bond’s resignation, adding that there had been no further resignations from the executive board. The departure of the three board members marks a deepening crisis for the party as it struggles to address issues around the candidacy of Ellie Kisyombe. Allegations of inconsistencies in the background history of Ms Kisyombe surfaced last week in the Sunday Times newspaper. Ms Kisyombe is originally from Malawi and has spoken of her experience of living in the direct provision system for much of the last decade. The party has become sharply ided over the issue after it was decided to conduct an internal review into her background. The decision to hold the review followed a discussion by the national executive that lasted several hours. It is understood that the national executive vote on the review was 9-2 in favour of carrying it out.Social Democrats co-leaders Catherine Murphy and Róisín Shortall raised concerns about the impact of the controversy, while other members are determined to stand by the candidate. Ms Kisyombe, who has lived for some years in the direct provision system, received considerable media attention when she announced her candidacy. It is understood the party has not yet discussed the planned review process with Ms Kisyombe. When contacted on Sunday she did not wish to comment on the controversy. The National Executive of the Social Democrats met on Sunday morning when Peter Tanham (Dún Laoghaire) was appointed as interim party chair and Sally Aquilina (Meath West) as interim party vice-chair.ConcernA spokeswoman for the Social Democrats said at the weekend that “the co-leaders wrote to the national executive and expressed concern at the allegation that there may be some inaccuracies in Ellie’s back story, while also appreciating the complexities and severe difficulties posed for those caught up in the asylum process”. “As a result, the national executive subsequently met and has decided to carry out a review to work through this with Ellie.”An email from party chairman Mr O’Connor, seen by The , states that he hoped to avoid the step.“However, I cannot stand over the decision made by the national executive last night, or how the party intends to proceed from here,” he said.“I believe we have been forced to view this issue through a narrow lens, and as a result seem intent on pursuing a course of action which I believe is wholly inconsistent with the interpretation of a majority of our members and supporters, and will as a result inflict irreparable damage to the party in my view.”Mr O’Connor wrote that alternatives to the course of action chosen by the Social Democrats were and are available, “if our response to this issue had not been framed with a pre-determined outcome from the start”.Ms Bailey, who is vice-chair of the party and a general election candidate for the party in Dublin South-West said she “cannot stand over a decision which includes a statement that will go to the media, which in effect could and will be construed as the party essentially abandoning a candidate and especially one so vulnerable as a person living in direct provision”.The issue has caused major ision within the party, with the Dublin Central branch on Saturday evening contacting members to affirm its support for Ms Kisyombe.“Dublin Central Social Democrats remain dedicated to supporting our friend Ellie Kisyombe’s candidacy, alongside Carol Deans, for local election and would be both honoured and proud to have such fine candidates represent the North Inner City, as new and erse voices for transformative politics.”Other tensionsThere are also significant tensions within the party over the decision to contest the upcoming European elections, with the co-leaders believed to hold reservations around the party challenging for an MEP seat. The matter has led to a strain between the party leadership and north inner city Dublin councillor Garry Gannon, who is actively pushing to contest the Dublin MEP constituency this May. Internally the party has said it would not be funding a European challenge, and any candidate would have to self-finance their own campaign.Mr Gannon and the party’s political director Anne-Marie McNally had previously stated their intention to contest the selection convention for the Dublin MEP race. However shortly afterwards Ms McNally withdrew her name from consideration. In a message to a private Facebook group of party members, Ms McNally said she decided against challenging for an MEP seat following “detailed conversations with experienced people whose judgement I trust”. She said both the financial cost of running a European election campaign, and the “party’s interests” were considerations in changing her mind, according to the message, seen by The . She said instead she would focus on running in the local elections, and challenging for a Dáil seat in the Dublin Mid-West constituency, in the event of a general election. Ms McNally previously worked as Ms Murphy’s parliamentary assistant. In relation to the European elections, a party spokeswoman said “the challenge for a party of our size is how to prioritise our resources.” A decision was taken by the national executive to open a selection process for a candidate for the Dublin constituency, she said. “A number of candidates have come forward and the internal selection process is underway,” the spokeswoman said."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3803496.1550937270!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"pope francis describes feminism as machismo with a skirt","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tPope Francis attending the third day of a summit at the Vatican on sex abuse in the Catholic Church. Photograph: AFPVatican media Pope Francis has described feminism as “machismo with a skirt” during a brief intervention at the four-day meeting on the protection of minors in the church which is taking place at the Vatican.Meanwhile, one of the church’s leading cardinals has admitted that files on clerical child abuse have been destroyed by bishops.Pope Francis made his comment about feminism in an off-the-cuff remark after hearing an address from a woman at the meeting.“Inviting a woman to speak is not to enter into the mode of an ecclesiastical feminism, because in the end every feminism ends up being a machismo with a skirt. No. Inviting a woman to speak about the wounds of the church is to invite the church to speak about herself, about the wounds she has,” he said.He was speaking following an address by Dr Linda Ghisoni, undersecretary for the Laity at the Vatican’s Dicastery for the Laity, Family, and Life and one of three women among 12 speakers scheduled to give addresses to the 190 Catholic church leaders in attendance at the meeting.The church leaders include 10 other women. Ireland is being represented at the meeting by the president of the Irish Episcopal Conference, Archbishop Eamon Martin.In her address, Dr Ghisoni recalled how “a priest, a few days ago, exclaimed ‘Still? We continue talking about abuse! The church’s attention to this theme is exaggerated’.”She continued how “even a practicing lady told me candidly: ‘It is better not to talk about these matters, otherwise there will be distrust of the church. Talking about it obscures all the good done in the parishes’.”Referring to priests who sexually abuse children as “howling wolves that penetrate the fold to scare further and disperse the flock” she said that “becoming aware of the phenomenon and (to) understand one’s responsibility is not a fixation”.Destroyed filesIn his address to the meeting on Saturday, Cardinal Reinhard Marx, Archbishop of Munich and Freising, President of the German Bishops’ Conference and a member of the Council of Cardinals which advises Pope Francis, said clerical child sex abuse files have been destroyed in some dioceses.“Files that could have documented the terrible deeds and named those responsible were destroyed, or not even created. Instead of the perpetrators, the victims were regulated and silence imposed on them.”He said the “rights of victims were effectively trampled underfoot, and left to the whims of iniduals”.“These are all events that sharply contradict what the church should stand for,” he said.At a press conference in the Vatican this afternoon he was talking about the German Catholic Church and that this destruction of documents had been established in a 2014 study conducted there. He said he assumed “Germany is not an isolated case”.In his address to the meeting, he said “establishing transparent procedural norms and rules for ecclesiastical processes is essential. Institutional mistrust leads to conspiracy theories regarding an organisation, and the formation of myths about an organisation. This can be avoided if the facts are set out transparently.”‘Mediocrity and hypocrisy’In another address on Saturday, Sr Veronica Openibo, a Nigerian who has worked in Africa, Europe and the United States, berated the bishops for mistakes in handling the sexual abuse crisis, saying the church had to acknowledge its “mediocrity, hypocrisy and complacency”.“We proclaim the Ten Commandments and parade ourselves as being the custodians of moral standards and values and good behaviour in society. Hypocrites at times? Yes! Why did we keep silent for so long?” she said.She told Pope Francis, sitting near her on the dais, that she admired him because he was “humble enough to change your mind”, apologise and take action after he initially defended a Chilean bishop accused of covering up abuse. The bishop later resigned.“How could the clerical church have kept silent, covering these atrocities? The silence, the carrying of the secrets in the hearts of the perpetrators, the length of the abuses and the constant transfers of perpetrators are unimaginable,” she said.‘Crisis and shame’She spoke of her shock when she watched the 2015 Oscar-winning film Spotlight, which uncovered how church leaders in Boston moved predator priests from parish to parish instead of defrocking them or turning them over to civil authorities.“At the present time, we are in a state of crisis and shame. We have seriously clouded the grace of the Christ-mission,” Sr Openibo said.“We must acknowledge that our mediocrity, hypocrisy and complacency have brought us to this disgraceful and scandalous place we find ourselves as a church. We pause to pray, Lord have mercy on us!” she said.She said church leaders must shed their habit of hiding events for fear of making a mistake.“Too often we want to keep silent until the storm has passed. This storm will not pass by. Our credibility is at stake,” she said.Leading cardinals told the four-day conference on Friday that the church must repair the “systematic failures” that enabled sexual abuse to take root around the world, and bishops should start policing each other’s behaviour.At the start of the conference on Thursday, five victims told painful stories of abuse and cover-up and the pope said they could expect concrete measures to come out of the meeting.Victims groups have complained that while some priests who sexually abused children were eventually disciplined by the church and sentenced by civil authorities, the bishops who either enabled the abuse or covered it up have not been punished.The conference ends on Sunday when the pope will make a final speech. The Vatican says it will then formulate follow-up measures to make sure all bishop return home knowing how to put anti-abuse procedures into place. – Reuters"},{"url":null,"title":"westminster dog show 2019 pictures","story":"Wire fox terrier wins Best in Show at the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show in New York on Tuesday night, emerging as the top dog among nearly 3,000 barking, tail-wagging competitors.GCHQ says Britain must consider threat posed by HuaweiScrapping six-month prison sentences will unleash 30,000 repeat offenders on Britain\u0026#39s streets, report warnsBBC Radio 3 launches new classical radio show to entice podcast generation with youngest ever host and guests under 30Donald Trump delays increase in tariffs on Chinese goods citing progress in trade talksUS warns Nicolas Maduro his \u0026#39days are numbered\u0026#39 as pressure mounts on Venezuelan regime after deadly aid standoffTheresa May enjoys downtime with Italian President, playing a game of pool in Sharm el-SheikhBaptiste, episode 2 review: has this thriller peaked too soon?Baptiste, episode 2 recap: Stratton shows his true colours, while a new character serves up a curveball White working class boys are now so far behind classmates they should be given special treatment like travellers and disabled, equalities commission saysExclusive: Brexit will be delayed by two months under plans being considered by Theresa MayPubs are closing down at a rate of one every 12 hours, new figures showComment: Brexiteers are not far-Right zealots.

They will fight on,” she said. “The Islamic State remains. We are weak now but we will come back again.”The 21-year-old was one of hundreds of bedraggled women who emerged from Baghuz in recent days. They waited in a huddled mass in a clearing to surrender to the Kurdish fighters of the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF).Mothers clutched dirty blankets and tugged suitcases through the mud while trying not to lose track of their exhausted children. A woman lifted her black abaya to defecate in a field. There was shouting as families shoved past each other to get to the trucks that would take them north to the refugee camps.These are among the final citizens of the Islamic State, the last people to have lived in the jihadists’ failed experiment in empire. The SDF now estimates that around 5,000 civilians and 1,500 fighters remain in Baghuz, more than originally thought but still a fraction of the 8 million people who once lived under the jihadists\u0027 black banner.Even in their hour of humiliation and defeat, many of the women still burned with the fanaticism powered the Islamic State for the last five years. They offered no remorse for the caliphate’s crimes and vowed that it would it one day return.That was the promise of Umm Mohammed, a 37-year-old from the nearby town of al-Bukamal. Like most Isil women she identified herself by her Arabic nickname, meaning Mother of Mohammed.Whatever her oldest son’s real name was, he is dead now. He was killed defending al-Bukamal, she said, while a second son was cut down in the town of Sousa. Her five remaining children were huddled around her feet, their eyes wide with fear and faces caked with dirt.The SDF have been shocked at the numbers of civilians coming out of the village of BaghuzWas it worth losing two sons in battle and subjecting her other children to horrors of war?“We stayed in the Islamic State because we want heaven. And we buy heaven with our souls and our children’s souls,” she said. “God didn’t create us for this life, he created us for the next life.”In between dense paragraphs of religious dogma and venomous condemnations of Shia Muslims, Umm Mohammed offered glimpses of the situation inside Baghuz.She and her family had been living in a tent made of rags for two weeks. “Our tents were like palaces because they were in the Islamic State,” she said.She said there were shortages of food but also that poorer families were unable to pay the high prices that come with a siege economy. Isil fighters had distributed some food but it was not enough. Without phones or internet access, they had little sense of the scale of Isil’s collapse. They knew only that Western warplanes were overhead all night and all day.As she spoke, a female Kurdish fighter searched through the folds of an Isil woman’s abaya. The jihadist’s wife stood patiently as the young woman in the colourful scarf checked her.As far as the Kurds knew, any one of these women could be a suicide bomber. Isil has no qualms with with using women or children in attacks and none of these people had been searched for explosive vests before they reached the SDF’s lines.The frantic hours it took to load the Isil families onto the trucks passed without incident under the watchful eye of Kurdish fighters. A column of American special forces drove past and bearded commandos peered through the windows at people from Baghuz.There were moments when the women’s certainty seemed to crack. One mother said that the Isil fighters had promised them that the UN would be waiting to receive them once they came out of Baghuz. Instead they found only their Kurdish conquerors and waiting journalists.But she insisted that Isil had not misled her. “There is no betrayal in the Islamic State.”The large numbers of civilians in the remaining Isil pocket have complicated the SDF offensiveThe woman said that Isil had ordered them to go as part of a deal struck between the jihadists and the SDF. Their understanding of the terms were murky but some suggested that the SDF agreed to let them out in return for Isil releasing Kurdish prisoners.The SDF strongly denied that there was a deal but said that they welcomed civilians coming out of Baghuz. “We are fighting a terror group. Either they surrender or they have to fight and die,” said Adnan Afrin, an SDF commander.The women said that was exactly the intention of the remaining Isil fighters, who were heavily armed and prepared to launch suicide bombers to defend Baghuz. “The brothers have everything and they are ready always. Even the women are carrying guns and are ready to be suicide bombers,” said one.SDF commanders have been shocked at how many women and children have emerged from the tiny pocket of Isil-territory. They had originally expected there were only around 1,500 civilians inside but so far more than 5,000 have come out.The large numbers of civilians have made it difficult for the SDF to call in airstrikes and will likely confound the predictions of a quick victory made by Donald Trump and others. Cmdr Afrin said it was impossible to predict how much long the operation would take.While most of the women continued to proclaim their loyalty to Isil, a few began a familiar routine of claiming that they had nothing to do with the jihadists.Umm Mohammed had some advice about women who said that. “Everyone here is from the Islamic State. Every one of us,” she said. “Anyone who says they are not is a liar.”  Scrapping six-month prison sentences will unleash 30,000 repeat offenders on Britain\u0026#39s streets, report warnsBBC Radio 3 launches new classical radio show to entice podcast generation with youngest ever host and guests under 30GCHQ says Britain must consider threat posed by HuaweiDonald Trump delays increase in tariffs on Chinese goods citing progress in trade talksUS warns Nicolas Maduro his \u0026#39days are numbered\u0026#39 as pressure mounts on Venezuelan regime after deadly aid standoffTheresa May enjoys downtime with Italian President, playing a game of pool in Sharm el-SheikhBaptiste, episode 2 review: has this thriller peaked too soon?Baptiste, episode 2 recap: Stratton shows his true colours, while a new character serves up a curveball White working class boys are now so far behind classmates they should be given special treatment like travellers and disabled, equalities commission saysExclusive: Brexit will be delayed by two months under plans being considered by Theresa MayPubs are closing down at a rate of one every 12 hours, new figures showComment: Brexiteers are not far-Right zealots.

It\u0027s great we have seen a drop in the number of pubs closing and shows that our campaign to get planning protection for pubs was worth it.The number of small pubs has almost halved since 2001Protecting pubs in the English planning system was a necessity and a welcome move from the Government. However, it has taken nearly two years for the trickle-down effects of the planning changes to show.As the UK prepares to exit the European Union, the Government will have the freedom to reduce Beer Duty specifically in pubs - levelling the playing field between the price of beer sold in social, community settings and cheap supermarket alcohol consumed at home.We believe this is one of three key measures the Government needs to take urgently to halt the tide of pub closures. We want a full reviews both of the business rates system to fix the unfair amount pubs pay, and the currently ineffective legislation designed to enable pub tenants to get a fair deal from their big-business property owners - both moves the Government has promised but is yet to carry out.The number of pub closures has dropped slightly from a rate of 18 a week during 2018 - helped, claim CAMRA, by success in achieving new local planning protection for pubs in England.The hardest hit areas include Yorkshire and the Humber and the South East, where one in a hundred pubs have closed in the past year.Please review our commenting policyScrapping six-month prison sentences will unleash 30,000 repeat offenders on Britain\u0026#39s streets, report warnsBBC Radio 3 launches new classical radio show to entice podcast generation with youngest ever host and guests under 30GCHQ says Britain must consider threat posed by HuaweiDonald Trump delays increase in tariffs on Chinese goods citing progress in trade talksUS warns Nicolas Maduro his \u0026#39days are numbered\u0026#39 as pressure mounts on Venezuelan regime after deadly aid standoffTheresa May enjoys downtime with Italian President, playing a game of pool in Sharm el-SheikhBaptiste, episode 2 review: has this thriller peaked too soon?Baptiste, episode 2 recap: Stratton shows his true colours, while a new character serves up a curveball White working class boys are now so far behind classmates they should be given special treatment like travellers and disabled, equalities commission saysExclusive: Brexit will be delayed by two months under plans being considered by Theresa MayComment: Brexiteers are not far-Right zealots.

Truthfully, though, Victor Frankenstein himself couldn’t have sewed together a creature out of more mismatched body parts than this album. It starts with a child’s glockenspiel and ends in deafening feedback, noise, and distortion. Side one track one, “Sunday Morning”, is a wistful ballad fit for a cool European chanteuse sung by a surly Brooklynite. “Venus in Furs” is a jangling, jagged-edge drone about a sex whipping not given lightly. “I’ll Be Your Mirror” is a love song. European Son is rock’n’roll turned sonic shockwave. That’s before you even get on to the song about buying and shooting heroin that David Bowie heard on a test pressing and called “the future of music”. Half a century on, all you have to do is put electricity through The Velvet Underground \u0026amp Nico to realise that he was right. Chris Harvey240 I Never Loved a Man the Way I Love You (1967), Aretha FranklinWhen Jerry Wexler signed the daughter of a violent, philandering preacher to Atlantic records, he took her to church, sat her down at the piano, and let her be herself. The Queen of Soul gave herself the same space. You can hear her listening to the band, biding her time before firing up her voice to demand R-E-S-P-E-C-T 50 years before the #MeToo movement. Helen Brown340 Master of Puppets (1986), MetallicaDespite not featuring any singles, Metallica’s third album was the UK rock radio breakthrough they’d been looking for. In 1986, they released one of the best metal records of all time, which dealt with the potency and very nature of control, meshing beauty and raw human ugliness together on tracks like “Damage Inc” and “Orion”. This album is about storytelling – the medieval-influenced guitar picks on opener “Battery” should be enough to tell you that. Although that was really the only medieval imagery they conjured up – they ripped Dungeons \u0026amp Dragons clichés out of the lyrics and replaced them with the apocalypse, with bassist Cliff Burton, drummer Lars Ulrich, guitarist Kirk Hammett and singerrhythm guitarist James Hetfield serving as the four horsemen. Roisin O’Connor440 Remain in Light (1980), Talking Heads“Facts are simple and facts are straight  Facts are lazy and facts are late…” sang David Byrne, submerging personal and planetary anxieties about fake news and conspicuous consumption in dense, layers and loops of Afrobeat-indebted funk. Propulsive polyrhythms drive against the lyrical pleas for us to stop and take stock. Same as it ever was. HB540 Catch a Fire (Jamaican version) (1973), Bob Marley and the WailersThe album that carried reggae music to the four corners of the Earth and made Bob Marley an international superstar also set the political tone for many artists to follow. Marley sang of life “where the living is hardest” in “Concrete Jungle” and looked back to Jamaica’s ignoble slaving past – “No chains around my feet but I’m not free”. He packed the album with beautiful melodic numbers, such as “High Tide and Low Tide”, and rhythmic dance tracks like “Kinky Reggae”. Released outside of Jamaica by Island Records with guitar overdubs and ornamentation, the original Jamaican version is a stripped-down masterpiece. CHAn unprecedented 220 hours of studio experimentation saw George Martin and The Beatles looping, speeding, slowing and spooling tapes backwards to create a terrifically trippy new sound. The mournful enigma of McCartney’s “For No One” and the psychedelia of Lennon’s “Tomorrow Never Knows” and “She Said, She Said” can still leave you standing hypnotised over the spinning vinyl, wondering if the music is coming out or being sucked back in. HBIt may be the most “serious” album she’s ever made, yet Like a Prayer is still Madonna at her most accessible – pulling no punches in topics from religion to the dissolution of her marriage. In 1989, Madonna’s personal life was tabloid fodder: a tumultuous marriage to actor Sean Penn finally ended in orce, and she was causing controversy with the “Like a Prayer” video and its burning crosses. On the gospel abandon of the title track, she takes the listener’s breath away with her sheer ambition. Where her past records had been reflections of the modern music that influenced her – Like a Prayer saw her pay homage to bands like Sly \u0026amp the Family Stone, and Simon \u0026amp Garfunkel. The album was also about an artist taking control over her own narrative, after releasing records that asked the audience – and the press – to like her. ROMillennials coming at this album can end up feeling like the guy who saw Hamlet and complained it was all quotations. Jimmy Page’s juggernaut riffs and Robert Plant’s hedonistic wails set the bench mark for all subsequent heavy, hedonistic rock. But it’s worth playing the whole thing to experience the full mystic, monolithic ritual of the thing. Stairway? Undeniable. HB940 The Best of the Shangri-Las (1996), The Shangri-LasOh no. Oh no. Oh no no no no no, no one ever did teen heartbreak quite like the Shangri-Las. Long before the Spice Girls packaged attitude for popular consumption, songwriter Ellie Greenwich was having trouble with a group of teenagers who had grown up in a tough part of Queen’s – “with their gestures, and language, and chewing the gum and the stockings ripped up their legs”. But the Shangri-Las sang with an ardour that was so streetwise, passionate and raw that it still reaches across more than half a century without losing any of its power. Leader of the Pack (co-written by Greenwich) may be their best-known song, but they were never a novelty act. This compilation captures them at their early Sixties peak. CH1040 The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars (1972), David BowieFlamboyance, excess, eccentricity – this is the breakthrough album that asserted Bowie as glam rock’s new icon, surpassing T Rex. He may have come to rue his Ziggy Stardust character, but with it, Bowie transcended artists seeking authenticity via more mundane means. It was his most ambitious album – musically and thematically – that, like Prince, saw him unite his greatest strengths from previous works and pull off one of the great rock and roll albums without losing his sense of humour, or the wish to continue entertaining his fans. “I’m out to bloody entertain, not just get up onstage and knock out a few songs,” he declared. “I’m the last person to pretend I’m a radio. I’d rather go out and be a colour television set.” ROIn their brief career, ended by the suicide of 23-year-old singer Ian Curtis, Joy Division created two candidates for the best album by anyone ever. Closer may be a final flowering, but Unknown Pleasures is more tonally consistent, utterly unlike anything before or since. The mood is an all-pervading ink-black darkness, but there is a spiritual force coming out of the grooves that is so far beyond pop or rock, it feels almost Dostoevskyan. There are classic songs – Disorder, She’s Lost Control and New Dawn Fades – and for those who’d swap every note Eric Clapton ever played for one of Peter Hook’s basslines, the sequence at 4:20 on I Remember Nothing is perhaps the single most thrilling moment in the entire Joy Division catalogue. CHThough her 1971 album, Blue, is usually chosen for these kinds of lists, Mitchell surpassed its silvery, heartbroken folk five years later with a record that found her confidently questioning its culturally conditioned expectations of womanhood. Against an ambiguous, jazzy landscape, her deepening, difficult voice weighs romance and domesticity against the adventure of “strange pillows” and solitude. HBThe answer to whether Robyn could follow up the brilliance of her self-titled 2005 album came in a burst of releases in 2010, the EPs Body Talk Pt 1, Pt 2 and Pt3, and this 15-track effort, essentially a compilation album. It includes different versions of some tracks, such as the non-acoustic version of “Hang With Me” (and we can argue all night about that one), but leaves well alone when it comes to the single greatest electronic dance track since “I Feel Love”, “Dancing On My Own”. Body Talk is simply jammed with great songs. CH “I will study and look back on the whole world of entertainment and perfect it,” wrote Jackson as he turned 21 and shook off his cute, controlled child-star imagery to release his jubilant, fourth solo album. Produced by Quincy Jones, the sophisticated disco funk nails the balance between tight, tendon-twanging grooves and liberated euphoria. Glitter ball magic. HBHow good can rap get? This good. There are albums where the myth can transcend the music – not on Illmatic, where Nas vaulted himself into the ranks of the greatest MCs in 1994, with an album that countless artists since have tried – and failed – to emulate. Enlisting the hottest producers around – Pete Rock, DJ Premier, Q-Tip, L.E.S and Large Professor – was a move that Complex blamed for “ruining hip hop”, while still praising Nas’s record, because it had a lasting impact on the use of multiple producers on rap albums. Nas used the sounds of the densely-populated New York streets he grew up on. You hear the rattle of the steel train that opens the record, along with the cassette tape hissing the verse from a teenage Nasty Nas on Main Source’s 1991 track “Live at the BBQ”: ‘When I was 12, I went to Hell for snuffing Jesus.” ROThis is the album that changes everything. The synthesised sounds coming out of Kraftwerk’s Kling-Klang studios had already become pure and beautiful on 1975’s Radio-Activity, but on Trans-Europe Express, their sophistication subtly shifts all future possibilities. The familiar quality of human sweetness and melancholy in Ralf Hutter’s voice is subsumed into the machine as rhythms interlock and bloom in side two’s mini-symphony that begins with the title track. Released four months before Giorgio Moroder’s I Feel Love, Trans-Europe Express influenced everything from hip-hop to techno. All electronic dance music starts here. CH1740 Kind of Blue (1959), Miles DavisWith the sketches of melody only written down hours before recording, the world’s best-selling jazz record still feels spontaneous and unpredictable. Davis’s friend George Russell once explained that the secret of its tonal jazz was to use every note in a scale “without having to meet the deadline of a particular chord”. Kind of Blue is unrepeatably cool. HB“If I ventured in the slipstream, between the viaducts of your dream…” To enter this musical cathedral, where folk, jazz and blue-eyed soul meet is always to feel a sense of awe. Recorded in just two eight-hour sessions, in which Morrison first played the songs to the assembled musicians then told them to do their own thing, Astral Weeks still feels as if it was made yesterday. Morrison’s stream-of-consciousness lyrics within the richness of the acoustic setting – double bass, classical guitar and flute – make this as emotionally affecting an album as any in rock and pop. CH“Life is all right in America  If you\u0027re all white in America” yelp the immigrants in this passionate and political musical relocating of Romeo and Juliet to Fifites New York. Leonard Bernstein’s sophisticated score is a melting pot of pop, classical and Latin music Stephen Sondheim’s lyrics sharp as a flick knife. An unanswered prayer for a united and forgiving USA. HB2040 Sign o\u0027 the Times (1987), PrinceSign o’ the Times is Prince’s magnum opus from a catalogue of masterworks – a double album ning funk, rock, R\u0026ampB and most essentially, soul. It is the greatest articulation of his alchemic experiments with musical fusion – the sum of several projects Prince was working on during his most creatively fruitful year. On Sign o’ the Times, the bass is king – Prince cemented his guitar god status on Purple Rain. There are tracks that drip with sex, and love songs like “Adore”, which remains one of the greatest of all time. Stitched together with the utmost care, as if he were writing a play with a beginning, a middle and an end, the album is a landmark in both pop and in art. ROCaught in the psychological undertow of family trauma and all those commercial surf songs, 23-year-old Brian Wilson had a panic attack and retreated to the studio to write this dreamlike series of songs whose structural tides washed them way beyond the preppy formulas of drugstore jukeboxes. Notes pinged from vibraphones and coke cans gleam in the strange, sad waves of bittersweet melody. HBWeave a circle round her thrice… Joanna Newsom is dismissed by some as kookily faux-naif, but her second album, before she trained out the childlike quality from her voice, may be the most enchanted record ever made. At times, she sounds other-worldly, sitting at her harp, singing to herself of sassafras and Sisyphus, but then a phrase will carry you off suddenly to the heart’s depths – “Still, my dear, I’d have walked you to the edge of the water”. Ys’s pleasures are not simple or immediate. Newsom’s unusual song structures, with their fragmented melodies, and strange and beautiful orchestral arrangements by 63-year-old Van Dyke Parks, take time to work their magic. But once you’re bewitched, Ys’s spell never wears off. CH2340 It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back (1988), Public EnemyPublic Enemy’s second album is hip-hop’s game-changing moment, where a new musical form that arrived fully born after years of development away from meddling outsiders found its radical voice. It Takes a Nation of Millions… is still one of the most powerful, provocative albums ever made, “Here is a land that never gave a damn  About a brother like me,” raps Chuck D on “Black Steel in the Hour of Chaos”. Producer Hank Shocklee creates a hard-edged sound from samples that pay homage to soul greats such as James Brown and Isaac Hayes, and Flavor Flav gives it an unmistakeable zest. CH2440 Dark Side of the Moon (1973), Pink FloydIt’s easy to knock these white, male, middle-class proggers, with their spaceship full of technology and their monolithic ambitions. But the walloping drums, operatic howls and “quiet desperation” of this concept album about the various forms of madness still resonates with the unbalanced, overwhelmed and alienated parts of us all. Play loud, alone and after dark. HB2540 The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill (1998), Lauryn HillLauryn Hill raised the game for an entire genre with this immense and groundbreaking work. Flipping between two tones – sharp and cold, and sensual and smoky – the former Fugees member stepped out from rap’s misogynist status quo and drew an audience outside of hip hop thanks to her melding of soul, reggae and R\u0026ampB, and the recruitment of the likes of Mary J Blige and D’Angelo. Its sonic appeal has a lot to do with the lo-fi production and warm instrumentation, often comprised of a low thrumming bass, tight snares and doo-wop harmonies. But Hill’s reggae influences are what drive the album’s spirit: preaching love and peace but also speaking out against unrighteous oppression. Even today, it’s one of the most uplifting and inspiring records around. ROThe great French singer-songwriter provocateur probably wouldn’t get too many takers today for a concept album about a tender love between his middle-aged self and a teenage girl he knocks off her bicycle in his Rolls-Royce. But, musically, this cult album is sublime, an extraordinary collision of funk bass, spoken-word lyrics and Jean-Claude Vannier’s heavenly string arrangements. “Ballade de Melody Nelson”, sung by Gainsbourg and Jane Birkin, is one of his most sublimely gorgeous songs. CHThere’s nothing contrived about Karen Dalton’s ability to flip out the guts of familiar songs and give them a dry, cracked folk-blues twist. Expanding the emotional and narrative boundaries of songs like Percy Sledge’s When a Man Loves a Woman is just what she did. Why has it taken the world so long to appreciate her? HB“Goddamn Europeans, take me back to beautiful England.” PJ Harvey may have sounded like she was channelling Boris and Nige when she made this striking album in 2015, but few Brexiteers would want to take this journey with her. Let England Shake digs deep into the soil of the land, where buried plowshares lie waiting to be beaten into swords. Death is everywhere, sometimes in its most visceral form: “I’ve seen soldiers fall like lumps of meat,” she sings on “The Words That Maketh Murder”, “Arms and legs are in the trees.” Musically, though, it’s ravishing: Harvey employs autoharp, zither, rhodes piano, xylophone and trombone to create a futuristic folk sound that’s strikingly original yet could almost be from an earlier century. CH2940 Boy in da Corner (2003), Dizzee RascalIt’s staggering to listen back to this album and remember Dizzee was just 18-years-old when he released it. Rising through the UK garage scene as a member of east London’s Roll Deep crew, the MC born Dylan Mills allegedly honed his skills in production after being excluded from every one of his classes, apart from music. If you want any sense of how ahead of the game Dizzee was, just listen to the opening track “Sittin’ Here”. While 2018 has suffered a spate of half-hearted singles playing on the listener’s sense of nostalgia for simpler times, 15 years ago Dizzee longed for the innocence of childhood because of what he was seeing in the present day: teenage pregnancies, police brutality, his friends murdered on the streets or lost to a lifestyle of crime and cash. Boy in da Corner goes heavy on cold, uncomfortably disjointed beats, synths that emulate arcade games and police sirens, and Dizzee himself delivering bars in his trademark, high-pitched squawk. RO3040 Hounds of Love (1985), Kate BushProof that a woman could satisfy her unique artistic vision and top the charts without kowtowing to industry expectations, Kate Bush’s self-produced masterpiece explored the extreme range of her oceanic emotions from the seclusion of a cutting-edge studio built in the garden of her 17th-century farmhouse. The human vulnerability of her voice and traditional instruments are given an electrical charge by her pioneering use of synthesisers. Thrilling and immersive. HBA uniquely British take on hip hop and soul that continues to influence booming modern genres like grime and dubstep, the Bristol collective’s debut gave a cool new pulse to the nation’s grit and grey. You can smell ashtrays on greasy spoon tables in Tricky’s whisper and feel the rain on your face in Shara Nelson’s exhilarating improvisations. HBIt only takes 20 seconds of opening track Bone Machine to realise Pixies and producer Steve Albini have stripped down the sound of rock ’n’ roll and rebuilt it piece by piece. The angry smack of Led Zep drums, ripe bass, and sheet metal guitar straight off the Stooges’ Detroit production line are separated and recombined. Pixies’ sound is already complete before Black Francis embarks on one of his elusive pop cult narratives (“your bone’s got a little machine”). The tension between the savagery of his vocals and Kim Deal’s softer melodic tone won’t reach its perfect balance until their next album but their debut, Surfer Rosa is gigantic, and deserving of big, big love. Its “loud, quiet, loud” tectonics would prove so influential that Nirvana’s Kurt Cobain would later say he “was basically trying to rip off the Pixies”. CH3340 Talking Timbuktu (1994), Ali Farka Toure and Ry Cooder If you ever doubt the possibility of relaxed and respectful conversation across the world’s cultural isions, then give yourself an hour with this astonishing collaboration between Mali’s Ali Farka Toure (who wrote all but one of the tracks) and California’s Ry Cooder (whose slide guitar travels through them like a pilgrim). Desert meets Delta Blues. HBCompared to the blues, the incalculable influence of gospel music on pop, soul and rock ’n’ roll has been underplayed. It can be found in every song on this brilliant 27-track compilation. If you can’t hear James Brown in the foot-stomping opener “Move on Up a Little Higher” by Brother Joe May, you’re not listening hard enough. The road to Motown from “Lord, Lord, Lord” by Professor Alex Bradford is narrow indeed, but you could still take a side-turning and follow his ecstatic whoops straight to Little Richard, who borrowed them, and on to the Beatles who copied them from him. The swooping chord changes in James Cleveland’s “My Soul Looks Back” are magnificent. All the irreplaceable soul voices, from Aretha Franklin to Bobby Womack, were steeped in gospel. This is a great place to hear where they came from. Companion album The Great Gospel Women is a marvel, too. CH“A lot of the music scene is just a wanking, self-congratulatory boys club,” said this angel-voiced, transgender artist in 2012. Four years later, the seismic drums and radical ecofeminist agenda of Hopelessness shook that club’s crumbling foundations to dust. The horrors of drone warfare, paedophilia and global warming are held up to the bright lights in disconcertingly beautiful rage. HBKurt Cobain had one goal with In Utero: to pull Nirvana away from what he dubbed the “candy-ass” sound on Nevermind – the album that had turned them into one of the biggest rock bands on the planet – and take them back to punk-rock. He asked Pixies’ producer Steve Albini to oversee production.  It didn’t exactly eschew commercial success upon release (it went on to sell 15m copies worldwide), but the heaviness the band felt as they recorded it bears down on the listener from the opening track. Disheartened by the media obsession with his personal life and the fans clamouring for the same old shit, In Utero is pure, undiluted rage. “GO AWAYYYYYYYYYYY” he screams on “Scentless Apprentice”, capturing the essence of Patrick Suskind’s novel Perfume: Story of a Murderer and using it as a metaphor for his disgust at the music industry, and the press. ROCurtis Mayfield had been spinning golden soul music from doo-wop roots with The Impressions for more than a decade before releasing his first solo album, which contains some of his greatest songs. While some point to the 1972 Blaxploitation soundtrack Superfly as the definitive Mayfield album, Curtis is deeper and more joyous, its complex arrangements masterly. Mayfield’s sweet falsetto sings of Nixon’s bland reassurances over the fuzz-bass of “(Don’t Worry) If There Is a Hell Below We’re All Going to Go” doleful horns give the politically conscious “We the People Who Are Darker Than Blue” a profound emotional undertow “Move On Up” is simply one of the most exhilarating songs in pop. To spend time with Curtis is to be in the presence of a beautiful soul. CHBefore they went their own way, Fleetwood Mac decided to tell a story that would be the quintessential marker for American rock culture in the Seventies. As Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks tossed the charred remains of their relationship at one another on “Dreams” and “Go Your Own Way”, the rest of the band conjured up the warm West Coast harmonies, the laid back California vibes of the rhythm section and the clear highs on “Gold Dust Woman”, in such a way that Rumours would become the definitive sound of the era. At the time of its release, it was the fastest-selling LP of all time its success turned Fleetwood Mac into a cultural phenomenon. ROA virtual unknown to rock fans just a year before – Hendrix used Are You Experienced? to assert himself as a guitar genius who could combine pop, blues, rock, R\u0026ampB, funk and psychedelia in a way no other artist had before. That’s even without the essential contributions of drummer Mitch Mitchell and bassist Noel Redding, who handed Are You Experienced? the rhythmic bridge between jazz and rock. Few album openers are as exquisite as “Purple Haze”. Few tracks are as gratifying, as sexy, as the strut on “Foxy Lady”. And few songs come close to the existential bliss caused by “The Wind Cries Mary”. Hendrix’s attack on the guitar contrasted against the more polished virtuosos in rock at the time – yet it is his raw ferocity that we find ourselves coming back to. Few debuts have changed the course of rock music as Hendrix did with his. RODisco’s crowning glory is this album that Chic’s Nile Rodgers and Bernard Edwards made with Kathy Sledge and her sisters Debbie, Joni and Kim. Nile and ’Nard were at the peak of their powers, classic songs were pouring out of them – We Are Family was released in the same year as the epochal “Good Times” by Chic – and this album has four of them, “Lost in Music”, “He’s the Greatest Dancer”, “Thinking of You” and the title track itself. Sister Sledge gave Rodgers a chance to work with warmer, gutsier vocals than the cool voices he used to give Chic records such laid-back style and the result is a floor-filling dance party, punctuated by mellow ballads. CHIt was Andy Warhol who wanted Lou Reed and John Cale to let his beautiful new friend Nico sing with their avant-garde rock band. Truthfully, though, Victor Frankenstein himself couldn’t have sewed together a creature out of more mismatched body parts than this album. It starts with a child’s glockenspiel and ends in deafening feedback, noise, and distortion. Side one track one, “Sunday Morning”, is a wistful ballad fit for a cool European chanteuse sung by a surly Brooklynite. “Venus in Furs” is a jangling, jagged-edge drone about a sex whipping not given lightly. “I’ll Be Your Mirror” is a love song. European Son is rock’n’roll turned sonic shockwave. That’s before you even get on to the song about buying and shooting heroin that David Bowie heard on a test pressing and called “the future of music”. Half a century on, all you have to do is put electricity through The Velvet Underground \u0026amp Nico to realise that he was right. Chris Harvey240 I Never Loved a Man the Way I Love You (1967), Aretha FranklinWhen Jerry Wexler signed the daughter of a violent, philandering preacher to Atlantic records, he took her to church, sat her down at the piano, and let her be herself.

CH1040 The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars (1972), David BowieFlamboyance, excess, eccentricity – this is the breakthrough album that asserted Bowie as glam rock’s new icon, surpassing T Rex. He may have come to rue his Ziggy Stardust character, but with it, Bowie transcended artists seeking authenticity via more mundane means. It was his most ambitious album – musically and thematically – that, like Prince, saw him unite his greatest strengths from previous works and pull off one of the great rock and roll albums without losing his sense of humour, or the wish to continue entertaining his fans. “I’m out to bloody entertain, not just get up onstage and knock out a few songs,” he declared. “I’m the last person to pretend I’m a radio. I’d rather go out and be a colour television set.” ROIn their brief career, ended by the suicide of 23-year-old singer Ian Curtis, Joy Division created two candidates for the best album by anyone ever. Closer may be a final flowering, but Unknown Pleasures is more tonally consistent, utterly unlike anything before or since. The mood is an all-pervading ink-black darkness, but there is a spiritual force coming out of the grooves that is so far beyond pop or rock, it feels almost Dostoevskyan. There are classic songs – Disorder, She’s Lost Control and New Dawn Fades – and for those who’d swap every note Eric Clapton ever played for one of Peter Hook’s basslines, the sequence at 4:20 on I Remember Nothing is perhaps the single most thrilling moment in the entire Joy Division catalogue. CHThough her 1971 album, Blue, is usually chosen for these kinds of lists, Mitchell surpassed its silvery, heartbroken folk five years later with a record that found her confidently questioning its culturally conditioned expectations of womanhood. Against an ambiguous, jazzy landscape, her deepening, difficult voice weighs romance and domesticity against the adventure of “strange pillows” and solitude. HBThe answer to whether Robyn could follow up the brilliance of her self-titled 2005 album came in a burst of releases in 2010, the EPs Body Talk Pt 1, Pt 2 and Pt3, and this 15-track effort, essentially a compilation album. It includes different versions of some tracks, such as the non-acoustic version of “Hang With Me” (and we can argue all night about that one), but leaves well alone when it comes to the single greatest electronic dance track since “I Feel Love”, “Dancing On My Own”. Body Talk is simply jammed with great songs. CH “I will study and look back on the whole world of entertainment and perfect it,” wrote Jackson as he turned 21 and shook off his cute, controlled child-star imagery to release his jubilant, fourth solo album. Produced by Quincy Jones, the sophisticated disco funk nails the balance between tight, tendon-twanging grooves and liberated euphoria. Glitter ball magic. HBHow good can rap get? This good. There are albums where the myth can transcend the music – not on Illmatic, where Nas vaulted himself into the ranks of the greatest MCs in 1994, with an album that countless artists since have tried – and failed – to emulate. Enlisting the hottest producers around – Pete Rock, DJ Premier, Q-Tip, L.E.S and Large Professor – was a move that Complex blamed for “ruining hip hop”, while still praising Nas’s record, because it had a lasting impact on the use of multiple producers on rap albums. Nas used the sounds of the densely-populated New York streets he grew up on. You hear the rattle of the steel train that opens the record, along with the cassette tape hissing the verse from a teenage Nasty Nas on Main Source’s 1991 track “Live at the BBQ”: ‘When I was 12, I went to Hell for snuffing Jesus.” ROThis is the album that changes everything. The synthesised sounds coming out of Kraftwerk’s Kling-Klang studios had already become pure and beautiful on 1975’s Radio-Activity, but on Trans-Europe Express, their sophistication subtly shifts all future possibilities. The familiar quality of human sweetness and melancholy in Ralf Hutter’s voice is subsumed into the machine as rhythms interlock and bloom in side two’s mini-symphony that begins with the title track. Released four months before Giorgio Moroder’s I Feel Love, Trans-Europe Express influenced everything from hip-hop to techno. All electronic dance music starts here. CH1740 Kind of Blue (1959), Miles DavisWith the sketches of melody only written down hours before recording, the world’s best-selling jazz record still feels spontaneous and unpredictable. Davis’s friend George Russell once explained that the secret of its tonal jazz was to use every note in a scale “without having to meet the deadline of a particular chord”. Kind of Blue is unrepeatably cool. HB“If I ventured in the slipstream, between the viaducts of your dream…” To enter this musical cathedral, where folk, jazz and blue-eyed soul meet is always to feel a sense of awe. Recorded in just two eight-hour sessions, in which Morrison first played the songs to the assembled musicians then told them to do their own thing, Astral Weeks still feels as if it was made yesterday. Morrison’s stream-of-consciousness lyrics within the richness of the acoustic setting – double bass, classical guitar and flute – make this as emotionally affecting an album as any in rock and pop. CH“Life is all right in America  If you\u0027re all white in America” yelp the immigrants in this passionate and political musical relocating of Romeo and Juliet to Fifites New York. Leonard Bernstein’s sophisticated score is a melting pot of pop, classical and Latin music Stephen Sondheim’s lyrics sharp as a flick knife. An unanswered prayer for a united and forgiving USA. HB2040 Sign o\u0027 the Times (1987), PrinceSign o’ the Times is Prince’s magnum opus from a catalogue of masterworks – a double album ning funk, rock, R\u0026ampB and most essentially, soul. It is the greatest articulation of his alchemic experiments with musical fusion – the sum of several projects Prince was working on during his most creatively fruitful year. On Sign o’ the Times, the bass is king – Prince cemented his guitar god status on Purple Rain. There are tracks that drip with sex, and love songs like “Adore”, which remains one of the greatest of all time. Stitched together with the utmost care, as if he were writing a play with a beginning, a middle and an end, the album is a landmark in both pop and in art. ROCaught in the psychological undertow of family trauma and all those commercial surf songs, 23-year-old Brian Wilson had a panic attack and retreated to the studio to write this dreamlike series of songs whose structural tides washed them way beyond the preppy formulas of drugstore jukeboxes. Notes pinged from vibraphones and coke cans gleam in the strange, sad waves of bittersweet melody. HBWeave a circle round her thrice… Joanna Newsom is dismissed by some as kookily faux-naif, but her second album, before she trained out the childlike quality from her voice, may be the most enchanted record ever made. At times, she sounds other-worldly, sitting at her harp, singing to herself of sassafras and Sisyphus, but then a phrase will carry you off suddenly to the heart’s depths – “Still, my dear, I’d have walked you to the edge of the water”. Ys’s pleasures are not simple or immediate. Newsom’s unusual song structures, with their fragmented melodies, and strange and beautiful orchestral arrangements by 63-year-old Van Dyke Parks, take time to work their magic. But once you’re bewitched, Ys’s spell never wears off. CH2340 It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back (1988), Public EnemyPublic Enemy’s second album is hip-hop’s game-changing moment, where a new musical form that arrived fully born after years of development away from meddling outsiders found its radical voice. It Takes a Nation of Millions… is still one of the most powerful, provocative albums ever made, “Here is a land that never gave a damn  About a brother like me,” raps Chuck D on “Black Steel in the Hour of Chaos”. Producer Hank Shocklee creates a hard-edged sound from samples that pay homage to soul greats such as James Brown and Isaac Hayes, and Flavor Flav gives it an unmistakeable zest. CH2440 Dark Side of the Moon (1973), Pink FloydIt’s easy to knock these white, male, middle-class proggers, with their spaceship full of technology and their monolithic ambitions. But the walloping drums, operatic howls and “quiet desperation” of this concept album about the various forms of madness still resonates with the unbalanced, overwhelmed and alienated parts of us all. Play loud, alone and after dark. HB2540 The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill (1998), Lauryn HillLauryn Hill raised the game for an entire genre with this immense and groundbreaking work. Flipping between two tones – sharp and cold, and sensual and smoky – the former Fugees member stepped out from rap’s misogynist status quo and drew an audience outside of hip hop thanks to her melding of soul, reggae and R\u0026ampB, and the recruitment of the likes of Mary J Blige and D’Angelo. Its sonic appeal has a lot to do with the lo-fi production and warm instrumentation, often comprised of a low thrumming bass, tight snares and doo-wop harmonies. But Hill’s reggae influences are what drive the album’s spirit: preaching love and peace but also speaking out against unrighteous oppression. Even today, it’s one of the most uplifting and inspiring records around. ROThe great French singer-songwriter provocateur probably wouldn’t get too many takers today for a concept album about a tender love between his middle-aged self and a teenage girl he knocks off her bicycle in his Rolls-Royce. But, musically, this cult album is sublime, an extraordinary collision of funk bass, spoken-word lyrics and Jean-Claude Vannier’s heavenly string arrangements. “Ballade de Melody Nelson”, sung by Gainsbourg and Jane Birkin, is one of his most sublimely gorgeous songs. CHThere’s nothing contrived about Karen Dalton’s ability to flip out the guts of familiar songs and give them a dry, cracked folk-blues twist. Expanding the emotional and narrative boundaries of songs like Percy Sledge’s When a Man Loves a Woman is just what she did. Why has it taken the world so long to appreciate her? HB“Goddamn Europeans, take me back to beautiful England.” PJ Harvey may have sounded like she was channelling Boris and Nige when she made this striking album in 2015, but few Brexiteers would want to take this journey with her. Let England Shake digs deep into the soil of the land, where buried plowshares lie waiting to be beaten into swords. Death is everywhere, sometimes in its most visceral form: “I’ve seen soldiers fall like lumps of meat,” she sings on “The Words That Maketh Murder”, “Arms and legs are in the trees.” Musically, though, it’s ravishing: Harvey employs autoharp, zither, rhodes piano, xylophone and trombone to create a futuristic folk sound that’s strikingly original yet could almost be from an earlier century. CH2940 Boy in da Corner (2003), Dizzee RascalIt’s staggering to listen back to this album and remember Dizzee was just 18-years-old when he released it. Rising through the UK garage scene as a member of east London’s Roll Deep crew, the MC born Dylan Mills allegedly honed his skills in production after being excluded from every one of his classes, apart from music. If you want any sense of how ahead of the game Dizzee was, just listen to the opening track “Sittin’ Here”. While 2018 has suffered a spate of half-hearted singles playing on the listener’s sense of nostalgia for simpler times, 15 years ago Dizzee longed for the innocence of childhood because of what he was seeing in the present day: teenage pregnancies, police brutality, his friends murdered on the streets or lost to a lifestyle of crime and cash. Boy in da Corner goes heavy on cold, uncomfortably disjointed beats, synths that emulate arcade games and police sirens, and Dizzee himself delivering bars in his trademark, high-pitched squawk. RO3040 Hounds of Love (1985), Kate BushProof that a woman could satisfy her unique artistic vision and top the charts without kowtowing to industry expectations, Kate Bush’s self-produced masterpiece explored the extreme range of her oceanic emotions from the seclusion of a cutting-edge studio built in the garden of her 17th-century farmhouse. The human vulnerability of her voice and traditional instruments are given an electrical charge by her pioneering use of synthesisers. Thrilling and immersive. HBA uniquely British take on hip hop and soul that continues to influence booming modern genres like grime and dubstep, the Bristol collective’s debut gave a cool new pulse to the nation’s grit and grey. You can smell ashtrays on greasy spoon tables in Tricky’s whisper and feel the rain on your face in Shara Nelson’s exhilarating improvisations. HBIt only takes 20 seconds of opening track Bone Machine to realise Pixies and producer Steve Albini have stripped down the sound of rock ’n’ roll and rebuilt it piece by piece. The angry smack of Led Zep drums, ripe bass, and sheet metal guitar straight off the Stooges’ Detroit production line are separated and recombined. Pixies’ sound is already complete before Black Francis embarks on one of his elusive pop cult narratives (“your bone’s got a little machine”). The tension between the savagery of his vocals and Kim Deal’s softer melodic tone won’t reach its perfect balance until their next album but their debut, Surfer Rosa is gigantic, and deserving of big, big love. Its “loud, quiet, loud” tectonics would prove so influential that Nirvana’s Kurt Cobain would later say he “was basically trying to rip off the Pixies”. CH3340 Talking Timbuktu (1994), Ali Farka Toure and Ry Cooder If you ever doubt the possibility of relaxed and respectful conversation across the world’s cultural isions, then give yourself an hour with this astonishing collaboration between Mali’s Ali Farka Toure (who wrote all but one of the tracks) and California’s Ry Cooder (whose slide guitar travels through them like a pilgrim). Desert meets Delta Blues. HBCompared to the blues, the incalculable influence of gospel music on pop, soul and rock ’n’ roll has been underplayed. It can be found in every song on this brilliant 27-track compilation. If you can’t hear James Brown in the foot-stomping opener “Move on Up a Little Higher” by Brother Joe May, you’re not listening hard enough. The road to Motown from “Lord, Lord, Lord” by Professor Alex Bradford is narrow indeed, but you could still take a side-turning and follow his ecstatic whoops straight to Little Richard, who borrowed them, and on to the Beatles who copied them from him. The swooping chord changes in James Cleveland’s “My Soul Looks Back” are magnificent. All the irreplaceable soul voices, from Aretha Franklin to Bobby Womack, were steeped in gospel. This is a great place to hear where they came from. Companion album The Great Gospel Women is a marvel, too. CH“A lot of the music scene is just a wanking, self-congratulatory boys club,” said this angel-voiced, transgender artist in 2012. Four years later, the seismic drums and radical ecofeminist agenda of Hopelessness shook that club’s crumbling foundations to dust. The horrors of drone warfare, paedophilia and global warming are held up to the bright lights in disconcertingly beautiful rage. HBKurt Cobain had one goal with In Utero: to pull Nirvana away from what he dubbed the “candy-ass” sound on Nevermind – the album that had turned them into one of the biggest rock bands on the planet – and take them back to punk-rock. He asked Pixies’ producer Steve Albini to oversee production.  It didn’t exactly eschew commercial success upon release (it went on to sell 15m copies worldwide), but the heaviness the band felt as they recorded it bears down on the listener from the opening track. Disheartened by the media obsession with his personal life and the fans clamouring for the same old shit, In Utero is pure, undiluted rage. “GO AWAYYYYYYYYYYY” he screams on “Scentless Apprentice”, capturing the essence of Patrick Suskind’s novel Perfume: Story of a Murderer and using it as a metaphor for his disgust at the music industry, and the press. ROCurtis Mayfield had been spinning golden soul music from doo-wop roots with The Impressions for more than a decade before releasing his first solo album, which contains some of his greatest songs. While some point to the 1972 Blaxploitation soundtrack Superfly as the definitive Mayfield album, Curtis is deeper and more joyous, its complex arrangements masterly. Mayfield’s sweet falsetto sings of Nixon’s bland reassurances over the fuzz-bass of “(Don’t Worry) If There Is a Hell Below We’re All Going to Go” doleful horns give the politically conscious “We the People Who Are Darker Than Blue” a profound emotional undertow “Move On Up” is simply one of the most exhilarating songs in pop. To spend time with Curtis is to be in the presence of a beautiful soul. CHBefore they went their own way, Fleetwood Mac decided to tell a story that would be the quintessential marker for American rock culture in the Seventies. As Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks tossed the charred remains of their relationship at one another on “Dreams” and “Go Your Own Way”, the rest of the band conjured up the warm West Coast harmonies, the laid back California vibes of the rhythm section and the clear highs on “Gold Dust Woman”, in such a way that Rumours would become the definitive sound of the era. At the time of its release, it was the fastest-selling LP of all time its success turned Fleetwood Mac into a cultural phenomenon. ROA virtual unknown to rock fans just a year before – Hendrix used Are You Experienced? to assert himself as a guitar genius who could combine pop, blues, rock, R\u0026ampB, funk and psychedelia in a way no other artist had before. That’s even without the essential contributions of drummer Mitch Mitchell and bassist Noel Redding, who handed Are You Experienced? the rhythmic bridge between jazz and rock. Few album openers are as exquisite as “Purple Haze”. Few tracks are as gratifying, as sexy, as the strut on “Foxy Lady”. And few songs come close to the existential bliss caused by “The Wind Cries Mary”. Hendrix’s attack on the guitar contrasted against the more polished virtuosos in rock at the time – yet it is his raw ferocity that we find ourselves coming back to. Few debuts have changed the course of rock music as Hendrix did with his. RODisco’s crowning glory is this album that Chic’s Nile Rodgers and Bernard Edwards made with Kathy Sledge and her sisters Debbie, Joni and Kim. Nile and ’Nard were at the peak of their powers, classic songs were pouring out of them – We Are Family was released in the same year as the epochal “Good Times” by Chic – and this album has four of them, “Lost in Music”, “He’s the Greatest Dancer”, “Thinking of You” and the title track itself. Sister Sledge gave Rodgers a chance to work with warmer, gutsier vocals than the cool voices he used to give Chic records such laid-back style and the result is a floor-filling dance party, punctuated by mellow ballads. CHShe added: “In fact that’s why I\u0026nbspsat down with him in the first place. I\u0026nbspsaw an opportunity to pick someone so opposite’s brain and try to talk some sense into them which i understand is highly unlikely but I\u0026nbspwill not apologise for trying. That’s all.”Grande said in a follow-up message she was “anything but complacent” during her conversation with Morgan, adding: “I\u0026nbspwon’t stop having conversations with people I\u0026nbspdisagree with when I\u0026nbspsee the opportunity to.”Morgan shared a photo of himself with Grande earlier this week on Twitter, saying they had spoken for about two hours.“We laughed, we argued, she cried, I nearly did, the drinks flowed and\u0026nbspwe bonded,” he wrote. “Turns out we really like each other. Weird.”The message left some Twitter users baffled, including one person who wrote: “Ew Ariana why.”Someone else tweeted: “ARIANA NO,” while another person wrote: “Don’t like this.”In addition to their spat over Little Mix, Morgan criticised Grande after the 2017 Manchester Arena bombing for not immediately visiting the victims of the attack. He apologised after Grande held the One Love Manchester concert, saying he had misjudged her.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The vast majority of MOO’s sales are in the huge North American market, now accounting for 75 per cent of their revenues.In addition to its well known cards, the company’s range also includes hard- and softcover notebooks and business cardholders, among other things. Its London headquarters have recently moved from a warehouse in Shoreditch to a 35,000 square foot space down the road in Farringdon, which comes complete with an ice-cream machine, pool tables and a “library” – a giant bookcase, where MOO employees can bring in books to place on shelves.Created with Sketch.Hot desks: The coolest office spaces in the world Show all 5Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.So it might be hard to imagine the first iteration of the business was a bit of a flop, with the company nearly dying in late 2005.What changed? A little creativity and a lot of persistence.Born and raised in north London, Moross, now 40, describes his younger self as more creative than studious.“It wasn’t like I wanted to be a policeman or a firefighter. I didn’t have a clear sense of what I wanted to do,” he tells\u0026nbspThe Independent.“Retrospectively, it’s interesting that no one ever talks about becoming an entrepreneur at school. I remember doing career coaching and going to job fairs, and entrepreneurship was very underrepresented as an option,” he adds.Moross attended Sussex University to study philosophy and politics – a course he enjoyed, although he wasn’t inclined to make a career out of it. “I wasn’t interested in becoming a politician, and professional philosopher isn’t that much of a job,” he says.After a brief spell at the BBC he joined a startup called Sorted, a tool that told users about the hidden places – from coffee houses to bookstores – in their neighbourhood.The business eventually ran out of money and closed in 2001, prompting Moross to get involved with Imagination, a design agency.“What I loved at Imagination was working on big brands with smart people. But what I was missing in that role was being able to design products and make products better and more exciting. I didn’t want to do the campaign around the car, I wanted to make it.” he says.All of MOO’s products are sold via its websiteIt was 2004 when, during a sleepless night, Moross first had the idea to launch a startup selling paper cards. His first enterprise – the rather ambiguously named Pleasure Cards.“MOO was once Pleasure Cards. A great idea with a horrible name\u0026nbspthat didn’t work for all sorts of good reasons,” he admits.“The idea was to create a business card for your social life – to give out at a party, say, instead of in a business meeting.”Set up with £100,000 of seed finance from angel investor Robin Klein (who is still on the board of MOO today), the idea never took off.“By the end of the first year of business we were quickly running out of cash and people didn’t understand the concept. “I thought that instead of making these social cards, we should start printing for social networks, help people put their photographs on paper, give them access to design tools in order to make their brands look good.”The company was saved by a lucrative tie-up with photo-sharing website Flickr, which allowed users to print their pictures onto the business cards – sparking a lot of interest from investors.The promise of real revenue was enough to secure another £5m in investment and that was when MOO as we know it today was born.In the age of smartphones, the process of handing out a physical card with your information on it can seem remarkably outdated. But\u0026nbspthe digital revolution actually gave new life to one of the world’s oldest industries.Moross says: “Business cards might be 300 years old but without digital technology our business wouldn’t exist. We sell 100 per cent of our products through the website.”“MOO cards can also carry a different image on every single card, thanks to the digital printing press.“It show that, in a digital world, good quality physical objects still matter. Meeting someone is a much more special experience than receiving an email. When you meet in person, you want to be remembered and our hope is that our card helps you make that connection.”That is not to say that MOO has not made a few digital updates since its launch. In 2015, the firm released a new range of cards embedded with near-field communication technology that connects it directly to a web page or social media network when tapped with a smartphone.To fight off competition you need to understand the landscape, what your customers want and what they value. We’re constantly looking ahead and thinking of how we can make our products better.MOO is also continuously trying to improve its green credentials and sticking its nose into the world of eco-friendly papers.In 2017, the company collaborated with Mohawk Fine Papers to take discarded cotton T-shirt scraps and give them new life as premium business cards.Usually, the scraps left behind from a T-shirt go to waste. But MOO takes these bits of fabric and uses a traditional printing technique to turn it into a high-quality paper.“To fight off competition you need to understand the landscape, what your customers want and what they value,” Moross says.“We’re constantly looking ahead and thinking of how we can make our products better.“In the case of cards made out of cotton, many of our competitors already have eco paper – but we took one step further to create a new type of better quality green paper.”At about £14 for a pack of 50 original cards and £25 for a pack of luxe cards (printed on extra-thick luxury paper), MOO cards are a premium product. But they remain a cheaper option for those looking for customised business cards without the need to enlist a designer.“To some extent, if all you need is very cheap business card, you can just write an email to that person with your signature or write your number on a piece of paper.“But professional design is expensive and hard to access. So we talk about great design for everyone and we think about how to use technology to make the design cheaper and the software accessible or how we can help professional designers make their brand stand out.”A View from the Top: Jonathan Sattin, founder of Triyoga A View from the Top with insurance boss Amanda BlancA View From The Top: Kaidi Ruusalepp, founder of FunderbeamA View from the Top with Herschel Mayers, CEO of VitalityWhen MOO was first founded, the team, which then consisted of just eight people, decided they would gather for a staff lunch on a weekly basis.Fifteen years later, the tradition endures, with employees being treated to free lunch every Friday.Moross, a keen photographer who has visited more than 60 countries, wants employees to have a life outside their jobs, believing this only increases productivity and creativity.“I tend not to work on weekends and I switch off very easily. You’re failing at your job if you’re 15 years in and you’re still working every hour of the day. You’re either failing at your job or you’re failing at your life and probably robbing your team of the things they could be doing.“I want people to come to work and be themselves. No one has to wear a suit and tie unless they want to, they can wear what they would at home – providing they wear clothes, of course.”Refreshingly, for a tech veteran who has little to prove to anyone, Moross can’t seem to rest on his laurels and is already looking to the next steps. “It’s always about pushing the business further. “This year, we’ll be expanding our product range and building much more for professional designers. But at the end of the day, it all comes down to building a good, strong, sustainable business.”We’ll tell you what’s true.

This is the opportunity to bring new technology and a new approach to the sector,” she said.Craig Donaldson, CEO of  Bank, said the grant “allows us to accelerate our plans to revolutionise banking for SMEs”. “It will help us bring much needed competition to the underserved SME hotspots in the north, while investing in our digital capabilities and creating new jobs,” he added.ClearBank, the first clearing bank to launch in Britain for 250 years, teamed up with SME specialist platform Tide to apply for the grant.Tide\u0027s chief executive Oliver Prill said the grant will help the company grow market share and that it will match the grant with further investment of its own.Additional reporting by wiresWe’ll tell you what’s true.

The Bank of England recently downgraded the outlook for growth. If the government’s official forecasts follow a similar path, £5bn will be added to the deficit in the medium-term.The Institute for Fiscal Studies said the chancellor is on track for below-target borrowing of £22bn this year but was not entirely optimistic.“Even in spite of today’s good news ...\u0026nbspthere could be tricky fiscal arithmetic for the chancellor as he considers how best to respond to uncertainty around Brexit and how much money to make available to departments at this year’s spending review,” the IFS said.Howard Archer, chief economic adviser to the forecasting group EY ITEM Club, said: “A record high surplus on the January public finances provides a much-needed boost for Chancellor Philip Hammond as he faces a worrying backdrop to his Spring Statement on 13 March.“With the economy clearly struggling early on in 2019 after a sharp slowdown in the fourth quarter of 2018 and the Brexit situation highly uncertain, the chancellor will have a lot on his mind when he presents the Spring Statement.“It looks highly likely that he will have to announce downgraded growth forecasts from the OBR (Office for Budget Responsibility) at least for the near term with possible negative ramifications for expected budget deficits.”We’ll tell you what’s true.

But scientists didn\u0027t know that they themselves were still wrapped in the edges of the\u0026nbspgeocorona.The extra source of hydrogen laying far out from Earth is not enough to allow space exploration, or to support any kind of human life. Down here, it would be referred to as a vacuum.But fortunately those particles do not pose any threat for anyone interacting with them, such as future space travellers that hope to journey to orbit around the Moon.“There is also ultraviolet radiation associated to the geocorona, as the hydrogen atoms scatter sunlight in all directions, but the impact on astronauts in lunar orbit would be negligible compared to the main source of radiation -- the Sun,” says Jean-Loup Bertaux, co-author and former principal investigator of SWAN, the instrument that made the founding.But it could get in the way of future observations around the Moon, the researchers caution.“Space telescopes observing the sky in ultraviolet wavelengths to study the chemical composition of stars and galaxies would need to take this into account,” adds Jean-Loup.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This amounts to around 100,000 students, if the results were reflected across the UK. \u0026nbsp \u0026nbspAnd the poll, of more than 1,600 students, reveals that nearly half\u0026nbspof those who have accrued debt have in excess of £1,000 and one in five owe more than £5,000.Created with Sketch.Student news in pictures Show all 34Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.South Korean policemen detain student protestors during a protest against South Korean President Park Geun-Hye outside the National Assembly in Seoul, South Korea.Filipino demonstrators face off with anti-riot police during a protest near the US Embassy in Manila, PhilippineHundreds of protesters including Indigenous People, students and militant groups marched towards the US Embassy to protest against the presence of US military troops and condemning the violent dispersal which left at least forty people hurt including twenty police officers and three people who were run over by a police vanA federal judge in Mexico has ordered that a once-fugitive police chief be held on charges of kidnapping in the disappearance of 43 studentsA man holds up a photograph of a missing student with a caption reading \u0027We are missing 43,\u0027 during a meeting marking the 25-month anniversary of the disappearances of 43 students in the southern state of Guerrero, in Mexico City.

And gambling has become more accessible to young people amid the rise in technology, the NUS says.Institutions must do more to raise awareness of the dangers of unsafe gambling and to signpost to other support that is available, the NUS and Gambling Commission have warned.Jason Heffron, a student at the University of Birmingham, used to turn to gambling when money was tight. He said: “At vulnerable times I’d often end up losing money that I couldn’t afford to lose.”In his second year, the student lost £500 over a few weeks and he struggled to pay the rent when he found himself £1,000 into his overdraft. He gave up gambling not long after the incident.He said: “When you are at university, when you are a bit more vulnerable to the benefits financially, you chase that high. You are only living off a few hundred pounds for a few months.“A rise in living cost is definitely a problem. Rent prices are crazy for most major cities now. Most student loans don’t cover rent so you need financial support before you even think about living.”Ban scratchcards for under 18s, minister saysThe government needs to overhaul the funding system for higher education and provide more student support to students so they are less vulnerable to gambling, the NUS says.Eva Crossan Jory, NUS vice president for welfare, told The Independent: “Students have said the only way that they can pay rent is to gamble. That is really worrying.“I think anecdotally more students are relying on gambling as a means of finance rather than just doing it for fun. I think previously people were not doing it as much as a means of survival.”She added: “It is so easy nowadays to gamble on your phone and not even realise that you may have a serious addiction. It doesn’t always seem like real money when it is all online.”Speaking ahead of the government’s review of post-18 education and funding, Ms Crossan Jory said: “There needs to be a renewed focus on the reasons why some students feel it’s necessary to supplement their income through gambling – which not only land\u0026nbspstudents in even greater debt, but also can lead to feelings of guilt, stress and depression.”Gambling firms to stop advertising during live sporting eventsOnline casinos hit with millions in fines amid regulator clampdownMore than 50,000 under-17s have gambling problems, report revealsHelen Rhodes, programme director of the Gambling Commission, which helped the NUS to develop the survey, said: “These results add extra emphasis that there is a significant risk for young adults and for students that needs to be addressed, and we welcome the part the NUS is playing to do so.”John de Pury, assistant director of policy at Universities UK (UUK), said: “Universities are focused on student welfare to support wellbeing and learning. This includes efforts to educate students on risky behaviours and to mitigate the impact of such behaviours on their university experience. \u0026nbsp“Online gambling is an issue that applies more widely than to simply the student population. It needs concerted intervention by government to act on risks of online gambling and addictive behaviours.”UUK called on the government to provide sufficient support to cover living and tuition costs for those most in need.A Department for Education spokesperson said: “No student should have to face this situation or experience any pressures or barriers to them accessing higher education.“Students from the lowest-income households who started their courses this year have access to the largest ever amounts of cash-in-hand support for their living costs.“We have a world-class higher education system and following the introduction of our progressive student finance system there is a record rate of 18-year-olds from disadvantaged backgrounds now going to university.“As a government, we are backing the University Mental Health Charter, led by Student Minds, to encourage vulnerable students to seek out support when they need it.“We are also carrying out a review of post-18\u0026nbspeducation and funding to look at how the system can work better for everyone, ensuring value for money for students and taxpayers.”We’ll tell you what’s true.

As a new breed of smartphones, Huawei Mate X combines 5G, foldable screen, AI and an all-new mode of interfacing to provide consumers with an unprecedented user experience.The Huawei Mate X will be the first key for consumers to open the door to 5G smart living.The company confirmed the new device would cost 2,299 Euro - higher than Samsung\u0027s Galaxy Fold, which has been given a price tag of 1,980 dollars.The Chinese firm\u0027s presence in the 5G infrastructure market remains a geopolitical talking point, with the United States warning European countries it may find it difficult to work with anyone who choose to use Huawei products in their networks, after raising security concerns over the Chinese company.But Huawei appears to be ignoring these on-going issues as it continues to expand its phone business.Now the second largest smartphone maker in the world, it is also due to unveil a new range of flagship devices in Paris next month.In terms of its foldable device, The Mate X will also come with fingerprint sensor built into its power button as well as featuring a camera system engineered with German camera firm Leica.Additional reporting by agenciesBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But might history actually be on the side of the new movement, asks Adam LusherClick to followThe IndependentMarkus Keaney, local Labour chair, says Shuker would be annihilated in a by-electionIt’s not every day you get to rock a flat cap and give a Trotsky turn of phrase to the BBC News from Luton.\u0026nbspBut Markus Keaney, chair of Luton South Constituency Labour Party, managed it all this week, when\u0026nbsphe discussed his recently departed ex-comrade Gavin Shuker, the constituency’s MP.Keaney looked forward to the day when the defector to the Independent Group would be “consigned to the dustbin of history” and\u0026nbsp“annihilated” by an official Labour candidate at a by-election.\u0026nbspHis words were uttered\u0026nbspwith the cold rage of a man who knows his local party committee procedure and is prepared to use it in the cause of “passionate new members enthused by the promise of a break from neoliberalism” – as he described the post-Jeremy Corbyn intake in his September\u0026nbspMorning Star article, written after a\u0026nbspno-confidence vote taken by party members against\u0026nbspShuker was carried.But, to refer to the context in which Trotsky popularised the “dustbin of history” line, who here were the doomed Mensheviks, and who the 1917 Bolsheviks arising to greet the new post-Capitalist dawn?\u0026nbspAs the Independent Group went cross-party with the arrival of three defecting Conservatives, were we witnessing the start of something like Emmanuel Macron’s French En Marche!\u0026nbspmovement? Or would Keaney still get his annihilation moment?\u0026nbspShuker and the Labour splitCould it be the Corbyn project that is doomed?\u0026nbspPerhaps lessons could be learned in Luton, a town with some claim to being a bit of a bellwether.\u0026nbspUntil\u0026nbspShuker upset the trend by getting elected for Labour in 2010, the Luton South constituency had gone to the party that won the general election in every contest since 1951.Created with Sketch.Which MPs have defected from parties to join the Independent Group?

You never change things from the outside. He should stand his ground and try to f***ing sort it from inside.”There might be another party we could vote for, with our vote meaning something, not the current dual system. A bit like the Gang of Four. That didn’t happen, did it? But I am a born optimistAnd yet. The more you spoke to Gallagher, and his workmates, and others, the more you sensed a certain sympathy for Shuker and the points he was making about “abuse” in the party, about failure to oppose hard Brexit, and about Jeremy Corbyn.Painter and decorator John Brydson, 68, initially described himself as a Tory-voting Brexit supporter. But it turned out the backstory was more tangled, in ways that might favour Shuker, not Corbyn. “I was Labour for 50 years,” said Brydson.\u0026nbsp“But when Corbyn came in, I changed to Tory.\u0026nbspThere will never be a Labour government while he is at the head of the Labour Party.”Shuker was one of seven Labour members to quit the party on Monday\u0026nbsp(PA)He too didn’t like the way Shuker had left the party. “But yeah, I would vote for him, even though the way he went about it was wrong.”There was a moment of reflection when you mentioned\u0026nbspKeaney’s prediction that a by-election would see Shuker “annihilated” by an official Labour candidate.\u0026nbsp“I don’t think so,” said Mr Brydson softly.MPs: Joan Ryan,\u0026nbspHeidi Allen, Anna Soubry and Sarah Wollaston (Reuters)Gallagher, meanwhile, seemed to be moving a long way in a short discussion, from “absolute rubbish” to “fair play to him”.\u0026nbspHe was an unwavering Labour man, he insisted: “All my life, working-class, always vote Labour.”But when you put him on the spot, and ask\u0026nbsphim to pick sides in a by-election fight between Shuker and a Keaney-approved Corbyn Labour candidate, there was a long pause.\u0026nbsp“Christ, you would have to go with Shuker, wouldn’t you?\u0026nbspYou would have to go sensible. The bloke with the cap, a proper lefty, wasn’t he?\u0026nbspToo much hatred in his voice, I thought.”The more ardent anti-neoliberal Corbynistas may not wish to be reminded of the old aphorism that the Labour Party owes more to Methodism than Marxism.\u0026nbspBut it was impossible to ignore as you sat in the Hardware Cafe\u0026nbspand pondered the new battle for the soul of British politics.\u0026nbspThe view from the cafe windows was dominated by the Mount Tabor Primitive Methodist Chapel, built 1897, grandeur unfaded, the names of the Victorian worthies who supported the project carved in stone for all to see.\u0026nbspMethodism still seemed to be triumphing over Marxism in 2019.\u0026nbspAl Short, 51, social worker and Christian, arrived.\u0026nbspHe still believed in the ideals of 2015, when Corbyn was promising a “kinder, gentler politics”. He regarded the Labour leader as “a pretty principled, genuine kind of guy, who cares for the poor, offers a genuine alternative.”And yet in a very gentle, very Christian kind of way, and despite his vote for Brexit, Short seemed to be warming to Shuker and this new Independent Group.\u0026nbsp“I am a Christian.\u0026nbspGavin Shuker is a Christian. I have a sense of rapport with him.”He even went as far as hoping the gang of 11\u0026nbsp(and counting) could prove a more successful update of the Gang of Four, who for a brief 1980s flurry had\u0026nbsplooked as if they might reshape British politics by leaving Labour and forming the SDP.Shuker (right) with his colleagues announcing their breakaway\u0026nbsp(PA)Short smiled, as if imagining a mildly exciting future: “There might be another party we could vote for, with our vote meaning something, not the current dual system. A bit like the Gang of Four. That didn’t happen, did it?\u0026nbspBut I am a born optimist.”Shuker will face an altogether feistier proposition in Short’s support-worker colleague Lorna Calliste, 42, east London-born daughter of a Trinidadian mother, now a mum to four kids by an Irish builder, and a committed Brexit supporter.\u0026nbsp“No, no, no,” was the unequivocal response to Shuker’s talk of taking a stand against “hard Tory Brexit”.But if Calliste wasn’t exactly brimming with excitement for Shuker and the Independent Group, she didn’t seem a natural fit with\u0026nbspCorbyn’s Labour either.\u0026nbsp“Labour has\u0026nbspgone silly.\u0026nbspThey want to let everyone in the country.\u0026nbspWhy can’t we have an Australian system where we let someone in if they have something to offer?”In the Hardware Cafe, you began to sense that going against his constituency’s Brexit vote would not fatally undermine Shuker, and that, however fuzzily, other elements of what the Independent Group was saying had hit home.Luciana Berger’s message was remembered, even if her name wasn’t (PA)Luciana Berger may exist in the Luton South consciousness as “the lady with the dark hair”, but many agreed with her that “what’s happening with the antisemitism is disgusting”.\u0026nbspAnd the notion that politics is “broken” sold itself.Stephen McNeilly had been excited by politics, once.\u0026nbspNow the 39-year-old electrician placed himself firmly in the camp of “the name Gavin Shuker rings a bell”.\u0026nbspHis disillusion with politics was a badge of pride, enlivened by references to Corbyn as “an absolute plank” to Brexit as a “f***ing shambles” to former Luton South MP Margaret Moran, whose life fell apart when she was caught “fiddling her expenses”.My son, his friends, many young people: they don’t know what happened in the past, and they want to give Corbyn a tryAnd yet, in almost the same lament, McNeilly seemed to be crying out for someone to inspire him and all the others languishing in the ranks of the disillusioned.\u0026nbsp“There’s no Martin Luther King figure,” he said.\u0026nbsp“No one with fresh ideas, no one with a voice, to make people stand up and listen.”Vividly expressed disillusion began to sound a little like an open invitation to Shuker and his Independent Group – all the more so when McNeilly turned to his own, conflicted feelings about having voted Leave.MPs have left the Labour party to form independent group“Every single thing I voted for – stopping immigration first and foremost – will be made null and void.\u0026nbspWe’re going to be financially crippled, kicked in the teeth. The dreadful thing is,\u0026nbspI would want to reverse it and vote Remain.”Perhaps all the conversations seemed to be running Shuker’s way.Why the Independent Group won’t succeed without electoral reformCabinet ministers back new Independent Group, claim Tory defectorsEx-Tory MP says battle for party is over as Brexit hardliners have wonBut then, Edward, a rather thoughtful 68-year-old, looked up from his book, and wondered whether we might be seeing things through a bit of a mainstream media haze.\u0026nbsp“My son’s 29,” said Edward, “And, I think, rather fooled by Corbyn.\u0026nbspSomehow Corbyn has got into young people, by young person’s media.\u0026nbspI suppose I am a centrist dad.\u0026nbspI’m so old I remember the Labour government of the 1970s that led us into trouble, into strikes.“But my son, his friends, many young people: they don’t know what happened in the past, and they want to give Corbyn a try.”But do they really, still?\u0026nbspThe University of Bedfordshire’s campus offered the chance of a probably wildly unscientific straw poll of the much-discussed millennial generation.\u0026nbspIt left you wondering whether the fever of Corbyn-mania may have cooled somewhat since the heady days of the June 2017 general election.Kieran Nixon, 23, was president of the student union, but when he spoke in a personal capacity he began to sound like a lot of others on campus.\u0026nbspHe voted Labour in 2015 because his parents did.\u0026nbspHe voted Labour in 2017 because of genuine enthusiasm for Corbyn.\u0026nbsp“He kind of set up this persona,” said Nixon, “that he was new, fresh, ‘down with the kids’, articulate.\u0026nbspI saw him going to festivals, saying he would clear the student loan debt.“But now it just feels like it was a pipe dream.\u0026nbspI don’t think I can see him being prime minister.\u0026nbspHe seems short of ideas, too quick to pass the blame to Theresa May.\u0026nbspHe doesn’t come up with any worthwhile solution to Brexit that could get accepted by Brussels.”“Maybe,” said Nixon, recalling that summer when he was 20 months younger and Corbyn was at Glastonbury, “going to festivals doesn’t really say professionalism.”Daisie Johnson: ‘The world seems in turmoil, but I don’t hear much about Corbyn opposing Brexit’ (Adam Lusher)Daisie Johnson also liked the Glastonbury appearance, at the time.\u0026nbsp“Corbyn tries to talk to young people,” said the psychology and criminal behaviour student. “Which is more than you can say for Theresa May.”But now, the full impact of the EU referendum – in which she was too young to participate – has hit home:\u0026nbsp“The world seems in turmoil, but I don’t hear much about Jeremy Corbyn opposing Brexit.\u0026nbspThat doesn’t seem to come up on the news feed.\u0026nbspI’m probably more for this other guy if he is against Brexit and Corbyn isn’t.”So no,\u0026nbspJohnson didn’t know who “this other guy” Shuker was.\u0026nbspAnd she didn’t really see how the Independent Group could turn a bit of House of Commons seating rearrangement into real change.\u0026nbsp“Where’s the majority to do anything? I don’t really get it.”Soubry and Sarah Wollaston join their new honourable friends\u0026nbspin the House of Commons (PA)But nor did McNeilly really get it when we began talking, and now he was at least a little interested.\u0026nbsp“I’ll try to catch a glimpse of what he’s saying,” said the 39-year-old.\u0026nbsp“More power to the guy: a journey of 1,000 miles starts with one step.”So what if that first step will be Shuker telling us who he is? They sneered at Macron to begin with, and he made it into the Elysee, avoiding the dustbin of history.\u0026nbspKeaney might be annoyed, but perhaps Shuker can take comfort in the fact there was even a time when no one knew who Trotsky and the Bolsheviks were either.We’ll tell you what’s true.

The new project that has not only envisioned but created such a molecule.“Life detection is an increasingly important goal of NASA’s planetary science missions, and this new work will help us to develop effective instruments and experiments that will expand the scope of what we look for,” said Lori Glaze, acting director of NASA’s Planetary Science Division.European Space Agency announces name of brand new Mars roverThe new research saw scientists create a new kind of molecule system that functions like DNA, but has an important difference. Instead of the usual four ingredients, it contains eight.It has all of the four that are found in life on Earth:\u0026nbspadenine, cytosine, guanine, and thymine. But it has four extra, synthetic ones, that mimic the structures of the ingredients found in regular DNA.The researchers call the new creation hachimoji” DNA – hachi means eight in Japanese, and moji means letter. It functions the same as our DNA, meeting the same requirements that allow it to store and transmit information.That has meant that the kinds of molecules that might be storing information in life on alien worlds could be similarly different. It suggests that life could structure itself in different ways than it does on Earth, at the most fundamental level – meaning that environments Earth-bound life could never live in might be teeming with unimagined life forms.“Incorporating a broader understanding of what is possible in our instrument design and mission concepts will result in a more inclusive and, therefore, more effective search for life beyond Earth,” said Mary Voytek, senior scientist for Astrobiology at NASA Headquarters.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

They use futuristic motors to allow them to be precisely tightened up automatically, without any shoelaces or other input.All of that can be controlled by an app, which allows people to slip on the shoes and then let the motors do the work of tightening them up, in a way shoelaces would traditionally work. They use much the same technology that allowed Nike to recreate the self-lacing shoes from Back To The Future in a limited run.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialBut that feature has broken after the Android app stopped syncing with the sneakers.

Well, good things come to those who wait. The iconic 1461s from heritage Midlands brand Dr Martens are now also being made in a super shiny synthetic material that mimics patent leather, so that everybody – men included! – can bring a touch of rockstar to their footwear. The inner sole is worth paying that bit for – it’s air-cushioned and resistant to oil, meaning no slipping and blisters. We were relieved to find that these didn’t need to be broken in like other Docs do – they were comfy from the first day of wearing them and looked slick with trousersleggings or a grungy dress. Colour-wise, you can choose from black, the cherry red (seen here), silver chrome or rose gold chrome.Firstly, yes, these are Star Wars-themed trainers (think rubber Rebel Alliance badge, Star Wars logo and galactic silver colouring), so if you’re not a fan of the movie space saga, they might not be for you. If you or a friend are, however, they’ll make the perfect affordable footwear gift. They slip on and are fantastically comfortable from the off. The outer is made with linen and Pinatex (a fibre made from pineapple leaves), the lining is organic cotton canvas and the insole is made from cork and natural latex, which moulds to your natural foot shape. Islington-born brand Po-Zu (meaning to pause in Japanese) is not entirely vegan, but much of its offering is, and all shoes are ethically produced in Portuguese or Sri Lankan factories using sustainable materials. For the height of vegan sophistication, no-one does brogues better than Will’s Vegan Store in London. Made with a kind of Italian faux leather created from plants and organic bio oil, they are fully decked out with the traditional brogue trim. Our top colour pick is the tan – it shows up all that intricate stitching beautifully – but they come in black or dark brown too. The durable rubber soles offer strong grip, the comfy insoles are made with recycled rubber and there’s a small block heel for added suave. Sizing is regular though if you normally look for halves, go one up. The Vegan Society has given this entire range the green light, and Will’s is a carbon neutral company that only uses plastic-free packaging, making this the ultimate in ethical browsing.411 Merrell all out crush 2 gore-tex: £120, MerrellFor the more active vegans among you, trustworthy trainers are a must-buy. US brand Merrell often pops up as a go-to brand for its small but reliable range of versatile shoes and after trying a pair for ourselves, we can see why. This lightweight pair of colourful kicks are built from Gore-Tex, a synthetic material, which is breathable and waterproof so will protect your feet in all running conditions. The heel is lined with lycra to help prevent rubbing and the sole boasts an impressive grip, even through slippy mud. In fact, these were designed especially with Tough Mudder-type challenges in mind. Expect your arches to feel well-supported, with plenty of room for broader feet. They come in black too, but why go boring when you can go jazzy with these bright blue, pink and coral dazzlers? Half sizes are also available.What we love about Birks is that you’re offered the choice between regular width (on the wide side) and narrow width, meaning everyone can find a pair of sandals to live in next summer, regardless of the shape of their feet. These have criss-crossed straps that are more slender than the classic design you might be used to. They’re made from Birko-Flor – essentially PVC with a breathable fleece-like lining. Its look mimics leather’s two-tone effect and feels just as gentle on the skin while being easier to clean. It’s win-win. The footbed, meanwhile, is the German footwear giant’s standard cork with arch support, only it’s lined with microfibre, not suede. The sole is made from an elastic material with excellent cushioning. Our pick of the three colours is the cream (pair it with any summer dress imaginable), but we might have to splurge on the dark grey and rose too. Here’s hoping they offer a vegan version of the yellow ones soon.611 Collection \u0026amp Co porto black lace up brogues: £120, Collection \u0026amp CoFor something that bit edgier, check out the new, fully vegan, Bristol-based footwear brand Collection \u0026amp Co, who are doing all sorts of cool things with waste materials in an effort to be more sustainable. We fell in love with these lace-up brogues, which come in jet black or rusty orange. They’re made in small, ethically-run Portuguese factories from soft faux leather, with faux suede side panels to add textural interest to the design. They slip on and off and have padded insoles for extra comfort, while rubber soles will withstand a pounding of the streets on a shopping mission. The 4cm block heels add a glam bit of height, although shoe lovers with wider feet might want to go for a size up as these are a bit on the narrow side. Oh, and they’ve got Peta’s seal of approval, too.Go back to basics with some canvas shoes specially designed by minimalist British shoe company VivoBarefoot to mimic the sensation of being barefoot and free. These dotty delights are handmade in Ethiopia in partnership with social enterprise, Soul of Africa, which supports education projects for disadvantaged kids. Even the print – choose from black or natural – has been designed in collaboration with local painters. Canadian accessories brand Matt \u0026amp Nat totally shun all animal-derived materials, so you can shop conscience-free (sorry, reader’s bank balance). These 3-inch block heeled Chelsea boots caught our eye, and certainly do away with any preconceptions that vegan shoes can’t be ethical, comfortable and stylish. In fact, the company’s motto is live beautifully, in more ways than one. The Peta-approved Kalistas have a sophisticated pointed toe and are made from black imitation leather, which you’d never know wasn’t the real deal. They pull on easily thanks to a smart elasticated ankle panel and came up true to size, while the gum rubber sole is hard-wearing enough to see you through those long days dashing between meetings – and finally to the pub afterwards!Every woman needs a reliable pair of black stiletto heels, be it for work, play or both. These faux leather beauties from Brighton-based vegan footwear brand Beyond Skin were recommended to us by a vegan pal who was overjoyed to find some plastic-made shoes that didn’t rub and give her blisters (it doesn’t give as well as leather does, though). Handmade in Spain, they have pointed toes, a breathable faux leather lining made from recycled materials and a heel of roughly 9cm. Peta has given them the thumbs up, so you can strut down the corridor feeling ethically awesome. No wonder Oscar-winning actor Natalie Portman is one of many famous fans. Some sizes may be out of stock online but we’ve been assured that they’ll be back in shortly, with pre-orders sent out in early March – so don’t panic!M\u0026ampS deserves a shout-out as a high street store with a huge range of vegan shoes that aren’t just kind to animals, but well-made and chic too. We were drawn to these metal trim loafers, which come in cheery cherry red or classic black and offer women with broader feet a wide fit option. The man-made material mimics suede (so be careful in rainy weather) and has an elegant check lining. They’re an absolute steal at just £25 a pair, and so comfy you’ll forget to take them off when you get home from a long day’s slog. The only downside is that there are no half sizes – if in doubt size up and grab some insoles.Roll back to the Seventies with these laid-back corduroy kicks from Californian footwear favourite Toms. Though not a vegan brand per se, the company offers an extensive range of shoes that are. These sneakers, inspired by the Sunshine State’s seaside towns, shot straight to the top of our must have list as they tick our three boxes: ethical, comfortable and cool. They’re also not like any shoes we’ve spotted elsewhere, so expect compliments from admiring strangers on the street. Though blissfully lightweight to wear with a cushioned insole, they’re also sturdy thanks to a rubber sole. Our faves are the turquoise, but the spicy red ones are hot too. Catch ‘em while they’re 40 per cent off in the sale and you could even justify buying both, especially as for every pair sold, Toms gives another to an underprivileged child.

In truth, serial killer drama Zodiac is every bit as good as the Facebook drama.The show is expected to focus on what has been a strong year for music in film, with Best Actress hopeful Lady Gaga down to perform “Shallow” from the third remake of A Star is Born with director and co-star Bradley Cooper.The 10 best winners of Best Picture at the OscarsThe controversies surrounding this year\u0027s Oscars Best Picture nomineesEverything we know about the 2019 OscarsGillian Welch and David Rawlings will perform “When a Cowboy Trades His Spurs for Wings” from the Coen Brothers’s The Ballad of Buster Scruggs and Jennifer Hudson will sing “I’ll Fight” from the documentary RBG.\u0026nbspThe Favourite\u0027s Olivia Colman is in pole position to land Best Actress for her superb performance as Queen Anne while co-stars Rachel Weisz and Emma Stone will continue their ficitonal rivalry in the Best Supporting Actress category.

This is the opportunity to bring new technology and a new approach to the sector,” she said.Craig Donaldson, CEO of  Bank, said the grant “allows us to accelerate our plans to revolutionise banking for SMEs”. “It will help us bring much needed competition to the underserved SME hotspots in the north, while investing in our digital capabilities and creating new jobs,” he added.ClearBank, the first clearing bank to launch in Britain for 250 years, teamed up with SME specialist platform Tide to apply for the grant.Tide\u0027s chief executive Oliver Prill said the grant will help the company grow market share and that it will match the grant with further investment of its own.Additional reporting by wiresWe’ll tell you what’s true.

Prices for the Galaxy S10 start at £799.As the name suggests, the S10+ is essentially a plus-sized version of the S10.Measuring 6.4-inches, the S10+ features the same triple-lens setup on the rear of the phone but adds another lens to the front.It can also hold an incredible\u0026nbsp1.5 terabytes of data – 500GB more than its nearest rival (the Galaxy Note9) – if its 512GB expandable memory is utilised.The battery on the S10+ is also enormous, though without real-world testing it\u0027s difficult to say how far this will go in an average user\u0027s day.Up to 12GB of RAM makes this smartphone more powerful than most modern laptops.Prices for the Galaxy S10+ start at £899The Galaxy S10 5G is huge – and not only because of its 6.7-inch frame.Its real significance comes in its support for 5G, the next-generation mobile network that will define communications for the next decade.This phone will appeal to anyone wanting to see what this new world might look like, though it\u0027s likely going to be at least a year before 5G rolls out on any significant scale.In terms of general specs, the Galaxy S10 5G is most similar to the Galaxy S10, with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of internal storage.\u0026nbspSamsung is yet to announce a price or exact\u0026nbsprelease date for the Galaxy S10 5G, though it will likely be coming at some point in the summer.While some may be questioning what the point of a folding phone is, others are heralding the Galaxy Fold as the future of smartphones.Like the S10 5G, this is a phone for early adopters, with future generations likely to iron out any kinks that may arise from such a radically new technology.It comes with 512GB of internal storage as standard, 12GB of RAM and an incredible six cameras.\u0026nbspSamsung is yet to announce the cost of the Galaxy Fold in the UK, but with prices in the US set at $1,980 and €2,000 in Europe, British buyers can expect to pay around £1,600.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The watchdog said\u0026nbspSolarplicity’s\u0026nbspcustomer\u0026nbspservice “has been poor for a number of months”.Between March and September last year\u0026nbspthere was an unacceptably high proportion of calls abandoned and unacceptably long call waiting times, Ofgem said.Although call handling has improved, the regulator said it “has not seen the required improvements elsewhere”.Created with Sketch.Solar powered bulbs light the way in the developing world Show all 3Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Measures Ofgem has recommended include ensuring customer contact channels are improved, managed and maintained, with queries and issues being resolved in a timely manner, and making sure the switching process goes smoothly, with switches completed within the required timescales. Mary Starks, executive director of consumers and markets at Ofgem, said: “We have taken action against Solarplicity to protect its customers from experiencing further detriment. “Solarplicity must get its house in order and provide a level of service that its customers expect. If not, Ofgem will take the necessary steps to ensure customers are further protected and will take the relevant action needed to do this, which may result in its licence being revoked.” SSE hikes energy bills by £117 for millions of customersWave power device could reduce energy bills, scientists sayPlan to cut energy bills will add £1bn to household costs this yearEnergy cap hike condemned: have the critics got it right? On Friday, Alex Neill, Which? managing director of home services, said: “Solarplicity\u0026nbspfinished rock bottom in our annual energy satisfaction survey, with scores of customers complaining about appalling customer service over the phone and online – so it’s right that the regulator is stepping in.“As millions of energy customers brace themselves for yet another eye-watering set of price hikes, this should also serve as a warning to all firms letting their customers down with shoddy service, billing and payment problems or poor complaints handling that they need to up their game.”A Solarplicity spokesperson said: “We are committed to meeting the expectations of every single Solarplicity customer, but Ofgem’s decision, which was made on old historical data, disregards the vast improvements that we have made to our customer service.“In November, Which?\u0026nbsprated us as the fastest energy company to respond to customer calls thanks to substantial additional investment in\u0026nbspour staff and IT systems.

Shares slumped again in january after another disappointing update.It emerged last year that new chief executive Rico Back had received a £6m payment when he joined from General Logistics Systems, a Dutch firm that Royal Mail owns.His total pay packet for this year could hit £2.7m while outgoing chief executive Moya Greene received a £900,000 payout.We’ll tell you what’s true.

Or at least that’s what we were told by Liam Fox in 2017.The confidence beaming from the international trade secretary as he set off on his world tour to convince governments to do business with “global Britain” was notably absent this week.With little to show for his efforts, Fox\u0026nbspwas\u0026nbspforced into an embarrassing climbdown, finally conceding that many of those\u0026nbsptrade deals had no chance of being ratified by 29 March.\u0026nbspSo where are we now – and why has Liam Fox fallen so far short of his own bar?No deal will be done in time with valuable trading partners Turkey and Japan, nor with the tiny European principalities of Andorra and San Marino.\u0026nbspCan UK continue trading with countries covered by an EU trade deal?Fox has so far delivered just six of the 40 deals he promised. The biggest positive he can point to is an agreement with Switzerland, a country which took £20bn of UK exports in 2017.By comparison, the UK shipped £278bn of goods and services to the EU in 2017. A deal with the trading bloc, Fox told us, would be “the easiest in human history”.\u0026nbspThe only other agreements he has so far been able to finalise in close to three years of toil account for a tiny percentage of UK trade. Israel is the largest among these, buying £2.4bn of UK goods and services, with £1.6bn flowing the other way.Agreements sealed with the Palestinian territories\u0026nbspand the Faroe Islands will do little to keep post-Brexit Britain afloat. We also have a deal with the 21 countries which make up the Common Market for\u0026nbspEastern and Southern Africa, but only Egypt accounts for anything more than a negligible amount of UK trade.Among the remaining countries in the group are two, which, according to official figures, imported no UK goods last year: Eritrea and Comoros.There is of course a chance that agreements will be reached in the next 35 days but Fox’s announcement hardly inspires confidence.He attempted to reassure the public with news that formal agreements are close with Fiji and Papua New Guinea.\u0026nbspBut that\u0026nbspsimply served\u0026nbspto highlight the lack of progress on agreements with far more important trading partners.True, we have some form of agreement with the US, Australia and New Zealand but these mostly cover product standards. They aren’t full trade deals.Created with Sketch.

Juergen Ziegler, CEO for Europe, said that while Brexit was not the only factor, it has brought forward the decision to relocate“Particularly intensive discussions” are happening with the European Economic Area, South African Customs Unions, Canada and South Korea, the trade secretary says – which sounds distinctly like they won’t be signed in time.It all seems like tinkering around the edges when you compare the figures involved to the vast sums of trade we conduct\u0026nbspwith the other 27 EU member states.None of this is to say that our trade secretary has been incompetent or lazy. No one said rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic was easy.\u0026nbspAnd negotiating trade deals is\u0026nbspeven more fiendishly complex – they frequently\u0026nbspamount to hundreds of clauses covering standards and tariffs on vast\u0026nbspnumbers of products.Deals often take\u0026nbspyears to finalise, even for skilled negotiators focused on one agreement, let alone 40.Whether through arrogance or ignorance, Liam Fox did not listen to trade experts who said dozens of EU deals could not be “rolled over” with ease.\u0026nbspHe assured everyone it could be done, but that was never truly the case.Got an unanswered question about Brexit?

His comments come after US secretary of state Mike Pompeo\u0026nbspinsisted the US would not provide top-secret intelligence to countries which use equipment from\u0026nbspChinese tech giant Huawei\u0026nbspin their core networks.Mr Pompeo\u0026nbsptold Fox Business:\u0026nbsp“If a country adopts this and puts it in some of their critical information systems, we won’t be able to share information with them.”Last year, MI6 chief Alex Younger expressed his concern about the potential involvement of Huawei in the UK’s 5G mobile network.​ The company\u0026nbsphas denied it has any links to Chinese spying operations.In his address to government, military and industry figures from across southeast Asia, Mr Fleming will say no decisions have been taken on 5G, with a government review due to report in the spring.However he will say it is essential the potential risks of allowing Chinese firms to become involved need to be properly understood.He will say:\u0026nbsp”It’s a hugely complex strategic challenge which will  the next few decades ... probably our whole professional lives.“How we deal with it will be crucial for prosperity and security way beyond 5G contracts.”US signals it will refuse to share information if UK uses HuaweiHuawei founder says ‘no way the US can crush us’ Huawei threat to UK national security ‘can be contained’Huawei addresses spy concerns to UK governmentWith around half the 1,100 incidents handled by the UK National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) over the last two years involving state actors, Mr Fleming will say there is a need for an internationally agreed system of ethics and standards for operating in cyberspace.“Some of the behaviour we’ve seen from certain states or criminals is clearly wrong in any circumstance,” he will say. “An attack on a hospital’s IT, or on a country’s electoral system will always require sanction.“Unchecked, we’re heading for an even less governed space where rights and wrongs are not automatically recognised and where acceptable behaviours are not a given.Ultimately, he will say that Britain’s continuing security in cyberspace will depend on its ability to act together\u0026nbspwith international allies.He is expected to add: “Our future security will be guaranteed not by the quality of our coding, the design of our silicon, or the cunning of our cyber operators – but by the bonds that tie us together and the relationships that give us confidence to act decisively against common threats.”Additional reporting by PAWe’ll tell you what’s true.

Parliament cannot stand by and allow this to happenAs Ms May announced she would not be able to put a new deal to the Commons, she said she would ensure that it does happen by 12 March\u0026nbspat the latest, and went on to signal that she would make an attempt to avert the frontbench rebellion on Wednesday, saying: “We don’t know what amendments are going to be tabled.“We don’t know what amendments are going to be selected. You haven’t even seen what motion the government is going to put down – as I say, it won’t be the meaningful vote.“I will be making a statement to parliament on Tuesday. And then, obviously, we’ll be having the debate the next day.”One option open to her could be to offer ministers and MPs who are worried about a no-deal Brexit\u0026nbspanother way to stop it from happening instead of backing the CooperLetwin amendment.But while the prime minister has already managed to push back attempts by MPs to back the proposal, Brexit day is now so close that many of those minded to support it believe this could be their last chance.Society’s poorest will suffer the most from Brexit unless we marchI joined a political party aged 13 – but Brexit’s pushed me to apathyHow we view our national identity is a great challenge to comeThe prime minister’s promise to bring her new deal before the Commons by 12 March is also significant, because if the CooperLetwin plan is passed on Wednesday it would require MPs to vote on the actual legislation delaying Brexit on 13 March.That means Ms May will have one final opportunity to get her deal through, and could also tell Tory Brexiteers that the UK’s departure would be delayed if they still refuse to back her withdrawal agreement on that day.The PM’s move to delay bringing any new deal before the house was attacked by critics in the UK and on the continent. Ms Cooper branded Ms May’s actions “utterly shambolic and irresponsible”.The Labour MP added: “She cannot just keep drifting and dithering like this or there is a real risk our whole country tumbles off a cliff edge into a chaotic no deal that no one is ready for and that would hit food prices, medicine supplies, manufacturing and security.”Gove says ‘no deal’ Brexit could lead to higher food pricesShadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer called Ms May’s decision over the timing of the meaningful vote “an admission of failure”, adding that it represents “the height of irresponsibility”.He went on: “Theresa May is recklessly running down the clock in a desperate attempt to force MPs to choose between her deal and no deal. Parliament cannot stand by and allow this to happen.”Ms May met European Council president Donald Tusk for talks on Sunday afternoon, and was set to hold a number of meetings with European leaders on the fringes of the summit she is attending in Egypt.But at least one senior European figure was unhappy with her decision to delay the vote. The European parliament’s Brexit spokesman Guy Verhofstadt said on Twitter that he had “seen many surprising decisions in a lifetime in politics. But this is close to being one of the most reckless.”There were even uncorroborated reports that EU officials were looking at delaying Brexit to 2021 to allow time to fully plan an orderly withdrawal.Josh Hardie, CBI deputy director-general, said of Ms May’s announcement: “This is the latest signal to businesses that no deal is hurtling closer.“It must be averted. Every day without a deal means less investment and fewer jobs created. That’s the cost of running down the clock, and it’s irresponsible to treat that as a price worth paying.”\u0026nbspWe’ll tell you what’s true.

Brexit day, 29 March, is so close that Ms May will find it difficult to convince MPs that they can vote for the plan in a few more weeks and still credibly implement it.There has been increasing speculation that many members of her front bench want to back it and take a no-deal Brexit off the table as well – including three members of her cabinet, David Gauke, Greg Clark and Amber Rudd, who wrote an open letter on the issue on Saturday morning.Cabinet ministers warn May they will delay Brexit to avoid no dealNew march for a People’s Vote receives £250,000 in matter of daysThe prime minister could choose to sack the ministers, but that might bring her whole government down. Then again if she allows them to vote against her will on Wednesday and does nothing, it will underline the weakness of her position in London, pass proposals that will weaken her negotiating stance in Brussels and make her chances of securing a deal less likely.A delay to Brexit also becomes almost inevitable, and other alternative outcomes – like MPs forming a cross-party coalition to secure the UK in permanent customs union – become more probable.Ms May’s only hope of avoiding this outcome is to beseech MPs and her own ministers not to back the CooperLetwin plan, by showing them she is within a hair’s breadth of clinching the withdrawal agreement she wants.Got an unanswered question about Brexit?

The Bank of England recently downgraded the outlook for growth. If the government’s official forecasts follow a similar path, £5bn will be added to the deficit in the medium-term.The Institute for Fiscal Studies said the chancellor is on track for below-target borrowing of £22bn this year but was not entirely optimistic.“Even in spite of today’s good news ...\u0026nbspthere could be tricky fiscal arithmetic for the chancellor as he considers how best to respond to uncertainty around Brexit and how much money to make available to departments at this year’s spending review,” the IFS said.Howard Archer, chief economic adviser to the forecasting group EY ITEM Club, said: “A record high surplus on the January public finances provides a much-needed boost for Chancellor Philip Hammond as he faces a worrying backdrop to his Spring Statement on 13 March.“With the economy clearly struggling early on in 2019 after a sharp slowdown in the fourth quarter of 2018 and the Brexit situation highly uncertain, the chancellor will have a lot on his mind when he presents the Spring Statement.“It looks highly likely that he will have to announce downgraded growth forecasts from the OBR (Office for Budget Responsibility) at least for the near term with possible negative ramifications for expected budget deficits.”We’ll tell you what’s true.

You do it!’ Because you’re not, so until you do it, I’m the boss, How about that?”Why the Green New Deal strategy is doomed to failThe resolution, which has been proposed by Ms Ocasio-Cortez and senator Edward J Markey, sets out broad changes to American society which aim to reduce the effects of climate change.It\u0026nbspincludes\u0026nbspkey goals of cutting greenhouse-gas emissions to net zero over 10 years and 100 per cent renewable energy in the US by 2030.The proposal currently has the support of major Democratic presidential candidates Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, Kamala Harris, Cory Booker and Kirsten Gillibrand.Senator Amy Klobuchar has said she would vote for the non-binding resolution but suggested she would oppose certain elements of the proposal when it came to the details of legislation.Former vice president Al Gore and former UN secretary general Ban Ki-moon have also supported the idea in principle.However, the resolution has faced opposition from fellow Democrats, such as California senator Dianne Feinstein.Ms Feinstein was recently filmed arguing with a group of school children over the proposal, saying she could not support it because “there’s no way to pay for it”.“I’ve been doing this for 30 years.

I don’t respond to that.”Senate\u0026nbspmajority leader Mitch McConnell has said he intends to bring forward a vote\u0026nbspon the Green New Deal, which would force Democrats to formally decide whether to back the proposal.The resolution is not expected to pass the Senate, which is controlled by a Republican majority, and the planned vote has been criticised by Democratic leader Chuck Schumer as a cynical ploy\u0026nbspto split the party.We’ll tell you what’s true.

Likewise, consistently receiving less than you need to because you are paying back an advance can push people over the edge and into destitution.To succeed, Universal Credit needs to raise the incomes of those locked in poverty and ensure that work is a route to a better le. Without further reform, its potential risks being unfulfilled.The best immediate step the Government should take would be to lt the freeze on working age benefits this April.One million people are already receiving it and by the time the system is fully rolled out in , nearly  million will be on it.But there are big problems with the flagship new system - it takes  weeks to get the first payment and it could leave some families worse off by thousands of pounds a year.And while working families can claim back up to  per cent of their childcare costs, they must find the money to pay for childcare upfront - we’ve heard of families waiting up to  months for the money.Working parents across the country told us they’ve been unable to take on more hours - or have even turned down better paid jobs or more hours because of the amount they get their benefits cut.It’s time to Make Universal Credit work. We want the Government to:Together, these changes will help Make Universal Credit Work.Join our Universal Credit Facebook group or email UniversalCredit@the-sun to share your story. JRF also want jobcentres to better use the hidden pot called the Flexible Support Fund to help Brits with their childcare payments upfront so Brits dont go into thousands of pounds of debt going back to work.They highlighted the thoughts of both people on Universal Credit and work coaches in their new report.Research from Britain Thinks revealed that working parents saw Universal Credit as contributing towards their poor standards of living, and not helping them.Many wanted to be able to keep more of their hard-earned cash rather than being hit by the taper rate, and felt trapped by their circumstances.When the couple moved onto the new benefit system in September their £ a month benefits were immediately stopped, leaving them unable to pay their rent.The Peterborough couple, who’ve been living in their current home for a year now, claim they have nowhere  to gothey are evicted and will have to be put in temporary accommodation, at a cost of £ a week to the city council.Its a disgusting situation to be in because you know its going to happen but youre absolutely powerless to do anything about it, Amanda told The Sun.We have no savings, no one to fall back on and we struggle to be able to afford the rent now that we’re in debt.If were are relocated to a completely dferent area then Brian will have to give up his job but I thought the whole point of Universal Credit was to get people into work  It makes no sense.A DWP spokesperson said that the scheme works for the vast majority of people.They added: Universal Credit reduces gradually as people’s income increases, which means they’re always better off in work."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/NINTCHDBPICT000470023516.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"anila baig nothing shamima believes is to do with being muslim","story":"She made her bed and now, however uncomfortable it is, she must lie in it.But you must know one thing. None of the widespread condemnation of her actions is a patch on the revulsion that comes from the British Muslim community itself.It was bad enough she joined IS as a -year-old but what makes my blood boil is how she repeatedly claims her actions were something to do with Islam.No, they really aren’t.Her support for a murderous cult is nothing to do with the Islam that I recognise.When asked about witnessing beheadings and executions she said she wasn’t bothered because she thought they were “Islamically OK”.No, they are not.This twisted, toxic interpretation of Islam is anathema to me — and it is certainly not something we grew up following as second-generation Muslims in this country.We were taught from a young age that Muslims had to be compassionate towards everyone, whatever their faith.I grew up in a mixed community in Bradford, where I still live.We always took presents to our Christian neighbours at Christmas and ate sweets with our Hindu neighbours at Diwali. We celebrated each other’s religious festivals and had friends from all dferent backgrounds. I always heard about how Islam meant peace and how the Prophet was well known for being kind, honest and gentle.Now, thanks to the actions of Begum and her ilk, people sneer when they hear the phrase “Religion of peace”.The truth is, that in the Koran there are strict rules about warfare. You are not even allowed to harm a tree, so targeting children at a pop concert is completely unthinkable.Still, Begum talks about how “unjust” the decision to boot her out of the UK is and repeatedly asks for sympathy.Sorry, but I reserve my sympathy for the rest of us in the Muslim community.Every single time there is an incident around the world we hold our breath, hoping and praying it was not a misguided “Muslim” behind the attack.Since   there has ALWAYS been a backlash, and it is ordinary, law-abiding Muslims who bear the brunt.According to one anti-racism charity there were more than , attacks on Muslims last year — a rise of  per cent — and women are disproportionately targeted.Women who wear the headscarf say they live in fear. They have been verbally abused, a few have even had their hijabs ripped off their heads — and Begum’s interviews will pour petrol on that fire.High-profile Muslim celebrities such as boxer Amir Khan posted on Twitter that “arrogant” Shamima is giving all Muslims a bad name. It is hard to disagree.The far right will gleefully tar us all with the same brush, using the actions of ONE inidual to paint the WHOLE community as traitors.Despite this, we know that Britain is not as racist as other countries in Europe.When I went to Paris I was told repeatedly that le for immigrants in France is very dficult. Spain and Italy are among other EU nations that continue to show naked hostility and xenophobia towards Muslims, both in the street and among their politicians. Sure, when our parents came here in the s and s they also had to endure dficulties, but a lot has changed since then.Areas such as Bethnal Green, where Begum comes from, is not a ghetto hotbed of radicalism.Muslim men, women and children live harmoniously next to bearded hipsters sucking on their soy lattes, and it is this cosmopolitanism that makes it such a cool place to live.British people are, at heart, compassionate and kind. AndBegum had shown genuine remorse, repentance or humility I am certain the voices crying out for her forgiveness and safewould have been heard.There are still people arguing for her to be given another chance here, saying she was very young when she fled the UK and that she must have been groomed.But she didn’t go to Syria to work for a charity or help on humanitarian grounds. She went for the specic reason of becoming an IS bride, and supporting terror.It is ironic that the person who stripped Shamima Begum of her citizenship is, like her, the child of immigrants.Whatever the legal ramications of her citizenship, for the Muslim community the damage has been done — and sadly THAT can’t be as easily revoked as her passport.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Or about the Tories, under their most left-wing leader in a generation, in fact being ruled by compassionless brutes.It’s window dressing aimed at disguising their sole obsession, a catastrophically isive second Brexit referendum.Perhaps they need to justy it to themselves. Because Anna Soubry, Sarah Wollaston and Heidi Allen backed the  referendum, vowed to respect the result, voted for Article , then stood for election promising Brexit in full: no single market, no customs union.They now consider it “extreme” to keep those promises instead of breaking them. Ex-colleagues honouring the referendum and manesto are “anti-EU zealots”.Wollaston and Soubry represent Leave constituencies. Wollaston even campaigned for Leave initially. How can these hypocrites deny their duped ­constituents immediate by-elections and a “final say” on their duplicity At least, though, we now know the new Independent Group’s only policy: to reverse Brexit. The Labour MPs mainly quit Corbyn’s party over its vile anti-Semitism and economic insanity. The Tories’ recruitment shts the entire focus.Their anti-Brexit arguments, though, are the same old Remoaner claptrap.Soubry even trotted out the feeblest of all, counting non-voters to claim  per cent of us did not back Brexit: A child’s logic, applying to every election ever.Allen claimed they heard the “clarion call for change” from .million Leave voters. They intend to ignore them.They said “compassionate Conservatism” had been sidelined, airbrushing out their own role as serial rebels helping to paralyse Theresa May’s Government.But now they hope she will dump the DUP and make a pact with them in exchange for their “people’s vote”. She could,she wished to destroy her party.The Tories rightly aim to be a “broad church”. But these three shameless defectors, puffed up on sanctimony and epic self-regard, were irreconcilable.They have betrayed their party and their voters. And they’re not done yet.NEXT week backbench MPs could snatch power from the Government over Brexit in one of the most recklessly insane acts ­Parliament has seen.A Labour-backed vote, joined by Tory Remainers, would “take No Deal off the table” and effectively end the PM’s negotiations. The fact this is the brainchild of Oliver “Poll Tax” Letwin should tell you what chaos it will unleash.Which is doubtless why the EU is going cold on compromising. Why should it,Remainers will postpone Brexit Tory Leave MPs must not assume this will fail. Brexit is in mortal danger.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Billions of pounds pass before your eyes every day. But you don’t see a penny of it.It’s unfair. Never has so much been taken from so many by so few.So it is time to have a big redistribution of digital wealth.Google shareholders and Facebook boss Mark ­Zuckerberg are now worth .TRILLION. How much are you worth Remember, your mind is  per cent of the revenue of these corporations. So it is only right to demand your share.The British people, who set the world an example in waging a revolutionary war against feudal slavery, now find themselves in the latest stage of wage-slavery, working for the benefit of these wealthy companies and ­billionaires.The richest and strongest profit and grab most, while the weakest are utterly robbed, tormented, crushed and strangled.The tech multi-billionaires are, perhaps, some of the richest of all, and geographically the most secure.They have profited more than all the rest from their unholy alliance with weak national governments, who say their own parliaments and laws are too small to control or regulate these giant global corporations.Call it what it is — collusion, crony capitalism. The big companies and big government are hand in hand.The House of Commons’ Digital Select Committee this week called the tech giants “digital gangsters”.But even a good Saatchi alumnus like Damian Collins — the committee’s distinguished chairman — concedes the politicians have no power over these companies.Instead, it’s time for the people — the customers who keep the tech companies afloat — to take a stand.It is unfair that these few companies are so rich, and the many people are so poor.So, I say: Let us march! We are  per cent on the side of the heroes. They are  per cent on the side of the villains. Black and white. No compromise.When the tech companies say: “We agree in principle”, it means they will do nothing in practice.They say fair exchange is no robbery. You provide them with all your personal details — your age, gender, every friend, every photo you send, every film you watch, every app you download, every website you visit, every message, every item you buy, everywhere you go and where you are now — and inthey give you the wonders of the internet world.And as your bonus, they only send you “personalised” ads. Soyou want a new shampoo they don’t “serve” you a dishwasher.They are for the haves who hold power. We are for the have-nots.This is not a question of “privacy”. Or “harmful material”. Or “election interference”.This is a question of money.They have too much. We have too little. So we will make what seems highly improbable in fact happen.Every time Google or Facebook sell you to an advertiser, you should get paid for the privilege. Fair shares for all. The technology exists to make this possible. YouTube already pays people for the number of times their uploaded data is viewed.These companies only care about the millions of users they can sell to advertisers.What was your name again  Here is your chance to get your own back. A business model that says I get  per cent and you get  per cent is not going to last.The tech giants should remember what all Prime Ministers and Presidents usually learn too late.We the people have all the power. It’s best not to push us to use it.I say we need a popular uprising. A people’s revolution. Agitate! Create disenchantment! Build discontent!Join me and say: Start spreading the news. I say we want control. Ownership of our own minds.The new tech billionaires once used to dream of changing the world. Now they’ve got the whole world, they don’t want to let it go.They used to say: Set sail for the end of the rainbow.But now they say: Don’t rock the boat. They are turning into exactly the type of people they once condemned.The time has come to call a halt to their complacency and self-satisfaction. Will this cost them money  Yes, peanuts.But whatever it costs, it will be less than having the money dragged out of them.A society without ownership is one in which inequality and resentment flourish.Honour, common sense and the interest of the country require that all free British men and women, wherever they be, now fight for control of their own minds.We will feel more responsible for our own lives.And everyone will agree that this makes everything much fairer and that the people have gained more dignity and self-respect.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We should leave the EU and forge a new path in the world.It was put to a referendum and the rest, as they say, is history.For some, though, the result of the ­referendum is not history. It’s something they are desperate to re-run.Calls for an extension, a delay or even a second referendum are persistent — but so too is mydetermination, and the ­determination of this Government, to deliver on the will of the first one.Democracy is not about trying again until you get the result you want.It’s about compromise and accepting that while we might disagree with each other, we should respect each other’s views.That need for compromise is precisely why we continue to negotiate with the EU. The Prime Minister is fighting hard to make sure we leave with a good deal on March .That determination is the reason I believe that the Conservative Party is the only party delivering in the national interest.The Prime Minister has made clear through her actions that whether you voted Leave or Remain, the deal she seeks will look to bring everyone back together.Whether you are someone who can’t wait to see us leave the EU, or whether you wish the result of the referendum had been dferent — we all, each of us, just want the best for the UK.We have a bright future ahead and one in which the UK will continue to grow as a force for good in the world.The pressure isn’t all on Parliament.The EU needs to come to the table in the spirit of compromise too.It would be the most illogical act of senseless harmthe EU refuses to accept that the UK Parliament will not be trapped in a backstop and instead pushes us to leave with No Deal, thereby ­creating the exact problem with the Northern Ireland border they claim they want to avoid.As far as our current ­negotiation is concerned, we are well into extra time.As Leader of the House, I am responsible for passing the legislation necessary for our exit from the EU.We have a lot to do before March  but I remain confident thatwe resolve the backstop, we will be able to pass the Meaningful Vote and crack on with that vital ­legislation.We are so close to the ­finishing line, so my plea to politicians here and in ­Brussels is: Please don’t snatch defeat from the jaws of victory. The EU must lt its eyes and look beyond the current frustrations and towards the close friendship we all want in the future.The Labour Party must carry out the wishes of the majority of its own ­voters, who wanted to leave the EU.And my own colleagues on the ­Conservative benches must not make the perfect the enemy of the good.Don’t hold the PM to ­ransom at such a critical point.Instead, we must hold our nerve and push through.  We must hold fast to the reality of the PM’s deal — that it delivers us a clean exit from the EU and all of its ­institutions while at the same time ­offering a close trading and security partnership that addresses the hopes and aspirations of many in our country who voted Remain.So the prize is great — and it’s all of our futures.Let’s come together and, with one final heave, we can get the PM’s deal over the line and begin to look ­forward, not ­backward.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Italian Prime Minster Giuseppe Conte uploaded a video showing him handing the UK leader a pool cue before taking a shot himself.

Ministers have been warned they risk “unleashing a crime wave”the proposed policy to scrap jail terms of six months or less runs into trouble. Last week Justice Secretary David Gauke declared that there is a “very strong case” for the plan - except for violent and sexual crimes. Prisons Minister Rory Stewart has also backed the move, which is being explored as part of efforts to reduce the prison population and drive down re-offending. Mr Stewart, said last month that imprisoning someone for a few weeks means they “lose their house, their job, their family, their reputation” and meet “a lot of interesting characters” while behind bars.   He argued that public protection would be better served by a “good community sentence”. But a study from think-tank Civitas claims the approach would amount to an “amnesty for prolic thieves and burglars”, leaving the public at greater risk of crime. Around , offenders who were jailed in  would receive non-custodial punishments under the proposed new regime, according to the paper. The number includes thieves, burglars, drink-drivers, fraudsters, and iniduals caught with knives or drugs. The vast majority of criminals spared jail would be repeat offenders, the report says. The Civitas report, written by Peter Cuthbertson, founder of the Centre for Crime Prevention, says: “If Rory Stewart is wrong, the consequences for public safety could be enormous, with the Government unleashing a crime wave on hundreds of thousands of citizens.   “In reality, his own department’s data makes clear that it would mean tens of thousands more hardened criminals avoiding prison. “The Government must now consider the evidence, rather than proceed any further with plans for an effective amnesty for burglars, shoplters and other prolic criminals.” Mr Gauke signalled a departure from the Tory “prison works” mantra as he unveiled his vision for “smart justice” last week. Short custodial terms would be replaced by “robust” community orders under the blueprint, which has been backed by penal reform campaigners. The Justice Secretary cited figures showing that over a quarter of all re-offending is committed by people who served sentences of  months or less. A Ministry of Justicespokesman said: “It would be wrong to spend taxpayers’ money doing what we know doesn’t work - and the evidence is clear that short sentences often do more harm than good. “They fail to rehabilitate many offenders and lead to high rates of reoffending, which actually makes us less safe and more likely to be a victim of crime. “That is why we are exploring more stringent and enforceable community sentences - but this work is ongoing and we’ve reached no conclusions at this time.” Burglary, drug possession and possession of a kne offences are triable “either way” - meaning they can be tried at either the Crown Court or a magistrates’ court- and will therefore still attract custody where a longer sentence is merited, the ministry noted.

The Commons Work and Pensions Committee chairman, Frank Field, is asking Philip Hammond to use next month’s Spring Statement to help low income families hit by successive waves of benefit caps and freezes. Mr Field said the squeeze on benefits since  had had a “devastating” effect on some of the poorest households in the country, with some losing hundreds of pounds a year in real terms. He said research commissioned from the independent House of Commons Library showed six successive caps or freezes had wiped out the gains associated with the introduction of the national living wage and increases in personal allowances. It found that a lone parent in work or a single-earner couple with two children would be pound worse off in real terms next year compared with , while those with one child would be pound worse off.   Families who are out of work face even deeper real terms cuts to their income, ranging from pound to pound. In contrast, in a letter to the Chancellor, Mr Field said thatbenefits and tax credits had been “inflation-proofed”, lone parents and single earner couples with two children would be pound, better off in real terms than they were in . Those with one child would be pound, better off. However, he said that while inflation next year was forecast to be around % higher than in , child benefit and the basic -hour elements of working tax credit would be only % higher.Mr Field, who quit the Labour Party last year and now sits as an independent, said he had felt compelled to speak out after the “horror” of witnessing people in his Birkenhead constituency being left to rely on food banks.“In the light of these trends, it is not dficult to see why so many families, reliant on low-waged jobs, now seek help from their local food bank,” he said.   “There is an overwhelming precariousness that has engulfed families in low-waged work, all too many of whom are vulnerable to hunger because their incomes will not stretch to the end of the month. “I very much hope that, having considered these new data, the Chancellor will begin setting out, in the Spring Statement, a rescue package for the living standards of families with children whose incomes have been wrecked by successive waves of caps and freezes.” "},{"url":null,"title":"alfie evans dad says new","story":"NewsAlfie Evans dad says new baby has given him a reason to live after sons deathWATCH EXCLUSIVE VIDEO: Dad Tom, , says the six-month-old is the double of his brother and has helped him and his partner Kate James cope after Alfies tragic deathShareByPhil Cardy:,  FEB Updated:,  FEB Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news uk-news video father-of-alfie-evans-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News ,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News ,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true\"\"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThe father of “right to le” shytoddler Alfie Evans cradles his new baby son and tells how the tot has given him a reason to live. Little Thomas Evans is the double of Alfie – the -month-old who died after a heartbreaking legal battle by his parents. Thomas is six months old and his dad Tom today reveals how having a new baby has brought a joy he and partner Kate James feared they would never experience again. Tom, , told the Sunday Mirror: “Thomas is Alfie’s double, the resemblance is amazing. “When we see Thomas pull a face he looks like Alfie, we feel that in a way we have them both with us.  “He’s such a happy baby, he does nothing but smile. I had a great connection with Alfie and I feel like I’ve got the same with Thomas. “We’re hanging in there, keeping sane, doing as well as we can. I wouldn’t know where I was without baby Thomas. “I’ve got something to wake up to with him. I have to keep happy for Thomas’s sake. I wouldn’t want to wake upit wasn’t for the baby. “I don’t like to think what it would be like without Thomas. I worryhe wasn’t here, where would I be  “How would I be  What would my mental health be ”   Tom was speaking as he and Kate revealed a pound, fund for Alfie will be spent on helping sick children. The proud dad added: “When Thomas gets older we want him to understand what Alfie went through and he can know good came from it. We’d like to help children around the UK and the world.” The picture of Tom and Thomas is a ray of light after two years of pain and torment. Tom and Kate had fought to keep Alfie on a le support machine in a case which drew global attention. They lost, ultimately, and their son died at Liverpool’s Alder Hey Children’s Hospital from an ultra-rare degenerative brain disease. Kate, , fell pregnant with Thomas as the legal battle – which taxed her and Tom to the limits – was played out. But the couple stayed together through those tough times and are now devoted to Thomas. Tom said: “Kate is a great mum for Thomas. She has moments when she’s upset and she has a cry. That’s what you have to do to release the emotion. Mums have that bond, especially with the first child.” He accused doctors of separating him and Kate in hospital and telling her that the legal battle was wrong. Tom went on: “It was hard. She questionedwe were doing the right thing. I told her what we were doing, what our friends and family were doing, was the right thing for Alfie. But it wasn’t easy. It was hard for her to hear the arguments of the doctors every day. There was a lot of strain, but we stayed together. “We both loved Alfie and both wanted the best for Alfie. “We remained tough. They were telling her I was wrong. She was pregnant and her hormones and emotions were all over the place.”  The arrival of Thomas triggered a wave of emotions for the couple. Tom explained: “I was nervous but felt happy. We had the test done and he didn’t have the same genes as Alfie, we were told he would be okay. “We were happy that Alfie had a brother, it’s just that Alfie wasn’t there with us. “It was hard because the first time we had a beautul boy and we lost him. “Then when we had Thomas there were tears of joy, but it felt dferent because we had lost our first boy. “We were the same parents Alfie had at home, just in a dferent position, more tense. “ We still speak about Alfie, but we don’t speak about the hospital. We talk about how he is going to help save a lot of children in the future.”  Tom tearfully told how he gave Alfie mouth-to-mouth as his le ebbed away in the early hours of April  last year. With tears rolling down his cheeks Tom said: “I think about that moment every day. That moment is forever in my head. “I was giving him mouth-to-mouth, I could hear him breathing, like a sigh. It gave me more encouragement to keep trying. The noises kept coming and coming. But Kate was saying ‘Stop it, you’re just expanding his belly’. I didn’t want to stop. But I knew he was dead. At the very last moment his colour went. “The police and doctors and nurses were looking through the door, standing there. “I said to them ‘Can’t you do anything ’ They pulled his le support out and thought he would die in three to four minutes. But he lived for five days. We put him on our knees and sang to him, cuddled him.   “I said right to the end that their treatment of him was shyinhumane. “I do feel bad for the nurses because they didn’t have the power. All they could do was stand and watch for five days while oxygen and food was withheld. Up until the last I thought we were going to save him. I tried every avenue. “I was just a dad who wanted the best for his son.” Alfie was born in May  and while initially healthy he fell seriously ill at six months old. He was in Alder Hey Hospital for the last  months of his le. Doctors found he had the rare brain condition GABA transaminase deficiency. They said there was nothing more they could do and advised that Alfie should be allowed to slip away. A court agreed – prompting Tom and Kate’s long battle to overturn the decision, in the hope that Alfie could be taken abroad for le-saving treatment. They appealed to UK and European judges and Tom even met Pope Francis, who backed the couple. But ultimately the courts ruled Alfie’s le support could be switched off. Tom said he and Kate still see grief and bereavement counsellors as they strive for the best way forward. And he is determined to stay strong. He added: “We are still understanding how to grieve. “I want to be more happy around Thomas, I don’t want him to see me crying all the time or with a bad face. “He needs a happy environment. I need to understand how to be happy.” Alfies legacy to help other seriously ill kids Alfies dad Tom says a pound, fund raised in his name will now help other seriously ill children. The sum came from an “Alfie’s Army” fundraising page set up during the legal battle to pay for potentially le-saving treatment in Italy or Poland. Hundreds of supporters also joined demonstrations in support of Alfie. The family has applied for charity status and has already provided wheelchairs and sensory equipment for disabled children. Tom said: “When we get something we think ‘Alfie bought it for them, Alfie is helping that person’. We’re happy that his name can live on in other parents’ and children’s minds.” The Alfie’s Army page states: “We don’t want any other family going through what we have... we are hoping to open a foundation to help other families get the help they need.” "},{"url":null,"title":"britains most viewed homes far","story":"NewsBritains most-viewed homes so far this year revealed - and one costs £mRightmove has revealed the top five most-viewed properties on their site in  so farShareCommentsByElaine McCahillAssistant News Editor:,  FEB NewsBritains most-viewed homes in  have been revealed - including this mansion in Surrey \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailBritains most-viewed homes so far this year have been revealed - and one costs an impressive pound.m.

Particularly when she was going through the crack addiction. Their family member was going through the same thing and they would watch Rainie. We have a social responsibility to tell the stories.” Tanya first set foot in Albert Square more than  years ago and loves every minute. The London-born star – who was seen last week at the West End version of Only Fools And Horses – had a special word to say about another EastEnders veteran, -year-old June Brown, who plays Dot Cotton. Tanya said: “June is wonderful. She’s still playing that iconic character. She comes on set with all the same ethics she’s ever had. Her integrity towards the work is absolutely paramount. She’s an inspiration to me and it’s an honour to work with her.” And Tanya also heaped praise on another inspirational actress – Olivia Colman, , who played Queen Anne in The Favourite and is up for the best actress award at tonight’s Oscars. The pair starred in Broadchurch together.   Tanya said: “I watched the filmwhen I was in LA. She’s amazing in it. I was mesmerised by her. I sent her a message straight after. “She’s not a showbiz person. She’s down to earth and fantastic at her job. It’s fantastic she’s being recognised. It’s encouraging as it reminds you it’s possible and that dreams do come true.” But Tanya doesn’t have any visions of Hollywood stardom herself. She added: “Rainie challenges me right across the gamut. There’s drama and comedy. I’m learning from her. If Rainie keeps challenging me like this I’m happy to stay.”To support the Barbaras Revolutionairies Alzheimers London Marathon team, click here .Do you have a story to sell  Get in touch with us at webcelebs@trinitymirror or call us direct   .

Pontins Brean Sands in Somerset hit the headlines last week after  people were left injured by a falling ceiling.Amongst those hurt was gran Wendy Jones who was this weekend moved to intensive care after her condition deterirorated. The same resort previously featured in a Birmingham Live article, when report reporter Stephanie Balloo decided to find out exactly what the family holiday camp is really like. During her trip, she found chewing-gum trodden into the carpet and saw dirty towels and empty crates of booze dumped in the entrance at the Brean Sands holiday park in Somerset.   The choking stench of stale cigarettes filled an apartment and the toilet seat had been left broken with razor-sharp edges. It transpired a major mix up by staff meant she was given the spare key to a familys occupied flat, exposing all their belongings. One horried dad she spoke to revealed images of what he believed to be human faeces smeared on his paid-for bedding. Another told how their child had cut their feet on loose tiles in the swimming pool. Stephanie kept a detailed account of her short stay - here is her diary...  .pm: Popular destination with Midlands families The taxi driver tells me that Pontins Brean Sands is a popular camp with families from the Midlands. .pm - Surrounded by caravan parks Driving through it seems there are plenty of other options for holidaymakers wanting to enjoy Brean Sands beach. The camp is surrounded by a number of caravan parks. I arrive at Pontins Brean Sands in a taxi and give my details to security who hand me a form to fill out. pm - Musty smell in chaotic arcade As I opened the door to what I imagined was a quiet reception desk, I was immediately plunged into chaos. Dozens of arcade machines all ringing simultaneously, children racing around and a musty lingering smell like an old-fashioned pub. One staff member mans the entire reception and I join the queue of around seven families - all waiting to check-in to their rooms as key collection starts from pm. The arcade carpet is stained with filth and blobs of chewing-gum are trodden into the disgusting flooring at reception.  .pm - Friendly staff The young receptionist is polite and friendly enough - calling me babes and handing me a map with the route to my apartment. She also explains how Ill have to put at least pound of electricity into the meter on top of the pound I paid for two nights in a one-bed apartment. There is no Wi apart from in the main building, I discover. I was directed to the fun factory to find out what entertainment the night had in store for me. Surprisingly, it seems quite an extensive list, despite previous complaints from families there is nothing for the kids. Though judging by the weeks schedule, the entertainment is largely the same every night, with a Pontins character kicking off the evening, dferent Blue Coats performing and a disco to finish.  .pm - Cigarette butts and litter Walking through the holiday park to my allocated apartment I realise the reception isnt the only filthy area. Cigarette butts and rubbish is dumped all over the park - especially near the benches outside the main entrance. En route to my accommodation, I passed a neglected skate park, a strangely quiet adventure play area and a Nisa Local. The grassy areas around the play parks - dotted within the accommodation - were littered with discarded cigarettes as well.  .pm - Sick on the steps Im first greeted to my apartment block with the sight of what appears to be someones vomit. I try to dodge this as I haul my suitcase up the steps. But nothing could prepare me for what I was about to experience.  .pm - Horrying scenes at my apartment A full to the brim bin, burnt trodden-in popcorn and two damp towels - one strewn across the filthy corridor floor and another hung up on the rail. There was a empty crate of beer abandoned and a mug full of cigarettes and ash dumped on the floor outside too. And this was just the exterior of my allocated apartment. I was horried but despite everything Ive heard about Pontins, I thought surely this cant be right. But from the window I thought someone had genuinely left my room in this state, so I double checked the door - number . And double checked my documents - number .  .pm - Spare key to somebodys apartment To my surprise the key worked, but as I tried to enter, a rubbish bag full of half-eaten food and cans erupted and spilled out - blocking the entrance. A blast of stale cigarette smoke hit me and I begged internally to escape this hell. Inside, soiled underwear appeared stuck to the floor, sausages in thick grease on the oven and a bowl of what I can only describe as green slime. I spotted a mobile phone and pairs of shoes and realised Pontins staff had made a very worrying mistake.  .pm - Displeased neighbour The guest next door tells me the people in number  have been staying there for days and have just popped out for the day. It begs the question, why was the apartment all set for me to check-in  Nevertheless, the neighbour doesn’t seem surprised and tells me lots of families have had problems. They’ve lost the plot running this place, she says, as she explains how her room had no running water and a broken TV. She adds that her fire alarm keeps going off too. pm - Room mix-up not uncommon When complaining to reception about my apartment, the formerly chirpy lady now seems inconvenienced and replies agh okay before calling the manager. She explains that there is two sets of keys and suggests the family should have checked out. What may have happened was they were meant to have booked out but obviously the system hasnt updated that theyve booked an extra night or something like that. It doesnt happen too often. Its just that crossover - it has happened before though. She is unapologetic for the inconvenience caused, as is the manager - who says somebody had gone into a room they shouldnt have been in. He claims he was off to find out who they were and sort the situation. .pm - New apartment damp and reeks of smoke I get my keys to the new apartment, no , and it is relatively clean save for the broken toilet seat with the sharp edges. The harsh smell of smoke makes me choke slightly as I enter and theres dripping damp all over the ceiling too. A bucket has been placed underneath to collect the condensation. Small yellow blobs stick to the inside of the bath, though Im unsure what these are.  .pm - Faulty smoke alarms sounding The smoke alarm has randomly started ringing and refuses to stop even though there is no smoke present. Theres no way to turn it off and fteen minutes later it is still sounding. I think it is time to get out of the room. But as I leave, I realise it is the whole block and guests are furious. They say it has been going off constantly all week in the entire block every time anyone tries to cook for their children. They claim Pontins staff have not done anything to resolve the situation. .pm - Furious guest says never again Reacting to the fire alarm issue, a guest staying in my block says its the first time Ive ever been here and the last time too. Another guest says there was no water to bath his children and he entered the apartment to find other peoples food still in the fridge. pm - Hidden costs Dozens of families have flocked to the fun factory as the evening entertainment kick starts with a paparazzi session with Chuckles the monkey. The bluecoats are admittedly very enthusiastic and seem to excite the children. There are huge queues of families waiting to see the favourable monkey mascot, but these extras for the kids all cost more money. It costs pound for the children to have a photo with the monkey while outdated cheesy s music plays in the background. .pm - Litter-plagued leisure area There is litter everywhere and young kids are running around without a parent nearby. Towards the rear there’s an inflatable zone consisting of just two pieces of equipment, but the kids seem to be enjoying it. In the leisure zone there seems to be plenty to do, with go karting, paddle karts, a play area with swings, an urban gym, a skate park, trampolining and the pool. However, all of which is outdated and will cost more money in the form of tokens purchased from the leisure centre.  pm - Pleasant beach nearby Brean Sands is just a three minute walk and is perhaps one of the few selling points for the camp. The long stretch of beach is soft and clean, perfect for young children staying in the nearby Pontins.  .pm - Buffet on dirty plates The evening meal at the Queen Victoria pub for those who opt for self-catering is pound. and consists of some salad, grated cheese, vegetable pie, cod fish cake and chips. Theres also some sliced potato with mince-meat underneath. Some of the plates have spots of food from previous meals clinging on and the food smells are a bit overwhelming. Theres food squashed into carpet and on the floor and the dessert fridges are a mess. I force a little bit of food down but it is largely tasteless just like the squash which misleadingly brands itself as % juice.  .pm - Dirty fridges Dirty fridges full of bashed up bits of cake is the offer for dessert. Crumbs of pudding spill out from the fridges and onto the floor - ready to get squashed like everything  on the food hall floor. Though admittedly what was left of the pudding was surprisingly tasty.  pm - Bluecoat entertainers The fun factory is packed out with hundreds of parents, young babies, toddlers and even teenagers. The blue coat entertainers are up on stage and encouraging the kids and parents alike to be silly - including dancing around like ious animals and being soaked with a water gun. Chuckles the monkey comes out on stage and pantomime style jokes are made, leaving the children in fits of giggles. Everyone seems to be having a great time - especially the children.  .pm - Staff selling toys During the performance, Pontins staff try to squeeze more money out of the guests by offering light up batons to the kids for a set price. There is also a shop at the front selling Pontins branded toys and another store at the side of the main hall. pm - Non-stop evening entertainment The entertainment is non-stop and as soon as party time with Chuckles ends, the children are up on their feet once more dancing to classic school disco songs. The jam-packed line up is great to see and clearly has most people enjoying themselves. .pm - Scantily-clad dancers as children watch With the children still present, the parents continue to drink and the adult entertainment begins. Female dancers in crop tops dance around the stage and sing loud rock songs in the I wanna rock show. As the concert gets underway, the Blue Coats dance seductively as rows of children sit looking up at them.  .pm - Bouncers on patrol There are four bouncers currently manning the bar area and entrance for the fun factory. .pm - Young children play while parents drink Children as young as around six play in the parks outside the apartment blocks with no parental supervision in the pitch black as adults continue to drink inside the main hall. .pm - Chaos as fire alarm clears hall Families cling onto each other and ask whether they have all their belongings as they are evacuated from the building. All the while the children are screaming about their abandoned slush puppies and toys. Everyone is told to move away from the building after what seemed like a serious fire. However, it is believed a drunken guest had smashed the fire alarm.  pm - Doors banging, kids screaming As I try to sleep, the bass from the main hall can be heard among children screaming and doors slamming shut. Ive brought my own sleeping bag after hearing horror stories of blood-stained mattresses and filthy linen. Every breath I take I am inhaling more and more of the lingering second-hand smoke which clings to the walls, furniture and very atmosphere of the musty apartment. am - Parents squabbling with children I was awoken to the sound of what I thought was a fight kicking off outside my apartment. As I looked out into the corridor, parents were arguing loudly with their children in the doorway to their room. The row lasted around an hour before they eventually ed to their rooms. .am - Screaming girl The sleepless night in hell continues as Im woken by the short sharp scream of a young girl. It seems to have come from near the squabbling, restless family - who to my annoyance refuse to sleep. .am - Average breakfast The Queen Victoria is fairly quiet and there seems to be no staff in sight. It is a buffet again, which is all the camp offers in terms of cooked food. Segments of oranges, a fruit cocktail, toast, cereal or the main fry up in silver trays are the options available. But the sausages are spotted with transparent blobs of fat which are chewy to eat. Nothing tastes fresh, and it is fairly average.  .am - Huge queues for swimming pool Around  families are queuing for the swimming pool and have been for more than an hour with their children in just swimwear and a towel. One frustrated child - who clearly doesnt understand time yet - says why are they not open yet, its stupid. The families are forced to wait a total of an hour and a half to be let into the swimming pool for their turn. The long wait was due to no leguards being present at the pool. .am - Rammed pool The pool is rammed full of parents and children - each with around two square metres to swim and play and yet more are piling in. It has a capacity of  people, which is far too many for the size of the pool, in my opinion. The much-anticipated Flume feature of the pool is out of action due to a technical fault.  .am - Child cuts foot on broken pool tile A young child is hopping around in her swimming costume and towel with toilet paper wrapped round a bloody foot. Her father claims she had cut her foot on a broken, loose tile at the bottom of the pool. In images it appears many of the tiles on the bottom of the pool are either dirty or missing.  .am - Faeces smothered on duvet I speak to another unhappy guest who is disgusted by his experience at Pontins. He shows me images of what he claims are human faeces on a duvet supplied by Pontins for a sum of pound. Their mattress, he reports, also had smears of poo all over it. The family, who have come from Cardf, claim they waited from pm until pm at night for clean bed linen for their children to finally go to sleep in. He says . per cent of people are unhappy here and have complained too.  pm - Claims of mice and second pool injury Another family, living at the other side of the park in the chalets, claim mice have chewed through the furniture in their room. While a third family say their child lted one of the loose tiles above his head in the swimming pool after cutting his foot on it. pm - Haven is the Ritz compared to this A pair of unhappy mums - who brought their kids down together - explain how they had bought bleach to clean their chalet themselves. We got bleach flash, wipes, everything to clean as the smell was like rot, damp, festering bodies. We had a conversation last night saying overall theres plenty for the children to do, entertainments fine, but the smell of cigarettes was disgusting. Weve stayed in a lot of holiday parks, Butlins, Haven and this is the worst. Haven is like the Ritz compared to this. pm - Same activities, dferent day On the surface, there seems to be plenty of activities for the children and the whole family in the day time including Curling, Cine Racing, a Disco Bingo and photo opportunities with Pontins characters. However, when dissected this is nearly exactly the same as yesterdays daytime entertainment. And most of which needs to be paid for on-top of the accommodation price. When speaking with families at the end of my stay, many say there is not much to do for the kids in the day - and every day is the same.

Today,  years on from gunning down principal Burton Wragg, , caretaker Mike Suchar, , and wounding nine others, Spencer is on the cusp of freedom.  In August she becomes eligible to go before a parole board, a day she has been preparing for inside her cell at the Calornia Institution for Women in Corona. But while she may feel she has served her punishment, the victims and their families still dread her release. And that first shooting has cast a dark shadow over America. By her own admission, Spencer feels her actions were the blueprint for the massacres at Columbine, Sandy Hook and Parkland’s Stoneman Douglas High. Back in January , , at .am Spencer, then a geeky looking ginger-haired -year-old, took out the . rle her father had bought her as a Christmas present and pointed it through her bedroom window. Outside pupils were lining up outside Grover Cleveland Elementary School across from her home in San Diego. She trained her sights on the playground and squeezed the trigger, firing off  bullets. There then followed a six-hour stand-off, during which a reporter from the San Diego Evening Tribune, Gus Stevens, began calling houses in the neighbourhood trying to get information. One was that of the Spencer residence and the teenager picked up the phone. When he asked her reason for the school massacre, she replied: “I don’t like Mondays. This livens up the day.”   After surrendering to police on the promise of a Burger King meal, as she walked out in shackles she told them: “It was a lot of fun seeing children shot. They looked like a herd of cows standing around. It was really easy pickings.” She pleaded guilty to two counts of murder and assault with a deadly weapon. On April , , a day after her th birthday, she was sentenced to  years to le.   It is only since the parole process started in , she has expressed remorse. Diagnosed with epilepsy and a depressive, she said she was drinking alcohol and on the mind-altering drug phencyclidine which made her hallucinate when she opened fire. Controversially, she also alleged her father had sexually abused her. “I had to share my dad’s bed til I was  years old,” she said during a  hearing. Her father denied her claims.  She previously told the board: “I know saying sorry doesn’t make it all right. With every school shooting, I feel I’m partially responsible. Whatthey got the idea from what I did ” And yet the model prisoner maintains she is no murderer, refusing to take full responsibility, instead blaming her upbringing. “I had asked for a radio, but got a gun instead,” she said.   Estimates suggest since Spencer’s killings more than , pupils across  schools have witnessed a gun attack in America. It is one of the reasons her bid for freedom is so bitterly opposed by many, including Mr Wragg’s family. His granddaughter Haley, , says: “I know there was a lot of turmoil in the family every time Brenda was up for parole. “I was so young I didn’t really understand it. I felt really scared – like she’d come after me. I felt like letting this person out of her cage would harm my family even more.”   Christy Buell, who with her friend Cam Miller took several of Spencer’s bullets, also objects to her release. She was pretending to ice-skate on the frosty grass waiting for the school bell when the killer targeted her. Shot in the abdomen and buttocks, she spent  days in the hospital and needed two operations.   Christy told the Mirror. “It’s something that has never left. I will always oppose Spencer’s release.” Victim Mary Rintoul is a lone voice in defending Spencer. After  years working in psychiatry, she points to the alleged abuse the killer suffered at the hands of her father and a dysal upbringing.  She says: “Reading the reports and examining what was done to her, I don’t condone what she did, but I kind of understand why she might have chosen that path.” Mary says every time there is a school massacre painful memories flood back. “The first big school shooting after mine was Columbine, I cried for a week. I knew what those kids were going through,” she adds.   Her husband Neil only discovered her part in the shooting on one of their first dates in . As they ed from a restaurant, lead singer Bob Geldof’s I Don’t Like Mondays started playing on the radio. “This is the Boomtown Rats,” he told her as he sang along. “I know,” Mary replied. “The song is about me.” A record level of outrages on US campuses Since Brenda Spencer’s attack, at least  children, teachers and other people have been killed, and another  injured in assaults. And the problem is getting worse. The most bloodshed in American schools was recorded last year with  people killed,  of whom were students, and  injured. Although the US government does not track the attacks, research shows there were  incidents resulting in death or injury. Another database recording school shootings says  had the highest number of incidents recorded.  That database, from the US Center for Homeland Defense, uses a dferent way of identying gun incidents in schools and says there were . Thirteen people, plus killers Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, died at Columbine High School in Colorado in .

Emma Downs, , who was behind the wheel, claimed she had suffered tiredness and poor eyesight after being prescribed Tramadol and other painkillers for three cracked ribs. She said the drugs made her really tired and said she kept falling over and just wanted to lie down on the sofa.  Just days before the collision, Mrs Downs told friends: I can barely drive, its not safe at night. In a series of texts she said: I was really struggling with my meds and no food.

Over the years, Scotties have been used to advertise products such as Radley handbags and shortbread.

Of the  native breeds,  are now deemed vulnerable, with nine more at watch, and The Kennel Club has launched a poundsavebritishdogbreeds campaign to reverse the decline.   Those now classed as vulnerable, meaning they have fewer than  new registrations in a year, include the bearded collie and the Irish wolfhound. Kennel Club secretary Caroline Kisko said: There were just  vulnerable breeds and seven at watch a decade ago. There are now another six breeds either vulnerable or at watch and we could lose even more of our most iconic and historic native dog breedspeople dont look beyond the most obvious choices - such as the increasingly popular French Bulldog - and start to explore the huge ersity of breeds were lucky enough to have in this country.   Til Tovey, secretary of the Scottish Terrier Club of England, added: It is so sad to see this wonderful and well-recognised breed, which is affectionate, loyal and intelligent, steadily decline in popularity as more fashionable choices take over. The Scottish Terrier is a great breed for those who want a small companion dog with plenty of character and an independent streak, and have time to train them consistently. Scotties are brimming with personality so sometimes can be a little stubborn! It would be very sad to no longer see this historic and much-loved breed in our streets and parks in a few generations time.

There seems to be a pattern of her doing that to people, it’s a bit worrying. “From my personal experience, she is someone I thought I was pretty matey with and ‘bang’, she met somebody more important and that was it. “And told other members of her show who I was friendly with to stop talking to me.

According to reports, new regulations could also ban parents from opting their kids out of sex education in secondary school. Staff will bring in the new classes when they are rolled out nationally next year, according to the Sunday Times .The paper has revealed that primary school children will learn about same-sex and trans families. Under new guidelines announced by the Government pupils will also be taught about staying safe online - and developing healthy, respectful relationships”. Youngsters will learn the link between physical and mental health, with lessons focused on the importance of getting enough sleep, the dangers of sexting, and spotting anxiety in their friends. Three new subjects - relationships education from primary school, relationships and sex education at secondary school, and health education for all ages - will form part of the school curriculum in England from , with teachers deciding how frequently to hold age-appropriate lessons.   It will coincide with the first shake-up of sex education for two decades. Education Secretary Damian Hinds said: Growing up and adolescence are hard enough, but the internet and social media add new pressures that just werent there even one generation ago. So many things about the way people interact have changed, and this new world, seamless between online and offline, can be dficult to navigate. Almost  years on from the last time guidance on sex education was updated, there is a lot to catch up on. Mr Hinds said it was appropriate to make health education universal alongside relationships and sex education. It will help children learn how to look after themselves, physically and mentally, and the importance of getting away from the screen and the headphones, he said. And it can help young people be resilient as they chart a course through an ever more complex world. Under the plans, children as young as four will be taught self-care - such as getting enough sleep and spending time outdoors. They will also receive lessons in online safety, such as what to do when they come across something they find uncomfortable, trolling, and chatting to strangers. The announcement follows intense pressure for action in safeguarding vulnerable people, highlighted by the case of -year-old Molly Russell who killed herself in .Her family found material relating to depression and suicide when they looked at her Instagram account after her death.According to the curriculum guidelines produced on Monday, secondary school pupils will be taught about female genital mutilation- focusing on awareness, the availability of support networks, and reminding them that it is illegal.   Students aged  and older should also be taught about other forms of honour-based abuse, as well as grooming, forced marriage and domestic abuse as part of a strengthened curriculum, the Department for Education said. Teachers at secondary school will have to take lessons on online safety topics, including the serious risks of sharing private photos, the impact of viewing explicit or harmful content - including how to report it and get support - as well as how the internet can promote an unhealthy view of sex and relationships. Anna Feuchtwang, chief executive of campaign group the National Childrens Bureau, described the guidance as a welcome step forward in preparing children for adulthood, improving their wellbeing and keeping them safe and healthy. She said: By providing compulsory health education with a strong focus on mental wellbeing, and guaranteeing relationships education in primary schools and relationships and sex education in secondary schools, the Government has responded to the needs and concerns of children, young people and parents. This is an important milestone but there is further work ahead to ensure the new requirements fulfil their potential for helping children grow up healthier and happier. Leethan Bartholomew, from charity Barnardos, said: This announcement is therefore welcomed by the National FGM Centre, as it will give a certain group of children the opportunity to be made aware of this hidden form of child abuse. However, it must be acknowledged that most girls are cut at an age when they will be attending primary school. Therefore conversations about FGM should take place at a younger age. Whilst some may have reservations about this, the work of the FGM Centre has shown this can be done in a child centred way that can achieve the intended outcome of safeguarding children.

She lives in Alfreton, Derbyshire, with her husband, Arnold.As my sister Jessie and I walked into the scout hut in , we weren’t sure what to expect. The whole concept of a slimming group was new. With a friend’s wedding approaching, both of us were feeling frumpy and thought it was worth finding out more. We’d already tried to lose weight by ourselves, without much luck. So we joined the room full of people, feeling slightly nervous.  But as I listened to our welcoming consultant Margaret explain her slimming philosophy, I started to think my two shillings and sixpence weekly fee — around p in today’s money — was going to be a good investment. Going to group became a real highlight of my week, with lots of friends laughing together. And we soon started losing weight.  We learnt a lot about food and how to fill up on the ingredients best for weight loss. I lost st, felt full of confidence at the wedding, and took up Margaret’s offer to take over a group.

She lives in Batley, West Yorkshire, with her husband, Kevin. Are you sure you can have that  my husband asked, looking at my Chinese takeaway. I nodded, smiling. My greatest worry on joining was I might have to give up our weekend takeaway, but I didn’t need to. Before I joined, for three weeks, I’d driven to the venue, parked up, then driven home again. Once I finally got inside, experienced the atmosphere and found the plan would fit with our family tradition, I wished I’d gone sooner. It took me six months to lose four stone in , encouraged by my group and mum, Margaret, who was always the first to hear about my weight loss.  I trained to be a consultant myself and, with mum looking out for me, I kept the weight off as I embarked on my new career. In , mum passed away suddenly at . Devastated, I sought comfort in food and by , I was st lb. I knew the last thing mum would have wanted was to see me unhappy, so I rejoined Slimming World as a member. With my group’s support, I reached my target in . I was determined to maintain my weight for good by staying at group — and I’m still in my st target range.Lynne is ft in tall and weighs st lb, having lost st lb  sI feel better now than I did in my s Sheila Smith, , is a business owner. She lives in Sunderland, Tyne and Wear, with her husband, Rob. I struggled to lose the weight I’d gained having my two children and ended up in oversized clothes. But I wanted to be an energetic mum, so in  I joined Slimming World with Rob’s support. In nine months of enjoying delicious, satisfying meals, I’d slimmed from st lb to st lb. Then I went through a devastating bout of depression. Trapped at home by my illness, I regained the six stone I’d lost and more. I developed fibromyalgia, a long-term condition causing pain all over my body, and felt at my lowest ebb.  But in , Rob and I decided to start a new business — a vape shop. I wanted to lose weight so I could feel confident talking to the public. The thought of going back scared me — I was wrongly worried people would judge me for regaining the weight. But I’m so glad I did. Le couldn’t feel more dferent since losing st fraclb. These days I’m raring to get up at am to run along the seafront, and my wardrobe staple is skinny jeans and fitted tops — those baggy clothes are far behind me.Sheila is ft in tall and weighs st fraclb, having lost st fraclb  sLosing st helped me become a mum Cheryl Watson, , is a teaching assistant. She lives in Birmingham with her husband, Neil, and their children Chloe, nine, and Jake, five. You have polycystic oy syndrome, the doctor told me. You may not be able to get pregnant naturally. But as I left the hospital that day in , I was determined to prove him wrong. I’d heard losing weight might improve my chances — and my mum, Lesley, already with Slimming World, gave me lots of encouragement. With her on my side and the support of my fantastic group, I lost st in nine months. In September , I started to feel a little queasy, although my husband Neil and I didn’t dare to hope. But after six positive pregnancy tests we finally believed it. Chloe, came along, and four years later I gave birth to Jake. I call them my Slimming World babies as I’m convinced it was losing weight that brought them to me.  There were other changes too. I dropped five dress sizes, going from a  to a , and after years of being self-conscious, my confidence grew. Neil has also lost st by enjoying tasty meals with me and the kids.

It worked for me and I could help you with the cooking, she said.With that, I’d made up my mind. It was just after New Year  and my Instagram feed was full of reminders of how much bigger I was than my older brothers.They’d always been slim. I was born with one leg longer than the other, and childhood surgery to correct it didn’t quite work. The next operation at , was more successful. But it meant three months in bed, followed by three months of taking it easy, and my weight crept up. Bigger than I’d ever been, I reckoned Slimming World was worth a try.  I wasn’t sure a young ld like me would fit in, but I quickly felt at home and found inspiration surrounded by other people who all had the same goal. Since losing over six stone, I feel % better.

The woman is said to have been stuck in the burning home in Bristol on Saturday when she made the bold decision to jump. Witnesses claimed she leaped from a second floor window onto a trampoline in the garden beneath. Neighbours said they believed she would have died had she stayed in the home, where she was reportedly screaming get me out, get me out. One said she witnessed her make the leap onto her trampoline in the front garden.  Kirsty Dukes told The Sun she was about to put her daughter to bed when she heard a bang that sounded like a car crash.I was at the kitchen window and saw the kids climbing frame installed in front of their house fly into the road. I could hear the upstairs neighbours screaming Get me out, get me out, she said. She said she could see her neighbour, a woman, stuck at the top of the home, while Ms Dukes partner pulled a man who was literally on fire out of the building. We got him to roll across the grass and put him out with water. She claimed to have witnessed the woman stuck on the top storey as she jumped out onto a trampoline in the front garden, adding: I honestly thought someone was going to die.The explosion caused homes several minutes walk away from the property in the Hartclfe area of Bristol to shake after the blast, the Bristol Post reported.Firefighters are still investigating the cause of the explosion, however eyewitnesses believe it could have been started by a gas boiler. The explosion at about .pm on Saturday night destroyed the house in the southern Bristol suburb.  Steve Imrie, Avon Fire and Rescue Area Manager, said: “We committed two crew in breathing apparatus to contain and inspect the fire, while other firefighters began to administer first aid to a number of persons at the scene. All casualties were conscious and breathing. Certainly the initial person who was treated has suffered minor burns.  He added that the cause of the incident remained unknown and is subject to an investigation.: Early information is that there was potential gas at the property, though this is yet to be confirmed.” Fire crew members had managed to extinguish the blaze, and worked to administer first aid to a number of casualties at the scene, prior to the arrival of ambulance crews and police officers.  Eyewitness Taylor Pearson, whose aunt lives next door to the home, said she was safe. Luckily she is in hospital so wasn’t in at the time.

School teacher Cindy Biddle underwent major surgery to remove the skin cancer which was lodged inside her nose. Although the surgeons were able to remove the danger, they had to remove part of the -year-olds nostril and rebuild it using skin from her forehead. The reconstruction left her with huge swelling disfiguring her face while it healed, but Cindy. from Florida, said she refused to let people stare. My scars were pretty jarring, but there’s no way I was going to hide away. “If I caught anyone giving me an unwarranted stare, I told it to them straight, she said.   One time, I turned around on a group of guys walking behind me and they jumped back with a look of disgust. It reduced me to tears, and when I saw them again the day after, they were all laughing. “This time, I kept my cool and told them: ‘Don’t act like jerks. It’s obvious I’ve had surgery.’ “They turned tail and ran.” Today the teachers scars are almost totally healed, but she - and doctors - almost missed the cancer entirely.   The only visible sign of the tumour growing inside her face was a tiny sore, which looked just like a spot that would not heal. Cindy tried picking at it and moisturising, and was even prescribed an antibiotic cream by her doctor, but it would not get better. It was only identied as basal cell carcinoma - a skin cancer is mostly caused by too much exposure to the ultraviolet rays from the sun - by accident.The history teacher had gone to a walk-in clinic because she had a bad migraine , when the new doctor spotted the spot on her nose and immediately referred to a specialist. Cindy said she had no idea spending too much time outdoors could have given her cancer. I’d been working as a bar tender at a local Mexican place and had spent a fair amount of time in the sun and on the beach. “Growing up, no one gave a second thought to sun protection and I spent a lot of my childhood outside in the sunshine. “I was told the cancer had probably been growing for decades, possibly since I was  years old.” When she did go under the kne to remove the tumour, her husband Jonathan had to leave the room he was so shocked by the size of the growth.   Doctors then stretched her cheek skin to cover the hole and built her a new left nostril with skin from her forehead. Despite her shocking new appearance, Cindy said there was no alternative. This was something I had to do, because otherwise the cancer was literally going to eat my face off. I could have lost an eye or my entire nose.” She charted her recovery from the surgery with photos as the swelling gradually went down and her face ed to normal. Today, she is focusing on spreading the word about the danger of skin cancer and importance of protecting skin.

Mark Davies, , has challenged any expert to prove his video doesnt show spirits emerging from a grave containing the bodies of two women at Falmouth Cemetery. He told Cornwall Live he has probably the best evidence in the world right now of authentic paranormal activity, in the footage filmed last week.“I’ve been doing this for two years now and have never seen anything like it.” Mark has edited the video down to a  minute clip and is hoping that it will force senior paranormal investigators to take notice. Mark has already appeared in local news after he spoke out about his encounter with a mysterious creature which he described as an alien or a demon.He said: “It’s crazy. There’s a number of things happening and I’ve edited it to bring into focus the heads on the grave. “To the left of the grave there are also figures coming out and you can see an orb figure that moves. A solid object clearly walks for two seconds then vanishes in a sort of white mist.  “I invite any expert to dispel this evidence as it is the pinnacle of proof for le after death. You can see the faces coming out of the grave and something happening. A ball of cotton or something floats above the graves, it’s mental. Mark says that now the weather is improving he intends to go out and investigate Cornwall’s paranormal activity more frequently. He added: “This is proof of le after death and I’m hoping to get it on the national news so someone important in the paranormal field will notice it. Visually it’s as clear as day and the most concrete evidence you can get. I just wanted visual proof to show people and I’ve got it now.”  Mark says that he pays no attention to doubters and just wants to concentrate on his work. He says his next step is to investigate why the spirits appear to be stuck in the graveyard. He said: “I will use transcommunication special radio to help them across. The spirits need to be comforted and know that they won’t be judged. They just need to forgive themselves and go home.” "},{"url":null,"title":"meghan markles morocco visit amid","story":"NewsMeghan Markles Morocco visit amid mystery of countrys missing princessPrincess Lalla Salma, the we of King Mohammed VI, has not been seen in public since the end of  - with rumours re about her ious whereaboutsShareCommentsByAmber Hicks:,  FEB Updated:,  FEB Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news uk-news video harry-meghan-arrive-crowds-greet-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, combinedPrompt :true, subsets :[,,,,,],bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,info:,article:,info:,],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, combinedPrompt :true, subsets :[,,,,,],bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true\"\"Get the biggest Royal Family stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailAs Meghan Markle and Prince Harry spent the day promoting female empowerment in the glorious Moroccan sunshine - the mystery of the missing princess loomed in the background. It has been almost two years since ruler King Mohammed VIs we Princess Lalla Salma was last seen in public. The pair, who met at a party in  and married several years later, are widely rumoured to have orced - but this has never been confirmed by the Palace or members of the royal family. The disappearance of the -year-old princess from public le is said to have become an elephant in the room with Moroccan media reportedly choosing not to make mention of it.  But when Meghan, , and Harry, , meet King Mohammed, , tomorrow, British officials said they had no ideathe VIP visitors would ask after her in spite of their mission to promote gender equality. The focus of the the Duke and Duchesss four-day trip is also the changing social attitudes towards women in the country. Meghan and Harry have already met the couples son Crown Prince Moulay Hassan, , dubbed one of the “richest teenagers in the world”. He shook hands with the pair at the entrance to their royal villa in the grounds of King Mohammeds palace after they stepped off the plane at Casablanca airport onto a red carpet last night. They are staying as “honoured guests of the King” at one of the opulent royal palacesuntil Tuesday. It was believed to be the first official meeting between the British royal family and the future monarch of Morocco.   The King and Princess Lalla Salma also have an -year-old daughter, Princess Lalla Khadija. Princess Lalla Salmas whereabouts have been the subject of much speculation with rumours shes living in exile in the United States. There has also been a suggestion she is in the Greek Island of Kea with her daughter. Netty Leistra, a royal journalist, told Royal Central : “I think Salma had a very hard job trying to be the first visible we of a Moroccan king.There is quite an age gap too. Salma did some good things and of course, gave birth to two children. I always thought she did rather well. I guess thatthe news is correct about the orce, they will give her a nice big house and all the money she needs so that she won’t say anything about it. But I think it is rather sadit is true.” Like Meghan and Harry, the princess is a prominent supporter of womens rights. She also attended Kate Middleton and Prince Williams wedding in .  The Duke and Duchesss visit is focusing on womens empowerment, social entrepreneurship and girls education. Today the couple visited a school boarding house run by Education For All, an organisation for girls aged between  and  from some of the poorest and most remote areas of the country. The Duke and Duchess dropped into a classroom and spoke to some of the girls studying for exams, for whom without the school they would not have the chance to reach their full potential. It is a project transforming attitudes to female education in the Moroccan mountains and something the Duchess of Sussex wanted to visit. A heavily-pregnant Meghan also took part in a Henna ceremony, in which -year-old student Samira decorated the Duchesss hand with a henna flower to celebrate her pregnancy. The henna is tradition in Morocco and a blessing during the seventh month of pregnancy to celebrate the health of mother and baby. This evening, Harry and Meghan were greeted to Rabat residence of British Ambassador Thomas Reilly.  Upon entering the home the Duke and Duchess were given a traditional rosewater greeting and were officially welcomed by the ambassador’s we Leah. Meghan dazzled in a Moroccan inspired kaftan style Dior gown, with Dior clutch bag. At the glittering reception the royal couple mingled with guests from across Moroccan society including young leaders, entrepreneurs, business representatives and influential people from local girls’ education and sport. Meghan discussed the boundaries women face and issued a clarion call to feminists around the world. She said: “Women have to challenge everywhere in the world.” The event was held to highlight the positive dference the guests have made to Moroccan society through their influence and activities. A spokesperson for The Duke and Duchess previously said: Their Royal Highnesses are very much looking forward to the visit and are grateful to their hosts and the British Embassy for arranging such an interesting programme. They are particularly pleased that they will have the opportunity to meet so many young Moroccans over the next few days.

He still needs a lot of work, working with a partner and when to link and stuff but I’m delighted with his goals contribution so far.”"},{"url":null,"title":"dundee boss mcintyre ready to cross swords with new hibs gaffer heckingbottom","story":"Jim McIntyre and Paul Heckingbottom will cross swords for the first time in their managerial careers when Dundee and Hibs clash at Dens tonight.However, while Jim admits to knowing little of his opposite number, his knowledge of the team he’ll be putting out means he’s not expecting too many tactical surprises.Hibs appointed Heckingbottom as the successor to Neil Lennon last week and he kicked off his time in Scotland with an Easter Road win over Hamilton Accies.While, in time, the Dee boss knows his opposite number will put his own stamp on the Hibees, right now he’s not expecting too many drastic tactical changes from the way they lined up under Lennon.“I don’t know him but he got off to a good start and Hibs have good players. It’s going to be a tough game,” said Jim.“He’s got good options as well, you need to be able to handle that.“We know what players he’s got to work with and we know their strengths and weaknesses like we do most of the other squads in the league.

People know my dad – after I put it on Facebook I’ve just had loads of comments with people saying that my dad was like a mentor to them.“Some musicians have been in touch to say my dad taught them how to play.”Kenny’s elder sister, Phyllis Duffin, , from Craigiebank, said his talents went beyond his musical knowledge, adding: “He had learnt six languages from French, Spanish, Urdu to Polish.

It was a horrible thing to watch.“It was hard for him, he couldn’t drive anymore but he knew what was ahead. He developed a stammer and got frustrated.”Kenneth said: “Dad was a smart man so it was heartbreaking to see him getting ill.“The other week we were all sitting round him and he hadn’t spoken in over two years but then he began blethering and singing in German.“I told my sister that dad was talking and then he recognised Phyllis when she came in.“His music was playing in the hospital room and my sister turned down the stereo.“Dad said, ‘don’t do that again’ – it was braw!”"},{"url":null,"title":"shoppers complain of dundee post office mess as refurbishment is postponed","story":"A Broughty Ferry Post Office has had its refurbishment delayed despite complaints of it being littered with “mess”.The Gray Street branch was originally going to close from February  to March  to be given a makeover but residents have now been told the refurbishment has been postponed “indefinitely”.Christine Kenny, from Broughty Ferry, regularly uses the branch.She said: “The condition of the Post Office is a disgrace, with quite a bit of litter around.“There are bags of rubbish dumped in the front shop.”She added: “It was to be refurbished, but when I was in today the assistant mentioned it has been postponed.“The Post Office should have a say about its condition.“Even a brush, cloth or duster wouldn’t go amiss.”Ferry councillor Craig Duncan spoke of the store’s condition, saying: “The refurbishment has been deferred by the postmaster rather than the Post Office. In a way it’s disappointing but it helps in the short term because the Barnhill Post Office remains closed due to fire damage.”He added: “A lot of these matters are down to the postmaster rather than the Post Office to deal with.“I understand the purpose of the refurbishment is to bring these things up to spec and I welcome that and it will happen at some point.

To add to the drama, it’s done as a race against the clock.And McIntyre is gaining a growing reputation for doing the same with top-flight clubs here.Four-and-a-bit years ago he arrived at Ross County with the Highland outfit seemingly already doomed to relegation.By the end of that season he hadn’t just kept the Staggies up, he’d rebuilt them into a squad that would go on and win silverware in the shape of the  League Cup.After the Dark Blues’ weekend win at Livingston got them out of the bottom two for the first time since the end of August, thanks to goals from new handy men Andrew Nelson and Scott Wright, there are strong signs he can do the same at Dens Park.McIntyre’s reign as Dundee boss started in October when he received an SOS from owner Tim Keyes and managing director John Nelms.After a miserable start to the campaign, the Americans’ dream of cementing their team as a force in the Premiership and, eventually, taking the club to a new stadium looked in danger of crumbling around them.Confirmation of just how dire the need for an emergency rebuild came in his first game in charge when the roof fell in during a - defeat at Livi. It showed how flimsy the foundations of the team were as they collapsed under the weight of the home team’s excellence at set-pieces.Almost exactly four months on and after that second visit to the Tony Macaroni Arena under the new boss, the structure looks much more sound.And it’s all thanks to the kind of speedy reconstruction he undertook at County and of which Knowles and his team would be proud. For the team that ran out against Livi at the weekend bore no resemblance to the one McIntyre had to work with when he first headed there.Not one of the players in the starting XI in October were on from the start this time and of the  who were involved on that first day,  have left the club.Only Kenny Miller, Cammy Kerr and Elliott Parish remain and, of those three, veteran Miller was the sole participant in the vital - victory.For McIntyre, to bring about almost a complete change in such a short space of time has been a gamble, one that will only be confirmed as paying offhis team are still in the Premiership come the end of the season.It’s one, though, that represents his best chance of success and it is very much a case of so far so good.While Dundee under him remain a work in progress, the signs of improvement have been there for all to see.Since the end of the winter break there have been two wins, two draws and just one defeat in five league outings.By some margin that’s been the best run of form in the top flight so far this term.If it continues there is every reason to believe that target of building a team good enough for this level by the end of the season will have been achieved.Andthat is the case, fans will be hoping given more time, the manager will be able to set about putting together something even more impressive for next season and beyond."},{"url":null,"title":"mcdonalds-launches-veggie-happy-meals-as-greggs-sells-vegan-sausage-rolls","story":"MCDONALDrsquoS restaurants across Glasgow have launched their first-ever vegetarian

We originally only planned to install one but the money kept coming in and we had enough for another one so we spoke to Davy’s Fish Bar and they said they would back it.”The defibrillators can be purchased for around £, – a reduced price because they were bought in bulk through the Butchers at the Heart of the Community scheme.Both defibrillators will be accessibly to the public when needed.If an emergency  call is made and the defibrillator is registered with the Scottish Ambulance Service, the nearest device can be located and a code given to the caller to unlock it.Once opened, instructions are provided.For heart-attack victims, the community defibrillators could prolong their lives by vital minutes, because the more time that passes during a cardiac arrest without assistance, the less chance there is of survival.Mr Milne said he was overwhelmed by the community’s generosity.He said: “Most of it was raised in the shop. We also raised about £ through a Just Giving page.“Local musicians put together a concert at Newhills Church, and a second one at Bucksburn Church which raised quite a bit of money.

First performed in , Within This Dust has gone on to be staged all over the UK and internationally, including at the   memorial and museum.Especially inspired by Richard Drew#s unforgettable photograph, The Falling Man, Within This Dust details the experience of witness, Lisa Hood, and victim, Vince Virr, of the   attacks.The witness finds herself surrounded in dust, made of crumpled paper, and begins a grieving process of hunting through the papers, finding meaning in the words, as someone tries to tidy around her. The second act features the victim joining the witness, creating a connection that will inevitably be broken, when finally, in the third act, the victim is alone, caught between a choice of the smoke and fire within the collapsing building or the  metre drop to freedom.It was a very poignant performance, tenderly expressing the horror of the incident, perhaps now weakened due to overindulgence. When the lights came up everyone stayed where they were, perhaps a little too stunned to move. Chatter was in whispers, for respect to people who could not hear them.As the narrator of the show captured and pieced together from coverage of the attacks said, the dust has not settled, and never will. The losses of the people in the planes and buildings is still felt, and the wider western world is still wary, still learning, still recovering.Within This Dust manages to depict the horror of that day beautully, and more importantly, delicately. No easy task for a grieving world.PIC:Craignish Village Hall was full. _aWithinThisDustLisa Hood amongst the #dust#. _aWithinThisDustDancer, Lisa Hood. _aWithinThisDustLisa Hood collecting dust. _aWithinThisDustLisa Hood and Vince Virr. _aWithinThisDustDancer, Vince Virr. _aWithinThisDustVince Virr facing the smoke, or the window. _aWithinThisDust"},{"url":null,"title":"mid argyll rugby fans form scotlands honour guard","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThree Mid Argyll-based girls were among those given the honour of forming the honour guard at Friday February #s Scotland v Italy women#s rugby game.Amber Russell, Drew Buckley and Anya Gritten travelled to Scotstoun stadium on Friday night with their Oban U teammates to form the honour guard for the Scotland women#s team as they took on Italy in the first game of this year’s six nations tournament.The girls formed a tunnel of Saltire flags for the teams to run through as they took to the field.

This area of Argyll is the most fragile in the region. The people of Argyll, businesses and visitors deserve no less.Forget the squandering of £m on unreliable, mitigation measures trying to justy a flawed decision made many years ago to use the Old Military Road as a ersion which has failed on many occasions and now has a landslip between the two roads. Forget the expensive excavation of pits by the A rather use the cuttings into the hillside to form a two lane road protected with a flow over canopy with closed outer edges at the four problems gullies. If the contractors on the present scheme can work without any road closures then the flow over canopy option would not lead to closures as many officials and some politicians claim.This is a red herring postponing #a proper solution#. When this is option is completed it will save on the expense of manning the ersion route involving - personnel and - vehicles, replacing expensive nettings, delays whilst the farmer clears his animals and collect his fees. A scandalous waste of public money. Solve The Rest Landslides and stop wasting on mitigating measures.Like Brendan O#Hara I#m neither an engineer or geologist but both of us are blessed with plain common sense. If the Faroese can build a tunnel at £.m per kilometre surely a simple open sided m canopy would cost considerably less. In  at Dawlish .km of double tracked railway and .km of sturdy seawall was built at a cost of £m in eight weeks. Why have we in Argyll after nine years, four dferent Transport Ministers and £m spent and still have no guaranteed safe passage   on The Rest and Be Thankful Follow the Argyll Advertiser#s campaign #Invest in the Rest#. Transport Minister Michael Matheson, Transport Scotland and our Government must abandon their obsession with mitigation measures and fund a permanent solution. We demand no less.Sir,Calls for assurances that the Rest and Be Thankful section of the A will be improved to resist future landslides were made during a session of Transport, Infrastructure and Connectivity questions in the Scottish Parliament.I quizzed transport secretary Michael Matheson, about what was discussed at the last meeting of the A Taskforce in November , and asked what assurances the Cabinet Secretary could give to local residents and businesses who rely on the A being open at all times.The Rest and Be Thankful was closed off for nine days in October  following the largest landslide in a decade, forcing road users to either take a major ersion, or to use the Old Military Road during certain hours of the day.A number of petitions were created during the period of the incident, including one by myself, calling for a permanent solution to the Rest and Be Thankful.The transport secretary said that the meeting was #full and frank#, and that there would be a #review of the potential for additional landslide mitigation measures at the Rest and Be Thankful#, and that this would be discussed at the next A Taskforce meeting in March .There was also a commitment that Argyll and Bute would be #prioritised# in the next Strategic Transport Projects Review.I welcome the assurances by the transport secretary that there will be a review of any additional measures for the Rest and Be Thankful, and that Argyll and Bute will receive priority at the next Strategic Transport Projects Review.Donald Cameron, MSPReserve forcesSir,Last issue#sletter raising concerns about the UK government’s proposed use of the army’s reserve force in the event of a no-deal Brexit is timely.In case anyone out there still thinks a no-deal Brexit is a good idea it’s worth noting that the legal authorityof Reserve Forces Act  allowing the Secretary of State to take this step requires him to establish that it is necessary #for the alleviation of distress or the preservation of le or property in time of disaster or apprehended disaster#.Enough said.Frances Roberts, Ardrishaig"},{"url":null,"title":"inveraray accordion and fiddle club rings in the new year","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe Inveraray and District Accordion and Fiddle Club got the New Year off to a great start at the Inveraray Inn on January .Supporting players were Fyne Folk, with Sally Hall, Alex John MacLeod, Jake MacKay on fiddles, Agnes Liddell on keyboard and were joined by Calum Satchel on fiddle.

A long ball to the right hand side was met by Ryan Caskie who cut the ball back to Stuart McLean. The youngster took a touch before slotting past the Pupils# goalkeeper to give Star a - lead.Star continued to press and doubled their lead when Coll McCallum robbed the Pupils# defender on the edge of the box before cutting the ball across goal.

Our hearts are bidden to imitate the snow-drops: to come up from the darkness, raise themselves into the sunlight, and then fill the world with gladness.Parishioners from Ardrishaig, Christ Church, Lochgilphead and Glassary are joining together this Lent to read a poem a day through the  days of Lent and then Easter week. The poems have been chosen are in a beautul book, entitled The Heart’s Time, by Janet Morley. The poems come from across the English-speaking world, over the last four centuries. One poem is set for each day, accompanied by a short explanation, a reflection, and a brief suggestion for our own thinking.Parishoners will be reading the poems at home for those who wish it there will be meetings to share thoughts and inspiration at Ardrishaig Church during the weeks of Lent and at Christ Church on Sundays. Other meetings could be arranged, formally or informally.You can order the book from Fr Simon Mackenzie by emailing dr.lachlan@zen or calling  , or directly from Argyll Book Centre.

For in  she was Mrs Thomson, and husband Gilbert was the third generation in his family to run the business.

In fact, on average, Borderers are forking out pound less than their Northumbrian opposite numbers.Since First Minister Nicola Sturgeon announced the end of the freeze in , Scottish Borders Council has taken full advantage of the ability to raise council tax by % each year, and this year is no dferent, as the council agreed to a three per cent increase in December .However, the deal agreed by the SNP and Scottish Greens allows councils to raise tax by up to . per cent for  .Council leader Shona Haslam, who represents Tweeddale East, has been adamant that Scottish Borders Council will not take advantage of the increased limit, and will not raise an extra . per cent on Borderersrsquo council tax, instead sticking to an increase of three per cent.Council will not introduce workplace parking levy:Scottish Conservatives in the Borders have been very vocal about their opposition to the Scottish Government plans to introduce a workplace parking levy, where employers will be charged an annual tax based on how many parking spaces they provide for their employees.The aim is to persuade more commuters to use public transport in a bid to reduce pollution, but the charge could lead to employers passing the bill onto their employees.Both councillor Haslam and Scottish Borders Councilrsquos SNP opposition leader Stuart Bell, who both represent the rural ward of Tweeddale East, have signalled their opposition to the plans, so it is extremely unlikely this will feature in the councilrsquos budget proposals.Borderers who travel to Edinburgh for work could possibly be affected by the levy though, as Edinburgh City Council is considering implementing the charges.A move to three-weekly bin collections:Rumours have been circulating amongst councillors that Scottish Borders Councilrsquos waste refuse collection service will move to three-weekly bin collections, from the current once-a-fortnight collectionThe local authority is currently reviewing its waste collection service, which is expected to feed into the new budget for  .In fact, at a meeting of the council in October , Selkirkshire councillor Gordon Edgar, the authorityrsquos executive member for roads and infrastructure, refused to rule out the possibility when questioned by Hawick and Denholm councillor David Paterson.,params: .pushThe veteran Hawick councillor said: ldquoIf they go to a three-weekly collection it would cause some very serious problems for many of the people that we represent and I am sure it would increase the incidents of fly tipping.No tourism tax:Another controversial aspect of the SNP Scottish Greens budget proposals is the introduction of a tourism tax on nightly accommodation.Much like the workplace parking levy, local authorities have discretion over whether to implement it or not, and again Scottish Borders Tories have ruled out introducing it here.Changes to grass cutting services:Grass cutting, or the lack of it, has been a constant thorn in the side of the council over the past year.As an issue which caused a large furore, Scottish Borders Council could well announce further changes to the grass cutting regime, particularly around the maintenance of cemeteries.Changing the frequency of grass cutting from a -day cycle to a -day cycle was widely criticised by communities, with residents reporting overgrown public spaces and ankle-high grass in the regionrsquos cemeteries.Many opposition councillors have called for a rethink on the councilrsquos grass cutting policy, and due to the large number of complaints from Borders resident it is expected to be addressed in Thursdayrsquos budget announcement."},{"url":null,"title":"sos-to-keep-youth-club-afloat","story":"AN SOS has been issued in a bid to keep a village youth club open.Walkerburn Youth Club needs adults who have an interest or experience in working with young people to get in touch.The club meets at the Public Hall every Thursday evening from . to pm -

Now, with less regulation in place, there are thousands.’True to the name, Viola FC is a family-run agency # his son Johnny joined its ranks in early  # with their main work both in representing players coming to the UK, and ‘brokering’.John explained: ‘We mostly represent footballers transferring to the UK, while brokering involves working with clubs, players and other agents to help bring those players here.‘That said, we have done a lot of work in countries such as Brazil and China in recent years, where there is a huge appetite for football. You make valuable contacts and get to see some exciting players.’However, for John the image of the football agent thrashing out a lucrative deal for himself as well as for the player, fails to tell the whole story.He explained: ‘Of course working in football can be financially rewarding, but it’s a hard job. People think you’re just walking around in a suit with a laptop and phone, but so much goes into being a player representative.‘You need to travel a lot, and that means lots of airport lounges and hotel rooms.‘You’re working long days and doing lots behind the scenes, and all year round,  because that’s what it takes.‘The public see the excitement of the transfer windows on TV and then think that’s all agents do.‘If an agent does their job properly, they are available day and night, looking after the whole package for the player, like houses and children’s schooling.‘We’re more than a ‘necessary evil’, we do an important service for both the club, and the player.’Thinking about Campbeltown visits again, John brings up a memorable trip to the Wee Toon, where his son Johnnybecame an unofficial pool champ.John said: ‘My uncle John took us to the Commercial Inn to watch a game of football on the TV. Johnny was only young but he ‘won’ a pool competition in the pub.‘Of course, the adults had let him win, but he believed for about ten years he was the pool champion of Campbeltown!‘That’s just one but I have lots of good memories of visiting Campbeltown, and the surrounding areas, such as Machrihanish.#For me Kintyre is a special part of Scotland.’Reflecting on a career in football of more than  years, including representing many Celtic and Rangers players, his hunger as an agent remains.John, whose recent travels include talent-scouting missions to Portugal and Ghana, added: ‘I am blessed to do this job. I have made some great personal connections and am even godfather to some players’ children.I grew up in Easterhouse, and now I get to work with top players and managers, visiting great stadiums. It’s not bad to be able to say that.‘At the same time, I know I have worked hard for those opportunities and I don’t take them for granted.’John Viola with his son Johnny centre and former client, and now colleague, Craig Moore in Ghana."},{"url":null,"title":"letter district news disappoints","story":"I note that for the second week running the Islay section of the Courier#sIs this now Courier policy Are we to have a regular feature on the wonderful works and world of the all-conquering Alastair to sit alongside his weekly SNP bad letter It was said of Alan Reid in his days as MP that he would attend the opening of an envelope Alistair Redman could give him lessons.A Google search for our beloved councillor produces Alastair Redman archives # Campbeltown Courier as the th result, after two for ArgyllThere seems to me to be an uncomfortably close association between our local paper and a local politician.Tony WilliamsGrumpy Old ManMuasdale"},{"url":null,"title":"letter maintain tarberts social housing","story":"The issue that I hear about the most, from ward members in Tarbert, is the need for new social housing and the importance of maintaining and improving the existing housing stock.While the four new houses that are planned are welcome many residents have quite rightly said that many more are needed.Both externally and internally, housing must be improved including repairing and repainting the hallways that link many housing association flats.There have also been calls to rollout external wall insulation across all of the social housing in Tarbert, and while there has been a start on this clearly more needs to be done.As a social housing tenant myself I know all to well the dficulties in getting housing associations to act on concerns raised by tenants.I continue to press for more and better social housing across the Kintyre and Islands ward.Councillor Alastair Redman,Portnahaven,Islay."},{"url":null,"title":"down memory lane february 15 2019","story":"Maths and science teacher and latterly computer programmer, Roger Breckenridge, from Minnesota, USA told the Courier: #As far as I am aware the last Breckenridge to live in Campbeltown, was James Breakenridge who died in .#I have finished my own Breckenridge genealogy and have traced my Breckenridge lineage back to Glencraigs, just a couple of miles north of Campbeltown, along the Tarbert Road.#My ancestors were tenant farmers at Glencraigs, then called Craigs in the early to mid s.#Some of his ancestors are buried at Kilkerran cemetery and he specically knows there are graves for Andrew Breckenridge and his we Janet Finlay.In one posting, on the Courier#s Facebook page, Mr Breckenridge has askedany readers know where the Breckenridge#s rest and whether it would be possible to have photographs emailed.He is also looking for a very old place-name, possibly Glenreavoll,  concerning a Breckenridge family.Mr Breckenridge said: #All I know is that Glenreavoll must have been located somewhere in Scotland but not necessarily in Argyll or Kintyre.#A Breckenridge family lived at Glenreavoll in the year .#I have no idea what Glenreavoll was or where it was located.

But spring still feels like a long way off.I crave it, not just because it makes the evening walks in the woods possible once more, but because of the beauty it s to the landscape.The land is still dormant, with nature seemingly sleeping. Itrsquos at this time of year that the ugly results of peoplersquos disregard for the land can be most clearly seen. Litter of all kinds lsquodecoratesrsquo the roadsides. In summer it is partly hidden as hedges, roadside bushes and grasses grow. But in winter nature retreats and exposes the extent of peoplersquos uncaring behaviour.I canrsquot understand it, I really canrsquot. Our country is so beautul, yet so many people just throw rubbish from their car window. Do they not see the results and feel a sense of shame and horror  In a country where we have the facilities to dispose of our rubbish, there is simply no excuse to trash our landscape like this.And in a time when there are cuts to vital services, councils having to pay money to pick up peoplersquos rubbish from the sides of roads is just another unseen effect. Itrsquos not just that itrsquos ugly to look at, itrsquos polluting our environment, killing wildle and leaving an appalling legacy for our children.And so as we set off last Sunday for a walk, the sight of litter strewn everywhere along the roadside was quite depressing. And my children noticed its ugliness too. ldquoWhy do people litter like this  I was asked by my five-year-old Skye, and to be honest I struggled for an answer.ldquoI really donrsquot know, but it must be because they donrsquot care.My daughter seemed forlorn at this reply as we drove past a mass of discarded fast food remains, plastic bottles, beer bottles, plastic bags and yet more fast food rubbish.But I wanted to lt her spirits and so told her we were going on a hunt for something beautul. We were on a snowdrop hunt! And so as we drove to our destination, I reminded them of my version of the old story:lsquoMany years ago, Snow had no colour. It felt ashamed and left out to be colourless, especially when the land was so beautully covered in flowers of all dferent colours.And so Snow asked the flowersthey would be willing to share just a little of their colour. First Snow asked the daffodils, who were a beautul yellow. But they said no, they needed all their colour for themselves.Then Snow asked the bluebells, who were a wonderful blue. But they said they were too small to share any of their colour.Then Snow asked the whin bushesthey could share some of their vivid yellow, and they said no because they needed the colour.Snow even asked the roses of summer, but got the same answer: no.Then Snow heard a small voice and looked down. It was a small white flower. We can share some of our colour, with you it said.ldquoBut you are so small and you need your colour for yourself, said Snow. ldquoYes, the flower replied, ldquowe are small and we need our colour, but there are many of us andeach one of us gives a little then we can give you enough colour.ldquoThat is very kind of you but I donrsquot want to ruin your beautul appearance, said Snow.ldquoDonrsquot worry, said the wee white flower, ldquowe can all take a little colour from the inside of our petals, so it will not be noticed that any white is missing.rsquoAnd so that is how Snow became white. And because of the kindness shown by this little flower, Snow agreed to share its name with it, and so they became known as snowdrops.Snow also shared its space with the wee flower, so snowdrops and snow are often seen on the ground together. Andyou look carefully inside the snowdrop, you will see the hidden part where the white has been scraped off to give to Snow.With the storyrsquos end we arrived at Smeaton Lake, near East Linton, our destination for the snowdrop hunt. Itrsquos such a beautul place where a planted wood stands guard by a lake created  years ago. The woodland here is possibly unsurpassed in East Lothian for the canopy of snowdrops it displays.Excited screams at small patches of the flower soon gave way to ldquowow, look as we reached the end of the waterside and a wood carpeted by the wee flowers.My spirits were lted as I watched my daughter carefully examine flowers for evidence they had shared their colour. She showed her wee brother the green strips inside, explaining that is where the white was shared from. Both were careful not to damage or pick the flowers, despite their desire to do so.ldquoWersquoll find some growing in a less happy place and take those ones home, I assured them.And so we eventually headed back, a delicious bowl of ice cream at The Goth in Prestonpans, accompanied by traditional music, the reward for a good dayrsquos hunting.That night my daughter was reflective. ldquoI wish people wouldnrsquot spoil nature, she said. I felt guilty shersquos only five, I thought to myself, and shouldnrsquot have to be concerned about such things at that age. Perhaps I should have kept my thoughts to myself.ldquoBut I wonrsquot, and Irsquoll tell my friends not to as well. Can you tell me the snowdrop story again  So I told her the story once more.She had one wee snowdrop in a bowl by her bed. We had found it growing precariously at the verge of the road, surrounded by litter, and she wanted to lsquosaversquo it. So we did, hopefully with roots intact.ldquoWell we will plant the snowdrop in the garden and perhaps we will have our own snowdrops next year! I said to her, and she was happy at this.I went downstairs as she slept. My thoughts and emotions flooded me. My anger and depression at the ignorant mess we are making of our planet was superseded by my daughterrsquos determination to make a small dference, just like the snowdrop in the story.And perhaps therein lies the true message of that old tale: a dference can be made,we all do a little, but do it together.The children are the future, but letrsquos not leave all our ugly mess and destruction to our children to deal with. Let us all do something small, as many already are, to change the way we behave and how we appreciate what we have been gted.For our childrenrsquos sake, I really hope itrsquos not too late."},{"url":null,"title":"county-team-conquer-kilimanjaro-in-memory-of-vera-cameron","story":"Dougie Cameron and daughter Laura-Jane were joined by seven other men and women in climbing Mount Kilimanjaro last week.The trek was the latest fundraiser in memory of Vera Cameron and in aid of Cancer Research UK.Laura-Jane said that her mum would have thought the fundraisers were ldquooff our heads but would be ldquoreally proud of their achievement, which takes the fundraising total to about pound,.She said: ldquoIt was a really tough challenge but the fact we were doing it for charity kept us going.ldquoAt the end of the day, it was for such a good cause and we wanted to get to the top and keep the sponsorship going.ldquoThe whole experience was totally dferent to what I expected.ldquoBeing over seven days, we have never done anything like that before and it was tough mentally and physically.ldquoWe had one goal ndash to get to the summit ndash and we ended up making lots of new friends and spent a lot of time with other groups.ldquoIt was a really good experience overall.Vera, of Macmerry, worked for East Lothian Council as a senior administrator in transportation.Dougie, who is site attendant at Kinwegar Recycling Centre in Wallyford, was joined by seven colleagues from the council on the memorable trip.Laura-Jane, , and her dad set off from Scotland on January  alongside Ray Montgomery , Paul Ritchie , Lorraine Faulds , William Kelley , Stuart Baxter , Rachael Cormackand Vanessa Sanal .The group began the trip up the near-,-metre-high mountain on the Saturday and reached the summit last Thursday.Then it was back down before flying home on Sunday and back to work on Monday.Laura-Jane, who works as a PR officer, said it was ldquosurreal to think that just a few days earlier she had been standing at the top of Kilimanjaro.Already, more than pound, has been donated to the good cause, with that figure set to rise to pound, when all the money has been donated and counted.Previously, fundraisers have completed a number of other challenges ndash although nothing on the scale of the latest achievement ndash in memory of Vera, who was  when she passed away from cancer in .The West Highland Way, which stretches from Milngavie to Fort William , and the Three Peaks Challenge, which sees the highest peaks in Scotland, England and Wales ndash Ben Nevis, Scafell Pike and Snowdon respectively ndash climbed have been completed.Laura-Jane, who lives in Tranent, said: ldquoI think my mum would think we were off our heads for doing what we have done but really proud of us.

Such days are ones which have been borrowed from another month, and I think given the temperature and weather we have had recently the days have been borrowed from May.In , May will have borrowed Februaryrsquos days, so we can expect some unseasonal weather in that month as well, but in a dferent way.Sunday was a borrowed day for sure it was so mild and the later part sunny with a feeling of spring in the air. It was a perfect day for a discovery.We set off to find a place Irsquod only recently heard about. A friend had asked me what I knew about the lsquoKingrsquos Chairrsquo by Gullane. I had to admit that Irsquod never heard of it. He told me one of the holes at the golf course there has this name, but it seems it is named after a location nearby.This set me investigating. Sure enough, I found it marked on the map and searched for an image, which I found on a website called Ancient Stones: a large boulder, shaped like a throne, guarded by two other stones either side. It intrigued me and so our quest began.The starting point of our adventure was Gullane Beach car park. I knew roughly where to look but purposefully hadnrsquot brought the map so that we had a challenge to find the lsquochairrsquo. We knew what it looked like and that we needed to walk along the upper path, not the one that heads for the beach.We went the wrong way at first and got stuck in a mass of sea buckthorn, but on reflection that just added to the sense of adventure and achievement. We soon found our way and then suddenly there it was, up on Gullane Hill. The kids ran excitedly towards the stones, shouting: ldquoFound it, found it.I felt quite exhilarated at the discovery, and to be honest impressed by the sight of the Kingrsquos Chair. I can see how it got its name, as it looks something like a majestic reclining armchair. The two boulders on either side of it look like sentries keeping watch.The kids sat on it, of course, and I had to wait my turn after my we, who reckoned it could just as easily be a lsquoQueenrsquos Chairrsquo.When I finally got a chance to seat my majestic posterior on the chair, I realised the view was majestic as well, with Gullane Beach very visible in the near distance.I reflected on the fact we had recently visited Edinburgh Castle and seen the Stone of Destiny or Stone of Scone, along with the crown jewels. This rather uninspiring stone in Edinburgh Castle may be the coronation stone used for  years in England, but it is not, I am sure, the coronation stone used by ancient kings of Scotland, despite official claims that it is.I think itrsquos pretty clear that Edward I never got his hands on the real Stone of Destiny and I am convinced it has remained in Scotland, hidden somewhere, ever since. It occurred to me that this stone actually better fitted the early description of the original coronation stone at Scone than the one in Edinburgh Castle.ldquoImaginethis is the real Stone of Destiny and has been here all the time, I said fancully out loud. I know it isnrsquot, of course, but I have to saythis Kingrsquos Chair was on display at Edinburgh Castle it would certainly look more authentic.But sadly there seems to be no recorded tradition connected to this Kingrsquos Chair. I could find no story, or reference to the origin of its name. Perhaps some local people have some information on this There is an entry from the s that records the name, citing locals as the source, so there is some historic veracity in its title. But no suggestion is offered for the origin of the name, or any tradition associated with the stone. Its geology I could not say but it doesnrsquot seem to be a glacial erratic.And so we are left to wonder. We discussed how the stone got here and how it got its name. Maybe some children played here many generations ago and gave the boulder its title. Perhaps a Viking king who landed on Gullane Beach sat himself down on this natural throne to survey his warriors at their bloody work.Whatever the origin, the name, the location and the nature of the stone make this a worthwhile and fun discovery, even without a firm legend attached to it.And as I sat on the chair I watched smoke billowing from the coastline a little further to the west, close to the edge of Aberlady nature reserve. What caused the fire I didnrsquot know, but even from a distance it seemed destructive.It was a prophetic sight to witness from the Kingrsquos Chair. It looked like a burning coastline from a Viking raid. Thankfully the distant screech of fire engines told us help was on the way. The children wanted to go see the fire, but we kept our distance from the flames and let the firefighters do their job.So the trip to the Kingrsquos Chair had been an adventure in more ways than one. On our way back, the children advanced dferent theories about the origin of the name. It was universally agreed that a story must be made, but no agreement on the actual tale.ldquoPerhaps, I said, ldquowe should leave it to the imagination of those who search for and discover it, so they can sit and feel the power of the place and get ideas.My imagination was certainly ablaze. I saw the leader of the ancient Gododdin tribe, King Loth, sitting on the stone, looking out to the Firth as he watched his terried daughter in a small coracle being taken out to the open sea, his brutal punishment for her defiance of his authority.The story would fit as her journey began at Aberlady Bay, and so her small craft would have been seen from the Kingrsquos Chair as it passed by, being pulled out to sea by one of the kingrsquos boats.Itrsquos all a fancy of my imagination, of course, but thatrsquos my story.

But what do I know as a pale, stale male.What I do know is that ldquocis-gender is an ugly neologism which many women find offensive. They are content with their present sexual terminology. ldquoCis is in the same linguistic ballpark as ldquoTERF ndash trans exclusionary radical feminist, which is a term of abuse used against women who believe persons with penises are, er, male.

They can complain that ldquosex is a protected characteristic under the  Equalities Act, and that women therefore have a right to their own unique spaces.

It seems to be reinforcing outmoded concepts of gender to suggest that, because someone wants to wear dresses, play with dolls and put on makeup, they must have a lady brain in a male body. I thought we had left pink-for-girls gender stereotyping behind. But never mind. No-one wishes trans people any ill ndash certainly not me. But now that we are abandoning the very biological definition of sex, there are some anomalies that need to be addressed.Last week, a British transgender man, who had IVF by sperm donation and gave birth, won a court battle to prevent his child having ldquomother on its birth certicate. It will be the first child in history to have no mother. The The AIRE Centre, a human rights charity, contested this on the grounds that it would make le dficult for the child in future, when they apply for visas or anything which enquires about family background. The Government said simply that this isnrsquot a problem. From now on, fathers can give birth ndash end of.But Irsquom not sure this is the end of the matter. Children have not been included in the gender recognition debate thus far, even though they have rights too. It could be psychologically disturbing for a child to find, one day, that its mother has decided to become its dad. That song ldquoSometimes I feel like a motherless child takes on a whole new meaning.Of course, the trans parent will still be present, but is it OK to expect a child to suddenly start calling her natural mother her father  I would have thought that a child has a continuing right to a legal motherthey were born with one. If misgendering a trans person is unacceptable, surely demothering a child should be too. This is going to be confusing to say the least.Then there is the question of sport. The controversy over athlete Caster Semenya, a woman with high testosterone, raises the question of how to regard trans womenrsquos participation in women-only sport. Athletes who have testes, and therefore posses greater body mass, muscle strength and bone density, have an unfair advantage over old-fashioned women who have genetically female bodies.Next week, the International Association of Athletics Federations will argue in a hearing in Switzerland that people like Semenya should take testosterone-suppressing drugs before competing. Not only would this drive a coach and horses through the anti-doping protocols, it surely poses problem for transgender athletes who, of course, also take drugs like testosterone to help them transition to their ldquocorrect male sex. I hope the sporting authorities can get their heads around that because I canrsquot.Yet this is a very live issue in many sports. In the US, the ban on trans women taking part in power-lting events is being lted to prevent accusations of discrimination. You might have thought that having beefy, male-bodied women participating in these contests is discriminating against women athletes. Though, of course, only transphobes would say that, so we wonrsquot go there.The logical solution to this conundrum is to end sexual segregation in sport. Andwomen who are born biologically female never win any medals, tough. Strangely, there doesnrsquot seem to be the same issue about female-bodied trans men participating in male-only sport . Irsquom sure that has nothing whatever to do with the fact that they wonrsquot win anything.So welcome to the brave new world of post-sexual dferentiation, where men become women and fathers have children. It is one of the most radical and abrupt cultural changes in human history.Women have had a pretty bad deal in previous centuries, when they were regarded often as chattels without rights. In some Muslim societies theyrsquore still second-class citizens. Now, as women are finally emerging from the shadow of patriarchy, they are being told, by men, that they no longer have exclusive rights to their sexual identity.Itrsquos a weird turn of events. It seems women are just on the wrong side of history. But somehow, I donrsquot think theyrsquoll go quietly."},{"url":null,"title":"Glasgow  Gateway to Scotland  The best Charles Rennie Mackintosh within 90 minutes","story":"The striking beauty and modernity of the work was not fully appreciated in his letime, though the vision of its ambitious creator is now recognised and celebrated around the world.

He has spoken to priests, cardinals, bishops, monsignors, papal ambassadors, seminarians and the Swiss Guard. His conclusion, which will shock some and come as no surprise to others, is that about  per cent of the clergy in the Vatican state are gay. In other words, the HQ of a church that will not bless same-sex relationships, and forbids its clergy to have sex lives, is riddled with hyprocisy at its very core.Of these  per cent, Martel writes, some are celibate or in denial, others are living with their partners, or resort to prostitutes. A rule of thumb is that the more vehemently a cleric condemns homosexuality, the more likely he is to be in the closet himself. Hence the behaviour of the Colombian cardinal, Alfonso Lopez Trujillo. He was in the vanguard of the churchrsquos mission to prevent gay marriage. As the dire consequences of the Aids epidemic became clear, contrary to commonsense and compassion, he refused to encourage the use of condoms. Here was someone eager to be seen to uphold traditional values. Yet Martel claims that Trujillo, who died in , used male prostitutes.There are examples closer to home, among them the late Cardinal Keith OrsquoBrien, who pursued a similarly denunciatory anti-gay agenda, despite his own homosexuality and predatory behaviour. In fact, it doesnrsquot matter where you look. Throughout the Catholic churchrsquos parishes, globally and locally, there has been the mother of all cover-ups, not just in the buttoned-up past, but right now, here, today.You could say the church has been built on lies: countless men forced to hide who they really are, or to seek refuge in an all-male environment where they could find illicit love behind closed doors. Those clergy who were straight must have found themselves in a bewildering labyrinth of duplicity. That such depths of deceit have been allowed to thrive says all you need to know about the controlling power of those at the heart of the church.Martel believes that Pope Francis has earned enemies by adopting a very untypical approach. ldquoWho am I to judge  he replied, when askedhe condemned homosexuals, thereby loosening the ground beneath the feet of those in the Holy See who donrsquot want their secrets aired, or their way of le altered.The revelation of such widespread double standards is an echo of the medieval churchrsquos calamitous abuse of power and wealth. Out of it has sprung a culture where bullying, intimidation and blackmail have flourished. Andthat has been going on in this sphere, you can be sure it will have spilled over into every other part of the churchrsquos affairs.In the wake of the revelation of child abuse on a grand scale in the church, you begin to see why hiding the truth was the default position. This is not to make a link between homosexuality and child abuse but to see why the ecclesiastical authorities were so quick, and adept, at making the problem disappear. In avoiding scandal, they were intent on protecting their own rather than those who had been so grievously harmed.With evidence of institutionalised deception of the extent Martel claims, the church brings shame on itself: not for the numbers of priests who are gay, but for the willingness to lie about it, and to break vows, and the spirit of vocation, to an extent that will appall devout parishioners.Now is the time for the Catholic Churchrsquos own Reformation. No-one can any longer doubt that the le expected of a Catholic priest is unhealthy. And since there is no biblical injunction on him to be celibate, why can this not be changed  Already the church is embracing married Anglican vicars in flight from the ordination of women. Why not allow Catholic clergy the same right to open relationships, whether they be gay or straight Until the double-speak on which the modern church stands is addressed, there is no hope of winning back the faithful who have lost all trust and respect in this once revered institution. Obliging men to profess one thing while being another, is psychological torment. The denial of clergyrsquos humanity and self-expression is as cruel as anything the Inquisition devised. If the Vatican could bring itself to accept homosexuality, and gay marriage, and a non-celibate priesthood, it would be a truly Christian act.Read more: Cardinal Keith OBrien asked for forgiveness"},{"url":null,"title":"joanna-blythman-reviews-locarno-in-glasgow","story":"WErsquoVE decided to have one farinaceous main course at Locarno to keep down the total cost because the other mains are so expensive: pound. to pound..

Even the number of priests who have resigned the ministry, or those who have requested dispensation for clerical celibacy, those numbers are not forthcoming from the Vatican.\"That would help with the conversation about whether celibacy is working for the majority of Catholic priests. Clearly we know it isnrsquot.\"Now that we have the gay debacle as well ndash there are a number of gay priests in the priesthood, and that needs to be acknowledged instead of covered up.\"All of this is about keeping the lid on Pandorarsquos box because once you allow priests to marry, then we get into the situation of priestsrsquo marriages breaking down, wanting orce, wanting to remarry. How can you keep the lid on that reality which the church doesnrsquot accept or condone  That is why this control of the celibacy rule for priests is key.\"Mr Walker explained that another reason why many priests may want to keep the fact they have children a secret is because many are ill-equipped to deal with secular le.He said: \"When I left the ministry I had something like pound in my bank account. You are in a situation where you are frozen by fear [at the thought of] leaving to start a new le in the secular world.\"Priests are worried about security. Nine times out of  they wonrsquot have any money behind them unless theyrsquove been left a legacy from their parents, or perhaps parishioners. If they donrsquot have finances behind them then they will be reliant on the diocese renting them a property and perhaps giving them a stipend each month, which wonrsquot be a great deal.\"Depending on their age they have to think about employment, what do they do for a job  How do they earn their keep \"It also means that they lose their status,there is still a status, for being a Roman Catholic priest. That all goes overnight as well and then they have to face up to their responsibilities which they have never really had to experience before.\"They have been completely sheltered in this cocoon - living in the presbytery, having their bills paid for, people treating them with deference. They would risk losing credibility amongst their own colleagues and companions too.\"Therersquos a lot going on there.\"At the end of the day, they still have fathered children and they should be the number one priority. The church should make it the number one priority for the priest also.\"A brief history of celibacy in the Catholic ChurchCatholic priests were not always required to be celibate, with several of the Apostles known to be married according to biblical accounts.The very first Pope, Saint Peter, was married and there are ious accounts of priests and popes throughout the ages discussing the issue of celibacy in letters and correspondence.Clement of Alexandria, a prominent theologian who died in AD, wrote: \"The church fully receives the husband of one we whether he be priest or deacon or layman, supposing always that he uses his marriage blamelessly, and such a one shall be saved in the begetting of children.By AD, the first written requirement was made for those looking to join the priesthood to be celibate, and in  AD, Pope Gregory VII ruled that married priests were not allowed to say mass or carry out s.In , an ecumenical council for the Catholic church made celibacy mandatory for western clergy.In , Pope Francis said he would consider the possibility of allowing married men to join the priesthood, which is set to be discussed further this year."},{"url":null,"title":"spring-comes-early-at-scotlands-most-exotic-garden","story":"Warmed by the Gulf Stream and protected from winterrsquos blast, the exotic plants of Logan Botanic Garden have always defied the harshest Scottish weather to blossom and flourish against the odds.Just  miles south of Stranraer, itrsquos where the tree fernsrsquo dainty fronds dance in the breeze, giant rhubarb leaves bigger than beach umbrellas create a tunnel to walk through and palm trees that could have come straight from a Calornian bouled thrive all year round.They can cope with the sprinkling of morning frost thatrsquos left some plants sparkling under the winter sun, says Loganrsquos curator Richard Baines. Instead, weeks of mild winter weather have taken a toll, creating confusion that has seen some plants burst into le and blossom weeks earlier than normal.ldquoLots of flowers, including some of the gardenrsquos camellia, are in full flower already, he says. ldquoThatrsquos a lot earlier than normal.One iety in particular, Mary Christian, with rich, glossy, dark green foliage and flowers of dazzling bright pink petals that hug a bouquet of delicate yellow stamen, has erupted in colour several weeks earlier than normal.ldquoItrsquos in full flower at the moment and normally that wouldnrsquot happen [for a few weeks yet], adds Baines.An early spring seemed on the cards as far back as mid-December when he spotted the first snowdrops carpeting the gardenrsquos woodland area ndash nearly two weeks earlier than expected.Throughout winter, the temperature at Logan hasnrsquot dipped below -.#c. Apart from a couple of stormy days which claimed a handful of victims, therersquos been little to send Loganrsquos exotic residents into a terribly deep sleep.ldquoI walked the garden over Christmas and counted  dferent plants in flower, Baines says. ldquoThey are definitely ahead of where they should be.ldquoOne member of staff has been here for over  years and remembers lsquoproperrsquo winters, when the whole place used to be cold and covered in frost.ldquoBut now we can grow plants which are fairly tender and can take just a little frost and they are doing fine outside.For gardeners across Scotland keeping watch for the first tentative green sprout of a crocus or bluebell, this subtle sht is not great news.A mild winter and early spring play havoc with the natural cycle of garden insects. Ladybirds may emerge from hibernation early and ready to feast on aphids only to find the cupboard bare, while a sudden cold snap could be disastrous for fragile flora.ldquoThere can be opportunity, adds Baines. ldquoMilder winters mean we can grow a wider range of plants. But the opposite is that in the last two decades you have probably had more pests and disease entering the world of horticulture than in the last two centuries.ldquoSudden oak death is pretty prominent, and one or two pests are much more prevalent because of the mild conditions.Itrsquos a clear sign ndashany were needed ndash of the battle faced by the natural world, one element of which was highlighted earlier this month when scientists warned that a global scientic review of insects had indicated they could become extinct within a century.The study, by University of Sydney, found % of all insect species are in decline. Their loss, it warned, would spark a ldquocatastrophic collapse in the worldrsquos ecosystems.ldquoQuite often therersquos a lot of mention of birds, animals and insects, but no mention of plants, he says, pointing out the risk to plantstherersquos no insects to pollinate. ldquoItrsquos always the cuddly, furry things that get the mention, but therersquos a whole ecosystem out there. When one part of the ecosystem falls down, therersquos a knock-on effect.But eveneverything in the global garden isnrsquot terribly rosy, therersquos much at Logan ndash one of four botanical gardens across Scotland that come under the umbrella of the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh ndash that is, at least, blooming.Last year, more than , visitors made the journey to the Rhins of Galloway on Scotlandrsquos southwestern tip ndash closer, as the crow flies, to the Isle of Man than it is to Glasgow, and further south than Newcastle.There they breathed in the scent from more than  species of New Zealand and Australian eucalyptus at the gardenrsquos Tasmanian Creek, marvelled at -year-old tree ferns that tower four metres tall, and the curious ldquofilo pastry tree, Polylepis australis, which sheds layers of its bark in a bid to capture warm air and protect itself from the cool breezes of its native Andes mountains.In spring and summer, the mountain rhododendrons compete for attention with exotic blooms from the Canary Islands, Australia, South Africa and Chile the  species of palms ndash some over  years old ndash evoke beach le in sunny climes rather than the southwestern tip of Scotland.There are more than  species of wild flora ndash foxgloves, irises and wild grasses ndash carpeting the ground, lilies thrive on the walled gardenrsquos pond and the carbon-neutral Victorian-style greenhouse contains South American gems rarely seen in the UK.Where  could you find a driveway stretching a quarter-of-a-mile thatrsquos lined with  cabbage plants ldquoPeople are blown away by the exoticness of the place, itrsquos like an island with sea on both sides, says Baines, who was so enchanted by Logan as a child that he went on to study horticulture and follow in the footsteps of famous plant explorers like George Forrest, trekking to foreign lands in search of rare specimens.Later this year, Logan will be the focus for a series of celebrations to mark  years since it was handed to the nation.Its roots stretch much further ndash the McDouall family was granted lands in the area by John Balliol in the late th century and built a castle. Destroyed in the th century, a small stump remains within Loganrsquos walled garden.Fascination with exotic plants erupted in the th century, fuelled by explorers who ventured around the world in search of unusual species. The McDouall familyrsquos fascination with what it found and its estatersquos mild climate were a perfect match.Soon the first eucalyptus trees in Scotland were planted in the grounds, and peat bogs dug into terraces to nurture primulas.The estate was gted to the nation in November  and passed to the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh. Now, as well as being the arearsquos prime tourist attraction, itrsquos a base for horticultural study and conservation.New plants are arriving all the time. Later this year, Baines is heading on a plant expedition to Vietnam, in search of new species and to help secure the future of others.ldquoPlants are disappearing very quickly there through the impact of man, he explains.ldquoMany of these plants are very small and very fragile. A good example is a rhododendron called Kanehirae from north Vietnam.\"We did a survey five years ago and found the plant at Logan was the only one left in world.\"We propagated it, and circulated it around other botanic gardens.ldquoItrsquos not possible to undo whatrsquos been done to its native habitat, he adds. ldquoBut we can use our expertise so itrsquos not the end."},{"url":null,"title":"catholic-church-faces-mounting-pressure-to-help-traumatised-scots-children-of-priests","story":"One organisation which is supporting Scots whose fathers are clerics says people are left scared and traumatised by their secretive upbringings, and feel as though the church is trying to pretend they donrsquot exist.Some have even had to sign confidentiality agreements to hide their paternal identities, according to Coping International, which advocates for children of priests.Children have also been sent to Scotland from Ireland and England as a way of keeping them hidden from parish communities which may find out about their parentage.The impact on those involved is severe and detrimental, according to campaigners, who describe their treatment and lack of acknowledgement as ldquoclerical abuse.The Catholic church in Scotland has admitted it has no idea how many Scottish priests, or those working in Scotland, have fathered children.A spokesman has also compared the situation to office workers having extramarital affairs, and said the church as an employer wouldnrsquot necessarily have to get involved.It comes after secret Vatican guidelines emerged this week for priests who father children, but the church has refused to release the documents or explain what advice they contained.Vincent Doyle, founder of support organisation Coping International, has blasted Scottish bishops for failing to get to grips with the scale of the issue, and said more needs to be done to support women and prieststhey find they are expecting a baby.Irish psychotherapist Doyle set up Coping International after he found out a priest he believed was his godfather was actually his biological dad. He said he is currently supporting several Scots between  and  whose fathers are priests, who, he said, have been left scarred by their covert parentage and are afraid to speak out.However, he stressed that the actual number of children, men and women across the globe whose fathers are Scottish priests, or who live in Scotland, is likely to be much higher.Sonflowers, a support group for women who have had relationships with priests, previously reported that it had been inundated with calls from Scottish women claiming they were having relationships with priests and in some cases were pregnant by them.The organisationrsquos founder said in  she had hoped to set up a specically Scottish group to deal with the influx of calls but faced opposition to even advertising her service in churches or bulletins across the country.Doyle said: ldquoWe are supporting eight Scottish people. Eight may seem like a small number to many, but for those eight people their lives have been hugely affected.ldquoThey have been hidden, they have had confidentiality agreements too. They are scared.ldquoWe have one Scottish woman we are working with who was fathered by an Irish priest. They moved to Scotland and hid her there and she has hidden ever since. She doesnrsquot know what to do or how to bring it up.ldquoThese people are terried. One guy I know has psychosis, hersquos on the verge of schizophrenia.ldquoWe have a lot of kids also from Ireland and England sent to Scotland, who were adopted but now through things like ancestry and DNA matching sites they are finding out their roots and what actually happened.ldquoThere are around  priests in Scotland at the minute, but how many men have been ordained in Scotland or how many Scottish men have been missionary priests over the last  years  That is where the real question is.ldquoWhen you take that into consideration,only % of those priests fathered children, yoursquore talking about a surprising number.ldquoOn a global level, we know about , children in this position and that is only the ones we know about, itrsquos a hugely conservative estimate.A Catholic church spokesman told The Herald on Sunday there was no evidence of ldquosignicant numbers of children fathered by priests in Scotland, and compared priests having relationships to an office worker having an extramarital affair with a colleague.He said in both scenarios, vows would have been broken but it would not necessarily be the responsibility of the employer to get involved.When pressed, he admitted the church had no idea of the numbers and he had only heard of one such case before, but insisted that Scottish bishops would support prieststhey came to them to ask for help.The spokesman said: ldquoIn the case of a priest who has fathered a child, it is not possible to rule out any possible responses to these situations.ldquoA decision to remain or leave the priesthood would be made on its merits in each case.ldquoThere are no central records of such cases and while the church would not necessarily be aware of them, there is no suggestion of signicant numbers in this country.He also said there had been several priests who had left the priesthood to pursue relationships, and in his view there was no stigma around the issue.He said: ldquoIf a priest was to say to his bishop that he had fathered a child and, whether he wanted help to leave the priesthood and set up as a father or to remain in the priesthood but be able to support the child, the church would do whatever they could to support either of those options.ldquoEvery year a number [of priests] leave to get married. One left from Glasgow last year, for example. In the past that would have been seen as much more scandalous and a stigma. The view now is that the church is grateful for the service that you have given.Doyle has criticised the remarks and called for the church in Scotland to take the lead in finding and supporting people fathered by priests, and to understand why many priests do not disclose they have children.He said: ldquoI absolutely condemn the use of that world lsquosignicantrsquo in any regard. This is clerical abuse. If there are only five or  children in Scotland, so what  Quantity never should come in to pastoral care.ldquoIn order for this issue to be addressed we have to do away with moralistic audacious statements and look at this practically and also empower the woman. If you empower the mother and say lsquoyou are far from alone, you donrsquot need to be afraidrsquo, it would help, instead of the woman being told they are the only person in Scotland who is in this situation, and they must keep quiet in order for the priest to be able to support them and not lose their job.ldquoI would go back to the Catholic bishops in Scotland and ask them what constitutes a signicant number. We are working with eight people ndash is that insignicant  I donrsquot know the full number of children of priests in Scotland, but neither do the bishops.ldquoThe Catholic church should be willing to bend over backwards for one child so this whole thing of lsquosignicancersquo is hugely disrespectful, harmful and what they are trying to do is make this inauthentic.ldquoThere are children of priests the same as there are children of plumbers, fishermen, hairdressers ... they are out there.ldquoAnd it is never going to stop. Unless they stop ordaining heterosexual males it will happen. They canrsquot quanty it and they canrsquot address it.ldquoThe church have tried to dismiss child sexual abuse initially by saying its unquantiable, itrsquos the same thing.If you have been affected by this story please contact Hannah Rodgerathannah.rodger@heraldandtimes"},{"url":null,"title":"in-pictures-homes-transformed-into-magnificent-galleries-at-window-wanderland","story":"An annual tradition, locals decorated their windows with colourful, ornate designs.One home even renamed itself the Bungo Jukebox, decorating every window with a musical theme.Another featured a controversial message about the recent Glasgow School of Art fire.Hundreds walked the streets and marvelled at the fantastic displays, while others attended film screenings at a pop-up cinema.The Pollywood community cinema showed Rear Window by Alfred Hitchcock along with several other flicks throughout the evening."},{"url":null,"title":"rab-mcneil-concentrate-on-your-allotment-jeremy-theres-plenty-of-horse-manure-in-parliament","story":"All I know is that centre parties are always rubbish and are only supported by ditherers who canrsquot make up their mind between left and right, and who fall for all the tripe about a ldquonew politics espoused by people steeped in the old politics and, more importantly, desperate to keep their seats.No, I am more interested in the much-reported fact that when the splitters were preparing to leave his party, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn went down to his allotment to lt some tatties.

Inverness to WickKnown as the Far North Line for obvious reasons, this four-and-a-half-hour, -mile journey sees the train follow the coast for much of the way. Among the stops is one practically at the gates of the magnicent Dunrobin Castle, completed in the s at the behest of the owner who quite fancied having his own railway line. It required the say-so of Parliament but given that the owner was the Duke of Sutherland, the permissions werenrsquot too hard to get.Other highlights include Skibo Castle, Foulis Castle, the atmospheric peat bogsand the distilleries of Teaninich, Dalmore, Balblair, Whyte  Mackay , Glenmorangie , and, in Wick itself, Pulteney . Inverness to Kyle of LochalshIf yoursquore heading for Skye from the capital of the Highlands, then the so-called Kyle Line is the only way to travel. The line runs along the Beauly Firth, through Dingwall and on past villages such as Achnashellach, Achnasheen, Lochcarron and picturesque Plockton, where much-loved BBC drama Hamish Macbeth was filmed. Naturally there are great views of Skye itself at the end of the line but along the way yoursquoll also see the Torridon Peaks, Ben Wyvis, Loch Luichart and Loch Carron as well as some rugged Highland scenery. Aviemore to BroomhillThe route isnrsquot so much the treat here as the train itself because itrsquos on these  miles of restored track from the original Highland Railway Line that the Strathspey Steam Railway has run since it was brought back to le by a group of enthusiasts in . It runs between Aviemore stationrsquos  three and Broomhillrsquos Glenbogle station via Boat of Garten and when yoursquore not looking out of the window at the sceneryyoursquoll be looking around the old-style carriages or even down at your plate ndash the service offers all manner of dining experiences, from light lunches and afternoon teas to formal evening meals. Dufftown to KeithThis -mile line links the Moray towns of Keith and Dufftown, the self-styled ldquoWhisky Capital of the World . Predictably the line itself, once part of the Aberdeen to Elgin line, is known now as the Whisky Line and also bills itself the UKrsquos most northerly ldquoheritage railway. The rolling stock includes old commuter carriages from the s and s, and a dining coach which used to be part of the British Rail InterCity stock, but which has been repainted and renamed Spirit Of Dufftown. The line is closed for the winter and reopens on April . Borsquoness to Manuel JunctionOne of Scotlandrsquos most popular heritage railways, the Borsquoness and Kinneil Railway runs five miles between Borsquoness near Falkirk and Manuel Junction, via Kinneil and Birkhill. The views are pretty enough but again itrsquos the rolling stock which is the star.Among the favourites are  Neilson Reid locomotive Lord Roberts, which has been painted Thomas The Tank Engine blue, a set of s coaches in whatrsquos known as a ldquoblood and custard livery, and a pair of Caledonian coaches built in . Borsquoness is also home to the Museum of Scottish Railways, which houses historic locomotives, carriages, cranes, wagonsas well as shunting units, motorised trolleys and all manner of objects and archive stuff. Edinburgh to TweedbankThe Borders line, closed in  as part of the infamous Beeching cuts, reopened with no little fanfare in September  and reconnected the capital with the Borders towns of Galashiels and Melroseas well as Midlothian towns such as Dalkeith, Newtongrange and Gorebridge. The scenery is pleasant enough ndash go to the Highlandsyou want mountains and lochs ndash but the appeal of the Borders Railway, as itrsquos now known, lies in its ality and its historical importance: its rebirth brought a new dynamism and opportunity to a part of the country too often overlooked, and signicant numbers of tourists as well. Book lovers in particular have good reason to take the trip. Where  can you take a train which starts from a station named after a famous novel ndash Waverley, by Sir Walter Scott ndash and terminates close to the authorrsquos home, in this case Abbotsford, near Melrose  Milton of Crathes to Birkenbaud CrossingItrsquos only a mile of track along the now-disused Ballater to Aberdeen line, but as the name suggests the Royal Deeside Railway is steeped in history, thanks to the fact that for over a century, until its closure in , it was used by the royal family travelling to Ballater and from there to nearby Balmoral Castle. It was even used by ill-fated Russian tsar Nicholas II when he visited in .The original Crathes Castle station was built initially for the private use of the Laird of Crathes, and only later was the public allowed to use it. The Milton of Crathes station features a Victorian building but it came originally from Oldmeldrum and was sold to the Royal Deeside Railway for pound then transported to its new home in carefully labelled sections.The line has both steam- and diesel-hauled trains and among the former is the Thomas The Tank Engine-style Salmon. A sombre coda: the engine was named in commemoration of HMS Salmon, a submarine lost with all hands in . The line is closed for the winter and will reopen at Easter.How the Borders Railway creates a new future for Scotlands \"forgotten\" regionTravel: the West Highland Line"},{"url":null,"title":"scotlands-money-are-we-spending-it-properly","story":"Itrsquos two days before the Budget and Derek Mackay, Scotlandrsquos Finance Secretary, is sitting in his spartan ministerial office robustly defending his spending plans ndash while dealing with a nasty cold.Hersquos a man facing an almost impossible array of demands. Some of the brightest minds, and biggest voices, are calling for him to pull to the left, pull to the right, protect the poor, and boost business ndash all at the same time. Mackay ndash self-contained, confident and smartly dressed ndash may see himself as a steady pair of hands, but hersquod need the skill of a juggler to make everyone happy.At its heart, the Budget is redistributive ndash taking from the rich to provide services for the poor by widening the gap between how much higher earners pay in income tax in Scotland compared with the rest of the UK. Mackay has frozen the higher rate threshold at pound, in Scotland, while it will go up to pound, in the rest of the UK. However, everyone earning under pound, ndash % of taxpayers ndash will end up paying less income tax than in the rest of the UK.The spending plans also provide extra money for education , health , and infrastructure , and give new powers to councils to introduce a workplace car parking tax and a tourist tax. Local authorities get an extra poundm and can also increase council tax by up to .% rather than %.But what do the people who spend their lives studying the Scottish economy make of the Budget  Does the way Scotland spends its money work  Where could money be spent better  And what ideas might change the game when it comes to Scotland and out public services Some of the leading lights in Scottish public le give their views.PROFESSOR RONALD MACDONALDECONOMIST WITH THE ADAM SMITH BUSINESS SCHOOL AT GLASGOW UNIVERSITYRonnie MacDonald is happy to pay more tax, but he isnrsquot so happy with the Scottish Governmentrsquos approach to balancing the books. ldquoThe focus seems to be too much on spending ndash there isnrsquot so much emphasis on growing the economy, he says.About half the revenue raised comes from taxes, he says, and our ldquoeconomy is very skewed towards oil ndash a commodity in price decline. ldquoItrsquos a dangerous strategy for the long-term sustainability of public spending, MacDonald says.With limited borrowing powers, the Government has a choice between \"growing the economy or spending less\". The Government is following a Nordic-style model of public spending, he says.However, ldquothese Nordic countries grew their economies before making spending changes, we seem to be doing it the other way around.ldquoI think wersquoll ultimately have to cut spending, he adds. ldquoYou either prioritise and have a leaner mix now, or yoursquore forced to do it in the future ndash you could face much worse cuts in the future.Higher taxes in Scotland ldquomay well put off foreign firms thinking of investing in Scotland, he says. ldquoIf Irsquom a US-based company thinking of Scotland or the north of England, Irsquom going to go where the tax regime is more favourable to my employees. All in all itrsquos quite a dangerous game theyrsquore playing.Macdonald suggests a ldquorealignment from spending ldquotowards lowering business rates to encourage growth.A more erse economy would grow more quickly, says MacDonald, and provide the money needed for the ldquopublic provision the SNP wants to offer. Manufacturing around le sciences and new technology is one way forward.MacDonald suggests Scotland should follow the path of Australia ndash currently blazing a trail with the solar production of renewable hydrogen as a green energy source. Renewable hydrogen, says MacDonald, can be stored and shipped in liquid form. Given Scotlandrsquos wind and waves, wersquod be in a perfect position to exploit the new technology in the era of climate change.ldquoIt could be revolutionary, MacDonald says. ldquoIt could be as important as the discovery of oil ... it could lead to the reindustrialisation of Scotland.If the Government used public money to invest in the new technology ldquoit could create a sovereign wealth fund as the Norwegians did to use oil to pay for services.DAVE MOXHAMSTUC DEPUTY GENERAL SECRETARYldquoThe Budget is incredibly timid, says Moxham. ldquoWith the current ambition of a little bit more tax on middle- to higher-income earners, itrsquos quite impossible to fund the public services we need without the recognition that people on median and above incomes are going to have to pay more in taxation.\"We canrsquot pretend therersquos any mechanism for funding public services which doesnrsquot have that sort of ambition.ldquoItrsquos not enough to constantly use a Conservative Government as a comparator and say wersquore being slightly more progressive. Any party which aspires to say Scotland would be dferent under independence needs to be showing more now about what their commitment is to social justice.The STUC, says Moxham, would be ldquocomfortable with everyone above median income ndash about pound, ndash paying an extra penny in tax. ldquoThatrsquos small change. Itrsquos hardly bank-breaking, he adds.Spending needs to get smarter and more local too, Moxham says. Councils and council staff need more say in spending ndash as they understand the problems. ldquoTherersquos too much centralisation and not enough devolution to local authorities, he adds.He cites hospitals improving heart failure response times because ldquothe porters helped design the system of getting someone from the front steps to the operating theatre.ldquoWersquove had lots of reorganisation of the delivery of public services but these have tended to be executive-led, he says. Whatrsquos needed is getting the people who deliver the services ndash carers, nurses, teachers ndash to help design services. ldquoThe person who best knows how to organise a home care service is probably the home carer on the ground.The big idea that the STUC is investigating is a ldquouniversal basic infrastructure ndash where everyone has the guaranteed right to decent transport, housing, clinics and schools. Public spending priorities would be re-engineered around making sure every citizen had the basic infrastructure for a decent le.Small business bonus schemes are in the STUCrsquos sights. ldquoWe need a completely new approach to business tax giveaways, says Moxham. Investing in specic high-street regeneration schemes ldquois a far better way to rebuild our local high streets than the current approach where someone may need the boost, but others are using it to fund a second car.TRACY BLACKDIRECTOR OF CBI SCOTLANDIF the Government stimulates the white heat of technology it can fill its coffers with tax pounds and use the money to spend on the public services it wants ndash thatrsquos essentially Blackrsquos view.A no-deal Brexit could cost Scotland poundbn a year by , she says, and our demographics are going against us with a rapidly ageing population, so we need to start spending as smartly as we can. AI and automation could reduce costs. The elderly donrsquot have to travel to hospital when their blood pressure could be checked by remote monitoring. Investment in smart-ticketing and autonomous vehicles could help the high street.Glasgow may be a G hub, but connectivity needs improved across the country, as does infrastructure, Black says, so ldquowe get goods and people moving around more effectively.One big idea that Black is promoting is using national data to change how we spend public money. Data on the economy and population could be used by business ldquoto come up with really creative solutions around transport and health.The Scottish Government has done well so far supporting science and technology in business. Black says our pharma manufacturing sector is one of the most advanced in the world ndash itrsquos now the second-biggest spender on research and development, exports poundm in products, and has seen jobs rise by .%. The Medicines Manufacturing Innovation Centre in Renfrewshire was l funded by the Government and industry.Itrsquos this close working relationship between Government and industry that Black wants more of ndash but she feels there are ldquomixed messages when it comes to income tax, parking levies and the tourist tax. ldquoNone of these on their own are particularly crippling, but you put the whole package together and what sort of signal does that put out to inward investors PROFESSOR GRAEME ROYDIRECTOR OF THE FRASER OF ALLANDER INSTITUTE\"THE debate around public spending collapses down into short-term political sound bites rather than more intelligent conversations,\" says Roy. \"We see that every week at First Ministerrsquos Questions and in every manesto that every party produces.\"Parties obsess on issues like \", more nurses or , extra police officers\" when they should be looking at outcomes ndash like extending le expectancy or making streets safer. It may be that spending more money on housing rather than nurses will improve le expectancy. Preventative measures ndash that improve health or cut crime ndash will save money in the long run.\"Simple metrics donrsquot do anything for the long-term delivery of better value for public services,\" Roy says. \"Therersquos a fixation on targets and numbers when the evidence is that you should be bolder.\"He adds: \"If wersquore thinking about long-term sustainability of public services what we need to do is reduce demand, not just keep increasing supply.\"Such a quantum sht in how we look at public spending would require political courage. Politicians are locked in short election cycles, while long-term preventative policies might take decades to show fruit, Roy says. Closing a hospital because it makes more sense to spend the money on nutrition for the young could lose a government an election, even though  years from now it might have improved health.\"Some of the delivery of public services is simply not going to be sustainable in the long run,\" Roy says. \"Wersquove played with numbers where we think that on current projections NHS spending will within the next two or three years be pretty much % of the Scottish Budget. This will mean every other area in the public sector has to be squeezed ndash thatrsquos the sort of thing which I think will start to force more radical thoughts on how we deliver public services.\"JOHN DICKIEDIRECTOR, CHILD POVERTY ACTION GROUPDickie is clear that Scotlandrsquos public spending does not match the ambition of the Government when it comes to tackling child poverty. Targets have been set that less than % of children should be living in poverty by .With currently one in four Scots children in poverty ndash thatrsquos about , ndash to reach that target, says Dickie, \"we need a substantial rethink of how we raise revenue and allocate resources to make sure those families on the lowest incomes can give children a decent start in le\". Estimates show that one in three children could be in poverty within a few years.Dickie wants an \"income supplement\" to lt family finances to levels above the poverty line. The government is committed to introducing an income supplement by  ndash however, it hasnrsquot said how that will be delivered or how much it will be.The supplement needs brought in now, Dickie says. \"Families canrsquot wait until .\" He applauds policies like best start grants for families, and improvements in school clothing grants but says \"none of this is on the scale to have the kind of substantive long-term impact to really change the trajectory of child poverty\".Dickie would also like to see the Scottish Government act to top up child benefit by around pound, following cuts by the UK Government.Not tackling child poverty is a drain on the economy ndash with children more likely to get involved in crime, have poor health, and fewer job prospects. \"The government needs to act with urgency,\" Dickie says. It needs to \"recognise the value of the next generation\" and invest.DEREK MITCHELLCHIEF EXECUTIVE, CITIZENS ADVICE SCOTLANDWHEN there are families going to foodbanks and receiving \"cold bags\" of shopping because their gas and electricity has been cut off ndash when % of people in \"food poverty\" are working ndash then for Mitchell \"that doesnrsquot paint a picture of a society where everything is wonderful and great\".\"The simple matter is,\" he says, \"that things are very dficult for lots of people and that doesnrsquot show any sign of abating.\"Public resources need to go to those most in need, Mitchell says. \"Poor people donrsquot have a voice. Wersquove a debate at a political level. We talk about interest rates and mortgage rates, we donrsquot talk about household debt.\"Put simply: wersquore looking at things through the wrong end of the telescope. Get tougher with payday loan companies, force employers to pay decent wages, increase the funeral expense allowance, prioritise affordable rent ndash these are the levers of Government Mitchell wants to see pulled.DEREK MACKAYSCOTTISH FINANCE SECRETARYMACKAYrsquoS childhood shaped his politics. This is a man who didnrsquot grow up easy ndash raised in a council house, he even spent time in a homeless unit after a family break-up. He puts his le lessons into his policies ndash beliefs like ldquothe importance of community, kindness, treating others as you would be treated yourself.ldquoIrsquom very aware of chaotic lestyles, lack of opportunities, intergenerational poverty, he says. Mackay says he struck it lucky by entering politics and getting elected. It changed the direction of his le.Hersquos got a slick command of his portfolio and can rattle off statistics at a dizzying rate ndash but his Budget is assailed from all sides: itrsquos either a hit on the middle classes or it isnrsquot doing enough for the poor.Criticism doesnrsquot faze Mackay though ndash only once does he falter, and even then momentarily, when asked why the SNP needed the Greens to push them in a more progressive direction over policies like the parking levy.In his eyes, the Budget is about stability in the face of ldquocalamity at Westminster sustainability of public services, and stimulus for the economy.Mackay says preventative measures are built in when it comes to public health and early years ndash and the economy of the future is being looked after in terms of innovation on data and infrastructure. Direct investment in Scotland is second only to London, and research and development is at record levels. He makes much of new figures showing unemployment is at an all-time low.However, therersquos only so much the Government can do given the limited range of powers granted to a devolved administration, he says. ldquoWe can grow the economy as an independent countrywe have control of levers like immigration policy, and over a wider basket of taxation powers.Mackay described his current Budget as ldquofair and progressive in that it takes ldquoa bit more from the highest earning section of society. In the next financial year, he says, ldquo% of taxpayers will pay less tax, not more, on their current incomes, and itrsquos only those on or above pound, who will pay more.Itrsquos a ldquobalanced and moderate approach, he thinks. ldquoWersquore building a social security system with a dferent philosophy around dignity and respect, he said, while claiming the UK Government was in a ldquorace to the bottom on tax.While Mackay attempts to create a more progressive Budget, he insists hersquos also trying to remain pro-business as he believes ldquothe best social policy is employment. He dismissed claims of ldquoclass war in his Budget.ldquoIf we donrsquot invest in society and have the necessary safeguards for all then everyone pays for societal failure ndash business and taxpayers pay for this with prisons and unemployment, he says, adding that he believes his Budget presents a ldquopretty good deal.Reformation of council tax is likely to dominate the political discussion soon with plans for cross-party talks to find an alternative. ldquoIf we can find the consensus that could adequately and safety replace it then wersquoll support that, Mackay says. Legislation could be prepared in this Parliament for implementation in the next.Come the end of this Parliament, the country will also be heading towards the time for a review of the ldquofiscal framework set out by the Smith Commission and Scotland Act, which will mean the Government can ask for more powers from Westminster.Mackay admits such an ask wonrsquot be easy as ldquoWestminster concedes nothing without challenge and pressure."},{"url":null,"title":"david-pratt-just-what-is-going-on-in-haiti","story":"THERE is nothing like a coup drsquoetat to bring out the headcase and the hedonist in people.When I first visited Haiti back in , aside from the countryrsquos legions of poor, it seemed almost entirely inhabited by these two species of inidual.The capital Port-au-Prince was in meltdown back then, the cityrsquos ramshackle streets a labyrinth of barricades and blazing tyres, looters, shooters and partygoers.President Jean-Bertrand Aristide was in the process of being deposed from power. In the space of a few weeks, I would watch those same \"bouleds\" once consumed by violence and littered with corpses turn into one giant carnival as thousands crammed to dance the night away to Haitian and Caribbean music.Everywhere around the national palace that had been Aristidersquos lair of power, giant floats drted by while women in flamingo pink dresses, and voodoo priests, partied against the pure white backdrop of the whitewashed palace facade that dazzled in the nighttime dark like an edice of snow.There are few countries in the world that Irsquove been to quite like Haiti. Even fewer that have seen so much turmoil and destruction. It really does beggar belief that such a place exists an hour-and-a-halfrsquos flight from glittering Miami, and less than three hours from New York City. As the books and experts will attest to, Haiti is the poorest country in the Western hemisphere and the worldrsquos least developed outside of Africa ndash and believe me does it show.At night in the cityrsquos Marche en Fer or Iron Market district, crushing poverty forces sex workers, some little more than children, onto the filthy fire-lit streets.This is a two-tier nation that rises from the slums of Cite Soleil and Saint Martin, where hundreds of thousands cram into reclaimed swampland and cemeteries.So congested is it here that people I met said that ldquosht sleeping is common.With many single cupboard-sized rooms too small to house an entire family at any one time, people have been known to bed down on a rota basis, four hours inside and four hours in the alleyways outside.It might be a short distance as the crow flies in Port-au-Prince, but these teeming, humid slums are a world apart from the cool hills above where the wealthy live in the gated communities of Petionville, with their fine restaurants catering to a very dferent side of Haitian le.Right there in that very juxtaposition Haitirsquos inequality lies encapsulated. A chasm between haves and have-nots that for decades has led to political instability and violence which these past weeks has once again reared up and gripped the country.ldquoAfter each election, we are deeper and deeper in a crisis. People are living day-by-day ... If you donrsquot resolve the situation, yoursquoll have another uprising, warned Jean Clarens Renois, a former journalist and presidential candidate last week as street protests in the country intensied.For the last two weeks now, almost unnoticed by the international media, thousands of Haitians have taken to the streets, asking for US-backed president Jovenel Moise and his government to resign. Writing in the New York Times a few months ago, Jake Johnston, an international associate at the Centre for Economic and Policy Research in Washington and an expert on Haiti, told the story of what sparked the current round of unrest.ldquoIt started with a few keystrokes in a living room in Montreal, he wrote.ldquoGilbert Mirambeau Jr, a Haitian filmmaker and writer, took to Twitter on August  to post a photo of himself, blindfolded, holding a piece of cardboard with a simple question written on it in Haitirsquos Creole: ldquoKot Kob Petwo Karibe a    ndash Where is the Petrocaribe money   As Johnston went on to explain in the article, just a few days after Mirambeaursquos tweet, an informal group of young Haitians organised on social media using the hashtag #PetroCaribeChallenge and since then Haitians from all sectors of society have taken to the streets demanding an answer to Mirambeaursquos original question about what became of the Petrocaribe cash.This vast sum of over  billion is part of low-interest loans provided by Petrocaribe, a Venezuela-led oil-purchasing alliance of Caribbean states that since  was aimed at helping Haitirsquos ailing economy. The funds became crucial emergency money to the country following the devastating earthquake of  that laid waste to swathes of Port-au-Prince and beyond.Since then, the missing cash and whole Petrocaribe affair has become a political cause celebre in a country where ordinary people have seen a % hike in fuel prices and double-digit inflation that has made day-to-day survival extremely challenging for more than % of the population.For decades, ordinary Haitians have felt themselves powerless when confronted with this ongoing legacy of corruption and misgovernment. Presented with few alternative options, iniably they take to the streets as a last resort when trying to change things for the better.With so many locked in the grip of protracted poverty their frustration with the countryrsquos level of corruption is understandable. To take but one example following the  earthquake, it became clear that despite foreign donors pledging more than  billion in aid, less than % of that emergency aid spent in their names went directly to Haitians.I well recall in the wake of the earthquake talking to ordinary Haitians who had lost almost everything. One was a woman called Gladys Pierre, a mother who described that day back in  when just before five orsquoclock the mirrors fell from the walls in her family home and the furniture rose up and flew through the air asthrown by a giant malevolent poltergeist.ldquoA big beam slid, and from the chest up Rachelle was crushed against the wall like a mosquito, and I knew my little girl had died, Gladys told me, her voice trailing off.Unimaginable as the horror of her story was, it didnrsquot stop there. Steeling herself, she continued to tell of how her daughterrsquos semi-crushed skull became a grotesque prop for part of the apartment block wall that remained standing.In the following months, so dangerous were those ruins teetering on their macabre headstone that no-one dared enter to remove Rachellersquos corpse.Like many ordinary Haitians who found themselves now living in one of the tarpaulin cities that became semi-permanent fixtures in Port-au-Prince, Gladys and her husband Joel held out little hope of those in power doing much to improve their lives.ldquoYou only see them in their beautul cars and big jeeps driving up and down but they never stop, never get out of the car, talk to us or even congratulate the women and children on their courage, I recall Joel telling me at the time.And so, in the eyes of many Haitians, this sense of helplessness and frustration remains the way they see their lives and once again anger has boiled over in the country.While president Moise has pledged a crackdown on corruption few see little signs of it. Those who have taken to the streets as part of the protest movement in recent weeks have no clear political leader, but Haiti has a huge diaspora that has harnessed social media in its non-violent #PetroCaribeChallenge, campaigning among a population more than half of whom are under  years old.As ever, though, tensions have risen as government repression against the campaigners has become more unrestrained and brutal. Even in the early stages the signs of this were all too clear when last November armed gangs close to the ruling party, together with corrupt police officers, massacred at least  people just days before protests were due to begin.All this time, US influence ndash official or unofficial ndash has never been far from the surface in Haiti. In the latest case of murky US interference, five heavily-armed Americans were arrested in Port-au-Prince last week along with a Haitian man and two Serbians.The Americans are former Navy Seal officers Christopher Michael Osman and Christopher Mark McKinley, and Marine veteran Kent Leland Kroeker, as well as Talon Ray Burton and Dustin Porte. Burton is a private investigator once employed by the controversial private security company formerly known as Blackwater and the State Departmentrsquos diplomatic security service. Inside their vehicles the Haitian police found six automatic rles, six pistols, two professional drones and three satellite phones, and they were also carrying sets of licence plates.ldquoThey said that they were here on a lsquogovernment mission,rsquo ldquo Miami Herald reporter Jacqueline Charles told US National Public Radio. ldquoThey did not specy which government, but then they did tell the police that ... their boss was going to call their boss.Whether they were mercenaries, ldquogovernment contractors of something , the arrest of the Americans while failing to make global headlines triggered wide speculation about why they were in Haiti, particularly among Moisersquos political foes.The possible explanations range from a desire to protect the central bank or foreign assets to potential attacks on anti-government demonstrators and leaders. According to the Haitian police, the men claimed they were on a ldquogovernment mission when they were pulled over about a block away from the nationrsquos central bank.The US government only subsequently intervened after Haitian prime minister Jean Henry Ceant, speaking on CNN, called the group ldquomercenaries and ldquoterrorists. That they were released from prison and immediately flown back to Miami where they faced no charges has only further fuelled the rumour mill and caused political uproar in Haiti.Pierre Esperance, executive director of the National Human Rights Defence Network in Haiti, blasted the decision by US authorities not to charge the men.ldquoWhat the Haitian government did is grave. It shows that they had something they were looking for. The fact that the US took these people and did not charge them, it shows there was a conspiracy. They didnrsquot want them to go before Haitian justice, he told the Miami Herald.On Friday, the protests on the streets of Port-au-Prince showed no signs of abating. ldquoToday we lock down the country again, opposition leader Schiller Louidor told people who gathered for a funeral of two protesters killed earlier in the week, before they marched on the national palace carrying one of the coffins. ldquoWe are asking for justice. We are going to continue to protest. Jovenel Moise can kill as many people as he wants, he still has to go, said Josef Dicles, a cousin of one of the dead men, Onique Gedeus.And so Haiti is mired in turmoil again and just what the future holds is anybodyrsquos guess. But the mysterious presence of armed Americans and the cancellation of this monthrsquos scheduled carnival in Port-au-Prince certainly bodes ill for this long-suffering nation born out of slavery and still consigned to poverty."},{"url":null,"title":"chuka-umunna-urges-voters-to-join-movement-for-different-kind-of-politics","story":"In a sign that The Independent Groupwill form a fully-fledged parliamentary party, the former Labour MP called for the public to ldquojoin us, and help us forge a new, dferent kind of politics for Britainrsquos future.Our political system is clearly completely broken.

The new software — which can be used on desktops and mobile browsers — allows website visitors to customise what they see and hear, from changing the contrast settings, language, font size and more.In the UK, there are estimated to be . million people with a learning disability and . million people who have English as a second language. ‘Recite Me’ has the ability to translate the NorthLink Ferries website into more than  languages — including Scots Gaelic . It can also translate text-to-speech to help visually impaired users and focus screen areas for those with dyslexia.On Monday, February , teams on board MV Hamnavoe hosted an Access Panel Orkney session, where staff were provided with disability awareness training. During the two-hour session, staff were able to experience what it’s like to have a disability by wearing glasses that simulated blindness, used wheelchairs and crutches and had their hearing dampened.Carolyn Grfiths of Access Panel Orkney said: “The aim of our session was to let staff experience disabilities first-hand so they can empathise with passengers’ needs.#All of us running the training have a disability so we were able to provide first-hand examples of what accessible travel is like for us. We were delighted to be welcomed on board to provide this training and it’s great to see a company like Serco NorthLink Ferries take accessibility for passengers seriously.”The MV Hjaltland will also host a Making Connections workshop today, Friday, February . The workshop will look at how passengers navigate potential barriers when changing from one mode of transport to another. Making Connections brings disabled people together with transport operators to discuss, address and plan how travel connections can be made easier.Seumas Campbell, customer service director at NorthLink Ferries, said: “Catering for passengers with ying degrees of disability is an important part of our service provision. Whether they are using our website to book their journey, making a connection from other forms of public transport or coming on board one of our vessels, we believe that passengers should experience a service that caters to all their needs.“The new website software will allow visitors to customise what they see and hear and as more and more visitors from around the world choose NorthLink Ferries to travel to the Northern Isles, ‘Recite Me’ is a great tool to help them plan and book their journey.“Our workshops are also a great way in training our staff on how they can best help and understand passengers’ needs. We pride ourselves on having a great team that always provides the best service so it’s important that we’re constantly refreshing their training.”For more information on accessibility for passengers on NorthLink Ferries, you can visit www.northlinkferries copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

This was despite the fact that the name and address of the person they needed to contact — his mother Edna — was engraved on the memorial.#Vandals couldn#t have done a better job,# he said.Following this wave of public concern, OIC convener Harvey Johnston and chief executive Alistair Buchan have now released a statement apologising for the concern and upset that this project has caused.#Following a tragic accident involving a young child at a Glasgow cemetery, the Scottish Government asked councils to carry out detailed inspections in the interests of public safety,# they said.#We therefore engaged in the kirkyard safety programme for all the right reasons, but recognise that the process we have followed needs to be improved. It was never envisaged that the resulting work would leave kirkyards in the condition they are in. We are sorry about the concern and upset this has led to.#As a caring organisation, responsive to public concern, we will restore kirkyards to the condition people would expect. We will also consider how best to contact and discuss the remedial work required with those concerned. People’s safety is an important concern for us and we will continue to carry out headstone inspections. As at Warebeth , we will use blue pegs to mark stones identied as being unsafe and highlight these to local community representatives.#These stones will not be touched until we publicise the inspection results and give relatives the time they need to discuss with us any work they might wish to carry out themselves.#The statement also confirmed that further updates from the council will be provided further updates over the weeks ahead.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Known today as Rae Strait, it was the missing link in what would become the first navigable Northwest Passage.He also reported back on the ill-fated Franklin expedition, reported evidence of cannibalism — findings which were effectively rejected by the then establishment, and which led to Rae#s achievements being almost completely ignored.The modern-day team, who hope to raise further awareness of these achievements, will be led by Scottish-born and Canada-based expedition leader David Reid, with Scotland also represented by Broxburn-based former Royal Marine Richard Smith.The team will also include two Canadians — adventure film-maker Gerry Tutte and adventurer Frank Wolf.Over  years later and supported with modern-day kit from outdoor specialists Tiso, the explorers are hard at work preparing for the physical and mental challenge of hauling kg sledges for nine hours daily and for up to  consecutive days.Their route will cover undulating, windswept tundra, river valleys and sea ice during what can be the coldest time of year.The Arctic expedition will finish once the four explorers have finally reached Gjoa Haven on King William Island.Mr Smith said: #The Arctic Return expedition will be extremely tough but ultimately our aim is to raise awareness fo the exploits of John Rae and to help restore his rightful place as one of the greatest Scottish explorers in history. It is also our hope that this awareness will inspire the public to support fundraising efforts by the John Rae Society, to restore Rae#s birthplace at the Hall of Clestrain in Oprhir.The team have said any addition funds raised are to be used to produce a documentary film and book about the le and exploits of Rae, the expedition and the history communities, culture and wildle of the Arctic.The public will be able to track the team#s progress at their official website and through social media.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Mr McArthur believes this reflects a change in approach by the government, after months of campaigning by the Orkney MSP and a range of organisations involved in tackling fuel poverty across the Highlands and Islands.During his remarks, Mr McArthur pointed out that when it comes to fuel poverty, rural and island areas are disproportionately affected, with Orkney having the highest proportion of households in fuel poverty and extreme fuel poverty anywhere in Scotland.Commenting after the debate, Mr McArthur said: “Fuel poverty blights communities across Scotland, but there is no doubt that it has a disproportionate impact on rural and island areas. Until recently, however, the Scottish Government appeared unwilling to recognise this fact or indeed the higher costs faced by those living in our rural and island communities.“Over recent months, working with a range of organisations with a wealth of experience and expertise in tackling fuel poverty, I have made the case for the Minister, Kevin Stewart to think again.  It was a case that the Local Government Committee was also persuaded to support.“I am delighted, therefore, that the Minister has had a change of heart and committed to bring forward amendments to his bill at stage two that better reflect the specic nature of fuel poverty in places like Orkney.  I look forward to seeing the detail of those amendments and will work with Mr Stewart, and local stakeholders in Orkney, to make sure we get this right.“Given the impact fuel poverty can have, not just on people’s quality of le but their physical and mental health, this bill has the potential to make a real dference.  For that to happen, it must be both effective and ambitious in eradicating fuel poverty from communities across the country.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

We will be looking to strengthen the Bill as it progresses through the Scottish Parliament and ensuring that the Scottish Governmentrsquos pledges are met.\"Before Wednesdayrsquos debate Mr Stewart said: ldquoWithin this ground-breaking legislation, not only are we one of the few countries in the world to define fuel poverty, we are also setting a goal towards eradicating it.ldquoBy changing the definition of fuel poverty so itrsquos more closely aligned to relative income poverty and taking steps to ensure it works for remote rural and island communities, we are ensuring our support is focussed on those who need it most.\"He added: \"In this day and age, it is unacceptable that any Scottish household should have to choose between having the heating on and cooking their dinner.Councillor Ian Cockburn, who represents the Wester Ross, Strathpeffer and Lochalsh welcomed the Bill as \"something has to be done about fuel poverty\" while arguing it is also time to rethink infrastructure like the national grid.\"It is ambitious but has to be tried to get fuel poverty down in rural areas. We are one of the most energy rich countries in the world so we should be able to get something done. Too many people take it as just being part of the landscape up here so we need to change that thinking as well to get people the assistance that they need.\"Scotland should not be in this state. But you have to look back, the National Grid was set up at the end of the war, the Highlands is considered off-grid despite supplying much of the rest of the country through hydro and wind power. It is time for a rethink.\"Calum Macaulay, chief executive of Invergordon-based Albyn Housing Society, said: ldquoWe welcome this development in the Scottish Governmentrsquos approach to addressing fuel poverty in rural areas. The push to include minimum income standards feels like a signicant step forwards. This is something that the Rural and Islands Housing Association Forum has been promoting for quite some time.\"This has included research undertaken with the support of Highlands and Islands Enterprise and others into minimum income standards in rural communities. The results of this highlighted the pressures of lower average household incomes and higher average fuel costs across the northern parts of Scotland.\"What do you think  Share your views by emailing newsdesk@spp-groupMonday  Feb  : AMBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

If the facility is not taken on by the community then it will close on March as per report to the Highland Council [on] October .ldquoNo survey will be undertaken, the facility will transfer in lsquoas seen, as isrsquo condition, the facilities will transfer in their current operational condition. The position of toilets remaining open whilst negotiations are ongoing is for this financial year only. There is no budget to retain facilities... which is why we want to get the leases sorted out before the end of March.Despite that the director of the Groam House Museum Doug Maclean, who recently attended a meeting of the community council where the future of the toilets was on the agenda remains hopeful.ldquoWe are confident that by some means or other, through a charitable trust taking over the running of the toilets and the good services of the local people, we will be able to keep the toilets open, he said.However, Mr Maclean was in no doubt about how serious an effect the closure would have on Rosemarkie as well as Groam House Museum.ldquoFrom the museumrsquos point of view it is absolutely vital for our existence. We have groups of school children that come here and of course children need to go to the toilet, he said.ldquoWe also have groups of mainly elderly American tourists and they are not in a position to make their way to the beach cafeacute. And we would lose both those groups without the toilets which put the museum in jeopardy.Black Isle ward councillor Gordon Adam said: ldquoI am in discussions with the council over the time limit of March , my view is that the council needs to be flexible. Savings have to be made, but sticking rigidly to a timetable leaves little time to form development groups.Monday  Feb  : AMBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

There are many reasons why this course of action is necessary, the main one being the struggle to secure sufficient finances to run the organisation.About pound, to pound, is needed annually but Ms Cochrane said that the NHS is doing a review of third sector input, and can only confirm funding up to June.Without the support of the NHS, they will find it dficult to win the support of other funding bodies.The news will be a blow to the  service users currently on the books of ACSRS many of whom faced a personal battle before seeking help and then keeping on attending to receive the support on offer.However Ms Cochrane said they will do everything in their power to ensure their clients receive alternative assistance with their dependency. Around  people with alcohol dependency are referred to them each year.She said: ldquoThe board is actively pursuing alternative arrangements for our service users and volunteer counsellors who wish to continue their support or volunteering.ldquoACSRS has been indebted to many people over the years who have given their time and expertise freely as volunteers. Some have assisted in the management of the service as board members providing governance and support for staff and volunteers.ldquoOthers have given thousands of hours of their free time as trained volunteer counsellors. There are six counsellors and not all of them will be wanting to move on though some might seek paid employment.ldquoThe training for these counsellors was previously provided free. It now requires a source of additional funding.ldquoAs for other voluntary organisations, the burden of bureaucracy has increased without the corresponding increase in income, and the task of securing additional funding has become more challenging.ldquoACSRS is the only voluntary organisation within Ross-shire and Sutherland offering a free professional one-to-one counselling service for those affected by their own or a loved onersquos addiction. Our work complements the work done by NHS Drug and Alcohol Recovery staff.ldquoWe would like to thank all those people for their extremely valuable contributions which made it possible for us to serve our community for over  years.Councillor Margaret Paterson, Dingwall and Seaforth, said: ldquoI know this group and this will be a dreadful loss as they give a tremendous service. It is quite distressing to hear this because they have given people with addiction and their families such help for so many years. Their volunteers have given such time and talent to help the vulnerable in society, butthey donrsquot have money then they just canrsquot do it. I hope that something can be done to continue their good work.Two service users who wished to remain anonymous praised ACSRS for the help they received. One said: ldquoI can honestly say that ACSRS played a major part in my recovery. If that help was not there when I needed it, the outcome could have been very dferent.The other said: ldquoHearing a voice that was willing to listen to me was a relief on one of the darkest days of my le.Monday  Feb  : AMBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

I think I first saw the murals last year and they are quite stunning. Whoever is doing it is obviously very talented. Itrsquos a fascinating site. We know Invergordon became a naval town and was the base for the Home Fleet in World War I. These tanks were built for the supply of fuel to warships and they were in use until the mid-s.Mrs Brown said like many street artists, the person who carried out the work may wish to remain anonymous and even be fearful of prosecution.ldquoI just donrsquot know. But what they have done is quite beautul. I am sure we could find more projects for them in Invergordon including the town house which the community wants to take back into public ownership.A website documenting historical and derelict places in Scotland reveals the depot was built in conjunction with secret oil storage tanks a few miles away.It records the underground tanks were built to hold  million gallons of oil fuel and were built into a solid rock hill to protect it from bombs.On February ,  a Junkers  is reported to have carried out a solo attack on the tank farm, dropping two lb bombs damaging two tanks. But none of the bombs exploded although they cause a major spillage of oil.Mrs Brown said she understood there were plans to remove some tanks to build houses. She said: ldquoBut it takes time for these sites to be decontaminated from their former industrial uses.In , flats built in Joss Street had to be demolished because the site, which had been formerly used as a gas works, hadnrsquot been properly decontaminated.What do you think  Share your views by emailing us at newsdesk@spp-groupMonday  Feb  : AMBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

But, so far, not in this instance. Some have greeted their departure with a sense of triumphalism that they are “not Labour” or “should join the Tories”. Others have spent the last few years hounding, harassing and bullying those very MPs in order to force them to leave the Labour Party. I think they are all missing the point.I’m angry at that approach but I am angrier at the reaction from the Labour leadership. What we needed last Monday was a moment for reflection.The MPs who have resigned their lelong association with the Labour Party have taken this heartbreaking decision not as an act of sabotage or spite but as a very last resort at a situation they felt was untenable. They also set out a challenge to the Labour Party leadership. Those challenges should have been thought about and dealt with. But instead we got a cloth-eared response that essentially dismissed their concerns.I’ve never been involved in the professional world of human resources, but I am sure in any other organisation there would have been a little bit of soul searching to ensure no others would leave, and to try and address the fundamentally important reasons for their leaving in the first place.And the challenges they set are fundamental.They rightly said that the current official Labour Party position to prevent a public vote with the option to remain in the EU, which is the Labour Party policy agreed at our conference, was not in the national interest, and is playing members and the rest of the country for “fools”.They rightly said that the Labour Party was lack-lustre at best and turning a blind eye at worst to the scourge of anti-Semitism that seems to be enveloping the party.They said that the bullying and intimidation of MPs was unbearable and this was being tolerated by the Labour leadership’s inability or unwillingness to do anything about it. And they rightly said that the current Labour Party was only that in name and the party they joined was no longer the one they recognised today.There is little doubt that our politics is broken, and the party system is breaking down.Many voters see themselves as being politically homeless and that is why the new Independent Group should not just be dismissed.If they capture the imagination of the public, demonstrate that our politics is broken, develop policies for all of the country, and guide themselves by the national interest, they will talk to a very large number of voters. At the very least, they may well recalibrate British politics.So, the Labour Party is at a crossroads. The leadership can either see the events of this week as a wake-up call and try to address the issues that have been raised or they can carry on with business as usual. I would plead with them to go with the former, but I fear they have already set the trajectory for the latter.If they take the wrong route now the public will look for something that better reflects their hopes and aspirations for a credible alternative government to this wretched Tory administration and it won’t be anyone’s fault but their own.I have no plans to join them, but Tom Watson MP was correct when he said, “I love this party. But sometimes I no longer recognise it.”Those who have left have put the Labour Party on notice and I certainly don’t blame them for standing up for what they believe in. I just wish the Labour leadership would recognise the problem and listen, acknowledge, reflect, and reform.Ian Murray is Labour MP\u2028for Edinburgh South©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"brexit theresa may delays meaningful vote again","story":"Theresa May has delayed a second vote on her Brexit deal, leaving it until as late as  March for MPs to decide whether to accept the agreement or put the UK on a path to a no-deal exit from the EU.The Prime Minister confirmed she would not put a deal before parliament in Brexit votes this week, sparking condemnation from opposition leaders and her own MPs and risking the resignation of ministers who have insisted Mrs May rule out a no-deal scenario.With MPs set to vote on a proposal to extend Article an agreement hasn’t been approved by mid-March, it also puts huge pressure on Brexiteers, who could face a decision between Mrs May’s deal and a delay to Brexit.Speaking on her way to an EU-League of Arab States summit in Sharm el-Sheikh, the Prime Minister said: “I was in Brussels last week. Ministers were in Brussels last week. My team will be back in Brussels again this coming week. They will be ing to Brussels on Tuesday.“As a result of that we won’t bring a meaningful vote to Parliament this week. But we will ensure that happens by March .“But it is still within our grasp to leave the European Union with a deal on March .”: Lib Dems shouldn’t backto EU after BrexitShadow Brexit Secretary Sir Keir Starmer said the decision was “the height of irresponsibility and an admission of failure”.“Theresa May is recklessly running down the clock in a desperate attempt to force MPs to choose between her deal and no deal,” Mr Starmer said. “Parliament cannot stand by and allow this to happen.”SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford said the decision showed “Westminster is failing Scotland”.“Theresa May’s attempts to run down the clock on Brexit must be stopped – for the Tory party to gamble with the country’s future like this threatens a major economic catastrophe,” Mr Blackford said.The announcement was greeted with despair by business leaders, who backed a delay to Article .Edwin Morgan, the interim director general of the Institute of Directors said firms had “lost all faith in the political process”.“With today’s announcement, it’s clear the writing is on the wall. There appears to be little realistic chance of a deal being agreed and the necessary legislation getting through by  March,” he said.“It now seems hard to envisage an exit without a limited, technical extension to allow time for parliament to finalise our exit.“There is too much at stake to run down the clock and risk an accidental no deal.”There was also criticism from Remain-supporting Tories, with the MP Nick Boles saying there was “no reason to believe the PM will achieve anything in next two weeks that she hasn’t in last two months.”Focus will now turn to an amendment proposed by Labour’s Yvette Cooper and Tory Oliver Letwin, which sets a deadline of  March for a deal to be agreed - one day before the cut-off set by the Prime Minister.: Independence orce negotiations ‘would be harder than Brexit’If the amendment is passed when MPs vote on a government ‘neutral motion’ on Wednesday, it would begin a process backed by legislation requiring the Prime Minister to ask the EU to delay Brexit.Mrs May now faces a major rebellion by pro-EU Tories who oppose a no-deal Brexit, potentially including some of her most senior ministers.Three cabinet ministers - Work and Pension Secretary Amber Rudd, Business Secretary Greg Clark, and Justice Secretary David Gauke - warned on Saturday that unless a deal was agreed imminently, MP would be forced to back the Cooper-Letwin amendment.“It would be better to seek to extend Article  and delay our date of departure rather than crash out of the European Union on March ,” the ministers said.Responding to their comments on the flight to Egypt on Sunday, Mrs May insisted collective Cabinet responsibility had not broken down.“What we have seen around the Cabinet table, in the party, and in the country at large is strong views on the issue of Europe,” the Prime Minister said. “That is not a surprise to anybody.“We have around the Cabinet table a collective, not just responsibility, but desire, to actually ensure that we leave the European Union with a deal. That’s what we’re working for and that’s what I’m working for.”Mrs May did not respond when askedthe three ministers should remain in government, but said extending Article  would not break the deadlock over Brexit.“Often people talk about the extension of Article  asthat will actually solve the issue. Of course it won’t. It defers the point of decision. There comes a point where we need to make that decision.“Extension of Article  doesn’t solve the problem.“There will always come a point where we have to decide whether we accept the deal that’s been negotiated or not.”©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"david mundell snp approach to brexit is damaging and cynical","story":"David Mundell has said the SNP are supporting a no-deal Brexit by failing to endorse the Withdrawal Agreement negotiated by Theresa May.The Scottish Secretary had written to SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford, who previously called on Mr Mundell to back an extension of Article  in order to avoid a no-deal scenario.Mr Blackford’s letter also urged Mr Mundell to resignhe does not oppose a no-deal Brexit with the UK due to leave the European Union on March .: Ian Blackford calls on David Mundell to resign to oppose no-dealThe exchange came as the Prime Minister ruled out a “meaningful vote” on Brexit in the Commons this week, insisting one would be held by March .Mr Mundell said her proposals offered “a sensible, pragmatic way forward” and told Mr Blackford: “By failing to endorse the Withdrawal Agreement negotiated by the Prime Minister, you and your party are supporting a no-deal Brexit.“I agree with you that outcome would have very serious economic consequences for Scotland and the UK, so I would urge you to reconsider.”He added: “The deal negotiated by the Prime Minister achieves the broad objectives outlined in the Scottish Government’s Scotland’s Place in Europe papers.: Lib Dems shouldn’t back ing to EU after Brexit“It provides an implementation period that avoids a sudden ‘clf edge’, offers businesses the certainty they require and allows time for our future trading relationship with the EU to be negotiated...

Until now.All these club names have representation in the Scottish women#s under- squad which flew out to Portugal this week to take on three matches in an international development cup.And proudly flying the flag for the Western Isles women#s team is Rachael Johnstone, a -year-old goalkeeper from Balallan with a steely focus on forging a successful career in the ever-improving world of women#s football.Sport-daft Rachael took her first footballing steps while attending Stornoway Primary, where she says coach Gordon MacRae gave her huge encouragement to play.She started as an outfield player but began playing as goalkeeper for Stornoway Aths juniors in her first year at high school. She continues to train and play at the island#s capital club, as well as with the Western Isles women#s squad.Progress has been swt, and Rachael first featured for the Scotland under-s last year. Her performances have also caught the eye of the Celtic women#s team and she was recently invited to join the club#s national performance squad for a year#s trial. last week. #I can fly down and be in Glasgow on a Friday and fly back to be in school on Monday morning. It#s hard work, but I love sport and I#m determined to keep improving and go as far as I can in the game.#Being selected for the Scotland under-s makes me really proud # it#s insane really. It#s not really kicked in yet, and probably won#t until I am out on the field.#Rachael was in the starting line-up for the Scotland under-s opening match against the Netherlands on Thursday. Paul Brownlie#s side drew -, before going on to narrowly lose - on penalties. Their next match sees them take on hosts Portugal on Saturday before they conclude the three-match tour with a match against Germany on Monday.Mum Rhona was also making the journey to cheer Rachael on. She said: #I#m very proud. You always encourage them, but you don#t ever expect your children to be asked to represent their country. It#s a huge honour and I just want to support her as much as I can.#Rachael, who is a fourth-year pupil at Sir E Scott School in Tarbert in Harris, said she owed a big debt to local coaches Euan and Jenna MacLeod for their advice and encouragement as well as to her school for allowing her time off to pursue her footballing dream.Another of Rachael#s ambitions is to represent the Western Isles at the World Island Games # an event which has been pivotal in fostering women#s football in the Hebrides.#Ever since I was about seven it#s been my goal to make the Western Isles team and to go to the Island Games # that would be a huge thing for me,# added Rachael, who identied Scotland under- goalkeeper Lee Alexander as a key influence and role model, and star Scotland and Cha midfielder Erin Cuthbert as possibly her favourite player.As far as the future goes, Rachael says her priority is simply to keep learning the game, but she has already developed a keen sense of what it takes to be a top keeper.#Mindset is really important for a goalkeeper,# she added. #You need to keep the head up and keep going. If you let a goal in, you have to learn how to deal with it. Commitment is also really important.#My dream would be to get a pro contract, and be full-time in football.

It is a safe bet that there are only three: Robert Somerville, John Keenan, and Bob Fulton.Back in March , when they were union shop stewards at the town#s Rolls Royce plant, the three men # and thousands of their co-workers # were responsible for virtually grounding the air force of Chilean dictator General Augusto Pinochet, who had seized power just a few months before in a savage CIA-backed coup. The documentary #Nae Pasaran#, screened in Portree last weekend, tells the story of how these principled trade unionists came to be awarded the highest honour the Republic of Chile can bestow upon foreigners.With much of the world appalled by the overthrow, in September , of the democratically-elected socialist Government of Salvador Allende, it fell to Bob Fulton # a burly, no-nonsense Christian with wartime experience of fighting fascist dictators # to set the ball rolling in East Kilbride. Arriving for work on the morning of th March  he uncovered a chilling truth about the eight Rolls Royce jet engines that had just been delivered to the plant for servicing: the engines came from the British Hawker Hunter jets used by Pinochet loyalists to bomb, amongst other targets, the presidential palace in Santiago where Allende died on the day the coup began.Now in his mid-s, Bob immediately #blacked# the engines that is, he declared them subject to an industrial dispute. As such, they could not be touched by any worker # or anyone , for that matter # until the dispute was resolved. His colleagues soon followed suit, much to the consternation of management and the UK Government. And so the engines sat, untouched, out in the open air for the next four years, until they became useless lumps of rusting metal. Moreover, the East Kilbride plant was the only place in the world licensed to service the engines. So, aside from the eight now-engineless jets, the rest of Pinochet#s air force could not be kept airworthy while workers thousands of miles away stuck to the principles of international solidarity. How many lives this saved on the ground is a moot point.#Nae Pasaran# is a paean to what can be achieved by collective action, and to what might be described as the golden age of trade unionism. But the documentary # written and directed by Felipe Bustos Sierra, son of an exiled Chilean journalist # also works as an emotionally-charged voyage of discovery.For over  years, Bob, John and Robert, and other former plant workers doubted whether or not their actions had any lasting effect on the lives of persecuted Chileans, many of whom were trade unionists like themselves. #Nae Pasaran# works in a dramatic sense because we watch as this gap in their knowledge is filled. The Scottish refuseniks did make an impact. Their stand mattered.What makes #Nae Pasaran# so moving is that the surviving union men, interviewed atby Sierra in his adopted homeland, are shown interviews he conducted back in Chile with survivors of Pinochet#s brutality. Now old men themselves, the victims recalled how they took solace in smuggled radios tuned to Radio Moscow, which broadcast regular updates on the Scottish union#s boycott. The action # or rather inaction # of the Rolls Royce workers gave many Chileans hope that they would not be forgotten or abandoned by the outside world. It may even have contributed directly to the saving of seven lives.Among the hundreds of Chilean exiles arriving in the UK were seven rumoured to have escaped execution or imprisonment because the air force acquired spare parts from Israel, South Africa, and India. So desperate were the Chilean authorities for this materiel they may have swapped the seven detainees for what they needed. Sierra never proves this conclusively, however, because the UK Home Office refused to release certain files relating to the boycott.And what of the jet engines, left to rust in East Kilbride  They were whisked away early one morning in . To this day no one knows who took them, but the Rolls Royce workers were told they were back in service with the Chilean air force. A year later Margaret Thatcher came to power and relations with the Pinochet regime were quickly normalised. Arms exports resumed in earnest.But the #blacked# engines were never used again. One of them, which Sierra discovered in a derelict yard outside Santiago, was shipped back to Scotland in , the year before #Nae Pasaran# hit the cinemas. It is due to be installed, as a lasting monument to the boycott, in a college campus in East Kilbride in the very near future.#Nae Pasaran# celebrates people power. After the screening, the topic was the subject of a short talk by Councillor Chris McEleny, leader of the SNP Group on Inverclyde Council, who also answered questions from the audience on British involvement in the destruction of Yemen, the desire by Tory Brexiteers to deregulate and deunionise even further, and the situation in Venezuela. Indeed, Mr McEleny drew an #obvious parallel# with Venezuela, where the democratically-elected socialist Government of another resource-rich South American country is being targeted for regime change.He said: #In Chile, before the coup, US corporations had huge commercial interests in copper mining and they sought to undermine and destabilise the Allende Government, and this is pretty much what we are seeing in Venezuela right now. Poverty in Venezuela has been engineered by the US, just as it was in Chile. We are seeing the same media pattern, a capitalist conditioning programmeyou like, drip-feeding propaganda to make intervention look like the right thing to do. We are seeing that right now with Venezuela so we need to see the same solidarity that Bob Fulton and others showed in the s.#Sadly, as Bob and his comrades lamented, in an era of weakened trade unions such a workplace boycott could probably not take place now.

Jeremy Rossiter is one, he was the first person I spoke to.“I also have work from a couple from Skeabost, Gill Williams, who is a photographer, and her husband Ian Williams – who is more of an abstract painter.“What I like might or might not be what other people like, so I am intrigued to see how things go.”Robert said that he planned to open the gallery through to at least October and would operate on a commission basis, giving the artists the freedom to price the work themselves.He added: “A lot of galleries just focus on professional artists, but I want it to also be a place where amateur artists and photographers can sell their work.”He went on to say: “When people are buying something, especially work that’s expensive, it’s better to see it in the flesh than on a computer. It’s a  for people to sell their work, and I am just acting as an agent, selling it for them and supplying the location.”He added: “We are calling it the Isle of Skye Gallery – keeping it simple. That way everyone knows where it is, and it doesn’t prioritise one type of artwork over another. We have a Facebook page — Isle of Skye Gallery, and we’re on Instagram too — it’s not my forte but it’s a good  to promote it.” that while the gallery was due to open this week, an official launch would take place next month.With th March marking the one-year anniversary of Tommy’s death, perhaps the new crop of artists present will draw inspiration from the indelible impression left by the gallery’s former incumbent as the space is brought back into use."},{"url":null,"title":"m22 closure after four vehicles in collision","story":"The M northbound is closed between the Ballygrooby Road and Moneynick Road junctions after a collision involving four vehicles on Friday night.

As Moy Park celebrates  years in business, Aaron reflects on changes in the sector and milestones along the way. He said: “I first joined Moy Park in  when I was still at school, working part time at the weekends as a factory operative. “As a student, it was a great insight into the world of work and business. It taught me the value of hard work, money earned, and motivated me to want to do more of both! “After gaining a degree in Health and Leisure from Queen’s University Belfast, I was keen to move into a business environment and decided to apply to Moy Park’s Graduate Management Programme, to find out more about a career in one of our fastest growing industries, agri-food. “The two-year programme was the ideal way to find out more about ious strands of a business, from operations to finance, HR and marketing, and what might suit my skillset best. “From my time as a sht worker on the factory floor, I had a healthy respect and interest in the processing side of Moy Park, and the opportunities and challenges therein. “Once I completed the Graduate Management Programme - which we still use as a recruitment tool today - I took up a position as a sht manager, capitalising on my people management skills and interest in operations. “Since then, I have worked my way up across a number of Moy Park’s sites – moving from factory manager to area manager and have now been General Manager at Ballymena for two years. “Ballymena is a great place to work. From a business point of view, it’s strategically located with fantastic transport links and from a social standpoint, you’ll never find yourself wanting for something to do – from shopping to socialising over a drink or a bite to eat. It’s also quickly becoming the spa capital of Northern Ireland! “While Ballymena has faced a number of economic challenges, it’s an area with a rich history and heritage of business success. This spirit is still very much evidenced by the people, businesses and organisations in the town today. “Mid and East Antrim Council has an ambitious integrated economic development strategy for the area to help encourage business growth across the borough, and it’s one we are keen to help support. “It’s a strategy important not just to Moy Park as a business, but to me personally. “I sit on Mid and East Antrim Council’s Manufacturing Task Force Team, a working group committed to supporting and fostering growth. I was delighted to attend Westminster with a delegation from the Task Force recently when Northern Ireland representatives presented their plans for a Belfast City Deal. “Hearing these plans certainly gave us food for thought when it comes to nurturing growth locally. “As Ballymena’s General Manager, I’m responsible for all business s at the site – from technical to HR and finance. “With over , members of staff, it’s a erse and busy job but that’s what makes it worth doing. In the last  years, business management has evolved signicantly. “While there might be more paperwork, regulations, travel and late nights, there is also an incredible amount of collaboration - with customers, industry, educational bodies and government and our local communications. “Managers today cannot afford to work in silos, you need to adopt an attitude of knowledge sharing and foster an environment of innovation to truly succeed. “My key piece of advice to anyone viewing management as a career is to do your research and bolster your skillsyou need to. Being a good manager isn’t a static position, you constantly need to challenge yourself, and a good employer is one who lets you not only challenge yourself but equips you with the skills to overcome these challenges. “One of my own personal highlights over the last  years was been being named ‘Young Processor of the Year’ at the Meat and Poultry Processing Awards in . “Given my background working on the factory floor, it was great to win an industry award. At a business level, I’ve been very proud to see Ballymena evolve to become a Centre of Excellence, focused on driving innovation in food manufacturing. “As General Manager, it’s my ambition to see our facilities continue to grow.” "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1460456.jpg--.jpg?1550570314000\n","title":"mp hails amber light on scotland bridge plan","story":"North Antrim MP Ian Paisley has welcomed talks about a prospective bridge connecting Northern Ireland and Great Britain.Mr Paisley recently, along with South Antrim DUP MP Paul Girvan met with the Secretary of State for Transport, Chris Grayling to discuss the bridge.After the meeting between the three MPs, the Transport secretary said he would be in contact with the Prime Minister and the Chancellor of the Exchequer in order to discuss a feasibility project which would investigate the economics of the bridge and whether it would make financial sence to construct the bridge.The proposed bridge could be placed anywhere along the Northern Irish coast line, either at the shortest distance to Scotland at  miles or at the longest of  miles.

Inevitably, as he sedately passes, the lad with the ball loops one over the roof of the passing vehicle – Squinter seems to rememberthe player had hit the kerb with that shot he’d have got two points instead of one.It got Squinter to thinking – again – about the death of street games, for while the sight of two kids playing the iconic Belfast street game was enough to brighten the darkest day, the smile that it put on Squinter’s face faded a little with the realisation that it only highlighted the sad fact that such a sight is very much a rarity these days.It’s not the first time – and probably won’t be the last – that Squinter has lamented the passing of al fresco children’s entertainment: Rally-Oh!, Kick-the-Tin, -- Red Light. But here’s another street game that hasn’t been documented and yet was played in just about every house in Squinter’s street.When new gutties were required for the childer, we all got them at the same time: start of summer, new school term, bingo win – occasions like that. Brothers being intensely competitive beings, we were all keen to establish the superiority of the new footwear that had been bestowed upon us. And so we’d pull on the new gutties, lace them up with loving care and outside we’d go for a race.The winner was never going to be the fastest runner – the winner was going to be the one with the fastest shoes. We’d line up out in the square and, after the usual fussing and fighting over  starts and wrong counts, off we’d bolt, feeling aswe were being powered by some unseen but powerful motor in our pristine new gutties. Then we’d do some jumps, because of course those new gutties could not only make you run like the wind, they could make you leap like an antelope.Squinter’s not sure that kids do that now with their £-plus gel-cushioned, gas-injected fashion statements. In fact, he’s fairly sure that by the time a child grows out of them they’re as unmarked as the day they left the factory, given that they’ve spent more time on a sofa than they have on the street.Squinter’s running days are most likely over, sad to relate , which means that he will never again appreciate the unalloyed joyof pulling on a new pair of trainers. He did buy a sturdy pair of brogues recently which will face up to the rigours of any Belfast winter, but sadly aren’t designed to propel a person along a flat tarmac surface at any appreciable speed not like a good pair of Sizzlers."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"kfc footage proves man didnt burgle home claim","story":"THE brother of a man who’s been remanded in prison for his alleged involvement in an aggravated burglary in Ligoniel on Friday night says he is innocent.Daniel Lundy says his brother Alan was targeted in an MI-directed operation by the PSNI. He’s currently in Maghaberry. Alan Lundy, of Thornberry Close, appeared before Belfast Magistrates Court on Monday charged with intent to steal and having a firearm. He is accused of being one of two masked men who forced their way into a house on the Ligoniel Road on Friday night where a suspected gun was brandished.However, defence solicitor Darragh Mackin said Alan has provided a detailed account of his whereabouts on the night in question, ranging from being in a KFC fast food outlet  miles away from the scene of the crime,then travelling home and accessing WhatsApp and Facebook. Mr Mackin told the court that cell-site analysis and wi account details can be provided to show Lundy was messaging on social media rather than taking part in any burglary and said it was a “fundamental case of mistaken identity”. District Judge Fiona Bagnall refused Mr Lundy bail, citing potential witness interference and he was remanded in custody to appear by video-link on March .Alan’s partner’s house was raided late on Friday where he was arrested in front of his young children.Alan’s brother Daniel told the North Belfast News that he is innocent and his arrest and remand is the latest in a long list of intimidation against his sibling.“Alan is innocent, it is just internment,” he said.“There is sufficient evidence to prove where he was at the time of this so-called incident.“He is constantly stopped and searched and harassed. His family know where he was and everyone knows where he was.“Alan’s partner’s house was searched and has been on numerous occasions with the doors put through and his kids literally dragged from their bed at all hours of the morning. This is nothing but MI-directed.”North Belfast Saoradh representative Dee Fennell says Alan is “a victim of the state”.“Evidence has already been presented to the Magistrates Court when it was alleged he was involved in an incident in Ligoniel that he was  miles away in a fast food outlet and there is CCTV to prove that,” he said. “There is also proof via his phone that he was not there. There were also conflicting witness reports – one said it was Alan wearing a beige coat and the other said it was Marty wearing a black coat.“In any other situation, Alan would be at home with his family and children but instead he was remanded and sent to Maghaberry. This is the second time Alan has been a victim of malicious prosecution and internment.“In , Alan was a steward at a GARC protest and was accused by a PSNI officer of throwing a stone. He was sent to Maghaberry and served three months and it was only then that the PSNI officer retracted the evidence. His family is constantly harassed on a regular basis and, in my view, Alan is a victim of the state.“In the last ten years, Alan has been arrested between  and  times, had his house raided on more occasions than that, stopped and searched hundreds of time.“I am a youth worker. There are four definitions of abuse: physical, psychological, sexual and neglect. No-one can tell me that Alan Lundy’s children being dragged out of their beds in the middle of the night is not psychological abuse of children.“Alan Lundy personies what is happening to republicans across the six counties. It should also be pointed out that Alan has never been convicted of anything under what the British government callthe Terrorism Act.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screen-Shot-2019-02-22-at-14.19.53.png","title":"that battered can is kicked again","story":"IN  the intense focus of many in the policing debates in our community was the lack of progress on legacy matters. It was deeply contentious that a new police service could be established without a wider societal process to deal with the harms of the conflict, especially violations by the RUC, including their involvement in collusion and their involvement in and cover-up of state killings.Many families took the view that policing was needed in the community and that the structures were there to make human rights-compliant day-to-day policing possible, but did not agree with the moves to engage in policing in the absence of a process to deal with the past.We all know that the path of a peace process is painful, the question is, what pain is expected from whom Victims affected by all actors have been asked to accept painful processes. Those affected by non-state actors were asked to accept the early release of prisoners.For victims of the state this was not relevant because those responsible benefited from impunity.While the RUC was disbanded their positive reputation in their own community and wider society was secured with a St George’s Cross presented by the queen of England. The costs of changing the RUC to the PSNI ran into tens of millions with severance packages available to those who served in the RUC who did not want to change to PSNI. Those former officers also received pensions. Some of them also came into the PSNI as “civilian staff”.The thing about all of that was that it was never made clear why the change was necessary. It was alluded to as an issue of “community confidence”, because the RUC had been  per cent Protestant. But, of course, that did not explain the need for a human rights-based approach to the PSNI, for multiple s of accountability, including a Policing Board, a Police Ombudsman’s office and formal community engagement structures.Because we had not had an honest accounting for our conflict and impunity reigns supreme, the crimes of the RUC, which include extensive collusion with loyalism, have gone unmentioned and without proper investigation, with the can of dealing with the past being kicked so repeatedly down the road that it has become a sick joke.When George Hamilton became Chief Constable he made promising and assuring statements about the need for a comprehensive process to deal with the past. However, last year when proposals to do exactly that were published the organisation representing his own rank and file rejected them, because of reputational issues for the RUC.Last week’s focus on files not disclosed to the Ombudsman have led to a wider discussion about policing structures. However, despite international and domestic law being on their side, the very people who have been harmed yet again by these systemic and deliberate failures are those whose concerns, for the best will in the world, were sidelined in favour of wider political “progress”.The question is, will those same families, or any other families, ever see their rights being vindicated in a truly independent process  Is it conceivable that they would once again be asked to compromise in favour of wider processes  The anger we all feel this week should be remembered for those days when those questions are asked."},{"url":null,"title":"eu cannot compromise on brexit deal to placate conservative brexiteers","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsSix NationsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

AUTOCROP h bpanews_eb-e-c-abbe-acaa_EmailThe Government has defended the practice of culling deer in Dublin’s Phoenix Park..pushFinance Minister Paschal Donohoe ruled out contraceptives as an alternative to managing wild deer populations.Mr Donohoe’s comments come after animal rights groups criticised deer being shot dead in the capital’s park in January following orders by the Office of Public Works.A total of  deer were shot at the start of the year.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  A deer cull is carried out in Phoenix Park in Dublin It is understood the carcasses were then sold onto meat suppliers.Campaigners called for a more humane way of managing the wild deer.In a written response to a question in the Dail by Independents  Change TD Clare Daly asking whether alternatives to deer culling in the park had been considered, Mr Donohoe said alternatives had been examined but they were not deemed feasible.“Deer culling is of course an activity that OPW would prefer not to have to carry out,” Mr Donohoe said.“However, the cull, as undertaken, is considered to be the most appropriate and humane way to sustainably manage the population of deer in the park.”Mr Donohoe said contraceptives were not a viable alternative because no contraceptives are licensed for use on wild deer in Ireland.“Although not licensed yet, there are dferent contraception strategies available for deer, but in most cases, they refer to heavily managed herds ,” he said.The minister said the most common strategy would be steroids, which are given to each female on a yearly basis, but he said administration of these steroids in the correct quantities would be “entirely impractical” in a large, wild herd as it would disrupt their normal herd behaviour.Such steroids would be administered via dart and Mr Donohoe said the darting of deer for capture to administer contraceptives would be an “extremely dangerous procedure” to undertake in a public park.“Darts are often lost during such operations resulting in a dangerous hazard to the public and other wildle,” he said.“The quantities of tranquilliser required to sedate a deer could be fatal for humans which is obviously of particular concern in a park frequented by large volumes of visitors.”Mr Donohoe also said live capture, which was carried out in  with over  persons involved from Ireland and the UK, was not an option as current health and safety requirements and the size of the current herd meant it was not practical or safe to undertake this exercise today.“Live capture takes hours to be completed.“Stress levels can reach abnormal levels in the animals leading to immune-depression and abortion in females,” he said.“Live capture requires the gathering of many deer in limited spacesand this can lead to severe or sometimes lethal injuries especially among fawns and younger deer injured by bucks.”He also ruled out transporting the deer to other locations as it would be very stressful for wild animals.The OPW has previously said that culling prevents a rise in the fallow deer population which can lead to an increase in road traffic accidents in the popular park.Phoenix Park was originally formed as a royal hunting park in the s and opened to the public in .The park is home to Dublin Zoo and the residence of the president of Ireland Michael D Higgins."},{"url":null,"title":"ireland

So I think some of my colleagues will also be considering their positions following that announcement.”Meanwhile Labour has declined to comment on reports that Jeremy Corbyn is to meet with former justice secretary Lord Falconer of Thoroton to discuss how the party can tackle the issue of anti-Semitism.Mr Corbyn was said to be considering asking the peer, a former flatmate of Tony Blair, to be the party’s anti-Semitism surveillance commissioner, with full oversight of how it handles complaints and decision-making processes.Over the weekend deputy leader Tom Watson warned Mr Corbyn that he needed to “eradicate” anti-Semitism in the partyhe hoped ever to become prime minister.After the Jewish MP Luciana Berger was driven out by “racist bullies”, Mr Watson said it was clear that reforms introduced by general secretary Jennie Formby to deal with the issue had failed."},{"url":null,"title":"regina king named best supporting actress at the oscars","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsSix NationsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

And he offered a global review of the broader societal problem of sexual tourism and online pornography, in a bid to contextualise what he said was once a taboo subject.But he said the sexual abuse of children becomes even more scandalous when it occurs in the Catholic Church, “for it is utterly incompatible with her moral authority and ethical credibility”.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Pope Francis celebrates Mass at the Vatican “We need to recognise with humility and courage that we stand face-to-face with the mystery of evil, which strikes most violently against the most vulnerable, for they are an image of Jesus,” he said.Francis summoned the bishops from around the world to the four-day meeting to impress upon them that clergy sex abuse and cover-ups are not just a problem in some countries but a global problem that threatens the very mission of the Catholic Church.“Brothers and sisters, today we find ourselves before a manestation of brazen, aggressive and destructive evil,” the pope said.He offered an eight-point pledge of priorities going forward, calling for a change in the church’s defensive mentality and a vow to never again cover-up cases. Victims, he said, must take centre stage while priests must undergo a continuing path of purity with the “holy fear of God” guiding the examination of their own failures.“In people’s justied anger, the church sees the reflection of the wrath of God, betrayed and insulted by these deceitful consecrated persons,” he said."},{"url":null,"title":"cusack calls completion cregganburn lighting","story":"SDLP Councillor for Foyleside has called on the Council to finish the installation of lighting in the local Cregganburn Park between the Glen Road and Rosemount.Cllr Cusack explained that the regeneration of the Cregganburn Park started four years ago in January  with £k funding from what was then the Department for Regional Development, however, it is still incomplete.She commented: \"This budget was to cover many major aspects of the greenway scheme but was insufficient to fully illuminate all the pathways in the area.\"In March last year I was relieved to see Council respond proactively and oversee the lighting of the section from the Baldrick steps to the middle crossroads, which I’d lobbied continuously for. Promises had always been made that all areas would follow suit as and when finance became available.\"We are now a year further down the line and I am again calling for this project to be completed in full.

It is not a satisfactory situation.Mr Billy McGivern, the Executiversquos area manager, admitted to councillors he was not happy with the situation in Ballynahinch and explained what had gone wrong with the Antrim Road site where  new homes were to have been built.ldquoWe did get planning permission for the site, he said. ldquoWe dug trial holes and the ground was satisfactory, but we were overtaken by discussions between the landowner and a private developer. The Housing Executive could not go through with a vesting order where a private developer is going ahead to build low cost housing.Mr McGivern promised that the Executive would press very strongly for sites in Ballynahinch and would be meeting with local planners in an attempt to come up with an answer.Ballynahinch councillor Mr Eddie McVeigh agreed there were problems obtaining sites, but he pointed out that the town was not scheduled for any new homes until - and he wanted other sites investigated as soon as possible.Cllr William Brown felt the now abandoned Antrim Road site was not all it was supposed to be anyway and it would have been foolish to proceed with a site which would have flooded, as it had done in the past.Cllr Francis Laverty wanted to know how the Executive could justy giving houses in Ballynahinch to people from Drumaness.DOWNPATRICK mdash Downpatrick firemen had another busy week, during which they attended several gorse fires and a chimney fire.On Saturday they were called to a gorse fire near Irish Street and the previous day they attended a Gorse Fire at Gallows Hill.On Thursday they were called out three times. The first was in the morning to St Johnrsquos Old Peoplersquos Home in Pound Lane, but they were not needed as the fire alarm had gone off accidentally.KILLOUGH mdash Killough Village Committee is pressing the Housing Executive to repair extensive storm damage caused to houses during the Christmas period.Damage caused to several of the new houses in the Castle Street area was one of the main problems discussed at a meeting of the committee recently.ldquoSerious storm damage to the roofs occurred, especially over the Christmas period, and this has not been fixed, the committee claims.ldquoLetters were sent to the Housing Executive and the contractor. The Executive sent a clerk of works to meet the contractorrsquos men at an arranged time, but they didnrsquot turn up, the committee said.ldquoThe occupants are very annoyed about this lack of interest and are now awaiting immediate action before dampness causes more serious damage.The committee has also hit out at the delay in truing to prove the ownership of the village harbour. They say it has ldquogone beyond a joke and intend sending a delegation to Down Council in a bid of finally resolve the ownership question.ldquoNothing can be done to start work on the sadly neglected harbour area until the present owner is contacted and public ownership is established. We firmly intend to pursue this matter until work has begun, the committee added.In the evening they attended a gorse fire on the Saul Road and several hours later they attended a chimney fire at Bobbie Hanveyrsquos photographic shop in Irish Street.ARDGLASS mdash Local planners have been asked to keep watch on a dredging operation currently underway at Ardglass harbour.The call has come from Down Council chairman Eddie McGrady, who is concerned not so much about the dredging but what is happening to the materials being taken from the harbour.Local councillor Dermot Curran is also concerned. He said that a tipping operation at the rear of the Seaview estate has not been properly maintained mdash much to the disgust of residents.DRUMAGHLIS mdash Three pupils from Drumaghlis Primary School, near Crossgar, have won a Raleigh Boxer bicycle in a national lsquoWheels Projectrsquo open to Tufty Clubs.The bicycle, which will be used by the Tufty Club members at the school, was the top price in the - years section of the competition which was organised by the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents.Members of the schoolrsquos Tufty Club entered the competition, but it was the entries of Jason McKeown, Paul Beattie and Paul Chambers that clinched the top prize.COMBER mdash Comber police are investigating a number of thefts which took place in the town over the past week.Thieves entered the Rle Club in Railway Street and took away away a number of bottles of spirits on Wednesday evening.

We really are in need of fund raising from the public to help keep us going.Glebe House manager Diarmaid McGarrigle blames the rise in student overheads as one reason for the shortage of dedicated volunteers, calling it a ldquopoor indictment on our society.Mr McGarrigle said up until a few years ago Glebe House benefited from a ldquoteam of dedicated, driven and enthusiastic helpers.He said that is no longer the case because students were now having to seek paid employment to cover tuition fees and other costs.ldquoIt is a shame because young groups need volunteers from their own peer group to relate to, he explained.ldquoWe can offer volunteers a wide iety of skills to choose from as we have  acres of farm land, animals to look after and an environment to plan and maintain. We also run lots of arts and crafts, cookery and games-centred projects.ldquoAll we are looking for in a volunteer is someone who is dedicated to the aims and objectives of Glebe House and its projects.ldquoInthey will receive training in which ever area they choose to work, a lot of camaraderie and the opportunity to meet new friends.ldquoOne of the most rewarding aspects of working at Glebe House for me is seeing children we have helped come back as volunteers years later.

The centrepiece of the celebrations was a specially baked cake.Mrs Hilman has seen huge changes over the past four decades, including progressing from a manual typewriter and maintaing a hand written register to a state-of-the art computer system with touch-type keyboards and scanners.However, one thing that remains the same is the children, who are as much an inspiration today as they were when she first walked into the school.Mrs Hilman began working as secretary in  when Mr James McIlhinney was the principal.

He asked me would I come along and join him so we have been out on tour and we were over playing in Camden, in London last week, said Sean.He continued: ldquoHe signed with a record label called Buddy Records and they got it all sorted for us to go in and record with Abbey Road, so we were recording our new single lsquoCall My Name.rsquoWith the new single due to release on Spoty at the end of next week, Sean said: ldquoWersquove got it all nearly ready to go so therersquos just a few mixes that need to be done.Talking about the recording day, Sean said: ldquoWe were in early morning and we were just straight into it, I never really got thinking about it and about midday we took a walk around the building and seen all the big studios.ldquoWe recorded in the Gate House studio and we went into Studio Two and Studio Three to do wee bits of sample and background vocals.

He said: ldquoRory was in a band way back years ago called The Revs and they wouldrsquove been doing sets at the likes of Slane Castle. My dad is a sound engineer, and he done the sound for The Revs about  years ago.

He asked me thenI wanted to go out on tour with him when he was home. So it came out of nowhere really.Sean has since been touring with Rory and the Island for the last six months, travelling all over Ireland and the UK.

It was indeed seen as a building block towards delivering Irish unity.“There is much for unionism to reflect on, particularly given that we have now come to a point where unionists are in the minority at Stormont.“Any right-thinking unionist should ponder long and hard as to why they would want to go back to that system of government.”South Down MLA Mr Wells said Mr Eastwood’s remarks were “the last throw of the dice” for the SDLP, which he described as a party “looking for relevance”.“These comments by Mr Eastwood are yet another nail in the coffin of the social democratic element of that party,” he told the News Letter.“We have known for years that Sinn Fein wanted to use Stormont as a means towards achieving a united Ireland, and it is sad that the SDLP have now seem to have joined that bandwagon.“It also indicates to me that the SDLP has thrown out any attempt to woo unionism. They are trying to out-green Sinn Fein.

Ministers were in Brussels last week. My team will be back in Brussels again this coming week. They will be ing to Brussels on Tuesday.“As a result of that we won’t bring a meaningful vote to Parliament this week. But we will ensure that that happens by March .“But it is still within our grasp to leave the European Union with a deal on March .”Asked how the Government would treat non-binding motions expected this week which call for the ruling out of a no-deal exit, and which demand an extension of Article , Mrs May said: “We don’t know what amendments are going to be tabled.“We don’t know what amendments are going to be selected.“You haven’t even seen what motion the Government is going to put down - as I say, it won’t be the meaningful vote.“I will be making a statement to Parliament on Tuesday. And then, obviously, we’ll be having the debate the next day.”The PM said the Government was still in talks with the EU about the Northern Ireland backstop.Mrs May said: “We are still in that negotiation. We are still talking to the EU about ious ways in which we can find a resolution to the issue that Parliament raised.”The PM insisted collective Cabinet responsibility had not broken down after the intervention by Amber Rudd, Greg Clark and David Gauke indicating that they could back parliamentary moves to stop a no deal.Loughinisland: Killers’ getaway car had no forensic value Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"The PM said: “No, collective responsibility has not broken down.“What we have seen around the Cabinet table, in the party, and in the country at large is strong views on the issue of Europe.“That is not a surprise to anybody.“We have around the Cabinet table a collective, not just responsibility, but desire, to actually ensure that we leave the European Union with a deal. That’s what we’re working for and that’s what I’m working for.”Askedthe three ministers should remain in Government, Mrs May said: “What we see around the Cabinet table is strong views held on the issue of Europe.”Mrs May said that extending Article  would not deal with the issues.The PM said: “Now, often people talk about the extension of Article  asthat will actually solve the issue. Of course it won’t. It defers the point of decision. There comes a point where we need to make that decision.“Extension of Article  doesn’t solve the problem.“There will always come a point where we have to decide whether we accept the deal that’s been negotiated or not.“And that will be a decision for every member of Parliament across the House.“Every member of the Commons will have to face that decision when that point comes.“The Government will be bringing back, working with the EU, and will want to put a deal to the House of Commons in a meaningful vote.”try catch  TrendingIN PICTURES: The  locations across N.I. where speed camera vans operateTwo cases of meningitis confirmed at NI primary schoolMan caught with  lsquopackagesrsquo of cocaine in his body at Belfast City AirportBallymena manager David Jeffrey praised his side after their - defeat to Linfield in the BetMcLean League Cup Final.LIVE BLOG: League Cup final  - Ballymena United v Linfield          ..

I canrsquot see that there is any way the council can fix this, there just isnrsquot the infrastructure.ldquoItrsquos obvious that it is not going to work, it would be a waste of money to even try it.But another Plassey Street resident, Bat Goddard, said: ldquoTo spend pound, on an experiment, which in  months they could reject, is ludicrous.ldquoWe have the widest street in Penarth here but they want to turn it in to a one-way system.ldquoWe need to stop this folly now.Vale council member Geoff Cox, who is the cabinet member for Neighbourhood Services and Transport, has since said a report will be put forward that retains the roundabout and instead looks at enhancing other ideas to solve crossing issues and traffic problems.Cllr Coxsaid: ldquoAs the Cabinet meeting date approached, I became more aware of the strength of local feeling associated with the highway option being proposed, hence my decision to defer the report meaning it was not even considered by Cabinet on January .ldquoI have since reviewed the ious options further, which has included my meeting with local ward members to obtain their detailed views on all options. I now intend to present an amended report to cabinet on February .ldquoThe report will propose that option one in the previous report now be taken forward, which retains the current roundabout though enhances the gateway route into Penarth whilst providing much safer crossing opportunities for cyclists and pedestrians. There is no requirement to complete any spending on this project by the end of this financial year.ldquoIt is very dficult to please everyone with highway improvement schemes but I very much hope that this option provides the active travel benefits we are seeking and is viewed by residents and visitors to Penarth as being the most appropriate. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It was made with willow grown in the grounds of Cogan Primary School.More than  people attended the hill rolling ceremony down Clf Hill towards Penarth Esplanade - with the school pupils from Cogan and pupils and families from Ysgol Pen Y Garth helping to roll it along.The head was accompanied by a wooden frame from the Mabinogion stories called the Window of Sorrows made by Tony Simms, and the artist Ifor Davies undertook the ritual sawing of the Window of Sorrows on the clftops and read the Bendigeidfran story from the Mabinogion tales before the rolling went ahead.The head of Bendigeidfran and the Window of Sorrows was accompanied by Penarths Mari Lwyd which is a symbol of hosting, and negotiating hospitality through song and teasing. Richard Parry led the Mari Lwyd this year, and on arriving at the bottom of the hill the celebration visited local shops and resaurants along the sea front wishing the proprietors and customers a Happy New Year. We sang for Romeo Italian restaurant, The Fig Tree, James Sommerin, The Crazy Cafe and Hamptons seaside shop. After reaching the bottom of the hill the head was carried by the children along with the Mari Lwyd to the shops and cafes along the seafront where dferent New Year songs - called Calenig - were sung in each venue and led by local opera singer Richard Parry.Speaking about the event, artist Haf Weighton said: \"I loved working with Cogan School. Itrsquos a hidden gem in Penarth with very enthusiastic staff who were happy to jump in to get involved in this project at short notice. Richard Parry and the schools deputy head Tom Lewis, ran a assembly to the whole school on the new year traditions. Then children from across the school came to see me working on the piece. \"It was lovely to hear children who donrsquot come from homes where Welsh is spoken enthusing about the mabinogi tales and Welsh traditions. Children from Pen y Garth joined in after the head was created. They helped us roll it down the hill from the clf tops.\"Richard Parry, who helped to organise the event and led the Mari Lwyd, said: \"It was great to see so many people come together to celebrate Hen Galan in Penarth. The giant Bendegeidfran got his name because he was the Blessed Bran - the best friend anyone could ever want - and in the stories of the Mabinogion he was loved by those who knew him. He is a symbol of friendship and celebrating together. \"The community celebration on the clftops was thoroughly enjoyed by children and adults alike, and even though its a bit chilly it was wonderful to see so many people out of doors, celebrating, singing and enjoying wishing everyone we met Blwyddyn Newydd Dda and Happy New Year.\"The head will now go on display at a iety of places, including Pen y Garth School, Cogan Primary School, Penarth Library and The Hearth Gallery Llandough Hospital. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Dealing with this type of call prevents our staff from dealing with genuine emergencies.ldquoCalling an ambulance when you donrsquot need one wastes time and resources which could have been better spent responding someone genuinely in need of the high level clinical care ambulance crews provide. Ambulances are not a taxi service and arriving at hospital by ambulance does not mean yoursquoll be seen quicker.\"She added: ldquoIf someone is seriously ill or injured and their le is at risk, you should call  immediately.

That being the case, this council, like many others in Wales, is unable to continue to provide the level of subsidy to outdoor sports provision that it has in the past.ldquoExploring dferent ways of working, including the transfer of responsibilities in appropriate circumstances to community groups is a key element of the councilrsquos strategy moving forward as it addresses dficult budget priorities.ldquoFollowing the successful transfer of responsibilities for five libraries to community-based organisations and looking at a number of successful sports clubs across the Vale of Glamorgan who operate without any subsidy from the Council, it is hoped that the majority of clubs currently using council facilities will be able to continue to provide opportunities for all to participate in sports activities. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief.

Pat said: “My daddy was one of three brothers who used to can apples. They’d get the apples from the local orchards, peel them and can them. Daddy then started growing his own apples and supplying the fresh market and the cider markets.”Now Pat’s son, and Peter’s grandson – also called Peter – is the third generation farmer who is set to carry on the business. Pat’s we Catherine and their four daughters also have integral roles to play as the craft cider making end of the agri-business continues to grow.Pat, Catherine and Peter McKeever of Long Meadow FarmLong Meadow started off with two craft cider drinks in  before introducing a mulled cider and a cider aged in oak barrels, some of which had been used in the original apple canning business. Over the past two years the company has branched out into flavoured ciders, apple juice and apple cider vinegar – famed for its health benefits.Catherine said: “I know everything goes through a bit of a fad, but I think the craft ciders are still holding their own. The mindset of cider has changed with craft ciders. “A lot of people would have associated cider in their younger days – maybe when they were at university – as a cheap drink you can buy in big quantities and get a hit off.“But that wasn’t craft cider. People are prepared to pay that little bit extra for the quality that comes with craft cider.“We’re using all our own fruit. We make it in smaller quantities so it can hold all the flavours, that’s the way we want to keep it. We only use hand-picked fruit, not any that has fallen on the ground.”Of the harvesting process, Pat said: “We would have between  to  pickers. They would come the third week in July and do a bit of summer pruning.Resurfacing works on A Portadown Road, ArmaghBrexit and data protection - will firms still have to comply with the new EU GDPR  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"“Once that’s finished, in August they start into the picking of the apples, that goes right through to the end of October, first week in November.“The picking season we call it the nine weeks of hell. It’s your livelihood. You are depending on that fruit.“We harvest approximately , tonne of apples yearly.”Catherine explained how the orchard came to be illuminated: “A man called Walter Holt came to the farm last year to buy some apple cider vinegar. “I got talking to him and he gave me his card and told me what he did – an outdoor lighting artist.“I didn’t think much of it at the time, but I think the seeds had been sewn. I played about with it in my mind for a long time that it could be something we could work with.”Walter Holt and his assistant Orlanda Delaforce spent a total of  hours working on the installation of the lighting scheme.Walter commented: “The challenge on this particular scheme was working with smaller trees in an orchard setting. It’s a compact area and our solution was to develop a one way circular trail. “We tried to have as much creative iety as possible, implementing dferent approaches to dferent trees, with the whole colour scheme carefully thought out.”The light display is accompanied by music composed by Londonderry musician Sharon Graham.Catherine said: “We chose Valentine’s week for the treelumination launch as we felt it was a novel way in terms of adding to the romance of walking in the moonlight, but it’s by no means just for couples, it’s designed very much as a family experience for everyone.“I think we all have a vision of apple orchards complete with apple blossom or an abundance of fruit.“This illuminations event highlights the orchards in a totally dference perspective – a raw natural resting state before the cycle of growth begins.”The light show – designed by Walter Holt of Travelling Treeluminations – is the first of its kind to be held in an orchard environment and will open to the public from today until Saturday, from pm to pm each evening at  Loughgall Road.Entry is £ per adult and £ for children. A family ticket for two adults and two children costs £.Visitors will be given the opportunity to see the pressing and blending facilities on the farm as well as taste some of the products.Artisan food will be on sale as well as some free refreshment including tea, coffee and hot chocolate. Set to benefit from the four-day event is local charity ‘Katie-Rose’s Journey’.For more information on this week’s illumination event and other aspects of the farm go to www.longmeadowcidertry catch  TrendingThree vehicle crash near PortadownPartner and child were lsquomaking too much noisersquoDiscovery of mans body sparks murder probeJail sentence for man who spat and screamed at hospital staffConcern as disabled woman who carrys oxygen tank slapped with parking ticket          ..

Do you know who I am  I’m Richard Chestnut and I know who you are.”He struck the security guard on the right eye.Defence barrister Seamus Lannon said his client was short of funds but had £ with him in court, although he had indicated to him that his might not ‘cut the mustard’.District Judge, Mrs Bernie Kelly, said Chestnut had been aware of this since November andsomeone turned up at court with the money in their pocket this was a demonstrable sign of remorse.Mr Lannon said that in the pre-sentence report his client did present himself as remorseful.He added that Chestnut had found a job involving double glazing and would be prepared to repay the money.Judge Kelly said the defendant was urinating on shelves in Tesco at seven in the evening when children, parents and grandparents could have been present.“It was a reprehensible act,” she added.PSNI warn of children staggering about drunk or choking on their own vomit Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"The judge said there was CCTV coverage and Chestnut says ‘do you know who I am’ because of the amount of alcohol he had he had a lapse of memory and didn’t know who he was.Mr Lannon said the defendant accepted he ‘behaved irresponsibility’ but was attempting to draw a line under this and make good to society.“I doubt that, not with his record and his attitude,” said Judge Kelly.She added Chestnut could not distinguish between a toilet and a set of shelves.“There could have been some wee cratur lting what they needed and he didn’t care. He was completely oblivious. You don’t go to a supermarket to watch other people use it as a toilet. You would expect most children to be potty trained by the age of two,” said the judge.She then gave the defendant the chance to come up with the money before the end of the court.Later Mr Lannon ed with the full restitution of £..For each of the offences Chestnut was sentenced to three months in prison, suspended for two years.Describing his behaviour as ‘absolutely disgraceful’ Judge Kelly warned the defendantshe ever saw him again for anything similar he was going to prison.At the same court Chestnut also pleaded guilty to driving without insurance on August  last year on the Lake Road in Craigavon.For this offence he was given three months in custody, suspended for two years, and banned from driving for  months.Judge Kelly also ordered forfeiture of the car he was driving.try catch            ..

Subject to confirmation by the all-island Single Electricity Market Committee, the auction for electricity generators to be awarded capacity contracts, on an all-island basis, has identied electricity capacityof , MW which will be in place for the year starting October ,  – , MW of that all-island total is attributed to Northern Ireland.This is a critical series of draft decisions which will reassure the large conventional generators about their contracts and will impose the discipline of revenue limits constrained by the capacity auction. The draft decisions also point to the expectations in terms of the capacity earmarked from renewable sources, from inter-connection with the Scottish grid and the capacity adjustments that may follow from demand-side adjustment contracts.SONI has not been as open and transparent as should have been possible. Readers must make the assumption that ties location to where capacity payments are identied in sterling and euro.The SONI statement lists  generator names ,  of which are identied as DSUswhich leaves  others. Eight are shown as part of the AES capacity in Ballylumford and Kilroot: four are small capacity generators, six each have capacity of over MW , and the last capacity source linked to Northern Ireland is the Moyle Interconnector.SONI does not present the capacity awards in a way that allows readers to identy the location of each successful unit.The Utility Regulator has agreed that the available Northern Ireland capacity should include  MW from the Moyle Interconnector which represents over % of locally available capacity. This is a judgement that might be queried. Is the interconnectora guaranteed source of capacity  If, at a time of peak demand in Northern Ireland, demand in the grid in GB had no spare capacity, presumably the capacity might not be available for supply to Northern Ireland. The regulator and SONI are well placed to judge the probability of this outcome and might argue that it is a minimal risk.There are some interesting features stemming from the assumptions made in setting the framework for the capacity auction. First, Northern Ireland has been treated as meriting some contract iations because of locational constraints. This is a reflection of the limited capacity of the electricity grid on the whole island to send electricity to the places where there is demand. Both the Dublin area and Northern Irelanddid not attract auction bids adequately to supply these area locational constraints. For Northern Ireland. the easy explanation lies in the absence of the long awaited north-south grid expansion from to the planned distribution hub in Co Tyrone.The capacity auction allowed for the acceptance of bids with prices which are higher than the main auction prices which would match supply and demand across the whole island. Because of the locational deficit, some Northern Ireland bids now show capacity payment prices above the all-Ireland ceiling of £, per MW which applies to most of the successful bids.In the quotation from AES for the two large fossil fuel burning units, the proposal is that they should attract payment prices of £, and £, per MW. At first sight this appears to allow a premium of nearly % on the payment price for each MW. This seems more than a marginal cost and points to the possible cost savingsthe proposed new north-south link had been operational.This answer for the older high capacity units at Kilroot is a further reflection of the doubt about the continued viability of these units. It will be remembered that a year ago, these same two units were deemed unsuccessful in the auction but, at a late stage when faced with a request for a derogation to be allowed to close these units, the initially agreed settlement was revised.A year ago, the first capacity auction under the rules of the newly instituted I-SEM, was accepted with a capacity supply of near to , MW for all of Northern Ireland. Now, in early , SONI has concluded that for security of supply Northern Ireland should contract for just under , MW. There is no obvious major uplt in demand in Northern Ireland so that, quietly, the suggestion is that the arithmetic in late  may now be thought to have been slightly too risky.The capacity auction is a fundamental building block of electricity supply policy for Northern Ireland. However, on its own, the allocation of capacity and the possible scope for investment in new generating capacity must also be seen in the context of increasing,market forces allow, the proportion of electricity supply that is supplied from renewable sources. The distribution of generating capacity is still dominated by fossil fuels. Northern Ireland’s capacity is nearly % from gas andcoal. However, the statistics showing the proportion of electricity supply from renewables points to average consumption from renewables of nearer to -%. Because of the iability in the contribution of wind based renewables, it would be hazardousgreater security dependence was allocated to renewables.In turn, the caveat about the possible role of renewables points to the possible value of further investment in energy storage for which no major scheme has been launched. If Kilroot power station survives for a further three to four years, then the experimental electricity storage capacity on that site may become an attractive asset.There are several continuing questions about Northern Ireland’s security of electricity supply. Will Kilroot be given further stays of execution after   Will the North South interconnector eventually be built  Will the proposed large natural gas burning power station be built in Belfast  Will the politically unpopular investment in anaerobic digestion plants be tackled  Will the Brexit settlement, or lack of it, damage the continued operation of the all-island single electricity market  But... it seems Kilroot has been given a temporary extension of its role in keeping the lights on.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/pmcg.jpg","title":"ryder cup legend to address belfast leadership conference","story":"Posted on Friday February  by Ulster Business Ryder Cup legend Paul McGinley has been revealed as one of the key speakers at a leadership event taking place in Belfast next month.

Its surveying team are members of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors . Nurturing talent and progression is a core principle that the firms stands for with  of their surveying staff having become qualied throughout the firm’s training program.

Day-to-day this can include everything from managing service charge budgets to maximising rental income through lease renewals and rent reviews. Another key role is to provide regular accounting and financial reports to clients.“One of my key roles is to support my agency department colleagues in their  acquisitions of investment assets and upon completion ensure that a comprehensive management regime is followed to ensure continued growth of our clients assets,” she says.“The role of a ‘property manager’ has evolved signicantly over the course of my career with much of our work now focusing on compliance and risk management. We pride ourselves on making sure our clients are well advised, mitigating any risks that may be involved with their particular property.”Some of those clients include retail sites such as Rushmere Shopping Centre in Craigavon.Gail is also one of just eight female surveyors in Northern Ireland with the designation of FRICS, a Fellow Member of RICS.“While females still only make up % of the surveying profession as a whole there are a signicant number of women working within the commercial property sector in Northern Ireland, it’s no longer a male orientated profession.”As for the business landscape Gail says that whilst there is general economic uncertainty they are seeing an increase in demand for their services as investors seek to maximisefrom their investments.“Interestingly we took on a number of new properties over the course of , often on behalf of investors who were keen to maximise rental s and ensure their property is run as efficiently as possible.”  Marian McFlynn, surveyor Since graduating from Ulster University in  with a degree in property investment and development, Marian’s career began on the other side of the globe – working for multi-billion dollar US-owned LaSalle Investment Management at its offices in Sydney.“In Sydney, as part LaSalle’s centre management team, I was responsible for leasing, marketing, administration and operation of a bulky goods shopping centre, home to over  homemaker and lestyle stores,” she says.“I ed to Northern Ireland, and joined the property and asset management department of Osborne King as a graduate surveyor in June ,” she adds. And following training, Marian became a chartered surveyor in . She’s now responsible for managing a range of commercial assets on behalf of clients. “This involves asset enhancement advice, tenant liaison, building maintenance, health and safety management, rent collection and accounting, service contract tendering and service charge administration,” she says.“I continue to build on my client and property portfolio.”And Marian also says that uncertainty hangs in the air for investors, while the ongoing lack of clarity over a post-Brexit landscape still exists.  Lisa McCaffrey, surveyorLisa has five years at Osborne King under her belt. Having graduated from the property investment and development course at Ulster University’s Jordanstown campus in , she worked at a Belfast estate agents before joining Osborne King in  becoming a chartered surveyor in .She works within the professional services team which sees her carry out valuations for a wide range of clients including private iniduals, large companies and the major lending institutions.
