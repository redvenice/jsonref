Everyone knew he messaged his \u0027favourite\u0027 girls. But it was dismissed as \u0027just Mr Belfield\u0027 and we were told to ignore it. He has so much power, nobody wanted to rock the boat.\u0027People were scared of losing their place at the school.\u0027I\u0027ve had nightmares about Mr Belfield and my mental health has got worse since I left school in May. He has messed with my head so much. Even if what he has done doesn\u0027t meet the criminal threshold, it is a massive breach of trust. I feel so let down by the council of manage-ment, everyone at the school.On one occasion, Belfield told Cat she would make \u0027a terrible girlfriend\u0027 because she is \u0027far too demanding\u0027 and that she should wait until she was 28 to get a boyfriend. He also wrote about being lonely on his trips abroad.\u0027There are so many beautiful girls here but I\u0027m faithful to my wife as I don\u0027t believe in unfaithful behaviour and I know you approve!!!,\u0027 he wrote while staying at the Ritz-Carlton in Moscow. He went on to say that when Cat got married: \u0027I will be at the wedding. You will make a lovely bride. I will be sooooo proud. It will all happen for you,\u0027 he wrote in another. \u0027I know you believe and trust me. I\u0027ll be checking you\u0027re OK throughout this holiday.

None of them are cute but every parent thinks their own one is. I favour sterilisation.\u0027He added: \u0027Any woman that has a baby and cannot properly look after it should be deported to another country and should be forcibly sterilised so they can\u0027t have any more.\u0027Cat says that when she finally told a teacher about his messages, she was told: \u0027It\u0027s just Mr Belfield being Mr Belfield.\u0027 Another told her to block him on social media.She says that when she deactivated her Instagram account, Belfield sent the school nurse to tell her he needed to be able to have contact with her. I said that he could email me but the nurse came back and said it has to be WhatsApp so he can call you or Instagram.\u0027I didn\u0027t want to give him my number so I reactivated my Instagram account.\u0027Belfield grew up in Cornwall before graduating from Trinity College, Cambridge, with a maths degree in 1994. He began teaching a year later at independent Concord College in Shrewsbury. It was there he met his wife Barbara. They married in 2001. He became head of sixth form at Ruthin School in 2001. He was made principal in 2010.When Cat finally left the school in May last year, Belfield was temporarily suspended while investigations were undertaken but returned to work in September. He hasn\u0027t been seen at the school since November last year, when the school was inspected twice by the Care Inspectorate Wales and Estyn, the Welsh Ofsted.Cat\u0027s mother Susan, a former teacher, says that after seeing the messages which had been sent to her daughter \u0027I called social services, the Care Inspectorate Wales, the Charity Commission, the Education Workforce Council and Estyn, everyone I could think of to ask why he hadn\u0027t been sacked.\u0027Social services explained that because he worked in an independent school the governors had to make that call and their hands were tied.\u0027She says she subsequently contacted the chair of the school\u0027s Council of Management, Julie Oldbury, and asked her \u0027How would you feel if it was your daughter?\u0027\u0027But all she kept saying was \u0027no comment.\u0027 \u0027The school source who spoke to the Mail said that, thanks to Belfield\u0027s success at the school, he had become virtually untouchable — and that he was \u0027a dictator who wouldn\u0027t be challenged\u0027.The source spoke of the \u0027complete control\u0027 Belfield exerted over the school, particularly given his combined roles as both head and bursar.\u0027Because he manages the money as well, he has control over everything,\u0027 says the source. \u0027He is like a kingpin between the Council of Management and the rest of the school and it was just him in the middle speaking for both sides. He has made himself indispensable.\u0027The inspection report by Care Inspectorate Wales last week concluded the school was being run by an \u0027autocratic and controlling management\u0027.This week, Estyn also published a report of their findings after their \u0027unannounced focused visit\u0027 in November, saying the role of the principal \u0027is not defined precisely so it is not clear to what extent the principal is exempt from specific guidelines and why this should be the case, how the principal is held to account and consequently what the principal can and cannot do\u0027.The Council of Management welcomed the publication of the reports and said in a statement that it \u0027has been working tirelessly to ensure both reports\u0027 recommendations are implemented and has been carrying out a root-and-branch strategic review of its safeguarding governance and safeguarding arrangements, and that is continuing.\u0027The school is determined to ensure all appropriate steps are taken. In response to the Estyn report, the Council of Management produced a comprehensive action plan to address the shortcomings identified, and other areas of improvement. This was submitted to the Welsh government on January 17 for approval.\u0027Belfield appears to have relished the control he has exercised at the school. \u0027I have complete authority,\u0027 he wrote in one of his messages to Cat. \u0027I can do whatever I like. I can go to any country I feel like. I\u0027m creating a new school piece by piece. By the time I retire I will have created something forever — and I will be remembered for many years!!!\u0027"},{"url":null,"title":"Got Brexit UK finally leaves EU Britons country celebrate","story":"Share this article              Mr Johnson signed the ratified Withdrawal Agreement last week in another highly symbolic step towards BrexitJanuary 24: Mr Johnson signs the ratified Withdrawal Agreement in another highly symbolic step. January 29: MEPs approve the Withdrawal Agreement by 621 to 49.

Thousands of miles away in Central America, KMS earned more dirty money, this time from the American government. It was 1984, the height of the Cold War, and the Reagan administration was obsessed with removing Nicaragua’s Marxist Sandinista government. The former US President is pictured aboveLandon, whose son Arthur is a socialite and friend of Princes William and Harry, was on close terms with Thatcher, which may have dissuaded concerned mandarins in Whitehall — the previous Labour government had considered banning all mercenary companies — from kicking up a fuss.KMS also had a friend in Lord Royle, the Tory vice-chairman in the Eighties, who acted as its informal link with the Foreign Office. But for all its links to people in high places, not every KMS trooper was comfortable with its blatant disregard for military ethics.One KMS contractor who couldn’t turn a blind eye to the mercenary group’s atrocities was former SAS trooper Robin Horsfall, a veteran of the Iranian embassy siege operation in London in 1980.He accepted a KMS job in Sri Lanka in 1986 aged 27 after working as a bodyguard for Harrods owner Mohamed Al-Fayed.Imagining KMS to be a responsible organisation, he hoped it would be different to the ‘Dogs Of War’-style mercenary outfits that had rampaged through Angola and the Congo in the Sixties and Seventies.But after just four months as a battle school commander in Sri Lanka, he quit, appalled at the ethnic slaughter taking place around him. The tipping point came when a South African helicopter pilot described to him how his Sri Lankan door gunner had on one occasion mown down every living creature in sight.However, when asked by the Mail about what he witnessed, Mr Horsfall insisted that he does not believe former British military personnel were directly involved in war crimes — as they themselves didn’t fire weapons at civilians.‘I have no knowledge of that and never heard of anything like it —and I’m sure I would have heard,’ he says. ‘But there is no doubt that the Sinhalese commanders perpetrated genocide against the Tamils.’By 1985, KMS’s name curiously disappeared from government documents, but its subsidiary company, Saladin Security — founded in 1978 by Walker — lives on, and to this day has strong links with Saudi Arabia’s despotic regime.And what of those who made money from their involvement in these secretive wars?Major Baty lives in retirement in England. When visited by Miller and asked about his role in the dirty war in Sri Lanka, his reply was short and to the point: ‘Bugger off!’As for Walker, he re-invented himself as, of all things, a local Tory councillor on Elmbridge Council in Surrey for a time.Before his election, he reportedly told voters that he was ‘a man of action’ and involved in ‘defence matters at a national level’.In 2017, on learning of a ceremony commemorating the STF, he penned a letter to its then commandant, praising its founders.Describing Keenie Meenie’s role in Sri Lanka from 1983, he wrote: ‘It continues to be a matter of great pride that I frequently heard STF described as the most effective force in the country.’‘Effective’ is one way to describe it.

However, the fashion industry is trailing behind supermarkets, where one in five of all new products launched last year were vegan.The new guidelines for producing vegan fashion have been drawn up by the British Retail Consortium (BRC), the trade body for stores and online sellers, after it was inundated with requests from fashion buyers trying to source vegan products for the first time.The process is more complex than just eliminating popular materials such as leather, suede and wool. Businesses must examine every material used in a product, including the ingredients of the glues, dyes and waxes used.The BRC warns retailers they should should not claim a product is sustainable simply because it is vegan – a definition that means only the product contains no animal-derived materials or ingredients.Vegan-labelled items should also be providing an alternative to something that is traditionally made with animal products.The ethical retail market, which s everything from food and drink to cosmetics, was worth more than £40bn by the end of 2018. That compares to about £11bn 20 years ago, according to an annual study by the Co-op.While eating ethically – a banner that covers Fairtrade, organic, vegetarian and plant-based alternatives – has taken off, the clothing market has been a laggard. Ethical fashion spending is only £50m, which is a fraction of the £35bn fashion market (although sales of vintage and secondhand clothing have rocketed).\u0027Fast fashion\u0027 is a phrase coined to describe inexpensive clothing produced rapidly by mass-market retailers in response to the latest trends. Critics say that the industry has a large carbon footprint,\u0026nbspand creates water and air pollution. Clothes are often manufactured in poor working conditions.Garments are manufactured cheaply, and are expected to have a short life. One in three young women, the biggest segment of consumers,\u0026nbspconsider garments worn once or twice to be\u0026nbspold. UK consumers sent 300,000 tonnes of textiles to be burned or dumped in landfill in 2018.Without rapid reform, the fashion industry - of which fast fashion is the dominant player – could be responsible for\u0026nbspa quarter of the Earth’s carbon budget by 2050.The Mintel study found that more than a third of fashion shoppers would like to spend their money in stores that did not use animal products. This trend has not gone unnoticed by retailers battling for sales: half of Marks \u0026amp Spencer’s shoes are now vegan and three of its top 10 bestselling bags this winter were also vegan.Chana Baram, a retail analyst at Mintel, said: “It’s no longer enough for clothing to be priced well or to reference the latest trends. Many young people today are likely to be influenced by the ‘Attenborough’ or ‘Greta’ effects and are becoming far more aware of the negative effects of fast fashion.”The Scottish tights brand Snag, which only launched 20 months ago, is on track to hit sales of £20m this year. Its founder, Brie Read, says its tights, which are vegan and come in rainbow colours, have struck a chord with women frustrated by ill-fitting, conservative hosiery.Read says it was an active choice to ensure its products were vegan – some fashion is by accident rather than design. “For us, it was dyes,” she explained. “A lot of them are not vegan friendly because they are made out of crushed beetles. We have to be careful about the dyeing process and getting really good cotton.”Snag’s business model involves interacting every day with potential shoppers on social media. “We’re very much based around our customers and lots of them are vegan and concerned about ethics,” Read said. “They ask us every single day: ‘Are your tights vegan?’”Mintel found that shoppers were confused by conflicting messages regarding what is, and is not, sustainable, and that the fashion business needed to develop industry-wide best practice guidelines."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d3f1ee88c4eb92660fbacbd2792aa0612f769088/0_134_4104_2463/master/4104.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4861d9533a99accdb055e2fbe4149831","title":"britain beauty test cities countryside planners","story":"If adopted, proposals for the rural and urban environment could see the greatest reordering of public space in 70 yearsSeldom does a philosopher get to rule. Now one does – if, sadly, posthumously. The late Roger Scruton’s government-backed report on “building better, building beautiful” is political philosophy in the raw. It comes hot on the heels of the government’s agriculture bill proposing a complete shift in farm support away from food and into “public money for public goods”. If adopted, these twin pillars of rural and urban environment could see the greatest reordering of Britain’s public face in the 75 years since the war. They are both about that most elusive concept, beauty.The farm bill remains opaque. The 1947 Town and Country Planning Act, which separated towns from countryside as an inherent “good”, all but collapsed under David Cameron’s developer-driven government. It delivered sheds, hypermarkets and housing estates sprawling unplanned round almost every town in southern England. It turned communities into raging nimbys, and planning decisions into court cases. Rules on everything from tower blocks to expanded villages were made so uncertain that planning defaulted to anyone who could afford a lawyer.Post-Brexit, farm subsidies will now go to “land management”. This is ill-defined but rumoured to embrace soil quality, woodland and wildlife protection, rewilding and public access. There is no sign as yet that ministers will decide how much of Britain’s countryside the public will be allowed to treat as beautiful. But that surely is a “public good”. We now need only an Aristotle to stride the land.As for buildings, we now have an Aristotle. Scruton is not afraid to summon the names of Kant and Stendhal to his cause. No, he says, beauty is not “subjective”. We can tell it from ugliness because we can debate and agree or disagree about it. This is not a matter of free markets but of market regulation. As Scruton says, we are democrats, local as well as national. We have a duty to one another and our children to protect and promote public beauty. That this should come from a philosopher of the right is the more welcome.Scruton’s report is co-authored by Nicholas Boys Smith of the consultancy Create Streets. It opens with a devastating critique of the Cameron government’s 2012 planning framework. It left a landscape “littered with debris”, a planning regime “biased towards ugliness” and a public that has “lost confidence in developers and their regulators”. The report cites a planning inspector allowing windowless flats in Watford, knowing they would be instant slums, because he “lacked grounds for their refusal”. This is planning in a state of collapse.For the moment, development is driven by the same absurd machismo typified by HS2, a belief that prosperity lies in centralism, bigness, disruption and public extravagance. Small and local is for wimps. Beauty is for herbivores. The so-called national infrastructure commission is not a regulator but a lobby for the “big eight” building contractors and their grand projects.It is refreshing to read a Whitehall report that gets the message of America’s Ed Glaeser and others, that “green means urban”. Happiness lies not in anonymous sprawl but in the adaption and intensification of existing city buildings. New York has the lowest per-capita carbon footprint in the US. The report advocates the “gentle densification” of Britain’s underoccupied cities. West Yorkshire has 2,400 mills lying vacant, offering 52,000 new homes. Britain’s low property taxes effectively subsidise emptiness, which in London – with one of Europe’s lowest densities – conceals potential homes for “millions more households”.There is no mystery about what people find beautiful. A Mori survey for the report found they wanted “vernacular and human scale”. They hated towers, though they did not mind high density. Indeed, the highest London densities are not in tower block estates but in Victorian street terraces. The most popular urban neighbourhoods are in tightly packed old parts of towns, in London’s Soho and Shoreditch, in Manchester’s northern quarter and Birmingham’s Jewellery Quarter, in Hebden Bridge and Halifax. Here are buildings designed to last. As the report says: “The beautiful building is one that outlives its original use.”The report is not anti-development. It rather demands that promoting beauty be explicit in planning control – and ugliness explicit in refusing consent. It proposes meticulous and specific changes in regulations. Communities should be empowered to vote down ugliness. Builders should know what is allowed and not allowed, to speed up their work. They should be steered towards popular urban forms, such as streets, squares, shops, trees and water, to the “fine-grained city”. There is even a suggestion of a fruit tree for every house and bricks for birds and bees. Scruton does twee.We have yet to see what “public goods” are envisaged for Britain’s farmland and countryside. But for towns and cities, Scruton and Boys Smith have demanded a total reversal of policy. A blueprint of passionate intensity, for a dignified and democratic planning regime. The opposition will be fierce. As the urban and rural landscape already demonstrates, builders have grown used to getting their way.A measure of the task can be seen this week in Norwich. Here an inquiry is sitting into the crudest imaginable 20-storey tower block, planned to rise over the city centre and leer at its ancient cathedral. There is not another city in Europe that would even think of permitting such an outrage. That is the challenge Scruton bequeaths us."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/77d5d5d73851d42da26a7ffa44145aac8a6d95c3/0_116_4856_2914/master/4856.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8f25505e9bdf7b1abd8d307e2ee0e1e8","title":"trade unions workplace local chicago teachers","story":"Connecting trade unions to community causes can be highly effective – just look at the success of Chicago’s teachersLast week, a Freedom of Information request revealed an historic no-strike deal between the trade union GMB and outsourcing conglomerate G4S. This isn’t surprising, given the decline in union membership and power over the past 40 years due to deindustrialisation and legislative attacks. Today, many unions are on the defensive, narrowly focusing on agreeing union recognition and consolidating their power base, rather than working directly with employees in the workplace to fight for issues that matter to them.But there’s a way to turn the tide on decades of decline and reinvigorate unions as vehicles for change in the workplace and the wider community. In the US this has taken the form of “bargaining for the common good”, where unions use strike action to lift up community concerns outside the workplace, going far beyond the traditional demands of wages, benefits and job security.The Chicago Teachers Union (CTU) coordinated strike action with the union representing school support staff. It also formed alliances with groups outside the workplace, such as with Black Lives Matter, in a shared recognition that “education justice is racial justice”. In a school district where nearly half of students are Latinx and nearly one in five don’t have English as a first language, the CTU demanded new guarantees for bilingual education. It called for more dedicated teachers for English language learners, and a declaration that Chicago schools are sanctuary spaces for students who are immigrants, Muslims or LGBTQI+. The union also demanded reduced class sizes, as well as a nurse, counsellor, librarian and social worker in every school. Most ambitiously, it demanded an expansion of affordable housing for educators, students and parents.Unions in the UK can learn from the strategy of the CTU by moving towards a form of unionism which focuses on organising workers from the ground up, as well as aligning work-based organising with broader campaigns. Larger unions could look to actively organising social care workers to fight for better pay and conditions, as well as lower staff-to-patient ratios. In this way, unions could unify the interests of workers, people receiving care and the public, fighting for a social care system that treats its workers well and provides quality care and dignity later on in life. Even more ambitiously, care workers could align their interests with the hundreds of thousands of climate strikers to recognise that a sustainable economy will be built on low-carbon jobs like care work.It’s not too late to halt the decline of trade unions. “Social movement unionism” could form the basis of a new model of organising, expanding beyond the workplace and integrating other struggles and movements, as part of a broader attempt to rebalance power in the economy.Historically, unions have been the most important progressive force ensuring we have a society and an economy that works for the majority of people. Union wins are things we take for granted today, including the two-day weekend, paid annual leave, paid parental leave, equal pay rights, and much else besides. New Economics Foundation (NEF) research has also shown that unions are an essential part of a well-functioning economy through bargaining for higher wages, which in turn drives national income more than growing company profits. Trade unions are vital to a good economy, so it’s important to make them as effective as possible.In an economy that is failing the majority of people, we need trade unions who are willing to look beyond their base and engage with wider societal struggles.• Aidan Harper is a researcher at the New Economics Foundation"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/32da93ac2401785d863deeaa5754a12a6e584847/0_318_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0e5738e087c84421c339af51c319d749","title":"brexit midsummer nights dream politicians","story":"It unearthed some of the worst people in the country – on both sides. And the worst of all were the politiciansTonight’s Parliament Square party to mark Brexit was hit by a ban on booze, live music and fireworks – the first three in a presumably infinite series of things that we now won’t be able to blame on boring Brussels bureaucrats. Right about now, you’re probably starting to think “Oh my God … what if … what if we were the bastards all along?” Crazy as it may seem on this day of national emancipation, it’s just possible that one day we might yearn to be plugged back into the matrix where it was all someone else’s fault.Still, to the victor go the spoils. Brexit is done, except for the many big bits that aren’t. All UK humans must absorb the sledgehammer implication of the fact that a man with the mind and moral stature of Nigel Farage is far and away the most successful politician of his generation. Like Farage said last week: “Unless this government drops the ball, and I don’t think it will, you will never, ever see me again.” And like he said this week: “I look forward to a new role with Newsweek, where I shall be commenting on the battles ahead.”Either way, there are indications that the curtain between reality and metaphor has been finally rent. Consider the fact that on Brexit eve, Farage stood in what appeared to be a London restaurant’s attic and unveiled a hideous portrait of himself. Instead of being accompanied by a brilliant Wildean dandy saying things like, “Nigel – you are the type of what the age is searching for, and what it is afraid it has found!”, Farage was instead introduced by occasional Dubai émigré Jim Davidson, who made a joke about France that I can’t lavish a keystroke on. Trivia completists may care to know the title of Nigel’s portrait was Mr Brexit, and not 55?!?!?! – Fuck Me, He Had A Hard Paper Round.To mark the occasion, the government has newly minted, or reminted, a special Brexit 50p coin. If you get one, hang on to it – it might be worth something one day. Something like 20 euro cents. Or 1600th of a threadworm tablet under the new US-friendly drug pricing. When coming up with their big Brexit marker, it’s interesting that the Tory right decided to go with pieces of silver, a concept closely associated with historic betrayal. Perhaps they’re trying to reclaim it for themselves, along with Calais, and the idea it’s fine to say the N-word because rappers do it.They’re certainly using the moment as a fundraising opportunity, and have spent much of the week acting as a sort of off-brand Franklin Mint. Tuesday’s big push alerted buyers to their range of Brexit “merch”, which is exactly how the target market for this stuff talks. A second drive offered people the chance to “own Brexit” in the form of a copy of the withdrawal agreement signed by Boris Johnson. Tickets for the draw are £5. It’s a lovely idea – and is it scalable? Even now, perhaps one of the oddballs hired by Dominic Cummings is working out whether you could technically fund a new hospital by selling copies of the statement “I will build a new hospital” signed by Boris Johnson. Soon enough, the dominant form of intranational trade in the UK will be the exchange of items signed by Boris Johnson. Johnson has long been aware of the value of his signature, which is why he has avoided flooding the market by withholding it from a number of birth certificates.In terms of economic prospects, meanwhile, it’s a huge psychological boost for Brexit that most of Britain’s newspapers are in favour of it. Remember: always take business advice from journalists, the runaway market leaders in the poorly managed decline sector. Brexit could be the UK pivoting to video. To get a visual feel for what the  calls “the glorious future”, go online and try loading a  story. People call Brexit a project of false nostalgia, which here feels right: Renaissance masterpieces were actually downloaded on to canvas quicker than an article headlined “DI TOLD ME BREXIT WON’T AFFECT MY HOUSE PRICE”.But here we all are. That was the Brexit that was. And what was it? It had the mad energy of A Midsummer Night’s Dream but went on for three and a half years. The sheer litany of WTF-ery that occurred would take precisely three and a half years to recount. At one point Michael Howard threatened war with Spain. It was the golden age of television drama, but people instead found themselves watching BBC Parliament in the evenings, initially capable of making wan comparisons with Game of Thrones but eventually lacking the energy to do anything but wish a dragonfire apocalypse on everyone involved.It certainly unearthed some of the worst people in the country. On both sides, let’s be honest. By the time we were a few months in, most of the haute remainers could make you turn hard Brexit whenever they appeared on the news. Just as Donald Trump would be richer if he’d simply invested his inheritance in a tracker fund and done nothing, it feels likely that the leading forces of remain would have been in better shape three years into the horror show if they’d taken a vow of silence on 24 June 2016 and stopped trying to “help”.For my money the Brexiteers were even worse, but others will argue we’re comparing Aids with syphilis. The second I saw Pimlico Plumbers boss Charlie Mullins (remain) park for one Brexit high court challenge by mounting his personalised-plated Bentley on the pavement, I immediately channelled arms and strategic intelligence to pro-Brexit contras.To each remainer their Brexit analogue. Charlie’s was Wetherspoons boss Tim Martin, a man who looks like a cautionary tale about his own pubs. Or take Brexiteer James Dyson (actually, I think Singapore already has). Dyson, as we never stopped hearing, is an inventor – a term that apparently allows him to walk through the same door as the creators of the steam engine and radio. Naturally, I yield to no one in my admiration for minor hand-dryer improvements. But Dyson basically does things that blow or suck, doesn’t he? Maybe that’s why he was drawn to Brexit.Needless to say, the absolute worst people of all were the politicians, from the sensationally limited Theresa May to supply cult-leader Jeremy Corbyn, via committed anti-elitist Jacob Rees-Mogg, reservist idiot Mark Francois, and so on via a gazillion Tory wingnuts to the ghastly John Bercow – accused of multiple instances of bullying – whose lionised impunity served as a useful “how radicalised are you?” test for remainers.The ultimate victor, pyrrhic or not, was Boris Johnson. On the day of withdrawal, then, I guess the key philosophical question is: how can something whose own internal logic made Boris Johnson prime minister be wrong?From his days as the ’s Brussels fabulist, Brexit has been an end-to-end service by Johnson, who you’d think ought to look happier about it. But as tonight’s broadcast will unwittingly show, emotion is his phantom limb – which he feels the twitch of occasionally but primarily experiences as a sort of yawning absence assuageable only by the usual temporary fixes.He does not appear to be a man who enjoys a short leash, which is perhaps why he has set the clock on himself for the trade negotiations, to introduce some of the jeopardy he has historically sought out in other pursuits. But no longer. Boris Johnson must now play the Henry V to his own Falstaff, which is his tragedy. We all have to watch, which is ours."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/35cc262888549a150d30de1502a78d0e8fa85b9e/656_362_4718_2831/master/4718.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=69e261439da6d0684268d3b9825f55ce","title":"cropped out climate activist vanessa nakate urges media to hear africans","story":"Ugandan activist says she hopes storm over Davos photo will help shift narrativeThe Ugandan climate activist who was cropped out of a press photo in Davos has said many African activists experience the same erasure but feel unable to speak up.The Associated Press apologised last week after it cropped Vanessa Nakate out of a photo she had posed for alongside fellow activists Greta Thunberg, Loukina Tille, Luisa Neubauer and Isabelle Axelsson.At a Fridays For Future press conference in Stockholm on Friday, the 23-year-old said: “This is something that has been going on for a long while and African activists are trying so hard to be heard. It gets so frustrating when no one really cares.” She said she had received messages from other activists who had experienced similar things but were too scared to speak out or who did not receive much attention when they did.“It’s really sad that the incident happened,” she said. “But when I look at it in a more positive way, it has actually made the world set their eyes on the activists in Africa and try as much as possible to listen to their stories. So I’m actually very optimistic about this and I believe that it is going to change the stories of different climate activists in Africa.”Nakate joined the press conference by videolink along with other African climate activists.Thunberg said at the event: “It’s quite obvious I get a certain kind of media attention. If I say something, it turns into a headline. Of course, that is not the case for pretty much all other climate activists, especially from the global south, unfortunately.”Speaking of what happened to Nakate at Davos, Thunberg said: “Since Vanessa is my friend, it was very hard to see what she had to experience there, and we tried to support each other through that.”Makenna Muigai, an activist from Nairobi, Kenya, told the press conference: “Africa at large is being affected by the negative impacts of climate change. A great example is the locust infestation in east Africa, which will soon lead to food insecurity. The sad thing is, lots of people from western countries are unaware as to why this is happening.”Ndoni Mcunu, a climate scientist from the Global Change Institute at the University of the Witwatersrand in South Africa, highlighted how the continent was already feeling the impact of the climate crisis."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6caddb9759b9968003e022181e4386b1ea1e00d7/0_159_4724_2835/master/4724.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4366075dc43fdce44c30602cf0ab1315","title":"former energy minister removed as un climate talks chair","story":"Source says officials in COP26 unit could not work with Claire O’Neill in run-up to Glasgow talksClaire O’Neill, the former UK energy minister who was to lead the UN climate talks this year in Glasgow, has been removed from the post.Her sacking comes as Boris Johnson prepares to launch the UK’s strategy for hosting November’s crunch climate talks, known as COP26.O’Neill, under her Twitter handle of @COP26President, wrote on Friday evening: “Very sad that the role I was offered by Boris Johnson last year has now been rescinded as Whitehall ‘can’t cope’ with an indy COP unit. A shame we haven’t had one climate cabinet meeting since we formed. Wishing the COP team every blessing in the climate recovery emergency.”The dramatic last-minute change of plan follows murmurings over the past month that O’Neill, known under her previous married name of Perry when she was a minister, lacked the gravitas for one of the most important jobs in international politics this year.A source in the COP26 unit said: “Claire has seriously underperformed, including at Davos and on a recent ministerial visit to India. She had said ‘the Paris agreement is dead’ in key meetings to the surprise of everyone.“She didn’t seem to get that this is a diplomatic job. The senior team of officials in the unit couldn’t work with her and her erratic behaviour and poor performance has spooked key stakeholders in the UK and internationally. She had to go. The PM now needs to show he is taking this seriously by appointing a heavy-hitting minister.”Achieving the consensus needed among world governments will be a mammoth task – many countries, including the US, Brazil, Saudi Arabia and Russia, are now hostile to the Paris agreement, and others including China and India have been unwilling to make big new public commitments under the accord.O’Neill’s previous experience peaked at junior minister, which was regarded by some diplomats as not enough to gain her the respect needed to get meetings with premiers and top officials around the world.Observers of the UN talks interpreted her removal as a sign that Johnson was taking COP26 more seriously. He will make his first public intervention on the issue next Tuesday, when he will launch the UK’s COP26 strategy, at an event with Sir David Attenborough, the climate expert Lord Stern, the outgoing governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, the UN’s climate chief, Patricia Espinosa, and a host of dignitaries.“A good COP president makes all the difference between success and failure,” said one former high-level diplomat and COP veteran. “They direct the negotiations, they play the key role in determining the outcome.”Tom Burke, the co-founder of the environmental group E3G, said he thought that either William Hague or Michael Howard, both former Conservative party leaders, could be possible choices to replace O’Neill. “If this is a sign that the government really wants to signal its intent to make a success of COP26, it has to appoint some more senior people, and those two candidates come to mind,” he said.The Cabinet Office, which has been leading on the COP26 talks, declined to say whether a successor had been chosen. There have been rumours among climate activists that Zac Goldsmith could take on the role, and O’Neill’s tweet appeared to suggest that responsibility for COP26 could be taken away from the Cabinet Office.The Cabinet Office put out a statement: “Claire Perry O’Neill will no longer be UK COP26 president. The prime minister is grateful to Claire for her work preparing for what will be a very successful and ambitious climate change summit in Glasgow in November. Preparations will continue at pace for the summit, and a replacement will be confirmed shortly. Going forward, this will be a ministerial role.”That could leave the way open for a House of Lords appointee.Responsibility for the UK’s participation in the annual talks was previously held by the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, after the closure of the Department of Energy and Climate Change.Another COP expert said whoever took on the job must have the clear and public backing of the prime minister, and that Johnson must take a much stronger public role on the issue.In her parliamentary career, O’Neill was best known for having to apologise when, unable to catch the Speaker’s eye, she wondered aloud in the House of Commons to whom she needed to “give a blowjob” in order to get her say.She also issued a putdown to David Davis when he confused her with another female Tory minister, Caroline Nokes. Referring to Davis’s previous campaigning slogan, she is reported to have told him: “David, let me help you: Caroline is a C cup, I am a double D.”Her exuberant manner also led to trouble. In November 2018, three unions wrote to BEIS, where she was a minister, to raise allegations of shouting and bullying civil servants.O’Neill started out as a political radical. The environmentalist George Monbiot recalls her at Brasenose College, Oxford, where she studied geography, as “a leftwing firebrand who wanted to overthrow capitalism and nationalise the banks. She was impressive and persuasive, and had some influence on my thinking. You can imagine my disappointment when she took a City job and became a Tory.”She entered parliament with the coalition government in 2010, her no-nonsense approach belying the patronising “Cameron cutie” label.O’Neill announced her decision to resign as an MP last September, citing the pressures of the COP26 presidency, and she stood down in December’s election. That left her free to jet to foreign capitals, but outside cabinet discussions.Johnson’s government is vulnerable to charges that ministers are not prepared to make the hard decisions required against vested interests in fossil fuels and finance.

It would be a fitting reward for the country’s endlessly innovative film industryWhen Parasite director Bong Joon-ho got started on a story idea based on his twentysomething experiences as a tutor to Seoul’s super rich, doubtless ending up in the Oscar race for the best picture was not on his radar. No Korean film in history had even been nominated in the foreign language category, let alone for the biggest award of them all. But his uproarious but sorrowful class comedy about the Parks, a working-class Seoul family who infiltrate a well-to-do household by masquerading as private tutors and servants, became a stealth hit with US audiences. Before you knew it, he was on Jimmy Fallon, then skating through awards season, catching trophy after trophy. Now, with Oscars night looming, Bong’s film is up for honours in six categories, and, along with the much-fancied 1917, is considered a frontrunner for the top prize.If Parasite wins best picture it will be overdue recognition for the creative hothouse that is South Korean cinema. In two decades, it has become pound-for-pound the most dynamic and original film industry on the planet, a home for muscular mainstream directors such as Bong and The Handmaiden director Park Chan-wook, but also festival-circuit favourites Hong Sang-soo, Kim Ki-duk and Burning director Lee Chang-dong.This tonal pileup, visible in different measures in the work of many other directors, might be seen as a kind of reaction to the jarring upheavals of the country’s recent history. Oh Dae-su’s imprisonment s from 1988, South Korea’s first full year of republican democracy, to 2003. In that time, the country had undergone a blazing entry into free-market capitalism, blotting out the preceding, darker period of military rule. Had South Korea, like Oh Dae-su, collectively experienced a blackout, a refusal to reckon with the meaning of these changes? The country’s film-makers have determined not to do the same grappling with these social conditions arguably helped give birth to the country’s phenomenal cinema. They were also aided by a generous screen quota that, until 2006, required cinemas to show homegrown films for 146 days per year.The same conflicted outlook is visible at the start of Lee Chang-dong’s majestic 1999 feature Peppermint Candy. A suicidal businessman bellows wildly on a riverbank as his former friends ignore him and sing a nostalgic song – before the film goes backwards in time, through the boom years omitted by Oldboy, to discover what unhinged him.Many Korean new wave (or hallyu) directors inhabit this zone of tonal overlap. The likes of Bong, Park and Kang Je-gyu (who directed thriller Shiri, the country’s first big domestic blockbuster) emerged from the period of 1980s civic turmoil that ended the military dictatorship. They were all members of the university cine-clubs that showed films banned under censorship laws, on campuses boiling over with pro-democracy fervour. Hence the taste for exploring off-limits parts of the national psyche, such as the resurgent South Korean industry’s obsession with the schism with the communist North, as seen in Park’s breakout film Joint Security Area, about a shooting in the demilitarised zone, Shiri, in which communist sleeper agents plant bombs in Seoul, and Kang’s Korean war blockbuster Taegukgi.That obsession has now faded, but not the strain of pungent social commentary that is the Korean trademark, as US newcomers to Bong’s work are discovering. Memories of Murder, his 2003 masterpiece, used the great unsolved saga of the 1980s Hwaseong serial murders to indict dictatorship-era brutality and incompetence. Even his ostensibly popcorn creature feature The Host, from 2006, sneaks some in: it is an American scientist who dumps the chemicals in the Han river that create the film’s rampaging mutant catfish, surely a sly dig at the US military presence on the peninsula. With his English-language features Snowpiercer and Okja (which starred such western A-listers as Chris Evans, Tilda Swinton and Jake Gyllenhaal), he has worked within the belly of the hyper-capitalist US blockbuster beast, but always while poking it satirically from the inside. Other South Korean film-makers have explored the same themes: the feeling that US-style capitalism has poisoned the country can be gleaned from the likes of the 2011 animation King of Pigs, about brutal competition in schools, or Lee’s massively acclaimed Burning, from 2018, about an aspiring novelist’s frenemy relationship with a Gangnam playboy.But it is also the same corporate ideology, and the strong commercial ethic it put in place, that has given South Korea a seemingly endless procession of masterful genre film-makers: from Bong and Park to Kim Jee-woon (the ultra-violent revenge thriller I Saw the Devil) to Yeon Sang-ho (Train to Busan, a zombie-carriage rampage with a class consciousness to rival Bong’s Snowpiercer) to the current new hope Na Hong-jin (the astonishing rural exorcism thriller The Wailing).The secret is now out. Following the 2007 reduction in the screen quota, some of the original momentum has inevitably been lost. Bong and Park are now international players, with English-language suitors aplenty. But if Bong – after making two English-language features – had to go back to his native country to make the sharpest possible statement on inequality, winning big at the Oscars would be the ultimate vindication that audiences are prepared to follow. The local is the universal, after all. Or as Bong puts it: “We all live in the same country now: capitalism.”Parasite is in cinemas from Friday 7 February"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/92972bee6d658d65e0564281907eb0ccc209a453/87_0_1937_1162/master/1937.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=53ae05999afd290c039e3807ad5a400a","title":"studio ghibli netflix streaming back catalogue guide anime films","story":"The Japanese anime house has listened to its fans and finally released its back catalogue for streaming. Time to e inNetflix concentrates so much of its promotional effort on pushing its original content – particularly at Oscar time, with The Irishman, Marriage Story and multiple documentaries among its films hoping to grab some gold next weekend – that you wouldn’t usually expect one of its archive acquisitions to get the biggest streaming-related headlines of the year so far. But it’s indicative of the global, generation-crossing adoration for Japan’s Studio Ghibli animation house that its new agreement with Netflix is, in all senses, a very big deal.Impatient acolytes will remember that Ghibli and the streaming world were at an impasse for several years, with the studio preferring not to make most of its back catalogue available for digital distribution – encouraging fans to buy its pristine Blu-ray releases instead. It’s Netflix, unsurprisingly, that has broken the barrier. “In this day and age, there are various great ways a film can reach audiences,” said Ghibli producer Toshio Suzuki. “We’ve listened to our fans and have made the definitive decision to stream our film catalogue.”It’s an apt enough way to celebrate the creative resurgence of a studio that threatened to shutter production in 2014: its most lauded director, Hayao Miyazaki, has emerged from retirement to make a new film, How Do You Live?, though reports suggest it’s some way from completion. While we wait for that, 21 of Ghibli’s films will be exclusively added to Netflix’s streaming library, in all territories except the US, Canada and Japan. (Rare are the moments we get streaming access to something over Americans: let’s smugly enjoy this one.) They can be watched in the original Japanese with subtitles, or dubbed into 20 other languages – adult purists and very small fry are thus equally well served.The films are being unloaded on to Netflix in three batches of seven, over three months. The first have just landed, and already includes some of the studio’s most beloved classics. It’s practically inconceivable that any modern-day childhood could be completed without a viewing of Hayao Miyazaki’s My Neighbour Totoro, the most pure-souled and joyful of all Ghibli films: perceptively humane but dusted in real magic, its story of young girls escaping into the spirit world to help them through a parent’s illness remains bewitching at any age.Miyazaki’s Kiki’s Delivery Service, with its cheery tale of whimsical witchery, also sits at the sweeter end of the Ghibli spectrum, but another Miyazaki, Porco Rosso, ranks among their most spectacularly eccentric works: a daftly comic, skewed-to-adults romp about a first world war fighter pilot turned bounty hunter turned oddly debonair pig. (It’s one that’s actually worth watching in both the Japanese and English versions, since Michael Keaton’s offbeat, dashing voice work as our bacony hero is rather inspired.)The introductory collection also includes a fourth Miyazaki title, Castle in the Sky, which was also the first feature Ghibli produced, in 1986. Its blend of elaborate, child’s-eye fantasy and steampunk styling isn’t the most polished in its catalogue, but it’s a rich, ambitious blueprint for the kind of world-building it would refine in future. Miyazaki’s son Goro directed 2006’s Tales from Earthsea, a busy, dragon-powered saga based on Ursula K Le Guin’s popular Earthsea novels. It’s one of Ghibli’s less engaging adventures and not where any novice should start, though completists will be glad it’s included.Two less obvious selections in the first group, however, are highly rewarding. Isao Takahata’s lovely, mellow Only Yesterday dispenses with fantasy for a wistfully grownup portrait of a lonely city woman taking stock of her life over a country holiday if Yasujirō Ozu had made cartoons, they might have been something like this one. It’s less emotionally acute, but Tomomi Mochizuki’s rarely screened Ocean Waves is likewise a gentle, mature character study, centred on the dynamics of a teenage love triangle.Devotees of Miyazaki’s two most canonised works, the majestic, fantastical war epic Princess Mononoke and the Oscar-winning, shape-shifting fairytale Spirited Away, will have to wait until 1 March, when they’ll hit Netflix along with the considerable bounty of The Tale of the Princess Kaguya, Arrietty, The Cat Returns, My Neighbours the Yamadas and Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind. April, finally, will bring The Wind Rises, Howl’s Moving Castle, Pom Poko, When Marnie Was There, From Up on Poppy Hill, Ponyo and Whisper of the Heart.Miss Americana(Netflix)More than just fan-service fluff – though obviously fans will thrill to it – Lana Wilson’s documentary detailing the construction and reconstruction of Taylor Swift as a pop icon and political influencer is both a fascinating insight into the machine and a sympathetic showcase for her gifts.Judy(Fox, 12)Speaking of the machine, this bittersweet biopic of Judy Garland at the exhausted tail-end of her life satisfyingly balances showbiz razzle-dazzle with solemn awareness of the industry abuse she endured, while Renée Zellweger’s Oscar-bound performance is more concerned with emotional empathy than hollow imitation.Boyz N the Hood(Sony, 15)A sharp 4K high-definition Blu-ray re-release for the late John Singleton’s taut, tough-minded, still-exhilarating study of young black masculinity under fire in the South Central neighbourhood of Los Angeles.

Add the mirin, vinegar and salt, and cook for 20 minutes more, by which time the cabbage should be caramelised and very tender.While the cabbage is cooking, get the soup base started. In a medium saucepan, bring one and a half litres of water to a boil, lower the heat to a whisper, add the kombu and simmer for 10 minutes. Carefully remove the kombu with a pair of tongs and discard. Whisk the miso, soy sauce and mirin into the hot broth and leave to one side.Next, pickle the turnips. In a jug, mix the salt into the vinegar and 100ml freshly boiled water, then pour over the turnip in a heatproof bowl and set aside.Cook the buckwheat noodles according to the packet instructions, taking a minute off the cooking time, then drain and rinse under cold water. Transfer to a bowl and mix through the toasted sesame oil.To assemble, ide the noodles between four bowls. Gently heat up the broth, pour it over the noodles, then top with the caramelised soy cabbage, watercress and pickled turnips, and serve.

Like most boys his age, plain pasta or bread are Flynn’s first choice – always! – but he also surprises us now and then with an out-of-character enthusiasm for, say, cabbage one day or mussels the next. This makes cooking for him a chancy experience – unless soup is on offer. For reasons known only to Flynn, a soup can feature all manner of normally undesirable ingredients without so much as a peep of protest. As he’s the youngest and the loudest in the family, the rest of us have to toe the line. But we do this willingly and lovingly, of course, because what’s better than a bowl of warm soup and a blissfully quiet child?Chicken wings are a great and economical way to ramp up the chicken flavour in a soup. This one comes together fairly easily, without having to soak the beans overnight. To make it more child-friendly, serve it without the salsa.2 tbsp olive oil500g chicken wings2 onions, peeled and finely chopped 4 garlic cloves, crushed with the flat of a large knife250g plum tomatoes, finely chopped1½ tbsp picked oregano leaves1½ tbsp basil leaves, finely chopped1 tbsp thyme leaves3 tbsp Worcestershire sauce ½ lemon Salt200g dried black-eyed beans 1 litre chicken stockFor the salsa1 green chilli, finely chopped (remove the pith and seeds if you prefer less heat)1½ tbsp basil leaves, finely chopped1½ tbsp parsley leaves, finely chopped3 tbsp olive oilPut a large, heavy-bottomed pot on a medium-high heat and, once hot, add the first eight ingredients and fry, stirring often, for 12 minutes, until the wings are beginning to colour. Add the Worcestershire sauce, lemon and two and a half teaspoons of salt, and fry, stirring often, for three minutes more. Add the beans, add the stock and 300ml water to cover, and bring up to a simmer. Lower the heat to medium, cover with a lid and cook for 35-40 minutes, or until the beans are cooked through but not falling apart.Turn off the heat, then use a pair of tongs to transfer the wings to a plate and leave to cool. Squeeze the cooked lemon into the soup to release all its juices, then discard the shell. When the chicken is cool enough to handle, pick the meat off the bones and add it to the soup pot discard the skin and bones. Return the soup to a medium heat for five minutes, just to heat through. Meanwhile, mix all the salsa ingredients in a small bowl with a good pinch of salt.Divide the soup between four bowls, top with salsa and serve.This take on French onion soup features hawaij, a Yemeni spice blend that complements the sweet onions, and brings with it extra complexity and warmth. The cheesy bread is optional. If you prefer to keep the soup vegan, use vegetable stock instead of chicken and extra oil instead of butter.75ml olive oil, or 50g unsalted butter plus 2 tbsp olive oil1.2kg onions (ie, about 7-8), peeled, halved and thinly sliced1 tbsp coriander seeds2 tsp cumin seeds2 whole cloves8 cardamom pods, seeds removed and shells discarded½ tsp fenugreek seeds½ tsp ground turmeric250g tomato passata30g fresh coriander, roughly chopped1 x 400g tin chickpeas, drained (240g net weight) 1.5 litre vegetable or chicken stockSalt and black pepperFor the cheesy bread (optional)220g mature cheddar, roughly grated10g fresh coriander, roughly chopped1 large garlic clove, peeled and crushed6 slices sourdough, cut about 2cm thick 15g unsalted butter, softened1 tbsp dijon mustardPut the oil (or butter and two tablespoons of oil) in a large, cast-iron saucepan on a medium-high heat. Once hot, add the onions, stir to coat them in the fat, then turn the heat to medium and cook gently for an hour, stirring every 10 minutes or so, until completely soft and golden.Meanwhile, make the spice mix. Put the coriander and cumin seeds, cloves, cardamom and fenugreek in a small frying pan on a medium-high heat. Toast, shaking the pan frequently, for five to six minutes, until fragrant, then tip into a spice grinder and blitz to a powder. Stir in the turmeric and set aside.When the onions are done, turn up the heat to medium-high, add the spice mix, passata and fresh coriander, and cook, stirring occasionally, for five minutes. Add the chickpeas, stock, one and three-quarter teaspoons of salt and a very generous amount of pepper, and bring to a boil. Turn the heat back down to medium and simmer, stirring occasionally, for 30 minutes.For the cheesy bread, if making, heat the grill to its highest setting. In a small bowl, mix the cheese with the coriander, garlic and a good grind of pepper. When the soup is close to ready, put the bread on a baking tray lined with greaseproof paper, grill it for a minute, then remove from the oven and flip over. Brush the untoasted side first with butter and then mustard, top with the cheese mixture and grill for three or four minutes more, until golden and bubbly. Cut each slice into three.Divide the soup between four bowls, top each with three slices of cheesy bread and serve with the remaining cheese bread alongside.I use garlic three ways here: roasted to add sweetness, fried for crunch and garlic oil to drizzle on top. Feel free to double or even triple the number of garlic heads you roast – the cloves can be kept in oil in a sealed jar and used in spreads, dressings or even folded into mashed potato. This soup thickens as it sits, so add more liquid to get it to a consistency you like.3 whole heads garlic, top trimmed to expose the cloves, plus 6 extra cloves, peeled and thinly sliced105ml olive oil, plus extra for drizzlingSalt and black pepper1 onion, peeled and finely chopped 1 medium celeriac (700g), peeled and cut into 1½cm cubes3 cinnamon sticks1½ tsp dried oregano80g short-grain rice500ml vegetable stock2 lemons – 1 cut into 6 ¼cm-thick rounds, the other juiced, to get 1½ tbsp10g parsley leaves, roughly chopped3 spring onions, trimmed and thinly sliced½ tsp chilli flakes (optional)Heat the oven to 240C (220C fan)465F gas 9. Drizzle the garlic heads with a little oil, sprinkle lightly with salt and pepper, then wrap them inidually and tightly in foil and bake for 30 minutes, or until lightly coloured on top and softened. Once cool enough to handle, use a small, sharp knife to separate the cloves, discard the skins and set aside.Meanwhile, put two tablespoons of oil in a large saucepan on a medium-high heat. Once hot, add the onion, celeriac and cinnamon, and cook, stirring occasionally, for eight minutes, until everything is softened and lightly coloured. Add the oregano and rice, stir to coat, then pour in the stock, 1.3 litres of water, one and three-quarter teaspoons of salt and a good grind of pepper. Bring to a boil, then turn down the heat to medium-low and cook gently for an hour, stirring occasionally, until the rice has started to break down into the soup. Transfer 200g of the mixture (taking roughly equal amounts of solids and liquid) to a blender, add the roast garlic and lemon juice, and blitz smooth. Pour this back into the soup pot and keep warm until ready to serve remove and discard the cinnamon sticks.While the soup is cooking, put a large frying pan on a high heat. Remove the pips from the lemon rounds and, once the pan is hot, add them to the pan and cook for two minutes on each side, until nicely charred. Finely chop the charred lemon, then put it in a bowl with the parsley and spring onion.Heat the remaining five tablespoons of oil and the sliced garlic in a small frying pan on a medium heat, and cook until the garlic starts to turn golden – eight to nine minutes. Add the chilli flakes, if using, cook for a minute more, then drain the solids through a sieve set over a bowl, and add the oil to the lemon and herb mixture.Divide the soup between four bowls, top each portion with a drizzle of the lemon and herb dressing, followed by the reserved fried garlic and chilli, and serve."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9db6f2e2b9f8d631357073fac920db8369146a72/0_138_4553_2732/master/4553.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=12950f5f75db48452a41717c1d632b25","title":"ryan bertrand southampton director of football ambitions business racism","story":"Southampton defender discusses his passion for business, how to deal with racism and why the walloping by Leicester was neededRyan Bertrand was glued to the footage of the government summit from Dubai in February 2014, specifically the talk on how to build a results-driven organisation, which is not a line that can be written about too many Premier League footballers. The Southampton left-back, though, is not a typical footballer.The guest speaker at the conference was Ferran Soriano, the chief executive of Manchester City, and Bertrand has total recall about a particular exchange. Soriano had outlined why he felt City’s management structure was set up for success, one in which the power is devolved from the head coach and shared among several bosses, including a director of football, when he was challenged by the compere.It was put to Soriano that Manchester United had done pretty well in recent years under Sir Alex Ferguson, who had left his post as the master of all he surveyed at Old Trafford the previous May. Was the autocratic model not the best practice?“You will have an opinion about this now that Ferguson is gone,” Soriano replied. “Maybe next year, I come here again and we see how United has done without Ferguson and with this autocratic structure.”Bertrand nods. “It’s exactly right what Ferran said. He’s called that. He said: ‘We’ll see how United operate with Ferguson gone,’ and you can look at it now and you think United are not currently the United and everyone is saying it’s perhaps behind the scenes, the structure. As a business, you shouldn’t be determined by one person. This person will go. In football, there is a high turnaround. So the business needs to continue. You can see the difference now between City and United.”Bertrand is preparing for Saturday’s game at Liverpool and Southampton will travel with their tails up, having won seven of their last 11 to rise to ninth in the table. The trauma of the 9-0 home defeat against Leicester from late October has been quarantined. Bertrand describes that as being “like a relegation in itself, the lowest of the low but, at the same time, something people needed because, if we’re being honest, we haven’t got things right on the field or off it for a few years now”. The collective mindset has been jolted into sync and the principles of the manager, Ralph Hasenhüttl, look a lot clearer in a 4-4-2 system, especially with regard to pressing.But what Bertrand wants to discuss is his passion for business and his ambition to become a director of football. It is in his blood and, growing up in London, he remembers the times when he accompanied his mother to offices of the investment bank Morgan Stanley, where she worked in the administration department.“She was a single mum and sometimes I had to go with her to work – when they had the open days, when the kids were allowed,” Bertrand says. “I remember being wowed by the buildings in Isle of Dogs, Canary Wharf. That’s what sparked my interest.”At 18, Bertrand started trading and he has since been involved in a couple of ventures – first, in 2015, a fintech start-up called Silicon Markets, a brokerage dedicated to, in his words, “bringing institutional tools to the at-home trader”. The following year, he got behind FootiEmoji – together with two other players, John Terry and José Fonte – and helped them to launch a short-lived emoji app.“With the fintech thing, myself and my business partner went in there, made a good product and learned a lot,” Bertrand said. “If you want to be in business, it’s important to start and the sooner you do that, the better. We sold that a while back. We exited to a Malaysian firm. But we’d built a company, developed it and gone through the exit process.”Aged 30, Bertrand has a good few years left on the pitch but his thoughts have taken in what to do after he retires, how to make his way in business and he has been guided by a standout piece of advice: stick to what you know. What he knows is football and so a role as a director of football holds great appeal.Bertrand has started researching it while also making study plans. He hopes to attend the four-day business of entertainment, media and sport programme at Harvard Business School in June and, at some point, the Football Association’s technical director course. His learning has invariably led him to figures from mainland Europe, such as Soriano, who worked at Barcelona before moving to City, because there are not many examples of people who champion directors of football or hold the position in England.“It’s when things are new and if managers are set in their ways,” Bertrand says. “At first, English managers could possibly fear it. No one is telling me which players to buy, they’d say. But if you look at it, the demands on one human in the modern-day game … you can’t become six of you. There are specialisms – player recruitment, making sure the club’s methodology is being kept from the youth team up. That’s ultimately what the director of football’s role should be.”Bertrand believes that he would be well-equipped for the job because of the depth of his experiences in the game. He has played at the top level, winning 19 caps for England and the Champions League with Chelsea in 2012, but also further down – in the Championship with Norwich, Reading and Nottingham Forest and League One with Bournemouth and Oldham. There was a relegation season at Norwich in 2008-09. He has worked under 19 managers at club level.Then, there is his network. Off the top of his head, he mentions how he played with Frank Lampard at Chelsea and Eddie Howe at Bournemouth. Both are now the managers of those clubs. Terry, another former Chelsea teammate, is an assistant coach at Aston Villa.“I’ve had a real different path,” Bertrand says. “Someone who has won World Cups and Ballon d’Ors will probably make a great director of football but I’d like to champion my kind of learning – the broad scale of it. Possibly, it’s what’s actually necessary. I have learned a lot in terms of people what works, what doesn’t, what’s needed, how the players are reacting.”What shines through is the force of Bertrand’s personality. He is a leader, particularly now in the Southampton dressing room, where he is a big brother figure to Nathan Redmond, Jack Stephens and Michael Obafemi. He believes that he must use his platform and profile in the right way and he has tried, for example, to help the people affected by the Grenfell Tower tragedy of 2017.Bertrand is also a strong voice against racism, something that he was subjected to as an England youth international. “It was under-18s or under-19s and it was somewhere in eastern Europe,” Bertrand said. “I can’t even remember the actual place but that doesn’t matter.“I was warming up on the side of the pitch, there weren’t too many people there because we were in the middle of nowhere and it was just one guy being racist. But you look at him, where he’s at and you can’t let that guy affect you. He looks like a joke. So you’re just like: ‘It’s a joke, just keep going about your business.’“But that on a bigger scale … if you received that from a whole section of a crowd, it becomes a lot more impactful, especially when you look around and think: ‘No one is doing nothing.’“I think Brexit has fuelled a rise in nationalism. There will probably be some people who are pro-Brexit and have hidden agendas within that. It naturally gives a rise to, or a bit more of a voice to, the nationalists.”Bertrand wore a special pair of boots against Chelsea in October 2018 that featured an image of Martin Luther King and his iconic quote: “I have a dream.” Bertrand did it to mark Black History Month but he says that the push for greater awareness and integration should be “a forever thing”, organic throughout the year.“Seeing these people rise up, like Jesse Owens, too … you build a confidence or a willpower knowing that they did it in their time,” Bertrand said. “You think: ‘Wow. If I’m experiencing this in my time, imagine what it was like for them in their time.’ If they can do it then, I can do it now.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6aa901e1b50460e541ca41e3959ea4959f8eef95/2_0_3021_1814/master/3021.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8350a8741cffe93d9a398f30e6d02a5b","title":"transfer window verdict how every premier league club fared in january","story":"Manchester United scrambled around for a striker and Sheffield United broke their transfer record while Chelsea and Liverpool kept their powder dryMikel Arteta knew he would have limited wriggle room in his first transfer window as manager so was happy enough to add the defensive cover Arsenal desperately needed. A number of options were explored, ultimately bringing relatively risk-free loan deals for the centre-back Pablo Marí and right-back Cédric Soares. A month ago Arteta was concerned about the prospect of high-profile departures but Granit Xhaka’s situation was smoothed over and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang is going nowhere for now. Nick AmesInjuries forced Villa to get busy in January and they will need their reinforcements to make rapid impacts if they are to stay up this season. Goalkeeper Pepe Reina has made an impressive start as a replacement for Tom Heaton, and Danny Drinkwater has looked rusty but vaguely promising in midfield. The big question is whether Mbwana Samatta and Borja Bastón can provide the sharpness up front that Villa have lacked. Paul DoyleEddie Howe will have breathed a sigh of relief when Manchester United informed Bournemouth they had cooled their interest in Joshua King hours before the deadline, having had a bid north of £20m rejected on Thursday night. Bournemouth made inquiries themselves and were interested in loan moves for Danny Rose, Bertrand Traoré and Jacob Bruun Larsen but finished up with what they started, having retained King, Nathan Aké and Ryan Fraser, with the latter being able to leave on a free this summer. Ben FisherGraham Potter added another exciting youngster to his Sussex stable in Tariq Lamptey, who made his Chelsea debut under Frank Lampard this season and, having sown the seeds, they activated a permanent move for Aaron Mooy after the Australia midfielder impressed. Meanwhile Argentina international Alexis Mac Allister returned from a loan spell at Boca Juniors and Glenn Murray stayed put, despite firm Championship interest, most notably from promotion-chasing Nottingham Forest. BFSean Dyche promised a quiet January transfer window and Burnley’s business was typically unspectacular, with just one signing from the Championship in Josh Brownhill and another departure in Nahki Wells, the latter leaving after never making a Premier League start and spending most of his time out on loan. Ben Gibson and Matej Vydra stayed at Turf Moor, despite being unhappy with their lack of game time. Paul WilsonIns Josh Brownhill (Bristol City, £8m), Henri Ogunby (Manchester City, undisclosed) Out Nahki Wells (Bristol City, £5m), Adam Phillips (Morecambe, loan), Ryan Cooney (Morecambe, loan), Scott Wilson (Blyth Spartans, loan), Will Harris (Warrington Town, loan), Tunde Bayode (Curzon Ashton, loan), Anthony Glennon (Grimsby Town, loan), Josh Benson (Grimsby Town, loan), Rob Harker (Hartlepool United, loan)The transfer ban was lifted but business was slow. Frank Lampard’s search for extra firepower ended in frustration – late moves for Edinson Cavani and Dries Mertens went nowhere – and the failure to bring in cover for Tammy Abraham meant Olivier Giroud, who wanted to join Inter, stayed put. Expect a bigger push in the summer, when Chelsea will look to sign Jadon Sancho and Timo Werner. Jacob SteinbergRoy Hodgson’s priority was to sign a striker and a right-back in this window: the first came off in the form of Everton’s Cenk Tosun on loan, but Nathan Ferguson’s failed move from West Brom meant that Palace could not find a belated replacement for Aaron Wan-Bissaka. Missing out on Ferguson, as well as Hull’s Jarrod Bowen, will not have helped the manager’s mood. Ed AaronsCarlo Ancelotti’s first window as manager passed quietly which, with the new man still assessing his squad and Everton announcing record losses of almost £112m for the year to June 2019, was no great surprise. The club maintain no formal offer was received for Richarlison from Barcelona, although that may change in the summer, and were unable to shift deadwood such as Oumar Niasse and Cuco Martina. Andy HunterIn Jarrad Branthwaite (Carlisle United, undisclosed) Outs Kieran Dowell (Wigan, loan) Callum Connolly (Fleetwood, loan) Cenk Tosun (Crystal Palace, loan) Antony Evans (Paderborn, undisclosed) Lewis Gibson (Fleetwood, loan) Morgan Feeney (Tranmere Rovers, loan), Jonas Lössl (Huddersfield, loan)A pleasingly quiet window for Leicester, who were never likely to sell any of their key players halfway through a season that could end with a top-four finish. The only significant arrival was Ryan Bennett, who is a useful enough reserve centre-back who is hardly expected to become a regular starter. A high-end winger would have been a welcome addition but was not needed urgently, with Harvey Barnes improving and Ayoze Pérez doing a fair job on the right. PDJürgen Klopp usually avoids January recruits but the opportunity to sign Japan international Takumi Minamino for a bargain release fee of £7.3m was one he could not resist. Understandably, given the Salzburg playmaker’s impressive displays against the runaway Premier League leaders in the Champions League this season. Otherwise it was a case of finding Rhian Brewster and Natt Phillips valuable game-time on loan. AHPep Guardiola could probably have done with a fresh frontline centre-back despite Aymeric Laporte’s recovery from injury as he only has two others: the equally inconsistent John Stones and Nicolás Otamendi. Yet despite having the option of recalling Tosin Adarabioyo from Blackburn, Guardiola was content to retain the status quo. In the summer, then, expect him to strengthen the position and possibly add a creative midfielder to replace the departing David Silva. Jamie JacksonBruno Fernandes’s arrival for £46.5m is a desperately needed boost for Ole Gunnar Solskjær, the Portugal international adding leadership and experience in midfield. The transfer deadline day scramble for a No 9 was less credible: Romelu Lukaku’s departure last summer should have presaged a replacement then instead of United’s rather last-minute move with ended with Odion Ighalo joining on loan for the rest of the season. JJSteve Bruce has added quality at left-back in the shape of Danny Rose, while Valentino Lazaro brings creativity on the wing and Nabil Bentaleb central midfield stability. Yet, with a bid for Olivier Giroud having proved forlorn, does Newcastle’s worryingly coy forward line contain sufficient goals? And might Rose and Bentaleb turn into the troublemakers some at their parent clubs, Tottenham and Schalke, predict? Louise TaylorThere was more than a hint of “preparing for life in the Championship” about Norwich’s January window. Lukas Rupp arrived from Hoffenheim after an unheralded career in the Bundesliga. Two younger talents – Melvin Sitti and Sam McCallum – were brought in and loaned back to their parent clubs immediately. Only one addition, attacking midfielder Ondrej Duda, looks to have been signed for immediate impact valued by Daniel Farke at £25m, he came in on loan. Paul MacInnesIf it ain’t broke why fix it? Propelled by a combination of expert coaching and rare collective spirit Chris Wilder’s side have defied all expectations. But treading water can also be perilous and Wilder looks to have added real quality in the shape of the Norway midfielder and record signing Sander Berge. Meanwhile the pacy Dutch striker Richairo Zivkovic can only intensify competition for attacking places after arriving on loan from China’s Changchun Yatai, while a loan move for Greece international defender Panos Retsos strengthens options at the back. LTA satisfying window for Ralph Hasenhüttl, who beat off competition from Premier League rivals to land Kyle Walker-Peters on loan from Tottenham. The full-back will likely slot in at right-back to fill the void left by Cédric Soares, who has joined Arsenal, and provide competition for the fit-again Yan Valery, but can also play at left-back. Leicester enquired about Denmark defender Jannik Vestergaard but balked at his asking price, with Southampton determined to recoup the £18m they paid for the defender. BFJosé Mourinho wanted a striker to cover for the injured Harry Kane and he did not get one, meaning he has at least a further two-and-a-half months without a recognised senior No9. He lost the experience of Christian Eriksen and Danny Rose but gained the youthful promise of Steven Bergwijn and Gedson Fernandes. David HytnerNigel Pearson always said that Watford were unlikely to do significant business in this window, and so it proved – the club, 19th in the league, perhaps finding that any player talented and ambitious enough for them to be interested was also too talented and ambitious to join them, while also being frustrated in several attempts to get rid of players, on loan or otherwise. The Brazilian forward João Pedro has arrived, with more fanfare than impact so far, but he has youth on his side. Simon BurntonRelegation fears led to a frantic dash in the final week of the window. West Ham strengthened their midfield after signing Tomas Soucek on loan with an option to buy for €20.5m and concerns about the attack saw David Moyes pip Crystal Palace and Newcastle to the £22.5m signing of Hull’s Jarrod Bowen. Moyes also sorted out the goalkeeping situation, signing Darren Randolph as cover for Lukasz Fabianski and shipping Roberto off to Alavés on loan. JSNuno Espírito Santo openly pleaded for new signings to help his team continue to challenge for Champions League qualification while advancing in the Europa League, but Wolves only made one purchase. Daniel Podence, a forward most at home on the wing, became the third most expensive recruit in the club’s history when he joined for £17m from Olympiakos. That welcome addition still leaves Wolves very reliant on their one senior specialist striker, Raúl Jiménez, especially after the departure of Patrick Cutrone. Central midfield could also do with more depth.

Also like every millennial, I somehow constantly manage to never do any of the things I need to do to self-improve. I’m hoping that technology can help me get it together – so I got an Amazon Echo 3rd generation, with Alexa.The Echo Dot comes in a small box, which I open up to reveal a small speaker, just larger in diameter than a drinks coaster, but small enough to hold in your hand. Aesthetically, it’s very futuristic – at the top within the light ring are four tiny microphones and four buttons – volume up, volume down, mute and Alexa. It feels smooth around the sides with adaptor and aux ports at the back.Mine is heather grey, but you can get them in charcoal, plum and sandstone too – you can even get one with a clock to show you the time. There’s an information document, a charger, a user manual and a list of commands to try, such as: “Alexa, set a 10-minute timer” and “Alexa, add toilet paper to my shopping list”.To set up, I need to be connected to my wifi and download the Amazon Alexa app on to my smartphone. Set-up is easy, all within the app, and takes about five to 10 minutes – but if you struggle, there are a million and one tutorials on YouTube for you to follow and a dedicated Echo help page.There are a ton of things you can do with the Echo straight out of the box, such as setting alarms and asking it trivia questions. To unlock even more value, you can add skills via the Alexa smartphone app or just by using your voice.I like to tell people I’d be fitter if I had more time to go to the gym, safe in the knowledge that I don’t actually have the time. Now I have no excuse. I never thought Alexa would be able to help me exercise in any way, but I was wrong. The Body Coach skill allows me to work out as Joe Wicks, the Body Coach, keeps me motivated with cries of: “You’ll smash it!” It has seven 15-minute, high-intensity interval training (HIIT) workouts to help you burn fat when you’re short on time, including marching, star jumps, squats, push-ups and crunches – and that’s just lesson one. I can’t say I’m at my target weight yet, but it’s definitely helping me get more regular exercise in.Learning a new language can be quite daunting but with the Translated skill it no longer has to be. I ask Alexa to teach me how to say any word or phrase in Spanish, and Translated reads it out so I can learn how to say it myself. I can even ask the skill to slow down or repeat the translation until I’m happy I’ve nailed it. I’ve already learned how to introduce myself: Me llamo Phil! I’m hoping that a few minutes a day practising while cooking or cleaning can really make me el experto.I often struggle to get to sleep but Sleep and Relaxation Sounds is excellent at resolving this. It has hundreds of ambient sounds that can be used to help with meditation or lull you into a state of complete relaxation. Once the skill is open, I just say: “Alexa, help me sleep”, or “Alexa, play heavy rain”, and I’m zoning out in no time listening to the downpour.My flatmate has an Echo, so we use Drop In – an inbuilt, two-way, intercom-like feature that connects two Alexa-enabled devices together once permissions are enabled. It’s perfect for letting my housemate on the top floor know that dinner is ready. All I had to do was say: “Alexa, drop in on the attic room”, and I can immediately communicate with my flatmate without walking up the steps.It turns out playing a game with a speaker is actually a lot of fun. I try out Twenty Questions: you think of any animal, mineral, music or vegetable and the skill asks 20 questions that you can answer, aiming to work it out in 20 questions or fewer. I play with Beyoncé’s 2016 single Formation – of course – and Alexa gets it in 10 questions. Impressive! You can also play a variety of other games, such as Deal or No Deal and Pointless.Alexa is a lot of fun, but, importantly, she’s really handy at helping you with those small tasks that can take up time or easily be forgotten. It can play music, tell the time, give you news briefings and weather forecasts, check traffic and so much more. Most surprisingly, it helped me to begin a brand new fitness journey. I’m interested in adding some smart tech soon to make it more powerful. I could turn lights on and off, control TVs, open garage doors and change the temperature. I’m excited to continue exploring all its capabilities.Learn more about what you can do with Alexa"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f93d07b50b4f4c008b7c5cef76a3b19453f709fd/1_0_4165_2500/master/4165.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e56250c8726df280c3b2225bdbf433d5","title":"a letter to the pupil i wanted to foster","story":"‘You were moved to a home for difficult girls.

What you don’t know is that I often thought about the idea of fostering you.How shocked would my boyfriend have been if I had brought you home – a “problem child” of almost 13? A couple who worked long hours, lived a hectic lifestyle and often ate cereal for dinner – could we have offered you much better?Deep down, I knew it wasn’t to be, despite often feeling scared that I might suddenly suggest it in a meeting about you. I desperately wanted you to have some stability I wanted to be in your corner.Most of our meetings involved social workers wearing worried looks, concerned about where they might place you next, all the while pretending they knew you. At each meeting they would always reiterate that, for you, school was the only constant in your life, and I knew that to be true.Whenever you had to change homes or had a fallout with the newest caregivers, school would help pick up the pieces. I used my free lessons to work with you I chatted to your teachers to check you were fine, gave you the thumbs up if I saw you doing well.Inevitably, though, you were not doing well. You could not focus or stay in a lesson for any extended period, you screamed in the faces of your peers and teachers – and often in mine. I understood how could you focus when you didn’t know whose house you would be moved to next? How could you concentrate while you were so angry at not being given a voice?It’s been more than five years now and I still think about you. A sudden decision had you moved to a residential home for difficult girls a long way away. You were gone in two days.

Has the workplace crush had its day?Jenny had been living in Hong Kong for a couple of weeks when she fell “head over heels” in love with Christine, the creative director of a small fashion company. But there was a problem: Christine already had a girlfriend. And another problem: Christine was interviewing Jenny for a job at the company at the time. “The first thing she did when she came in was to sit in her chair and say to me: ‘So you’re the English girl,’” Jenny recalls. “She was very direct – it wasn’t something I was used to. It felt strong.”Jenny, whose parents are from Hong Kong, had decided to move there after graduating from university in 2018, to learn more about her culture. She was 22, and describes herself as extremely shy. She applied for a series of positions at creative companies, but Christine’s firm was the first to invite her for an interview Jenny landed an entry-level position, reporting directly to Christine. Her new boss wasn’t like anyone she’d met before. She was powerful and direct in business meetings, but playful, disarming, even confessional one-to-one. She worked out and channelled a masculine, minimalist style: white shirts, blazers, black turtlenecks. She seemed to take a special interest in the English girl.“There was one moment early on when we were going through some props for a shoot together,” Jenny says. “I was just an intern then – it was a menial job for a director to be helping out with, but she was so caring. She wanted to know more about me.” Within two weeks, Jenny was questioning her whole identity. “I never realised that I had feelings for women before I met her,” she says. “I was surprised that I could feel that way about anyone. I started to think back to all my previous experiences with men and realised there was something lacking. But with my boss – it was different.”Jenny was one of hundreds of  readers who responded to a call-out for tales of workplace romance. The intention was to find out how the business of coupling up at work has changed. According to surveys, about two-thirds of British workers are open to dating colleagues – but human resources and human emotions aren’t always in alignment.Since 2017, the #MeToo movement has helped bring to the surface a series of stories about harassment and misconduct in workplaces, including American Apparel in the US and the Arcadia Group in the UK. In 2018, Monica Lewinsky revisited her workplace affair with Bill Clinton, when she was an intern and he was president, in an essay for Vanity Fair. She wrote: “I’m beginning to entertain the notion that in such a circumstance the idea of consent might well be rendered moot.”The more recent case of the British former McDonald’s chief executive Steve Easterbrook – fired from a $15.9m-a-year position last November for having a consensual affair with a colleague – highlights just how far some companies are prepared to go to guard against potential abuses of power and troublesome lawsuits, particularly in the US. “Non-fraternisation policies” and “love contracts” are common, typically requiring both parties to declare the relationship, agree that it will not interfere with their work, and potentially move departments in the event of any conflict of interest.There had been no complaint against Easterbrook from his lover, only from the McDonald’s board, who argued that his affair “violated company policy”, which bans employees with “direct or indirect reporting relationships” from having sexual relationships. Easterbrook’s dismissal wiped around $4bn from McDonald’s share price overnight. In December, BlackRock Inc – the world’s largest asset management company – dismissed Mark Wiseman, a senior executive tipped as a future CEO, for a similar breach. “This is not who BlackRock is. This is not our culture,” said an internal memo circulated at the time.The situation in Britain is different. European workers are – in theory, at least – protected from such dismissals by the European convention on human rights, article 8, which grants us the “right to respect for private and family life”. In other words, your company’s shareholders don’t have the right to tell you who you can have sex with, as they do in America.Nonetheless, says Jonathan Rennie, employment partner at the London law firm TLT, business is increasingly international. US conventions are drifting across the Atlantic – and what will happen post-Brexit is unclear. “We’ve had a lot of inquiries from firms about what is and isn’t appropriate, particularly since #MeToo,” he tells me. “Larger companies in particular have identified this as a potential trip hazard.” The compensation is unlimited in sexual harassment cases, he notes, so it’s in companies’ interests to put some kind of policy in place. Even if it is not rigidly applied, the company’s lawyers can then make a “reasonable steps” defence in any potential employment tribunal.He points to Facebook’s Relationships at Work document as an example of a typical US policy, which theoretically applies at a global level. The firm stresses that workers aren’t banned from dating each other – but there are “simple rules” to prevent “unwanted invitations” or “unwelcome flirting”. “If you ask a co-worker out and that invitation does not result in a date, do not ask again” is one rule. Another: “If you do start a relationship with someone in your management chain, it must be disclosed to HR.” People who are in relationships must remain “professional” with one another while at work. And so on.But, as Rennie notes (and he helps to draft this sort of thing) such rules are nigh on impossible to enforce. “There are infinite ways that a relationship might develop,” he says. “The idea that you can cover them all in a policy is a bit heavy-handed.” For instance, when should you disclose your relationship to HR? After you share a fumble at the Slug \u0026amp Lettuce? When your stomach turns to butterflies at the photocopier? “Theoretically, if you fail to disclose, you could be fired,” Rennie says. That sounds dystopian, I remark. “Well, modern life is dystopian!” he laughs.Still, Dame Heather Rabbatts, chair of the anti-harassment campaign group Time’s Up UK, stresses that context is always important when it comes to consensual relationships within the workplace. “Harvey Weinstein has argued in court: ‘There was always consent,’” she says. “Well, how was that consent made? If the senior inidual has power, and consent is given in a context of bullying, that is harassment.“It’s really worth stressing that sexual harassment is still endemic in the culture of many, many companies,” she adds. “The women at McDonald’s have been campaigning around sexual harassment for some time.” (The company has defended its anti-harassment efforts.) Rabbatts doesn’t see relationship contracts as a priority making employees aware of their rights and ensuring they have access to confidential advice is more effective. “At some of the production companies we are working with, the anti-harassment policies are printed out and pinned to the door. I’d welcome that.” Even if the companies are more concerned with their own reputations than the welfare of their employees? “Well, it’s hard to interrogate the mindset of a corporate entity, isn’t it?” she says. “But what is important is the outcome. Employers are rightly concerned with their reputations. There was a time, not that long ago, where sexual harassment wouldn’t have been a reputation issue. Now companies feel they have to address it, and that is to be welcomed.”But while larger firms are becoming more cautious, many startups operate a looser, more informal culture. A former employee of the US startup WeWork, who claimed she was sexually assaulted twice while working for the company, filed a lawsuit in 2018 citing an “entitled, frat-boy culture that permeates from the top down”. The company vehemently denied the claims, which were partially upheld under New York City law. One reporter described WeWork, which at its height managed more than 800 co-working spaces across the world, as a “flirting utopia”. Few smaller companies have policies in place, for the simple reason that they have other priorities. But last year the Financial Times reported that investors were starting to seek “#MeToo clauses” in investment agreements with startups, in order to guarantee that there have been no historical sexual harassment complaints – with an obligation to report any complaints that do arise.One difficulty is that so much of our lives now take place in the grey area between work and non-work, says Michael Ryley, a partner who specialises in employment law at Weightmans. Are work parties work? If you work from home, is your own home the workplace? “And what happens if, for example, I’m in a relationship with someone in the office? If I pat her on the bum and she’s my girlfriend, that’s potentially fine. But if she’s defined as another employee, I could get sacked. And what if the relationship breaks down? Have I harassed a fellow employee, for which my employer is liable? The potential for toxic fallout is considerable.” Nonetheless, he sees McDonald’s-style sanctions as “aggressive”: “I don’t see why an employer should dictate who you can go out with any more than they should tell you what you can eat for dinner or watch on TV.”And there’s a broader shift, too. Esther Perel, author of Mating In Captivity and perhaps the world’s most in-demand relationship therapist, has turned her attention to workplaces in her new podcast, How’s Work?. As she notes, we increasingly ask our employers to take care of our emotional needs – terms like “trust”, “authenticity” and “belonging” have now entered the business sphere. Businesses organise mindfulness sessions your boss wants to know how you’re feeling. Meanwhile, romance is increasingly subject to the logic of the marketplace: we’re more inclined than ever to treat dates as job interviews. Judging from the responses of  readers, romance is very much alive, lustful and complicated in 2020. “I can’t remember who emailed who,” reports Polly, 39, an account director from Sheffield. “But an email was sent, waters were tested and within a couple of days we were snogging round the back of the office by the smoking shelter.” (The affair fizzled out after a couple of months: both were in other relationships.) Academia would appear to be a hotbed of brooding intensity: “My baby is the only positive thing to come out of it,” says Elisabeth, 27, an administrator from Manchester. City law firms (long hours, small teams, high pressure) sound particularly steamy. “When they installed a sleeping pod in the office it really got quite bad,” reports a former employee of one eminent firm.The majority of respondents told heart-warming stories that began with something like: “He made me find the dull drudge of each day amusing” (Rachel, 26, a researcher from London), and concluded along the lines of: “That was 40 years ago and next year we celebrate our ruby anniversary!” (Michael, 64, a retired civil servant from Chesterfield). There was plenty of heartache, too. “She worked for the sales director, I was in marketing, and every time I saw her my stomach turned somersaults,” says Andrew, 60, from Wales, who managed to keep his affair secret. “Never had that before or since. She was the love of my life.” She transferred abroad and Andrew considered jacking it all in to join her, but in the end chose his career. “I hope she’s reading this,” he adds.Then there are those for whom the sheer messiness of office romance is the whole point. Abigail, 48, a civil servant from Oxfordshire, reflects that her “romantic dalliances” have made for the happiest times in her work life. “No, I never got the big promotion or any recognition for how awesome I am, and more than once someone else has taken the credit for the work I’ve done,” she says. “I really don’t mind, because while they’ve been focusing on their careers, I’ve been preoccupied with infatuation, love and heartbreak.” She tallies one unrequited “major crush”, two stray snogs, three sexual relationships, two serious long-term relationships, one marriage and one broken heart from her civil service career. “These are the people I spent most of my time with – of course I’m going to develop real feelings for some of them,” she reasons. “The secret to my success? A friendly smile and a key to the stationery cupboard.”In those first weeks, she says, her rights as an employee were the last thing on her mind. Her main concern was spending as much time with Christine as possible. She took on extra work so she had an excuse to contact her over weekends. She took up jogging so she could exercise with Christine, and accepted an invitation to karaoke with her boss and her girlfriend. She enjoyed the status their closeness gave her. Best of all, they got to travel together: Tokyo, Beijing and Singapore. “We became reliant on each other,” she says. “Most of our work is in China, but I don’t really know Mandarin so I needed to stick with Christine to order food and get around. But she also needed me to help with filming schedules and castings and everything.” It was at these times that Jenny got to know “her secrets and fears”.Then, last January, came the shoot in China. As usual, the two of them flew out before the rest of the team to make sure everything was in place. “We had been out for dinner at this hotpot restaurant, a very traditional place, noisy, busy, full of smoke. We were drinking beer, eating boiled pig intestines and talking about religion. Like: what do we think happens when we die? Do we believe in reincarnation? All these deep topics.”Christine had told her that she had never instigated any of her romantic relationships – it had always been the other woman. Jenny took this to mean that she would have to make the move. But what if it went wrong? She considered resigning so that she could declare her love. But then she would lose her job and, potentially, Christine. Finally, they ended up at the hotel. “We were waiting outside the door and our eyes met and we just kind of stared at each other.”Power is sexy, work is dull and other people are more interesting. The writers of romances have always known this. But what would a human resources director make of, say, the film Secretary, in which Maggie Gyllenhaal plays a woman whose boss subjects her to what, from a 2020 perspective, looks like a clearcut case of sustained workplace harassment: whips, manacles, king? The US author Mary Gaitskill, who wrote the story on which the 2002 movie was based, returned to its themes in her recent novel This Is Pleasure, in which a powerful New York publisher faces a lawsuit from a former employee. He thought their king episode was a bit of transgressive fun. Years later, the employee thinks otherwise. In a recent interview with the , Gaitskill defended her decision to tell the story from the perspective of the accused on the grounds that the media has been full of accusers’ stories. “The thing about the bigger story,” she said, “is that you see the currents, but you often don’t see people really feeling it.”If you put any group of people together, pretty soon feelings will surface. “I’m a quiet and shy guy,” says Haroon, 35, from Bury. “I don’t tend to socialise much. I started my new job and on my first day this beautiful blond woman walks into my office and introduces herself. She is in her late 40s and married she talks a lot and loves to socialise. We hit it off as soon as our eyes locked.” He describes how she brings him out of his comfort zone, makes him feel confident and sexy. She often comes into his office to chat. He hasn’t made a move – and nor does he intend to. “Instead she is relegated to a fantasy,” he says. “My wife roleplays her when we have sex, not knowing I have a real crush on her.”Kimi, 51, a university lecturer from Scotland, says: “We got together in the most cliched circumstance – getting drunk at the work Christmas meal. We both had very young children and spouses who starved us of physical affection and intimacy. That was almost 18 years ago.” They are still together now – a “tacit couple”, long past the point of gossip. But they are also still with their respective spouses.“We sometimes manage to go to the same conferences,” Kimi says, “but mostly we have lunch and do the crossword puzzle, or meet for a drink and a game of cards. Our love affair has been largely conducted in writing, but we still miss each other when we don’t see each other for a few days.” She says they are more in love than ever, the most loyal friends, but that it’s bittersweet, trying to make the best of things, waiting for their children to grow up and leave. “We furnish imaginary flats and talk about the future. But I fear that when it comes to it, I won’t have the nerve to leave my husband.”Jenny and Christine didn’t kiss. Christine said something about the hard day they both faced in the morning, and Jenny said yes, and they went to their separate rooms. “And the next day we went back to work.”Jenny has just marked her first anniversary at the company. Over time, it has become easier. “I have given it a lot of thought and decided that it’s better to stay friends for life then be lovers for a short time,” she says. But she maintains that it’s her boss who helped her discover her sexuality. “I’m at peace now, I guess. It’s not nice to obsess. But now I’m happy. I feel so much freer. I’m more willing to try new things and meet more people. I’ve started using Tinder and Bumble. And I’ve been to my first Pride – that was quite special.”Christine – to the best of Jenny’s knowledge – has no idea of the role she has played in her younger colleague’s life. “But I don’t mind keeping it a secret,” Jenny says. “I’m very grateful to her. She is someone I will remember for a long time.”• Some names have been changed.If you would like your comment on this piece to be considered for Weekend magazine’s letters page, please email weekend@the, including your name and address (not for publication)."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a2ba2ac638db55c169edee69d4f0883530873dbc/0_326_5594_3356/master/5594.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=529e9f2c0101bb5399bf51e386866784","title":"quiz cardiac smooth skeletal seabird sirius thomas eaton","story":"From a seabird to Sirius, test your knowledge with the Weekend quiz1 Who wrote the UK’s three bestselling books of the last decade?2 Which footballer was known as the non-flying Dutchman?3 What was last held in London in the winter of 1814?4 Which seabird is named from a French form of William?5 Eileen Collins was the first woman to command what craft?6 What starts with H and ends in Og?7 A rock off County Cork is the midpoint of which yacht race?8 Where did pilgrims eat on the Street of Bad Cooking?What links:9 AngusLaura BernardLydia CarrieHamish CharlesHenrietta Gareth?10 Cardiac smooth skeletal?11 Ain’t Misbehavin’ Blueberry Hill The Twist Praise You?12 Pie Oreo Nougat Marshmallow Lollipop Cupcake?13 Sirius Canopus Rigil Kentaurus Arcturus Vega?14 Buckingham Regent’s BPP Arden?15 Portugal South Korea Ghana Egypt Peru?1 EL James (Fifty Shades trilogy). 2 Dennis Bergkamp. 3 Frost fair on the Thames. 4 Guillemot (Guillaume). 5 Space shuttle (Columbia, 1999). 6 Periodic table (hydrogen and oganesson).7 Fastnet race. 8 Medieval Jerusalem (Rue de Malquisinat). 9 The titular four weddings a funeral, in the 1994 film. 10 Types of muscle in the human body. 11 Hits for stoutly-named musicians: Fats Waller Fats Domino Chubby Checker Fatboy Slim. 12 Versions of the Android smartphone operating system. 13 Brightest stars in the night sky. 14 Private universities in Britain. 15 Home countries of recent UN secretaries general: António Guterres Ban Ki-moon Kofi Annan Boutros Boutros-Ghali Javier Pérez de Cuéllar."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/69a0f6ef20c59bb2edec50776fe221af19be5a47/104_0_3661_2197/master/3661.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=359bf46a62a342b7d47a13f63d5999f7","title":"zero evidence worse for children parenting in polyamorous relationship","story":"We’ve decided to allow other partners into our lives. There is just one problem: how to square that with having a familyAlmost three years ago, my partner and I decided to experiment with opening up our relationship. More recently, we’ve “come out” as polyamorous, meaning we are free to be involved with more than one person at a time, physically andor emotionally, in a transparent, consensual way.In practice, this means that I currently have a wife, who I live with, along with our two-year-old son. I also have a girlfriend, who lives elsewhere and has a daughter. I love both my wife and my girlfriend deeply, in different ways. My wife has a new male love interest, also living elsewhere, also with children.It is a little complex, but it needn’t be horrifying. Yet when I tell people about the recent change to our 11-year relationship, I’m usually met with fear and confusion. That’s understandable, perhaps open non-monogamy remains a relatively uncommon choice and comes with its fair share of upsets and hurt feelings. At times I, too, have felt some fear and confusion. But it’s hard being judged by others for making a considered adult choice. The biggest anxiety our situation raises, it seems, is that we’re parents. The overwhelming suspicion seems to be that our child will either be exposed to a dangerous level of eroticism, or somehow miss out on attention, stability and love.It is remarkably similar to some of the hysteria conjured by religious and political zealots around same-sex parenting back in the 1980s. Still, I’m sympathetic. Having entered the brave new world of conscious non-monogamy only in the past few years, I, too, am unravelling decades of social conditioning that suggest open relationships are OK-ish (a bit bohemian juvenile even), provided there aren’t children involved. Children need consistency, right? But does consistency have to mean monogamy?In many ways, polyamorous couples face the same challenges or rewards as blended families where orced parents remarry. Mancub, 16, is the child of polyamorous parents living in Northamptonshire, whom he quite simply calls “my adults”: Cassie (his mum), Josh (his dad) and Amanda (their partner). “Even at a young age, I was able to grasp the concept that my mum and dad could love more than one person,” he says. “The only thing I’ve found challenging about having three adults in my family is getting away with things, because it means more people to check up on you, to make sure you did your chores. But I also have more people around to give me lifts here and there, to help with homework and to come to my lacrosse games. The saying ‘raised by a village’ definitely applies to me. I feel like a completely normal teenager, just with polyamorous parents.”This kind of positive response is not uncommon. Researcher and relationship coach Dr Eli Sheff is author of The Polyamorists Next Door: Inside Multiple-Partner Relationships And Families, which details 15 years of studying polyamorous families. This includes interviews with 206 people in polyamorous families in the US, 37 of them children.“Looking at these kids overall, I would say that they are equally – if not more – emotionally healthy than their peers,” Sheff says. “The kids from poly families are pros at establishing new relationships. They’ve been growing up marinated in personal growth and honesty, and exposed to a wide range of ideas. They don’t necessarily think they’ll be polyamorous themselves, particularly since most grow up in an environment designed to foster independent thought.” Though my wife and I have no plans to live with any other partner, we will continue to be cautious about how and when we introduce our son to significant others. In my view, he has certainly benefited from the presence of my girlfriend: the pair have a touchingly close relationship she was the first person ever to babysit him (when my wife and I went out for a date) and as a trained actress and born storyteller, she’s definitely his favourite when it comes to bedtime stories.I’m acutely aware that our son will soon know himself to be different from the norm, since he has two mothers (and a donor, whom our son hasn’t met, though my wife and I maintain contact because we like him, and in case our son wishes to contact him when he is older). I have worried at times: will he feel vulnerable because his parents have veered away from the traditional paradigm?At the moment, it isn’t a pressing concern the things that matter most to him right now are ice-cream, trains, and refusing to wear pyjamas. As he grows, however, it will become important to answer his questions in an age-appropriate way. “This can mean using terms like ‘special friend’ or ‘sleepover’, but doesn’t mean avoiding the truth,” says Dr Lori Beth Bisbey, a London-based psychologist and practising polyamorist. “If your child asks why he has two mums, you’d answer that question directly, so don’t be any different about your relationship status. For those adults in your life who are freaking out about your choices, you can ask them whether they think that it’s possible to love more than one child, and explain how loving more than one partner is much like that.”Secrets and lies – these are things that ought, ideally, to be eradicated in poly relationships, although in practice humans are still, well, human. Having been traditionally unfaithful and openly polyamorous, I know that my self-respect and inner contentment are far higher in the latter scenario. In consciously open relationships, the idea of infidelity is less clear cut, and becomes an agreement between two (or more) people. “Cheating” can still happen, when trust is broken: going on a date without telling the other partner, for instance, or lying about one’s intensifying feelings towards another partner. On the whole, however, there is much less dishonesty or evasion than in more monogamous setups, which arguably results in fewer acrimonious breakups.We won’t know the impact of our choices until our son can articulate it. When the time comes, I intend to listen, allowing him to express his ideas or complaints. I hope to take great care of any part of our bond that might have been overstretched somehow by my mistakes or actions, though I have zero intention of foisting details of my sex life on him. What I might say, instead, is that I don’t believe in sublimating all my own needs merely because I’ve become a parent. I think that doing so can lead to greater problems, and I want to show him that it is possible to get most of one’s own needs met openly and responsibly, while also loving someone else – including one’s child.Once he is old enough to understand, I’ll also tell him this: my relationship with his mother has strengthened since we allowed each other to be attracted to, or fall in love with, other people. That’s not to say it has been easy (hell no: the opposite). But ultimately it has been worth it, because the freer we are to look elsewhere, the freer we are to choose each other. My wife and I are more honest and less co-dependent than we have ever been in our 11 years together. I believe our son is more likely to grow up with two parents who love one another, and are committed to one another.

Yet boomers built the world we live in today, for worse but also for betterOne of the cruellest ironies of being a teenager is that the attitude you reckon makes you look the most grown up is the one that proves you are definitely still a child. There are few things more adorably infantile than the wholesale dismissal of one’s parents as idiotic know-nothings compared with you, the all-knowing fount of wisdom, albeit one who still needs her parents to drive her everywhere. I once got into an enormous huff with my parents because they dismissed Eurotrash – the much-missed (by me) Channel 4 show – as “stupid”. AS IF! Objectively, they were wrong: as TV shows predicated on laughing at other countries go, Eurotrash was amazing. It never occurred to me that my parents had led lives before me, ones in which they did things that my potato-like 15-year-old brain could not even begin to fathom. My father had lived abroad my mother had worked with Jim Henson both received far more higher education than I did. And still, I rolled my eyes and told them they knew “nothing”.The younger generation has to disown the older one in order to break away from it. I see this in my own kids – already, at the age of four, dab hands at the keenly deployed eye roll. And I hear it every time someone sneeringly dismisses “a boomer”, anyone born between 1946 and 1964, or “a second waver”, a feminist who came of age in the 1960s and 70s. There’s even a genre of literature about it, with calm and measured titles such as A Generation Of Sociopaths: How The Babyboomers Betrayed America. Meanwhile, the much-discussed “OK, boomer” meme is chucked at anyone, whenever they were born, who expresses an opinion deemed unforgivably out of step with the times. I am not a boomer, but I’ll be frankly insulted if this column doesn’t earn me a few “OK, boomer” emails.Yes, boomers had it pretty great, and look at this (literally) hot mess of a planet they’ve left us. To make it worse – and this, clearly, is the real source of anti-boomer ire – they then complain about how easy those avocado-eating millennials have it. Or, putting it into the kind of context I can easily understand, it’s like the dorky parents in an 80s movie telling their way cooler teenager that he should be grateful for his meagre allowance, when they have a massive car and hang out all day at the country club. No wonder that teenager has a party and trashes the house. It’s what the parents deserve!And yet boomers built the world we live in today, for worse but also for better. True, Donald Trump is a boomer but so are Steve Jobs, Barack Obama, Oprah Winfrey, Madonna, Stephen King and Bill Gates. And although the figureheads of the civil rights movement and second-wave feminism – Martin Luther King, Malcolm X, Betty Friedan, Gloria Steinem – were born before the boom, it was the boomers who went on the marches, because, as millennials and Gen Zers know, it is the young who agitate for and effect social change.Plenty of the lieutenants in these movements were born during the boom – Andrea Dworkin and Catharine MacKinnon among them. Some of their views might not find favour with the young women who today consider porn empowering and sex work liberating Dworkin was not exactly known for her “sex positivity”. But it was MacKinnon who first drafted what became the law against workplace sexual harassment.There is a tendency in feminism that will always – ironically – want to kill its mother figures. Every new wave has defined itself in opposition to the one that came before, and I never hear any reference to “the second wavers” today that isn’t critical. Feminist-lite website Jezebel claimed in 2018 that “The Backlash To #MeToo Is Second-wave Feminism”. Never mind that this isn’t even true (I’m pretty sure Dworkin, for one, would have been down with #MeToo) the point was, as it always is, that these old people don’t understand anything. It’s an argument that’s since been levelled against Obama, when he dared to suggest that “we can’t completely remake society in a minute”, earning the first black American president some swift “OK, boomer” dismissals and Oprah Winfrey, who last week made the mistake of recommending the much-discussed new novel American Dirt, by Jeanine Cummins, which has been accused of cultural appropriation.Part of growing up is learning that your elders are fallible. But a bigger part is seeing them fully, their weaknesses but also their strengths. Because as any therapist will tell you, sitting around and blaming your parents for everything doesn’t get you far, and trashing your house just means you live in a mess. Generational ides, aside from being cliched, accomplish less than nothing, as the last general election in this country proved. Maybe Obama (winner of two elections) might actually have some insights into how you sway mass opinion maybe that most reviled of British boomers, Tony Blair (winner of three), might, too. In a world where newness is all, and your every device is telling you to update to the latest version, it’s easy to forget that sometimes there are older stories worth learning from.Gosh darn it, kids, go upstairs and do your damn homework!"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/60684842570c8a120aa6cddbad7909b0901a9511/0_37_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=551bea1e5d941c2818161bdedcdfe140","title":"are you a woman who has experienced insolvency in later life","story":"If you have been insolvent over the age of 65, we would like to hear from youAccording to the government’s Insolvency Service, the number of personal insolvencies in England and Wales climbed to a nine-year high last year.We’d like to hear from women who have had to face insolvency.

Photographer Tristram Kenton went to watch the Royal Opera House’s fast and furious new production of Gerald Barry’s opera take shape• Alice’s Adventures Under Ground is at the Royal Opera House, London from 3-9 Februaryby Tristram Kenton,  Mee-Lai Stone and  Imogen Tilden“I’m definitely free-range organic,” jokes Bloom, playing Humpty Dumpty. McDonald, as well as directing, has designed it all – sets, props and every costume. “Everyone’s basic costume is Victorian underwear they put their other costumes on top. I’ve been working on it for about two years. I said that a condition of my agreeing to do the production was that we had to have all the costumes and the props in rehearsal from the very beginning. That meant we could solve problems as we went along.”“The scene changes are all incredibly fast,” says McDonald. “The bottles turn to cakes in the blink of an eye, or the White Queen has to be an Oyster and then back to the White Queen. I spent a long time trying to work out how you could go from scene to scene and make the costume changes work. Barry gives very precise stage directions. If I haven’t honoured every single one of them, I’ve tried to honour the spirit of all of them.”Some of Barry’s precise stage directions include: “The scene should go like the wind …Players are guillotined randomly … Soldiers come running in through the wood, at first in twos and threes, and then at last in such crowds that they seem to fill the whole forest. They trip over something or other, and whenever one goes down, several more fall over him, so that the ground is soon covered with heaps of men.” An old, hairless teddy belonging to Barry’s partner’s brother inspired the stutterings of the White Queen, carefully annotated by Barry. “When you turn it over slowly,” he told an interviewer, “it groans a glissando from E to G. If you shake it while turning it upside-down, it produces a staccato gasp – a little cruel, I know.”The entire opera is under an hour long and is showing twice an evening on the Royal Opera House’s main stage, with two separate casts. Claudia Boyle is one of the two sopranos singing the role of Alice. “I love the humour of Barry’s music. It’s like an assault on the senses because it’s an experience as well as great music. He really pushes the orchestra and the singers to their limits. The opening scales and arpeggios as Alice falls down the rabbit hole are particularly extreme. It’s great – every coloratura soprano’s dream!”“The opera is relatively short but everything is packed in. I’m on stage most of the time … It’s intense but I love it. It feeds my soprano ego,” jokes Boyle, who originally studied as a cellist but swapped to singing “because I was sick of being in the pit and decided I wanted to be on stage!”“When I was a child I didn’t particularly take to the books,” says Boyle. “I always thought there was a darkness to them. These larger than life characters that are all a bit psychotic. Alice is a really strong girl, a great character to play. She questions things, she stands up to people rather than cowers, and she navigates herself through this rather frightening world pretty well. I much prefer playing strong characters.”I love Barry’s music. His compositions are a Frankenstein mashup of found sounds, whistles, shouts and spoken words, of snatches of tunes, old music hall songs, ear-worms from symphonies and sonatas, that he then tears to pieces and puts together again like papier mache. And then he turns it on its head because it’s so much fun. Thomas Adès“My job is to be the one point of stability in all this. The circus master if you like. His writing is very precise. He knows exactly what he wants and shows you how he wants it, when to go up in the voice, when to go down, what rhythm and when to leave tiny pauses. He reminds me of Beckett or Pinter - the pauses are as important as the music, and brilliantly convey the deep weirdness of the characters Alice encounters,” says Adès.“This is an opera for ages two to 102. Carroll’s Alice books are for the child that’s still in all of us,” says Adès. “Opera feeds the soul,” says Boyle. “It’s visceral. It’s truthful. It moves you. It’s our job to try and open it up and get more people to come to it. Works like this bring in new audiences that you hope can then grow up with opera.”Tenor Sam Furness (below) plays the White Rabbit, the Mad Hatter, Tweedledum, a fawn, a train passenger, the White King, a bottle and a cake. “It’s definitely up there in terms of the more extraordinary roles I’ve sung,” says Furness. “I’ve got something like 12 costume changes which all happen within a 45-minute long piece. We don’t really know where we are, we’re just being rushed along to the next thing by our dressers. At one point I have a one-and-a-half minute costume change so I can relax and take a breath. Which is nice.”“It’s exhilarating and terrifying, but I’m an adrenaline junkie so I love it,” says Furness. “Musically it’s pretty fast and furious, whatever we’re singing, and very, very high – I think I’ve used up all my high notes. Just in one two-minute section we counted the other day we’ve got 55 top Bs and six top Cs, which is like a month’s worth normally.”A male dancer – here with the author’s face as if tattooed on his chest – represents Lewis Carroll who comes and goes throughout McDonald’s production. It’s his and Alice’s dream, says McDonald.I hope people will come away feeling stimulated and excited. It’s like a kind of explosion – throwing lots of things up in the air and then they finally settle. Anything that explodes your brain is good for you, isn’t it? Antony McDonaldBarry has made a few interpolations: the Queen of Hearts’s croquet match has become a singing masterclass with Alice and orchestra in a battle of scales and arpeggios. The gyres and gimbles of Jabberwocky are shouted in German, French and Russian. At the end, instead of Alice waking up, there’s something more melancholy. “I’ve got Alice killing the White Queen as well as the Red Queen,” says McDonald, “although that’s not in Barry’s score.” It’s a valedictory moment. Leaving childhood behind."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/616dbf199ff2caea8da84106c7510bbaa852f760/0_0_4201_2521/master/4201.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f6d941c13236c320297fa6a7dde69dd6","title":"from entry to exit what did eu membership mean for britain podcast","story":"John Palmer was the ’s correspondent in Brussels in 1973 when the UK entered the European Economic Community.

A triumph of dogged negotiation by May then, briefly, Johnson, has fulfilled the most pointless, masochistic ambition ever dreamed of in the history of these islands. The rest of the world, presidents Putin and Trump excepted, have watched on in astonishment and dismay. A majority voted in December for parties which supported a second referendum. But those parties failed lamentably to make common cause. We must pack up our tents, perhaps to the sound of church bells, and hope to begin the 15-year trudge, back towards some semblance of where we were yesterday with our multiple trade deals, security, health and scientific co-operation and a thousand other useful arrangements.We endured a numbing complicity between government and opposition. The door out of Europe was held open by Corbyn for Johnson to walk through. In this case, if you travelled far enough to the left, you met and embraced the right coming the other way.What did we learn in our blindness? That those not flourishing within the status quo had no good reason to vote for it that our prolonged parliamentary chaos derived from an ill-posed yes-no question to which there were a score of answers that the long-evolved ecology of the EU has profoundly shaped the flora of our nation’s landscape and to rip these plants out will be brutal that what was once called a hard Brexit became soft by contrast with the threatened no-deal that even now persists that any mode of departure, by the government’s own estimate, will shrink the economy that we have a gift for multiple and bitter ision – young against old, cities against the country, graduates against early school-leavers, Scotland and Northern Ireland against England and Wales that all past, present and future international trade deals or treaties are a compromise with sovereignty, as is our signature on the Paris accords, or our membership of Nato, and that therefore “Take Back Control” was the emptiest, most cynical promise of this sorry season.We surprised ourselves. Only a few years ago, asked to list the nation’s ills – wealth gap, ailing NHS, north-south imbalance, crime, terrorism, austerity, housing crisis etc – most of us would not have thought to include our membership of the EU. How happy we were in 2012, in the afterglow of our successful Olympics. We weren’t thinking then of Brussels. It was, in Guy Verhofstadt’s famous term, a “cat-fight” within the Tory party that got us going. Those cats had been fighting each other for decades. When they dragged us in and urged us to take sides, we had a collective nervous breakdown then sufficient numbers wanted the distress to go away and “get Brexit done”. Repeated ad nauseam by the prime minister it almost seemed impolite to ask why.In the early days of the referendum campaign we learned that “on the doorstep” it was all about migration but we also learned that it was the UK’s decision, not the EU’s, to allow unlimited migration from the accession countries before the permitted seven years were up it was the UK’s choice to allow EU migrants to stay more than six months without a job it was the UK that successfully campaigned to enlarge the EU eastwards it is the UK, not the EU, that lets non-EU migration continue (and why not?) as EU migration declines. We also learned that the UK, not the EU, opted for our maroon rather than patriotic blue passports. Though, as I look, my old passports seem almost black.There is much that is historically unjust about the British state, but very little of that injustice derives from the EU. Brussels didn’t insist that we neglect the post-industrial towns of the Midlands and the north or demand that we let wages stagnate, or permit multimillion handouts to the CEOs of failing companies, or prefer shareholder value over the social good, or run our health service, social care and Sure Start into the ground, close 600 police stations and let the fabric of our state schools decay.Hedge fund owners, plutocrat donors to the cause, Etonians and newspaper proprietors cast themselves as enemies of the elite. More magic dust. The claim that the Northern Ireland issue has been settled is a dangerous pretence. We have witnessed reasoned argument’s fall from grace. The Brexit impulse had strong elements of blood-and-soil, with hints of Empire nostalgia. Such spooky longings floated high above mere facts.We acquired an argot. “Article 50”, “frictionless trade”, “just in time”, “the backstop” – how they tripped off the tongue. We learned to respect an “invisible border”. Before it all began, only a very few knew the difference between the customs union and the single market. Three years on, not much has changed. A survey last year showed that quite a lot of us thought that “crashing out” was the same as remaining. If only.The Brexit leadership and the leader of the opposition were always in a hurry to start article 50’s two-year stopwatch. They feared that leave voters might change their minds, that those who didn’t vote last time were 2:1 for remaining, and that young voters coming on to the rolls would be mostly pro-EU. The Brexiter generals reasonably feared a second referendum.At least, we can all agree that we will be a bit poorer. As one of my school teachers used to say, if a thing is really worth doing, it’s worth doing badly. Theresa May could never bring herself to say that Brexit would make us better off. She wouldn’t even tell us if she would vote to leave in a second referendum. We should credit her honesty. By contrast, Boris Johnson, laying his post-Brexit vision before parliament, promised he would narrow the UK’s wealth and opportunity gap between north and south, and make it the home of cutting-edge battery technology. He forgot to mention that the EU never stood in the way of either project.Redefining our new trade relations with the EU will preoccupy us for years. As for the US position, take a long walk in the American midwest and you’ll go a month across a monoculture desert and not see a wildflower. To compete, our own agriculture would have to welcome the hormone hypodermic. Our farmers will need to est of inefficient hedgerows, boundary trees and three-metre field margins – museum pieces all. When it was in trade talks with the EU, the US wouldn’t contemplate higher standards of husbandry, food standards and environmental protection, even though they would have granted access to half a billion consumers. American farming corporations will not be changing their ways for a nation of a mere 65 million. If we want a deal, it is we who must downgrade.We sense damage and diminishment ahead. In a dangerous world crowded with loud-mouthed “strongmen”, the EU was our best hope for an open, tolerant, free and peaceful community of nations. Those hopes are already threatened as populist movements have swept across Europe. Our withdrawal will weaken resistance to the xenophobic tendency. The lesson of our nation’s history these past centuries is plain: turmoil in continental Europe will draw us into bloody conflicts. Nationalism is rarely a project for peace. Nor does it care to counter climate change. It prefers to let tropical forests and the Australian bush burn.Take a road trip from Greece to Sweden, from Portugal to Hungary. Leave your passport behind. What a rich, teeming bundle of civilisations – in food, manners, architecture, language, and each nation state profoundly and proudly different from its neighbours. No evidence of being under the boot-heel of Brussels. Nothing here of continental USA’s dreary commercial sameness. Summon everything you’ve learned of the ruinous, desperate state of Europe in 1945, then contemplate a stupendous economic, political and cultural achievement: peace, open borders, relative prosperity, and the encouragement of inidual rights, tolerance and freedom of expression. Until Friday this was where our grown-up children went at will to live and work.That’s over, and for now the force is with English nationalism. Its champion is Johnson’s Vote Leave cabinet whose monument will forever be a special kind of smirk, perfected back in the days of the old Soviet Union. I’m lying, you know I’m lying and I know that you know and I don’t give a damn. As in, “The five-week prorogation of parliament has nothing to do with Brexit.” Michael Gove and Jacob Rees-Mogg were masters of the mocking grin. The supreme court’s inconvenient judgment that this prorogation was illegal clearly still rankles. Recently, the ex-home secretary Michael Howard was set on to murmur against the judges. Extending political control over an independent judiciary would be consonant with the Johnson-Cummings project. Victor Orbán of Hungary lights the way.The remainers held out for a kinder sort of world, but we were always the herbivores in this debate, with our enormous, good-natured and derided marches – “a hate-filled crowd”, the Sun “an elite”, the Daily . If 16 million remainers are an elite, then we may rejoice that the UK is a model of meritocracy.We were, in truth, the left-behinds. By the grace of Corbyn and his grim lieutenants, we had no effective voice in parliament. On her first day as prime minister, Theresa May promised outside No 10 that she would govern for us all. Instead, she threw half the country to the dogs to appease her party’s right wing. Initially, Boris Johnson’s elevation was decided by a tiny, ageing constituency, the majority of whose members told pollsters that they wished Donald Trump ruled Britain and that they longed for the return of hanging. In similar spirit, Johnson found fresh depths of populist vulgarity when he spoke last June of pitchforking the EU incubus off the nation’s back. He has realised his dream.As for the outer extremes, we never stabbed and shot a Brexiter MP to death in the street we only rarely inclined to sending anonymous death and rape threats such as came so abundantly the way of Gina Miller, Anna Soubry and many female MPs. However, the antisemitic emails from within the Labour party were a disgrace. So too was the bullying mob jeering outside the Rees-Mogg home. But we remainers did not slyly exhort our compatriots to riot in the event of a second referendum going against us. Nearly two-thirds of the electorate did not vote to leave most of business and the trade unions, agriculture, science, finance and the arts were against the Brexit project three-quarters of MPs voted to remain. But our representatives ignored the evident public interest and shrank behind party cabals and “the people have spoken” – that bleak Soviet locution – followed by “get Brexit done”, the mind-clouding magic dust which has blinded reason and diminished our children’s prospects."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8cbab84eb20561a76bdc51e09e13e9b3df214d57/0_0_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5677247e5ff8011092e53eda1b3eff15","title":"britons board their last eurostar as eu citizens","story":"Travellers leaving Paris admit they are uncertain about what the future holds post-BrexitThree hours before Brexit, Eurostar 9061 pulled out of Gare du Nord, pushing steadily through the grimy suburbs of northern Paris, picking up speed across the flat plains of Picardy, through the Channel tunnel and onwards to St Pancras.The 8.13pm service was the last train on the last day of Britain’s 47-year membership of the European Union. For many on board, it was also the last European journey they would be making as an EU citizens. For most, it was a bit of a moment.Some had actively made it so. “We decided to mark this day because … we could,” said Nik Brown, 27, a Southampton vet, who with his friends Hannah de Spon, 34, and Mairead Ralph, 35, had caught the early train out to spend 11 hours in Paris.“We saw the Eiffel Tower and the Arc de Triomphe,” said De Spon, an animator. “We went to animé shops that’s our thing. We had a cafe lunch. Everyone was so friendly, like they wanted to make our day. It just feels like we’re kicking them in the teeth.”Brexit was “so silly, and wasteful”, said Brown, his UK passport stashed in an ‘I voted remain’ cover. “It seems so obvious we’re better as a community coming together, not pushing apart. So anyway, we decided, at Christmas, to have today in Paris – our last day as Europeans.”Others had only just clicked. “It realised as I was boarding,” said James O’Leary, 26, a software sales executive who travels to Paris once a week. “It was, yes, a moment. Rather a melancholy one. I think maybe none of us yet appreciates quite how much of a deal this is. Maybe we won’t fully understand what we’re missing until it’s gone.”Concretely, of course, very little will change for these travellers before the transition period ends next January. The 11 million passengers who take a Eurostar train each year will still have to show their passports, twice – Britain has never joined the passport-free Schengen zone.But today was nonetheless a moment, agreed Pirashani Umassudan, 22, a student returning from a three-day break in the French capital. “It just means I’m losing a part of my identity,” she said. “A part that’s to do with acceptance, inclusion, union, friends. It’s not a good feeling.”Callum McRobbie, 29, and Verity McQueenie, 26, from Northamptonshire, were on their way back from Disneyland Paris and wondering whether the next time they made the trip they might need to queue in the non-EU passports lane, with a visa.“It feels quite surreal,” said McRobbie, a painter and decorator. “People are really devastated.” Brexit was doing damage all around, he said: a close Polish friend had gone home because of the uncertainty he was not sure when, or if, he would return.McQueenie, a deputy sister in an A\u0026ampE ward, said her hospital was “really struggling. We’re losing people, lots of Europeans, and having trouble recruiting new ones.” The whole project, in fact, felt wrong, McRobbie said.“I don’t like ides,” he said. “It just feels … like we’re putting up barriers, a fence is going up between us.” Nearly 50 years his senior, John Earwicker, a retired charity worker from Abingdon returning from a city break in Paris, felt the same.“I feel it most keenly for my grandchildren,” he said. “The freedom we’ve had, to travel, work, live on a continent to which we are so closely tied by our culture and our heritage … They won’t have. And on the basis of such empty, meaningless slogans. This is a very sad occasion. I’m going to be crying into my cocoa tonight.”William Healing, a orce lawyer working mainly for French clients in London, was relieved his EU citizenship was secure: his mother was French and he has two passports. But it didn’t stop him being angry.“This train feels like its going to turn into a pumpkin under the Channel,” he said. “We just have no idea what we’re heading into. People are going to wake up next January and say, ‘Oh, but I didn’t know this would change, or that.’ We’re going to look back on this whole thing one day and marvel at what we did. It’s madness.”Queuing earlier in the day at the Gare du Nord, Claire Booth, 45, a day nursery manager from Lincoln, said she was “just gutted”. Returning from Paris with her partner, Mark, 46, from seeing the Birmingham indie rock band Editors in concert, the couple said the uncertainty was the worst.“It’s the unknown,” said Mark. “I mean, what will Brexit actually look like? After three years, it’s staggering that we still don’t know.” Hours before Britain was due to formally leave the EU, said Claire, “no one can actually envisage Britain being better off because of Brexit”.Glenn Berry, 34, was returning to London from the Paris Fintech Forum, a big annual event in the financial technology world’s calendar. He wondered how painless the same journey would be in 2021.Beyond the possible hurdles to travel, he said, Brexit was already disrupting his professional life: “My company is moving its head office to Amsterdam. Some are going to Luxembourg. We know regulations will change we just have no idea how.”But the deeper disruption was emotional. “All my life, I’ve had a European identity I’ve been lucky enough to have options,” Berry said. “Obviously, we’ll still be a part of Europe on some level. But it feels like we’re saying goodbye to a part of what we are.”French nationals taking the train were equally downbeat. “This is obviously a momentous day, a terribly sad day you’re abandoning this project after nearly 50 years,” said Natalie Delassalle, 47, a public relations executive who takes the Eurostar twice a month for meetings in London.“Honestly, I can’t see why you’re doing it. I don’t understand. I don’t envy you – and not just the passport hassle. You’re on your own now, and the world feels like quite a hostile place. Good luck.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/583ae0064f2cc9da9e03f72f4cb588943ce11e8b/519_214_1827_1096/master/1827.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=407195855510c43c009c1d985a9e8085","title":"david cameron accounts brexit vote 2016","story":"Former prime minister’s company accounts are made public on UK’s final day in EUDavid Cameron has made more than £1.6m since he quit as prime minister following the Brexit vote in 2016.The accounts for the Office of David Cameron, which were made public on the UK’s final day as a member of the European Union, show that he made £836,168 in the year to 30 April 2019.The previous year’s accounts show a profit of £790,274 with his total earnings since the company was established reaching £1.63m.The accounts do not provide detail on how much the former prime minister has been making from speaking engagements, and book and other media deals, but they do show that an investment property valued at £128,190 was bought last April.

With a lump in its throat and a poignant song of farewell – or with cheers and a raised middle finger of defiant good riddance? The answer that Britain gave at 11pm on Friday 31 January 2020 was: both. The UK broke from the European Union on a late winter’s night with both jubilation and regret, as ided on the day of leaving as it had been in deciding to leave. For some Britons, this was Independence Day. For others, it was a national bereavement.In Westminster, Nigel Farage exulted with his fellow Brexiters in Parliament Square, delighted that a prize they had sought for a quarter century, and that once seemed laughably improbable, was in their hands at last. “We did it,” he told the ecstatic crowd. “We transformed the landscape of our country.” At the stroke of 11pm, he led a chorus of the national anthem.In Downing Street, a countdown clock had beamed on to the outside walls as if impatient for the moment, like children waiting for Christmas. Inside, Boris Johnson – who had been the face and totem of the Vote Leave campaign of 2016 – hailed “the dawn of a new era”, the curtain going up on “a new act in our great national drama”. Surrounded by cabinet colleagues and veterans of the referendum campaign, the prime minister toasted their success with English sparkling wine, washing down a Brexit day feast of roast beef, Yorkshire pudding and Shropshire blue cheese, a spread pointedly free of the taint of the dreaded continent. Along the Mall, union jacks fluttered brightly.There was merch for those who wanted it: you could buy a Got Brexit Done tea-towel, perhaps using a handful of commemorative Brexit 50p pieces. If you were in Morley, you could join Andrea Jenkyns’ Big Brexit Bash, to celebrate what the Yorkshire MP called an end to “a hellish four years” and the start of what was sure to be “a golden decade”, with Britons at last in charge of their own destiny, free of the shackles of Brussels. Sunderland, first to declare for leave in 2016, had the joy of hosting a special Brexit day meeting of the cabinet.Melancholy was the mood of a procession on Friday afternoon from Downing Street to the London offices of the European commission, staged, the organisers said, “to say goodbye to our old friend”. Clad in blue and gold, they numbered just a few hundred: hard to believe that a million or more marched in their cause a matter of months ago. In Frome, Somerset, they gathered for a late-night vigil at an installation known as the European Community of Stones, a semi-circular henge of 12 boulders, one quarried from each of the EU’s 12 members when it was built in 1992. They sang the EU anthem, Ode to Joy, in recognition of the “sense of excitement, of opportunity, the EU represented”, said local Green party councillor Martin Dimery. For him, the EU was “the greatest international project for peace, prosperity and progress”, and now Britain will play no part in it. What was the point of a ceremony to mark that fact? “Every death deserves a funeral.”That elegiac quality has been a constant note sounded through these final days of UK membership, expressed most intensely in that widely shared footage of the European parliament rising to its feet to sing Auld Lang Syne to a departing Britain (confirming this is a wrench for them as well as us). It was the sadness of saying goodbye not to an institution, but to an idea – of friendship across the sea, of harmony between nations, of a resolve that a continent riven by the bloodiest of wars would live out its future in peace.So while Downing Street had its clock, remainers had a projection of their own: a film beamed on to the white cliffs of Dover, featuring two veterans of the second world war, both in their 90s, speaking of their sadness at the coming of this hour. They would miss the “comradeship” of the European Union, they said, adding the hope that “we will be back together before too long”. The film, the work of the Led by Donkeys group, ended with an image of a single gold star from the European flag. “This is our star,” said the message. “Look after it for us.”And that was the plea contained in so many remainer goodbyes, the hope that this is not forever. That afternoon procession in Whitehall was headlined “À bientôt EU, see you soon.” A departing Scottish MEP asked the EU 27 “to leave a light on, so we can find our way home.”The Royal Society of Literature posted an image from AA Milne: Winnie the Pooh and Piglet, hand in hand, walking into the sunset, above the caption, “But, of course, it isn’t really Good-bye, because the Forest will always be there… and anybody who is Friendly with Bears can find it.”Farage was having none of that, of course. “Once we have left we are never coming back and the rest is detail,” he had said, in his parting shot to the European parliament, before, in a metaphor made flesh, he had his microphone cut off by the chair: Brexit party MEPs had broken parliamentary rules by waving union jack flags. “Put your flags away … and take them with you,” the chair said. “You are leaving.”So for all Johnson’s talk of healing, there was no agreement between leave and remain at the moment of parting – except on one thing. Both saw 11pm as chiming in an epochal shift in the history of these islands. True, nothing material altered at that moment. The UK that wakes up on Saturday will still have to stick to EU rules and pay into the EU budget, albeit without any say, until 31 December. Britons can still go through the EU citizens line at the airport. Things will only get real on the first day of 2021.In that sense, 11pm ushered in a period of Brexit nirvana for Boris Johnson. For the next 11 months, he will have the best of both worlds: he can say he’s got Brexit done, and enjoy the benefits of EU membership. All the political gain, with none of the economic pain. Truly, he will have his cake and eat it.Still, leaving the EU marks the biggest change in our national life since 1973, when Britain joined, if not since 1945, given that today’s EU is so much larger and more significant than the Common Market of 47 years ago. The new political landscape will be wholly different. The pressure for Scottish independence will be greater than ever: at 11pm Scotland was taken out of the EU against its will. Irish unification will have a new, pressing logic, one that will only increase as Britain erges from the EU, thickening that border down the Irish Sea. Meanwhile, Westminster, and especially Conservative, politics will have lost its perennial bogeyman, its reliable scapegoat for all ills: Brussels.Some remainers believe – and maybe even hope – that the shine will come off Brexit pretty soon. They point to new government advice warning citizens that, come next year, they could face roaming charges when they use their phones on the continent that they’ll need health insurance or a special driving licence or a visa to work or study that they’ll have to queue in the slower, non-EU lane at the airport. Remainers still have their charts, projecting a UK economy turned anaemic once Britain goes it alone. They are poised, ready to declare: “I told you so.”But all that is over the horizon. For now, Britain has made one of its periodic shifts away from the continent, in a relationship that has blown hot and cold for at least 1,200 years. Even the eighth century King Offa of Mercia fretted about trading links across the Channel. In that long sweep of history, the 47 years we spent as Britain-in-Europe might come to look like a blip. Alternatively, so might Brexit. Those draped in blue-and-gold flags could be right: Britain might one day be back, even if all but the most optimistic rejoiners believe that day is decades away.In Parliament Square, site of hoarse slanging matches for the past four years, the crowds on both sides were thinner on Friday night, at least before the Farage rally got going. The leavers were beaming, proud in their sweatshirts bearing the slogan: Job Done. They believe spring is coming. The remainers were wrapped up against the cold, braced against a January night, which, to them, felt like the bleakest midwinter."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/75843a9541dadd4c9a8cbe9b8f715f7956c6e4ba/769_769_2179_1308/master/2179.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d78f67f5003e61249ad788a20e77b071","title":"judge orders welsh tories lift suspension assembly member nick ramsay","story":"Judge finds in favour of Nick Ramsay after he was arrested and released without chargeThe leader of the Welsh Conservatives has been ordered by a high court judge to lift the suspension of an assembly member pending further legal action.Nick Ramsay, 44, was suspended from the Tory group after being arrested at his home in Raglan, Monmouthshire, on New Year’s Day. Gwent police released him the following afternoon, saying he would face no further action, but his suspension remained.Ramsay is suing Paul Davies, the leader of the Welsh Conservatives, at the high court.At a hearing in Bristol, Judge Jonathan Russen QC ordered the lifting of the suspension until a trial into the matter takes place in February. “In my judgment, it is appropriate that he is restored to the membership of the group,” Russen said.The court heard Ramsay was elected to the Welsh assembly in 2007 and became a member of the Conservative group.He was arrested on the evening of 1 January and spent the night in custody in Newport before being released without charge the following day. At 1.31pm on 2 January, Davies emailed Ramsay to tell him he had “no option” but to suspend him from the Welsh Conservatives.Representing Ramsay, David Lock QC said Davies “lacked the power” to do so and had not conformed to the rules of the group’s constitution. In a written statement, Ramsay said he was at his “wits’ end” and sought the assistance of the high court to end the stalemate.Richard Price QC, representing Davies, asked for an adjournment to prepare for the case as he had been given less than 24 hours’ notice.Price said eight members of the 11-strong assembly group had supported the suspension and it was not the case that Davies had “acted solo”.“The defendant and the other members of the group who are involved in the process are concerned there is a risk, if your lordship were to refuse my application for an adjournment, that this matter would be decided simply on the back of the evidence of the claimant alone,” he told the judge.The judge refused the application for an adjournment and allowed the interim injunction until the case is heard at a three-day trial in February. He said his ruling did not affect the disciplinary processes of the group.Speaking outside court, Ramsay said: “I am disappointed that I had to come to court today to achieve this result. However, I am grateful for the opportunity to continue serving my constituents and discharging my public functions.”The trial is to be listed at a court in either Bristol, Cardiff or London between 19 and 21 February."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bf8543651afbf5577d5b7a316702e61c84768dd2/0_118_3539_2123/master/3539.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8d315d4cbe16a0b7e180aa8d3dddfe2c","title":"keir starmer labour should argue for return of free movement brexit","story":"Leadership frontrunner says party has to make the case for benefits of migrationSir Keir Starmer has said he would argue for the reintroduction of EU free movement after Brexit, if he becomes Labour’s next leader.The shadow Brexit secretary said his party must not be afraid to argue for free movement, and that EU citizens should receive “rights, not tolerance” from the UK.“We need to make the wider case on immigration,” he said, speaking at a leadership event at Westminster Cathedral in London.“We welcome migrants, we don’t scapegoat them. Low wages, poor housing, poor public services, are not the fault of people who come here: they’re political failure. So we have to make the case for the benefits of migration for the benefits of free movement.“I want people in this country to be able to go and work abroad, in Europe and I want people in Europe to be able to come and work here. I want families to be able to live together – whether that’s in Europe, or here.”Asked whether that meant he would argue for free movement to be restored, he replied: “Of course: bring back, argue for, challenge.”Friday will mark the start of what is likely to be an uphill battle to get a trade deal done by the end of the year, not to mention all the non-trade issues that must also be resolved including security and intelligence cooperation, fisheries, data, education and research collaboration.Although everyday life will remain the same and the UK will remain in the single market and the customs union until the end of the year as part of transition arrangements, the withdrawal agreement will be a legally binding international treaty that comes into force. It carries sanctions for any “backsliding or half measures”, as Michel Barnier’s adviser Stefaan de Rynck has pointed out.We know little of the plans for the negotiations, and parliamentary scrutiny of Brexit has been restricted. The House of Lords EU committee has invited but failed to get Stephen Barclay to appear to explain the next stages, sources say.While business has been clamouring for the government to reveal its Brexit vision beyond the joint aspiration of a tariff-free, quota-free deal, little is known about Boris Johnson’s specific goals.Expect plenty of sabre-rattling on both sides, but negotiations are unlikely to begin before March. The European commission kicked off its 30-stage process in agreeing its negotiating goals before Christmas and these are expected to be signed off by member states at a meeting on 25 February.David Frost, who replaced Oliver Robbins as the chief negotiator, is expected to lead a team of about 30 calling on expert knowledge from civil servants and trade experts. Some have suggested the government should hire as many as possible from the Canadian team that sealed Canada’s new deal with the EU.\u0026nbspThis remains the single most contentious part of the Brexit deal because of the checks on goods crossing the Irish Sea. De Rynck said in January that the EU and the UK would have to be “very disciplined” if they were to get a new system for trading in Northern Ireland ready for 31 December.Brussels and Irish political leaders are already alarmed by Johnson’s repeated declarations that there will be no checks on goods crossing the Irish Sea, even though some of these will be mandatory.Helen McEntee, Ireland’s minister for European affairs has contradicted him directly, telling Sky News’s Sophy Ridge: “There will be no checks\u0026nbspNorthern Ireland businesses have urged the government to set up a working group urgently so that the detail of the checks can be determined quickly.Freedom of movement will formally end when the UK leaves the EU on Friday evening – though the accompanying rights will be retained during the transition period, which is due to end on 31 December.Starmer appeared to be arguing for a new, but similar, arrangement to be negotiated reciprocally, as part of negotiations about the UK’s future relationship with the EU27.By contrast, Boris Johnson’s government plans to introduce a points-based migration regime that would no longer give EU citizens a free pass.Speaking on Brexit day, Starmer urged his colleagues, some of whom have been ardent remainers, to “let go”.“We leave the EU tonight, and the leaveremain ide goes with it. That ide has cut across families, communities, regions, the country. And we need to let that ide go. Leaveremain ends tonight, and that includes for the Labour party.”Starmer appears to be the frontrunner in the Labour leadership race, with 85 nominations from constituency Labour parties (CLPs) so far, against 44 for Rebecca Long-Bailey and 18 for Lisa Nandy.Asked whether Labour’s policy of supporting a referendum, which he was instrumental in pushing the party to adopt, had damaged its electoral prospects, he said there were many reasons for December’s election result.“Brexit of course was among them. But the argument that Brexit alone was the reason – and we would have soared to victory untroubled, without Brexit – is just plain wrong,” he insisted, adding that the public had lost trust in Labour as “a force for good”.He denied it had been a mistake for Labour not to back Theresa May’s Brexit deal, which could have meant a closer economic relationship than that Johnson is expected to negotiate.“Theresa May’s deal was a bad deal. It didn’t protect trade union rights, workplace rights, environmental rights, consumer rights. It was a bad deal which would lead to a very, very hard Brexit and we were right to oppose it. Let’s not rewrite that. Let’s not pretend that it was a good deal, somehow.”The first stage of the contest was for potential contenders to get the backing of 22 fellow MPs by 13 January. Five MPs passed this threshold: Keir Starmer (88 nominations),\u0026nbsp Rebecca Long-Bailey (33), Lisa Nandy (31), Jess Phillips (23) and Emily Thornberry (23).The ballot of members and registered supporters opens a week later on 21 February, and closes at noon on 2 April. To be eligible to vote you must have been a Labour member on 20 January, or have applied to have become a £25 registered supporter by 16 January.Corbyn’s successor will be announced at a special conference in London on 4 April.Starmer also criticised Johnson, saying he was the worst of the three Tory prime ministers he has seen since he became an MP in 2015. He described him as a man “without any principle or anchor”.“We don’t give up on the fight for a close economic relationship which protects our jobs and our economy. We don’t give up on the argument that we need to collaborate and cooperate with our EU partners, on scientific research, medical research, arts, culture, education. We don’t give up on the argument on security either,” he said.“We need to give our EU citizens rights, not tolerance: and that starts with the right to vote.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/94b8d294b86c19908253c675c147f504355f1d35/414_684_3011_1807/master/3011.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a7065aaa60cb0efc07f2ff9aa10190a1","title":"the ins and outs of brexit in pictures","story":"On 31 January, the UK will finally leave the European Union after years of tense negotiations, resignations and a controversial prorogation.

All three men remain in custody.A 47-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of threatening behaviour but later released from custody and will not face any further action.In Glasgow, there was a heavy police presence in the city centre as groups for and against Brexit held events near each other.Pro-EU campaigners gathered at the Donald Dewar statue on Buchanan Street before the official departure time of 11pm.Police said one 25-year-old man was arrested for a minor disorder offence.Supt Mark Sutherland said: “A proportionate policing response was in place to ensure public safety and minimise disruption to the wider city centre community. The events passed peacefully with only one arrest.”The Police Service of Northern Ireland said there had been no arrests at a celebration in Belfast.The Green MEP Catherine Rowett marks her return from Brussels this morning with a “European breakfast”. In case you missed it, here we answer all your questions about your post-Brexit rights. Welsh remainers mourning the UK’s departure from the EU are set to hold a rally in Cardiff this morning.Former Labour leadership contender Jess Phillips on how she feels on the UK’s first morning outside of the EU:This is from the BBC Brussels correspondent Adam Fleming, who has been among the team presenting BBC’s Brexitcast for more than two-and-a-half years. Parliament Square has returned to normal following the Brexit celebrations on Friday night.Little remained of the Leave Means Leave event other than some discarded union jacks and muddy footprints on the grass.Street cleaners were sweeping away the remnants of the party while staging used by speakers including Nigel Farage had been removed overnight.The European council president, Charles Michel, has responded to Brexit with a Monty Python reference, tweeting: “Always look on the bright side”.Above a picture of the white cliffs of England’s south coast, Michel said it was a “tribute to the late Terry Jones”, the Python star who directed Life Of Brian, the film featuring the song Always Look on the Bright Side of Life.In a message to Britons, the European parliament’s Brexit coordinator, Guy Verhofstadt, said he would “work to ensure the EU is a project you’ll want to be a part of again soon”.Earlier on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, the former Brexit secretary David Davis said it would be a “fair race” to strike a trade deal with the EU by 2021 but that it “can be done”.He said extensive work had already been completed when he was in the cabinet to analyse every free trade deal Brussels had previously struck with other third countries.Davis said: “There’s the possibility of a trade deal taking pieces from all the other trade deals that the European Union has done and therefore cannot undermine the single market.“It is going to be a fair race to do it right now because it was going to be 21 months, now it is only 11, but nevertheless it can be done in the time period.”On what more border and customs checks will mean for Northern Ireland, the Fine Gael senator Neale Richmond told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme:Well certainly that responsibility is up to the British government. But if the British government do want to go for this very hard Brexit then it is the people of Northern Ireland that will be separated more greatly from Great Britain.Brexit becoming a reality is splashed across the papers this morning, but the front page treatments vary wildly. From “Rise and shine” in the  to “What next?” in the i, here is our wrap of what the papers say about Britain leaving the EU.Keir Starmer said he would argue for the reintroduction of EU free movement after Brexit if he becomes Labour’s next leader.The shadow Brexit secretary said his party must not be afraid to argue for free movement, and that EU citizens should receive “rights, not tolerance” from the UK.“We need to make the wider case on immigration,” he told a leadership event at Westminster Cathedral in London on Friday.“We welcome migrants, we don’t scapegoat them. Low wages, poor housing, poor public services, are not the fault of people who come here: they’re political failure. So we have to make the case for the benefits of migration for the benefits of free movement.”In 2016, the  spoke to jubilant leave campaigners featured on the Daily Mail’s front page the day after the referendum. Some of those in the photograph criticised David Cameron for his decision to quit as prime minister, expressed concern at racist attacks in the wake of the poll, and wondered whether anyone actually had a plan. Frances Perraudin and Matthew Weaver went back to ask for their reflections on one of the most turbulent periods in British political history.’s Brussels bureau chief spoke to the UK’s nine surviving permanent representatives to the EU before Brexit.Spanning the premierships of Ted Heath to Boris Johnson, it’s a fantastic insight into the often uneasy relationship Britain has had with the European Union.Nicola Sturgeon, meanwhile, has urged supporters of Scottish independence to stay “focused and united”, while ruling out – for now – holding a consultative referendum that would inevitably be challenged in the courts.Two weeks after the prime minister formally rejected Sturgeon’s request for the legal powers to hold a second referendum, and as a poll put support for independence in the lead – by 51-49 – for the first time since 2015, Sturgeon told an audience of Scottish National party politicians and activists in Edinburgh that she would not “pretend that there are shortcuts or clever wheezes that can magically overcome the obstacles we face”.Describing Brexit day as “one of real and profound sadness … tinged with anger”, Scotland’s first minister said: “What we in the independence movement must not do is allow a sense of frustration – understandable though it is – to take us down dead ends or weaken our sense of purpose.”Jon Henley has written a good explainer on what has actually changed, why Brexit is far from “done” and what to expect over the coming months.Here is a taste of his piece: Yes. The UK has ceased to be a member of the EU. British citizens are no longer EU citizens there are no British MEPs or commissioner British ministers will play no further part in EU law-making no British prime minister will now attend EU summits. The change is legal and constitutional.Because we have entered an 11-month transition period during which pretty much everything will stay as it was while the UK and the EU negotiate their future relationship. Until at least the end of December 2020, Britain will remain in the EU’s single market and customs union and continue paying into its budget people, goods, capital and services will continue to move freely across the bloc – including Britain – as before. In their daily lives, most people will not notice any difference.The political declaration, part of the withdrawal agreement, provides for a June summit to allow both sides to assess how the talks are progressing. By 1 July Britain must decide whether it wants to ask for an extension. A deal on fisheries is also required by the end of June. Beyond that, the EU has said late November is the last date by which an agreement can be concluded if it is to be checked, translated, approved and ratified by the end of the year. In reality, this leaves only about six months of actual negotiating time.Here is the full piece:Welcome to our live coverage of Brexit day +1. It’s the morning after the UK has left the European Union.Britain is now formally no longer a member of the EU but everyday life will remain the same and the UK will remain in the single market and the customs union until the end of the year as part of transition arrangements. We know little of the UK’s plans for the negotiations of the future relationship but EU leaders have told Britain to expect tough trade talks. On the eve of Brexit, Ursula von der Leyen, the European commission president, said she wished Britons well, but vowed to fight for the EU’s interests in the coming negotiations over the future relationship. ’s economics editor, Larry Elliott, has written an analysis, saying Brexit is a chance to fix the British economy’s long-term problems.

The temperature sat above 40 degrees all match and it was Knight who conquered the blistering conditions, smashing 78 runs off 45 balls.Australia mounted a stunning comeback, hitting 22 runs off the final two overs to force the Super Over but England chased the eight runs in four balls.Australia bowled after winning the toss and dominated early, allowing just 29 runs off the power play - the first six overs - but Knight and Fran Wilson (39 not out) responded with a 115-run partnership.Ellyse Perry (1-9) snared the first wicket when Beth Mooney took a screamer at point to dismiss Danni Wyatt (17) in the fifth over. Amy Jones (10 off 24) struggled to get going and under pressure was run out after a direct hit from Jess Jonassen fielding at mid-off.Australia teenage debutant Annabel Sutherland dropped a tough catch off Georgia Wareham (1-15) to keep Knight out there in the ninth over. Perry atoned the mistake later that over after running 20 metres from long-on and taking a sliding catch in the deep to dispatch Natalie Sciver (4).Wilson was dropped in the 18th over and Knight received another reprieve in the 19th as Australia struggled in the field. Knight, who made 67 a day earlier against India, was caught in the final over by Rachael Haynes off Megan Schutt (1-40) as England tallied 156-4.Australia opener Beth Mooney (65 off 45 balls) was sublime before a middle-order collapse put England in control thanks to Sarah Glenn (3-28). But Sutherland (22) led the fightback alongside Delissa Kimmince (15) and both finished unbeaten to steer Australia to 156-8.Left-arm off-spinner Sophie Ecclestone bowled a superb super over, keeping Alyssa Healy and Ashleigh Gardner to just eight runs. Perry bowled for Australia but Knight and Wyatt got there easily.England lost the series opener on Friday to India, who Australia face on Sunday."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3fb39182e6d211d21086666d4dee0f4a99501a79/0_67_3437_2063/master/3437.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b1bcdd1a756b51056acfacd87b5fa77d","title":"talking horses sharjah irish champion hurdle horse racing tips","story":"Selection can surprise the hot favourite, Honeysuckle, on the opening day of the Dublin FestivalIt is not available to viewers of ITV4 but the Irish Champion Hurdle is undoubtedly the big race of the day, with the betting market evidently expecting Honeysuckle to reveal herself as a star. Henry de Bromhead’s mare remains unbeaten but new questions are asked by this step back in trip on drying ground at a track she has never visited.At 2-1 or thereabouts, Sharjah (3.10) is surely the way to go. But for a fall as a novice, he would have won Grade Ones at Leopardstown for the last three Christmases and he should be hard to beat in these conditions. Aramon ran Klassical Dream to a head here a year ago and makes each-way appeal.1.50 Sandown The Contenders Hurdle, which kicks off ITV4’s coverage, is a bit short of actual contenders this year and Call Me Lord deserves to be a strong favourite in the light of his International win. He has twice run well here in the Imperial Cup.2.05 Musselburgh It could be worth giving another chance to Ashington, who was last off the bridle here on New Year’s Day but got tired. That was Brian Hughes’s first ride on this strong traveller and they may do better again this time.2.25 Sandown The worry about Laurina is that she has run below expectations on her last two tries in Grade One company, suffering burst blood vessels when pulled up on Boxing Day. But the conditions of this race make her hard to oppose she is easily the highest rated but gets 7lb from all her rivals. It is a weak-looking Scilly Isles and hopefully she can come through it with flying colours.2.45 Wetherby This drying ground might not be ideal for Dominateur but it is a help to Boldmere, who has made such good progress since joining Caroline Bailey this season.3.00 Sandown With the Fergal O’Brien yard back in form, Ask Dillon has to be of interest on this second run of the season. He ran well for a long way on his reappearance at Chepstow before New Year but blew up in the closing stages. He should be ready to run above his handicap mark this time. Bold Plan is respected but this is quite a big step up in trip on a testing surface.3.15 Musselburgh Having been best of the Brits in two cross-country races at Cheltenham, Chic Name might be worth chancing in this Edinburgh National. He doesn’t do anything quickly but has dropped to a fair mark and first-time cheekpieces may help.3.35 Sandown A winning point-to-pointer who has taken his own sweet time to mature, Deise Aba might now be one to stick with. He had only one rival to beat at Catterick last time but showed enough to suggest we might see something much better this time than when he was fourth at Ascot in November.Even the National Hunt Flat races at the Dublin Racing Festival are worth €100k. There is a total of €1m in prize money on the first day of the meeting on Saturday and €1.125m on day two. And yet, of the 206 horses declared to run at Leopardstown this weekend, only three are stabled in Britain.This is the third running of the DRF, created from the cards featuring Ireland’s Champion Hurdle and Gold Cup which were previously a fortnight apart, yet still it seems that the British training fraternity has managed to miss the memo. The almost complete absence of runners from across the water is even more of a puzzle when you consider that 12 months ago, when a similarly meagre squad of four British-trained runners took on 143 starters from Irish yards, they left with a Grade One win and third place in a valuable handicap chase.It seems more a source of puzzlement than disappointment for David Attwood, Leopardstown’s operations manager, as he looks ahead to the 15 races, including eight Grade Ones, over the next two days.Last year’s Festival was diminished by a slew of non-runners, on the second day in particular, due to unusually fast ground, but a watering programme has seen as much as 30mm applied to some parts of the track in the last fortnight.“It was a very tough year last year with a very dry summer and winter, and then the ground was in danger of freezing as it got very cold,” Attwood says. “It’s completely different this year, but we’ve put water on to make sure there’s plenty of give to get us through the two days.”It has not been enough to tempt Gordon Elliott to run Envoi Allen, Ireland’s best novice hurdler, this weekend and he will now head straight to Cheltenham next month for the Ballymore Novice Hurdle.In every other respect, however, the weekend’s Grade One action stands comparison with any of the Festival meetings to come. On Saturday alone, the runners include Chacun Pour Soi, Min, Notebook, Fakir D’Oudairies, Honeysuckle, Sharjah and Klassical Dream, while the hugely popular Faugheen runs in a novice chase on Sunday before Kemboy, Delta Work, Presenting Percy and more line up for the Irish Gold Cup. British jumping, meanwhile, continues to watch from the sidelines."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/90173841522cb83af9172e7ce066d3977733d7d0/0_88_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7dc2d5b725b307a746fc42a821123e77","title":"sofia kenin v garbine muguruza australian open womens singles final live","story":"Third set: Sofia Kenin 4-6 6-2 3-2* Garbiñe Muguruza. Kenin pulls out an incredible hold. Fresh from her own tight hold, Muguruza went on the attack, marching to a 0-40 lead and roaring behind every point.Kenin responded by taking control of all three points as soon as she could, firing two backhand down the line winners and then a forehand down the line winner. At deuce, she came up with something even more surprising: a 146kmh sliding ace and then she held with a forehand passing shot winner. 5 winners in a row from 0-40 down. Astonishing.Third set: Sofia Kenin 4-6 6-2 *2-2 Garbiñe Muguruza. A huge hold from Muguruza there. Kenin established a 15-30 lead with a laser-like backhand down the line winner. How did Muguruza respond? Two big unreturned first serve brought her to 40-30.Then, after being dragged side-to-side by Kenin once again, she responded with an incredible crosscourt backhand on-the-run at 40-30, eventually finishing the point off at the net to hold.Third set: Sofia Kenin 4-6 6-2 2-1* Garbiñe Muguruza. Another strong hold from Kenin, who found a brilliant backhand down the line combo to move up 40-15. Muguruza shanked a bad backhand long, her 35th error of the day, to hand over the game. Kenin is playing her best tennis in the biggest match of her life, but she is reacting badly to every single point she loses. She demands perfection.Third set: Sofia Kenin 4-6 6-2 *1-1 Garbiñe Muguruza. Much better from Muguruza to secure a love hold. She landed 3 of 4 first serves and her forehand found its range for the first time in a while, finishing with a down the line winner for 30-0. She sealed the hold with a great cross-court forehand.Third set: Sofia Kenin 4-6 6-2 1-0* Garbiñe Muguruza. Kenin rolls through an easy opening game to 15. Muguruza didn’t just miss throughout that game, but her errors weren’t even close. Her forehand, as it often does, is haemorrhaging errors. An enormous service game is coming up...That was a tremendous set of tennis from Kenin. Many players would have been disheartened after playing so well in the first set yet losing it. Instead, she just took the positives and she looked even more confident in her ability to take control of the baseline. There were fewer dropshots and changes of pace - she just fought fire with fire.Kenin closed off the set exactly how she began it - she took control. From 30-30, she crunched a backhand return winner and then she followed it with another solid backhand return, forcing a backhand error from the Spaniard and taking the set.Second set: Sofia Kenin 4-6 5-2* Garbiñe Muguruza. Kenin is serving extremely well now and she pieces together another solid hold. She snatched the first point with a lovely angled crosscourt forehand, then a quick unreturned serve moved her to 30-0.Across the net, Muguruza is just a lot more hesitant now. At 30-15, instead of finishing a great point with a forehand drive volley, she hesitated and let the ball bounce before shanking her forehand into the stands. She will serve to stay in it.Second set: Sofia Kenin 4-6 *4-2 Garbiñe Muguruza. Muguruza breaks the run of three successive games with a good hold. Muguruza dismissed a forehand down-the-line winner at 30-15 and then she held with a curling ace out wide.Second set: Sofia Kenin 4-6 4-1* Garbiñe Muguruza. An excellent hold from Kenin to consolidate the break, sealed with a serve-forehand 1-2 punch. Muguruza opened the game with a couple of loose unforced errors and a couple of worried looks to her coach. For the first time today, the Spaniard looks flustered.Second set: Sofia Kenin 4-6 3-1* Garbiñe Muguruza. We have a match. Kenin has wrestled control of the baseline early in set two and she is forcing the Spaniard to move. From 30-15, Kenin elicited a Muguruza error with a strong forehand cross-court then she buried a low passing shot at Muguruza’s feet, forcing a volley error. She broke with a heavy backhand return, that forced another Muguruza error and the break.Second set: Sofia Kenin 4-6 2-1* Garbiñe Muguruza. Make that three love games in a row as Kenin breezes through another hold. This time, she opened with a rare ace and then stepped into the court and controlled the baseline, confidently directing two point-ending backhands en route to the hold.She seems to be learning as she goes and she already looks more comfortable on the front foot.Second set: Sofia Kenin 4-6 *1-1 Garbiñe Muguruza. Muguruza responds with a swift love hold of her own, sealed with a fourth ace. Quite a miraculous point from Muguruza at 15-0, who chased down a good Kenin drop shot and then just about recovered in time to hit a backhand drive volley off a decent Kenin lob before eventually stealing the point. Two good holds to begin the set.Second set: Sofia Kenin 4-6 1-0* Garbiñe Muguruza. A very quick start to the second set for Kenin, who holds to love with ease. A couple of loose, rushed errors from Muguruza in that game. Kenin will hope that there is more where they came rom.Great serving from Muguruza to seal up the set. From 0-15 down, she found a serve-forehand 1-2 punch, then two successive unreturned first serves to move up 40-15. A forehand error from Kenin completed the service hold.A really high-quality, competitive set of tennis, but Muguruza was just too good.First set: Sofia Kenin 4-5* Garbiñe Muguruza. That set could have easily spiralled out of control after the lost break, but Muguruza did extremely well to immediately restore the break by going straight back onto the front foot. Muguruza crushed a pair of point-ending forehands to move up 15-40. On her second break point, she moved into the net behind a heavy cross-court backhand and put the volley away. She will serve for an extremely tough set.First set: Sofia Kenin *4-4 Garbiñe Muguruza. That was brutal. Muguruza was clearly still frustrated after the missed opportunities for a double break and she completely capitulated here. She dumped a backhand long at 15-15 and then she threw in two double faults in succession to hand the break back. Muguruza is usually known for her tendency to not double fault. She must regroup.First set: Sofia Kenin 3-4* Garbiñe Muguruza. Once again, Kenin pulls out a seemingly impossible hold. This time, Muguruza steamed to a quick 0-40 lead in a flash of winners. Kenin responded by rollicking a backhand down the line winner and then she crushed an inside-out forehand winner on the third. When Muguruza immediately brought up a fourth break point, Kenin scuppered that one with a vicious wrong-footing cross-court backhand.Another lengthy deuce game ensued, which Kenin took hold of with a brilliant drop shot winner at deuce. She held with a lovely point-ending cross-court forehand after a serve. She cannot really play much better than that and the pressure is back on Muguruza to keep her lead.First set: Sofia Kenin *2-4 Garbiñe Muguruza. Muguruza marched to a 30-0 lead, but Kenin quickly pegged her back with two gutsy winners in succession. At 30-30, the pair traded bullets in an epic 23 stroke rally. Both women had the initiative and neither could seize it. Kenin looked to be on top of the point with a beautiful angled cross-court forehand, but Muguruza chased it down and blistered a cross-court forehand on the run before cleaning up the following short ball.Just as it looked like Muguruza was about to escape, Kenin crushed an inside out forehand winner to send her back to deuce. Muguruza navigated the hold impressively, eventually sealing the hold with a backhand drive volley winner off a great serve.So far, Muguruza is putting so much pressure on Kenin, who is having to play well outside of her comfort zone just to keep up. She is playing great but she is down 2-4. This is tough.First set: Sofia Kenin 2-3* Garbiñe Muguruza. This is already extremely tough for Kenin but she sure is fighting. Muguruza was prowling for a second break and she put Kenin under more pressure at 15-30. Kenin did what she always does in response, grinding out two successive points in a row and planting every ball on Muguruza’s often erratic forehand. After two successive forehand errors from Muguruza, Kenin found a short ball on her her backhand and pummelled it down the line to hold. A great and essential hold.First set: Sofia Kenin *1-3 Garbiñe Muguruza. A good hold from Muguruza after throwing in a pair of double faults. She moved to 40-30 with an excellent forehand winner, but Kenin is still stepping into the court and she eradicated it with an even better backhand down the line winner.The greatest measure of Muguruza’s alertness came at deuce, when Kenin attempted to throw in a moonball. Muguruza responded by sprinting into the net like a Spanish Usain Bolt and somehow catching the ball before it bounced, crushing a drive volley off the loopy ball. She is on a mission so far.First set: Sofia Kenin 1-2* Garbiñe Muguruza. This is already incredibly intense, but Muguruza breaks first! Kenin looked to be moving towards a second hold at 40-30, but Muguruza responded incredibly well, pummelling returns and crushing two successive crosscourt forehand winners to bring up break point.As a long, tense deuce game developed, Kenin saved the first break point by absolutely destroying a backhand down the line winner. On the second break point, she forced Muguruza into a backhand error with a nice forehand down the line.But Muguruza is already putting Kenin under immense pressure. She crushed a backhand return winner to bring up a third break point and, as Kenin bravely tried to fight fire with fire, she sent an aggressive forehand wide.So, who will win this? With her experience, her form and her performances in previous finals, Muguruza clearly begins as the favourite and she will be the main aggressor in this match. Muguruza loves to take the ball early, to change directions off both wings and to move forward in order to finish points at the net. She has also been serving much better than in previous years and her serve has held up under pressure. In this form, Muguruza will be so difficult to beat if she finds a rhythm.Across the net, Kenin will scrap for everything and her defence will force Muguruza into errors. Kenin will have to be brave, taking on her backhand whenever the opportunity opens up and she will have to rely on her resourcefulness, throwing in drop shots and keeping Muguruza on the move with angles and width. She has to make Muguruza uncomfortable enough to miss, particularly on her forehand wing, and then it will be very interesting.First set: Sofia Kenin *1-1 Garbiñe Muguruza. A solid opening hold from Muguruza under different circumstances. Kenin already looked fully dialled in as she pummeled a down the line forehand to move up 0-30 on the Spaniard, but Muguruza responded immediately. She served extremely well from 0-30 down very efficiently digging herself out of an early hole to secure her opening game.First set: Sofia Kenin 1-0* Garbiñe Muguruza. What a great start from Kenin in a completely alien situation. When Muguruza elected to receive first, she was probably curious to see how tense her opponent was at the beginning. Kenin simply held to 15 with ease, throwing in a couple of drop shots and finishing by forcing an error from the Spaniard with a nice angled crosscourt forehandThe players have arrived on Rod Laver Arena. Muguruza elected to receive.Here is Conchita Martinez on her charge, Garbiñe Muguruza:I think she has the right attitude at the moment. She’s very focused. I seen this look before when she’s been playing really good tennis. I like how focus she is, how she’s doing everything right to put herself in a good situation, to do well, to play well.There is no guarantees that you’re going to win because the other players are very good. I think tennis is improving. It’s really tough out there. A lot of competition.I feel like she has the right mindset to work and to try to, of course, win every match that she plays. Hopefully tomorrow is not going to be an exception. Like I said, there’s no guarantees. There are very good players out there. A fun thing about Kenin’s rise is that she has been well known in US tennis circles for well over a decade now and there is plenty of footage of her from when people tipped her for greatness as a youngster. Here is a 7 year old Kenin explaining exactly how she would return Andy Roddick’s serve. It is quite notable how serious and intelligent her answers are compared to the questions. She was born to do this.What is on the line for Garbine Muguruza?Here is Kenin on reaching her dream final: I always believed I could do it. Obviously, as I started getting more serious, transitioning from juniors to the pros, of course I would love to have been in the final of a Grand Slam. I’ve always dreamed about it. Being in the final here is obviously the place where it’s the best to be.Yeah, I just feel like I’ve always believed in myself. I’ve worked hard. I’ve pictured so many times being in the final, all the emotions, how it’s going to lead up into the final.I mean, I feel like I’m doing good keeping my emotions. Obviously, it’s a bit emotional and stuff. I feel like everything is just paying off. I see all the hard work I’ve been putting is really showing now. It has been fascinating to watch Muguruza on and off the court throughout the last two weeks. When she defeated Simona Halep in two extremely tight sets to reach her first slam final since 2017, her celebration”was simply a fist pump to her box while mouthing ‘c’mon’. That is all. Off the court, she is usually very extroverted and funny, but in Melbourne she has been extremely serious in her interviews and she has kept her cards close to her chest. So far it is paying off:Definitely the mission is to get away from here with a big trophy. But big or small celebration, it’s incredible achievement. It really depends of how you’re feeling. I believe in myself that I have what it takes to play these kind of matches and to be in this stage. You try to just keep it calm. There’s many more matches to go. I’m sure the right moment there’s going to be a big celebration. For now, it’s keep it calm. Hello! Welcome to our coverage on women’s final day of the Australian Open, the penultimate day of the tournament. Twelve days ago, this tournament started with a typically open women’s field and it was always clear that the tournament could develop in so many different ways. Somehow, this event has still managed to produce a shock finale as 14th seed Sofia Kenin takes on unseeded Garbine Muguruza for the title.Even as recently as the semi-final round, when Kenin faced number one Ashleigh Barty and Muguruza battled Simona Halep, this match-up was the least likely scenario. But it is far from random. Last year, Kenin enjoyed an extremely consistent breakout season as she won two titles, beat numerous top 10 players and finished the year on the cusp of the top 10. Other younger and more interesting players like Coco Gauff and Amanda Anisimova received more of the spotlight, but the 21 year-old has quietly developed into one of the most solid counterpunchers on the tour. Along with her retrieval skills, she can certainly punch - her backhand is already one of the best in the game and she loves to take the ball early and viciously use her opponents’ pace against her. The driving force behind Kenin’s success has been her intensity and competitive fire, which is instantly recognisable and means that she is often cold-blooded in the most important moments. Her mental strength has driven her to a first final and it is hard to believe that she will cower as she faces the newest, greatest challenge of her career tonight.Kenin is by far the highest ranked player and the only seed in this match-up, but rankings don’t always tell the full truth. Muguruza is a former French Open and Wimbledon champion who reached the number one ranking in 2017, and she is the player that most people know. Muguruza’s quality is undeniable but she is coming off a couple of torrid years in which her ranking tumbled, leading to her finishing 2019 ranked 36th. Even at the best of times Muguruza is a streaky player, but for a long time her game was caked in unforced errors and doubt.There were undoubtedly many reasons for her poor form, but the consensus was that her partnership with her coach Sam Sumyk was past its sell by date. At the end of last year, Muguruza finally split with Sumyk and hired 1994 Wimbledon champion Conchita Martinez as her new coach. It was the obvious move - Martinez had already coached her countrywoman to the Wimbledon title in 2017 when Sumyk had to take the tournament off for personal reasons - and it would have been a surprise if their partnership hadn’t worked out. The surprise is that just a couple of weeks into their first season together, she is already back in a slam final, her career thriving once more."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6e4eb1ed170866269273fffb3dae211cf7283587/1608_89_2349_1409/master/2349.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ac9f3969e8eeecc943d2677580bb61d6","title":"njambi mcgrath funniest things","story":"The Kenya-born UK comedian and author on the things that make her laugh the mostJim Jefferies does a brilliant routine about Americans’ right to bear arms, and the ridiculousness of arguments of self-protection.Nikolai Gogol’s The Government Inspector: I did it as part of my O-levels and even as a teen I thought it was the funniest book.

Despite asking both the driver who brought the item, and a second driver who delivered the order he had been expecting, neither would take away the £149 machine. Customer services told him it was highly unlikely the company would come to retrieve the fitness bike, and he would have to dispose of it.Harding, who says he rarely uses Amazon because of concerns over its tax affairs, says he “held his nose” in January and ordered a 20kg bag of reconstituted logs.But he got more than he bargained for when the driver arrived with an enormous box, wrongly bearing his name and address.“When I pointed out that the package contained a Nero Sports fitness bicycle, the delivery driver suggested that my logs might have been packed inside the box. I was flabbergasted by this suggestion, by which time the delivery man was halfway down the path. When I came to my senses I suggested to him that he should take the package back, or at least check that someone else in the Bristol area was due to receive a fitness bike. After checking his notes I was told he could not take the item back since he only did deliveries,” Harding says.After finding his way through the maze of the Amazon website he says he eventually found a number to call where a very helpful person agreed to replace his missing logs. But when these arrived the second driver also refused to take the bike away.“I was also told that if no one came to collect the fitness bike within 48 hours, I should feel free to dispose of it as I thought fit. That would be OK if had any use for an exercise bike, but I don’t. Aside from the inconvenience of having it filling my front room, I’m astonished at the cavalier waste of the world’s resources that have gone into this whole process. I’m guessing that someone else has ordered this machine and they have been similarly sent a replacement, when they should have this one,” he says.After  Money stepped in, the response was swift – and the firm collected the package from Harding almost immediately, with a bouquet of flowers and a box of chocolates.A spokesman for Amazon said: “We have contacted the customer to apologise for his experience and collect the bike. We have also investigated the matter with our delivery partner and are taking appropriate action.”Environmental groups are increasingly questioning the role of tech firms and their lack of response to the climate emergency.Last August, Amazon was criticised by activists and customers after introducing a range of plastic packaging that cannot be recycled in the UK. The online retailer had started sending small items in unrecyclable plastic envelopes, seemingly to allow more parcels to be loaded on to each delivery truck.In 2018, Money highlighted the extraordinary case of south London resident Tiffany Crow, who was being bombarded with hundreds of parcels from Amazon. Boxes of wireless speakers, fitness wristbands and batches of projectors kept arriving at her home, forcing her to spend hours dealing with them, and recycling all the packaging. Her repeated calls to Amazon to get them stopped drew a blank, and like Harding she was told she could do what she liked with them.In January, hundreds of Amazon employees in the US defied corporate policy to publicly criticise the company for failing to meet its “moral responsibility” in the face of the climate crisis."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/68d361bc9baf97aeee1261f7b98cb854201494b6/0_6_1441_864/master/1441.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e2db663fe11b53e4d677a09ac80e612e","title":"infinite scroll life under instagram","story":"After a few years, I came to understand Instagram dwellers as broken people – my people. By  Dayna TortoriciI had reached the point of diminishing returns. I wanted to quit Twitter, but my fingers were as if possessed, typing command+n, tw, enter at any lull in the workday, letting autofill take care of the rest. Like an old woman who finds herself at a familiar bus stop in her nightgown, I would blink at the new window and wonder how I got there and where I had intended to go. More than once I asked a friend to change my password and lock me out of my account. Weeks would go by without incident, sometimes months, but then a protest would break out, or my hometown would be on fire, and the old media was too slow with the news. I would go through the password retrieval process, log on, catch up, lose my mind and repeat the process.Finally, in July 2018, I thought: I’m going to have a heart attack if I stay on here.I changed my password to thisisamassivewasteoftimeandnotthepurposeofyourlifeonearth.I told a friend that I was banishing myself to Instagram, the only social media platform that did not haunt me, get under my skin and cause me to feel shortness of breath and numbness in my fingers. I had a theory that everyone was haunted by at least one of them, and which one depended on your insecurities, the type of people who gathered there, and the style of communication its interface allowed.I surveyed new acquaintances: “When you think: ‘Social media is terrible,’ which are you thinking of most?” For some the answer was Facebook – people with serious exes, political ambitions, a Trump-supporting family or high school rivals. For me, and for others overwhelmed by the hyper-acceleration of news commentary, it was Twitter.Instagram felt innocent by comparison. No one I knew cared about it or made a living on it. The people who confessed a troubled relationship with the platform were visual artists, which I was not fearful of missing out, which was not my flavour of social anxiety or influencers concerned with a standard of perfection that was not my standard, and so I felt immune. For the most part, Instagram people preached positivity and contentment, and reminded themselves and their followers that the aesthetic harmony attainable in images was fleeting, not sustainable as a way of life. Instagram people did not seem mean or clever. They were earnest and sincere. They drank green smoothies and went on hikes, sought personal bests, good health, peace of mind and oneness with the universe. They believed every day was a beautiful day to be alive. Leaving Twitter for Instagram was like moving to Los Angeles, only cheaper. I knew people who had gone west to convalesce and to retire from public life. Maybe Instagram would be like that for me?By this time I had already been on Instagram for six years – long enough to have developed misgivings about it – but the platform was such a reprieve from the moment’s psychic turmoil that I didn’t dwell on them. To do so would be like spending your holiday researching the detrimental effects of tourism: a wise, just and morally superior choice, but objectively not the point.If I was operating under a willful innocence, it helped that I had started in 2012 with a rule: only follow people you know. Even back then, I felt as if I was being hosed daily with unwanted opinions, ideas, emotions and headlines on Facebook and Twitter, and the idea that I could start afresh with a limited intake made me feel safe. My Instagram account was not private – anyone could follow me – but I kept a tight door on my feed. There was no share, retweet or reblog feature on Instagram people would have to go out of their way to show me things by people I didn’t follow, and most didn’t bother. The network was limited. Nothing I didn’t want to see would appear in the timeline. The environment was still and sane.How did I choose what to post? If I was walking down the street in company and stopped to say: “Sorry, I just have to take a picture of this,” usually that was sufficient. A random, inchoate force was at work – the snap reflex of humour or taste.Posting was its own separate pleasure. I would eventually come to post for attention, like everyone else – but early on, when nobody liked my pictures, I still found it gratifying to post. The satisfaction of self-publishing is difficult to describe. To press a button and see your own excrescence appear in the preordained format, minted, can feel like a kind of magic. It can make you feel like you count. But what people saw from me was less important to my mental health than what I saw of them. Hence the rule to only follow people I knew. For two years, that was a clean, easy test. But in time, I began to relax my definition of an acquaintance. Soon I was looking at a lot of people I had never met and never intended to.Genres of Instagram I came to recognise after this door opened were: archival photography, astrology meme, travel photography, cookingbaking, fitnessexercise, political meme, celebrity superfan, street fashion, makeupdrag, time-lapse photography, architecturedesign, tactile or “satisfying”, cross-platform meme (eg, screenshots from Twitter), female influencer, historical, inspirational, animal rescue, literary, home decor, viral dance, gymnasticacrobatic, ceramic, houseplant care, illustration and softcore pornography.Some trends were easier to decipher than others. For a period of six months, I noticed a number of Americans visiting Portugal and posting pictures of painted tiles. Why did the tiles look so good there? I overthought it for a while and then realised Instagram was already tiles. Why all the houseplants? Because we spend too much time indoors and they photograph well.Each night I lay in my bed beside my boyfriend with one eye closed against the pillow and with the other, wheeled down Instagram’s infinite scroll. Each morning, I woke up to my phone alarm and rolled over to tap it off and, if I had time, looked at Instagram while still half-asleep. I easily spent an hour on it a day – in bed, on the subway or at my desk during lunch. Compared with the hours I spent elsewhere on the internet, it felt like nothing.“What does the egg mean?”World records are meaningless in a culture defined by historical amnesia and the relentless invention of categories, I thought, and double tapped to like the egg.The closest I came to experiencing an Instagram subculture was through following fitness accounts between 2016 and 2018. I was in my late 20s and had rediscovered a passion for exercise. I belonged to a gym but needed things to do, something better than running or cycling. Instagram was a fount of ideas. It was there that I discovered a world of people, mostly women, who worked out all day and were paid in tights and crop tops by athleisure brands to do so.From time to time they cracked. “I look nice and smug in this photo,” said a popular woman powerlifter I liked, “but I’m considering making a YouTube video about my recent nervous breakdownidentity crisis.” Through her, I learned about the mechanics of Facetune, a photo-editing app that allows you to smooth cellulite, shrink waistlines, whiten sclera and disappear acne with little technical skill. I knew about the app from trans women I followed who used it to soften jawlines and erase Adam’s apples, a sort of spot-treatment for dysphoria that brought their likeness closer to the ideal. Their offhand references to Facetune suggested that image manipulation wasn’t empowerment, just something you could control when your health insurance didn’t cover facial feminisation surgery. The athletes, less forthright about their body-image issues, were cagier about their usage.In the powerlifter’s video about Facetune, she said she felt hypocritical for editing her photos while championing body acceptance and strength-building for women. If she couldn’t walk the walk, at least she would talk about it. She was not the only one. Such confessional double-consciousness was everywhere on #fitstagram. Women posted before-and-after photos 60 seconds apart to demonstrate the powerful effects of posing. Before: a slumping, bloated person with her tailbone tucked. After: a composed physique model with a popped heel and a perfect ass. But no matter how much consciousness-raising they did, they were still under the spell of the image and strove to live up to it.I wish I could say I watched this all from a cool, critical distance. In truth, I spent too much time at the gym and worried about my forward head position – an affliction common to people who spend too much time on their phones. My Explore page, which drives users via algorithm toward content similar to what they’ve seen or liked, became a mosaic of increasingly extreme exercisers. Looking at competitive bodybuilders, I caught myself thinking they didn’t look all that weird. This is how dysmorphia works, I thought the algorithm only encourages it, nudging you towards extremity. And yet it cut both ways: the more body-positive accounts I looked at as a counterweight, the more the Explore page fed me body-positive imagery. All images train the eye, and consistent exposure to fat bodies rewires the brain just as much as consistent exposure to thin ones. It brought to mind a moment in Pumping Iron, the 70s bodybuilding documentary, in which a young Arnold Schwarzenegger attempts to explain the mindset of the subculture.“I mean, obviously a lot of people look at you and they think it’s kind of strange, what you’re doing,” he says. “But those are the people who don’t know much about it ... As soon as you find out what the whole thing is about, then it’s just like another thing.”Everything on Instagram was like that. Once you found out about it, it was just another thing.We think we know, but do we really know the full extent of manipulation on this platform, the psychological complexity and the degree of social engineering involved? Yes and no. As of this writing, Instagram has an estimated value of more than $100bn (£77bn), 100 times what Facebook bought it for in 2012. It is a data-collection business and a media-selling business. Third-party indexing tools glean data from what is posted and sell it in the form of brand analytics – or as information for governments, security and surveillance firms, and corporations. Images posted to Instagram are used by Facebook to help train its proprietary image-recognition software. And, of course, Facebook-owned Instagram tracks your movements across the internet, and hints that it is stalking you in ways both subtle and not.Occasionally someone or something lifts the veil. In July 2019, Instagram crashed, and for a brief period users had the unusual experience of scrolling through their feeds and seeing, in the place of images, image-recognition metadata as blue text in pale gray squares. The text read:“Image may contain: night, sky and outdoor”“Image may contain: 1 or more people, people sitting, shoes and indoor”I imagined sentient robots thumbing through photos. This is how they would see us: in Terminator vision.When Instagram introduced advertisements in 2013, it suddenly seemed as if every fifth image in my feed was an ad. Then I counted – every third or fourth post was an ad. With time, they grew uncannily specific. An ad for a bar cart from a furniture startup, on which stood a selection of magazines, including n+1 – the magazine I work for – next to a speckled philodendron. An ad for a minimalist women’s clothing brand based in San Francisco, modelled by the younger sister of a poet I had recently met. I was being reached by Facebook Ads Manager through detailed targeting, which I knew existed: users who like Bon Appétit, live in Brooklyn, between the ages of 18 and 35, should see this ad. But this was being stalked on another level. By the end of 2019, I half expected to see my own likeness in an ad served just to me – me in minimalist clothing, reading n+1, beside a bar cart.What were other people seeing? I realised I had no idea. Whereas I once watched TV ads with interest – especially those geared toward men during the American football games my boyfriend watched, the car commercials and beer commercials and pharmaceutical commercials for hair loss and erectile dysfunction – on Instagram I saw only myself. It was easier to see ideology at work on other people, and at least those TV ads gave me a sense of what strings of the American male psyche advertisers were choosing to pull. Now, I was alone with my ads, in a filter bubble of one.Meanwhile, Instagram was leaving its trace on the physical world. People in search of ’grammable content were mobbing restaurants, public lands and private neighbourhoods in greater numbers, causing their stewards to think differently about design and crowd control. I read an article about Rue Crémieux in Paris, where residents of pastel-painted houses were begging for a gate so tourists would stop taking photos in front of them. “It’s become hell,” the vice-president of the street association told a local news website. “On weekends, we get 200 people outside our windows. Our dinner table is right by the window and people are just outside taking pictures.”An article on NPR suggested Instagram was driving more visitors to national parks in pursuit of the perfect image. In 2018, the article reported: “A California woman fell to her death at Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore in Michigan while trying to take a selfie.” At Yellowstone in 2015, a woman “was gored by a bison while attempting to get a selfie with the animal”. Park officials created a voluntary pledge for visitors that included the phrase: “No picture is worth hurting yourself, others, or the park.”Land preservation was also a concern. An anonymous curmudgeon started the Instagram account @publiclandshateyou to shame Instagram tourists for their thoughtless treatment of nature reserves and wilderness areas. In spring 2019, Miley Cyrus posted a photo of herself hanging from aJoshua tree, an endangered plant known for its delicate root system. The Mojave Desert Land Trust begged her to take it down.By then it was obvious that Instagram was changing the built environment, too. Cafes, bars and themed fun houses called “museums” were being constructed and designed to appear on the grid. Art museums realised that programming exhibitions with built-in selfie opportunities increased “user-generated content”, or UGC, which, in turn, led to free, “organic” promotion.New storefronts and restaurants were likewise optimised for the image. Considerations such as comfort, accessibility and acoustics were secondary to visual appeal. It was as if the landscape itself had dysmorphia, altering its physical appearance to fit an arbitrary standard that undermined its primary function. But maybe I had it backwards. Maybe the point of a physical space was no longer to shelter physical people. Maybe a shopfront was a marketing tool for a direct-to-consumer internet startup, the way a website was once a marketing tool for a bricks-and-mortar outlet. Glossier. Everlane. Warby Parker. The Sill. Walking into such places felt like walking into an app. They always looked smaller in person, like famous actors who are shorter in real life.By the autumn of 2019, I came to understand Instagram dwellers as broken people – my people. If I was getting depressed, so was everyone else. The algorithm’s hall-of-mirrors effect seemed to be at work again: more and more people were posting about staying in, struggling with their mental health and finding a community of fellow sufferers on the platform. But it wasn’t just me and my algorithm. Other people were growing disenchanted and reclusive, and the media seemed to confirm the trend. Tavi Gevinson, the American writer and the co-founder of Rookie, published a New York magazine cover story chronicling her ambivalence about growing up on Instagram. The Atlantic claimed The New Instagram It Girl Spends All Her Time Alone and described how influencers were staging more selfies at home to appear relatable to their followers. Home-delivery services, loungewear brands and weighted-blanket manufacturers were all well poised to capitalise.Then I encountered the Agoraphobic Traveller. At a live storytelling event I attended, the MC cued the lights for a message from the sponsor. The stage lights dimmed and a four-minute video told the story of Jacqui, a fortysomething woman with a thick New Zealand accent who had started having severe panic attacks in her 20s. “Eventually I was diagnosed with agoraphobia,” she said in voiceover as the camera caught her face through a windowpane. For a while, she struggled to travel far from home. “It’s not living life. It’s not a life, when you’re just constantly not in a good place.”Then she hit a turning point. Jacqui was looking at Google Street View one day when she thought to take screenshots of vistas or tableaux she liked. “I’ve always loved photography,” she said. “This gave me the opportunity to be a photographer but without having that anxious feeling. I think that I’ve taken around 27,000 screenshots,” she told the camera.Jacqui created an Instagram account, @streetview.portraits, to share the screenshots she took. In the video, the camera showed Jacqui looking at one of her Instagram posts, a washed-out image of two camels in the desert, scrolling over the comments. “Now I feel more connected to the world than I ever have before,” she said.With help from Google, Jacqui travelled to New York for an exhibition of her photos in Soho called The Agoraphobic Traveller. The video showed Jacqui in a cab, Jacqui on the plane. The camera trailed her arriving at the gallery, her shoulders hiked and hands in her pockets. Inside, she smiled and relaxed. “If you’re struggling and you’re keeping it to yourself ... it definitely doesn’t help,” she said. “Please don’t give up, know that it can get better and it does get better.”I was happy for Jacqui, but the video disturbed me deeply. I found it pernicious and thought about it for days. The message was benign – technology connects you to the world. But I couldn’t shake the subtext: that if Google and Instagram had an ideal user, it might be a creative person who could not – would not – leave her home.Modern voyeurism has precedents, even the multiple-window kind. In Alfred Hitchcock’s Rear Window, LB “Jeff” Jefferies is a housebound magazine photographer laid up with a broken leg and “nothing to do but look out the window”. Across the courtyard is a dollhouse of parallel lives that he can watch unfold from his wheelchair. There’s the blond “bikini bombshell” – “Miss Torso”, he calls her – who stretches and twirls in her underwear while she butters her breakfast toast Mr Thorwald, the costume jewellery salesman, who tends a flower garden and a sick, unhappy wife “Miss Lonelyhearts,” a single woman who pantomimes a candlelit dinner for two before she drinks and cries herself to sleep and other nameless neighbours who are less intriguing but still worth watching.The view from Jeff’s rear window calls to mind Henry James’s “house of fiction”, which “has not one window but a million”. It also recalls the view from Instagram. As Durga Chew-Bose writes in an essay on the film: “Jeff sits and stares out his window like we sit and scroll, and double tap.” He spins stories about his neighbours, like we do “about strangers ... based on their Instagram accounts.” The ethical implications were fraught then as now. “We’ve become a race of Peeping Toms,” says Stella, the insurance company nurse who checks in on Jeff and admonishes him. “What people ought to do is get outside their own house and look in for a change. Yes, sir. How’s that for a bit of homespun philosophy?”The entangled dynamics of who sees whom and who knows they’re being seen have always been present. Where Instagram seems truly new – beyond the introduction of machine learning and commercial surveillance to the mix – is in the strange instability of the viewer’s position as a subject. A voyeur knows what kind of viewer he is, but looking at Instagram, you are not always a voyeur. Neither are you always a witness, nor any other single kind of watcher. Your implied identity slips with each stroke of the thumb.If you are me, scrolling through Instagram, you are the confidant being whispered to by a face shot from under the chin. You are the recipient of a holiday card from a family in matching turtlenecks. You are the magazine subscriber flipping through editorials. You are the woman standing in front of the screen miming the aerobic movements of your instructor. You are the mother, adult height, looking down at her child. You are the lunch companion peering across the table. You are the customer browsing for deals. You are the scholar sifting through archives. You are the fan admiring Beyoncé. You are the mirror, reflecting the image of the photographer. You are the photographer, seeing through her eyes. You are the phone.Or you are the voyeur at the window, trying to get a closer look – in which case the villain who enters your private space, not through the window, but through the front door, is the ads.A week into writing this essay, I began to see ads about it on Instagram. The bar cart came back, this time with different magazines on the shelf. So did the “life-transforming, plant-rich super meals delivered to your door”, a remnant from my fitness moment, and the forward-head-position posture corrector, a piece of plastic you stick to your spine that buzzes whenever you slouch. I was served an ad for a New York Times article about facial-recognition technology, and an ad for the Wall Street Journal featuring an illustration of a teen girl in bed looking despondent in bed a phone on the bedside table showed two girls smiling and surrounded by hearts. The caption read: “Young Americans have become unwitting guinea pigs in today’s huge, unplanned experiment with social media, and teenage girls are bearing much of the brunt.”The US government has been slow to respond to the scope of this experiment. The EU has been more aggressive. In response to pressure from regulators, Facebook is now more transparent about data. For the first time, I can see the names of companies who have uploaded my information to the platform: Predictive Media Analytics LLC, Nielsen, LiveRamp, Acxiom, Adara, Oracle Data Cloud, Wunderman Data Products, SocialCode, TowerData. The company has also given users some measure of control over ad settings.Following the directions in an article I found online, I switched Ads based on data from other partners – meaning data about websites I had visited or purchases I had made on my credit card – to Not allowed. I switched Ads based on your activity on Facebook Company Products that you see elsewhere, which I didn’t understand, to Not allowed. I switched Ads that include your social actions, meaning ads telling friends I liked certain products, to be shown to No One.

I simply spent too much time on Instagram for it not to relearn what it knew before I wiped the slate. I wish I could wipe it again.The speed of machine learning is startling, often creepy. It is hard to tell what is creepier: the feeling that someone is somewhere out there, following your every step, or the fact that no one is, just the tracking device you carry with you in your pocket.

They’re just not going to vote for a socialist.” Another voter, Darby Holroyd, says: “I do have some concerns about Bernie Sanders’ health, considering the fact that he did have a heart attack.”Joe Biden has remained durable atop the Democratic field and maintains a clear path to the nomination. But recent surveys show Sanders leading in Iowa and far ahead in New Hampshire. On Friday, a NBC NewsWall Street Journal poll found Biden and Sanders in a dead heat at the top of the Democratic field.The urgency of the centrists’ warnings against Sanders reflects a realization he could actually win the Democratic nomination.“There’s a lot of history to suggest that if he wins those two states, he becomes very hard to stop,” said Mark Mellman, a veteran Democratic pollster and the president of Democratic Majority for Israel.After a summer of slumping poll numbers and a heart attack in October, few expected Sanders to rebound. Establishment-minded Democrats instead trained their fire on his progressive rival, Elizabeth Warren, attacking her economic vision and hammering her on the details of her healthcare plan. The effect was to turn the candidate with the most loyal supporters and largest fundraising operation into an underdog – allowing him to run as an anti-establishment insurgent rather than a frontrunner.“Suddenly, we have the Democratic establishment very nervous about this campaign,” Sanders roared at a rally in Sioux City, Iowa, last weekend. “They’re starting to think: could this really happen?“We are their worst nightmare,” he said, to deafening applause.The Democrats behind the recent moves to dim Sanders’ rise insist there is no coordinated “stop Sanders” effort, and few believe such a movement would work. Instead, these worried Democrats say their goal is to highlight Sanders’ vulnerabilities for a small but significant slice of undecided primary voters who are open to his message but not entrenched in his “political revolution”.However, few Democrats are joining their public call to arms, partly out of fear that any indication of an organized anti-Sanders campaign would antagonize his loyal army of supporters, who are already deeply suspicious of the party establishment. Others believe such efforts only serve to hand Sanders a political gift.Sanders raised $1.3m after a fundraising appeal asking supporters to fight back against attacks by “outside groups”. On Thursday, a coalition of nine outside groups backing Sanders said they would join forces to build what they called the “largest independent mobilizing commitment” in 2020.Mellman said he recognized the risks of inflaming Sanders supporters, but believes remaining silent “would be worse”.“Democrats say defeating Trump is what’s most important to them,” he said. “We think Sanders is very poorly positioned to do that.”At a town hall in Decorah, Iowa, on Thursday morning, Pete Buttigieg lamented that Sanders adheres to “a kind of politics that says you’ve got to go all the way here and nothing else counts”.Later that day, at a campaign stop in Pella, Iowa, Biden was unusually blunt when asked to draw a contrast with Sanders: “I’m a Democrat.”Sanders, an independent who caucuses with the Democrats, has signed a loyalty pledge to serve as a Democrat if elected president. But Biden pressed: “He’s not a registered Democrat, to the best of my knowledge.”John Delaney, the former Maryland congressman and a long-shot presidential candidate, departed the field on Friday with a warning that Democrats embrace the economic populism of Sanders or Warren at their peril.“Their proposal takes healthcare away from a lot of people and forces them on some new government plan,” he said of Sanders and Warren’s support for a government-run healthcare model. “That’s a hard way to win an election.”Sanders could carve a similar path to the nomination as Trump in 2016, by taking advantage of a fractured field with no clear leader. But the 2018 congressional elections delivered mixed results for Sanders’ movement, with little evidence to support his confidence that a populist leftwing agenda will resonate in conservative battlegrounds.“This isn’t an election where you win with huge turnouts in California or Massachusetts or New York,” said Harold Schaitberger, the general president of the International Association of Firefighters, a prominent union that is rallying support for Biden in Iowa. “People may not like it, but this is an electoral election. To win, you need a nominee that can compete in Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, Wisconsin, Iowa.”That analysis is sharply contested by Sanders supporters, who point out that running a centrist candidate failed to beat Trump in 2016, and that the eventual nominee must be someone who can energize young and disaffected voters to counter the president’s fervent base. Once again, they believe, the political class has underestimated Sanders’ appeal to working people.“The political establishment has ignored working people for so long. They sowed these seeds,” said Hugh Espey, executive director of Iowa Citizens for Community Improvement, which has endorsed Sanders. “We’re sick and tired of business-as-usual politics. We need to do something different.”Speaking at an event on behalf of Sanders on Wednesday night, the climate activist Naomi Klein cautioned that the attacks were just the beginning.“At every turn, Washington DC elites said Bernie’s position was unrealistic, impossible, not credible,” she intoned. “But over and over again over the past 40 years history has sided with Bernie Sanders.“If he was right about the past,” she concluded, “he is right about the future too.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fedc753a5cbcab449389d06d1ac063673a7c2b2c/0_194_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=91299a1f5a08cf0e0975a8f36f6f7f69","title":"fukushima radioactive water should be released into ocean say japan experts","story":"Build-up of contaminated water from wrecked nuclear plant has been sticking point in clean-up likely to take decadesA panel of experts advising Japan’s government on a disposal method for radioactive water from the destroyed Fukushima nuclear plant has recommended releasing it into the ocean, a move likely to alarm neighbouring countries.The panel, under the industry ministry, came to the conclusion after narrowing the choice to either releasing the contaminated water into the Pacific Ocean or letting it evaporate – and opted for the former. Based on past practice, it is likely the government will accept the recommendation.The build-up of contaminated water at Fukushima has been a sticking point in the clean-up, which is likely to last decades, especially as the Olympics are due to be held in Tokyo this year with some events less than 60km (35 miles) from the wrecked plant.Neighbouring South Korea has retained a ban on imports of seafood from Japan’s Fukushima region imposed after the nuclear disaster and summoned a senior Japanese embassy official last year to explain how the Fukushima water would be dealt with. Its athletes are planning to bring their own radiation detectors and food to the Games.In 2018, Tokyo Electric apologised after admitting its filtration systems had not removed all dangerous material from the water, and the site is running out of room for storage tanks.But it plans to remove all radioactive particles from the water except tritium, an isotope of hydrogen that is hard to separate and is considered to be relatively harmless.“Compared to evaporation, ocean release can be done more securely,” the committee said, pointing to common practice around the world where normally operating nuclear stations release water that contains tritium into the sea.The recommendation needs to be confirmed by the head of the panel, Nagoya University professor emeritus Ichiro Yamamoto, and submitted to the government at a later date that has not been set.Tokyo Electric, or Tepco, has collected nearly 1.2m tonnes of contaminated water from the cooling pipes used to keep fuel cores from melting since the plant was crippled by an earthquake and tsunami in 2011. The water is stored in huge tanks that crowd the site.The utility says it will run out of room to store the water by 2022.

Eager shoppers, a significant portion of them Chinese, make their way to the luxury outlet shopping destination nestled in the Oxfordshire countryside – many are wearing face masks.As fear about the spread of the new coronavirus grows across the globe, Chinese tourists who have come to the UK hoping to enjoy sightseeing and shopping during the lunar new year holidays have had their trips overshadowed by fears for friends and family back home – and what awaits them on their return.Making his way to the glitzy walkway that leads shoppers to Bicester Village, Sting Yao, 33, a manager in a media company, says at the moment his most pressing concern is the return to work. “We are safe in the UK, but I want to go back now,” he says. “When I go home I will be expected to stay at home for 15 days, when I have already been on holiday and I really need to get back to work.”It is a member of the coronavirus family that has never been encountered before. Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals, or possibly seafood. New and troubling viruses usually originate in animal hosts. Ebola and flu are examples.Severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (Mers) are both caused by coronaviruses that came from animals.The virus causes\u0026nbsppneumonia. Those who have fallen ill are reported to suffer coughs, fever and breathing difficulties. In severe cases there can be organ failure. As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work. If people are admitted to hospital, they may get support for their lungs and other organs as well as fluids. Recovery will depend on the strength of their immune system. Many of those who have died are known to have been already in poor health.Human to human transmission has been confirmed by China’s national health commission. As of January 30, the death toll in China stands at 170, with 7,711 confirmed cases of infections. In the past week, the number of confirmed infections has more than tripled and cases have been found in 13 provinces, as well as the municipalities of Beijing, Shanghai, Chongqing and Tianjin. The virus has also been confirmed outside\u0026nbspChina, in Hong Kong, Macau, Japan, Nepal, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, the US, and Vietnam. There have been two confirmed cases in the UK. The actual number to have contracted the virus could be far higher as people with mild symptoms may not have been detected. Modelling by WHO experts at Imperial College London suggests there could be as many as 100,000 cases, with uncertainty putting the margins between 30,000 and 200,000.There were fears that the coronavirus might spread more widely during the week-long lunar new year holidays, which start on 24 January, when millions of Chinese travel home to celebrate, but the festivities have largely been cancelled and Wuhan and other Chinese cities are in lockdown.Unless you have recently travelled to China or been in contact with someone infected with the virus, then you should treat any cough or cold symptoms as normal. The\u0026nbspNHS advises\u0026nbspthat there is generally no need to visit a doctor for a cough unless it is persistent or you are having other symptoms such as chest pain, difficulty breathing or you feel very unwell.No. The spread of the virus outside China is worrying but not an unexpected development. It increases the likelihood that the World\u0026nbspHealth\u0026nbspOrganization will declare the outbreak to be a public health emergency of international concern on Thursday evening. The key concerns are how transmissible this new coronavirus is between people and what proportion become severely ill and end up in hospital.Nonetheless he is determined to maximise his shopping time at Bicester Village, which is the second most popular tourist attraction for Chinese visitors to the UK after Buckingham Palace.While Chinese tourists in masks is a common sight in normal times in popular tourist destinations, at Bicester Village this week there seems to be more Chinese visitors wearing them than not.Kyu Hee, a Korean national with a Chinese husband who lives in the UK, has placed masks adorned with cute cartoon characters over the mouths of both of her children. “Of course I am worried,” she says. “This is the Chinese new year, so many people are leaving the country and lots of them are coming here. It is very popular.”Her in-laws in China are “watching the news and staying home”, while the children in her family in Korea are not going to school until the Chinese holiday season is over and the holidaymakers have gone, she says.Chao Chen, a paediatric ENT specialist, says his family’s holiday has been complicated by their return flights being cancelled. He had to rebook with another airline for an extra £1,000. While the family has been looking forward to the holiday for six months, it has been overshadowed by news from back home.“It’s very terrible, we are checking the news all the time,” says the 39-year-old, who works in Shanghai. “I wondered to myself: should we have cancelled? Should we have gone straight back home? But I promised my son we would take him to the UK, so here we are.”At Bicester Village no staff appear to be wearing face masks, but one shop assistant, who does not want to be named, says they have received assurances from their managers that they can leave their posts to wash their hands at any time. “I’m trying not to think about it, because when I do I start to panic,” she says. She is being slightly more cautious with customers, keeping more of a distance while “being professional”, she adds.In a gleaming meeting room in the offices of Bicester Village, Miranda Markham, the community relations director, says the company is monitoring the situation “on an hourly basis” but at the moment it is very much “business as usual”.“It’s calm, there is no question of any panic,” she says, adding that staff have been told to talk to their managers if they have any concerns. “It’s really important that we keep on welcoming our Chinese guests, particularly as they are having a really rough time in their own country at the moment.” On the impact of still more stringent travel restrictions from mainland China, she is pragmatic. “We haven’t seen a significant drop-off in numbers yet, but if there are further restrictions it will have an effect – but that will be the case for all tourist destinations.”“With the Chinese authorities suspending outbound travel, the Foreign Office advising against all but essential travel, and BA subsequently cancelling flights, there is an obvious and immediate knock-on impact for the tourism industry,” she says."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f44e38e0414a861245b108b0301df576141de9f1/0_133_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=718b62347ac93e662d16f8df01c4ca2e","title":"researchers make strides in race to create coronavirus vaccine","story":"International teams accelerate efforts to find effective immunisation methodResearchers racing to produce a vaccine for the Wuhan coronavirus believe they may have taken significant steps towards finding an effective method of immunisation.At least three pharmaceutical companies, as well as teams of researchers around the world, have been working on different approaches to producing an effective vaccine. These efforts accelerated after Chinese academics publicly posted the genetic sequence for the virus.A research team at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in Maryland said they had prepared a modified version of a key section of the virus to encourage the body to produce antibodies against the disease.As well as the NIH, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (Cepi) has announced it would commit $11m (£8.4m) to three programmes led by the companies Inovio Pharmaceuticals and Moderna, and the University of Queensland, with the hope of having a viable vaccine in production within 16 weeks, although testing for safety and efficacy will take much longer.With different teams competing to produce a trial vaccine, it remains unclear who is leading the race.Kizzmekia Corbett, lead researcher on the NIH coronavirus vaccine team, said her group had been concentrating on the spike proteins – the spear point of the virus,. This built on work done during the severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) outbreak that first emerged in China in 2001, another coronavirus thought to be similar to the Wuhan virus.The virus looks like a knobbly ball covered in protrusions that widen at the tip. These are spike proteins, which are able to dock to a receptor found in the lung membrane known as ACE-2, which allows the virus to enter the body.Corbett said that since the release of the Chinese sequence on 10 January, her team had been working around the clock to produce a stable version of the key protein that would prompt a strong antibody defence to prevent the virus entering the body.She said: “Coronaviruses are generally just a large family of pathogens of which six – well, now seven – are infectious to humans.“We had already published research on Sars and Mers (Middle East respiratory syndrome) and shown we could drop some stabilising mutations into the backbone of the spike after a colleague did this with the S protein of the respiratory syncytial virus,” she added.“Since 2017 we have been looking at how you give the body the right kind of messenger RNA that will attract the right type of cells to produce the right type of antibodies to produce a potent vaccine. We’ve been doing these sequences for the last three years now so we can basically plug and play, and are now able to look at any coronavirus spike sequence.”One of the problems, said Corbett, is that the corona spike protein is the largest of its kind to infect humans. “One of the reasons it’s so hard to look at is because is is so big and floppy,” she said.Corbett believed the previous work done at her institute and others may have reduced the timeframe for producing an effective vaccine. “We don’t want to ignite public hope but the goal is do it as fast as we can and we are working day and night. I lost 7lb in recent weeks!”The NIH team is among several that have been working on solutions to the wider problem of coronaviruses since the first emergence of Sars. Many of the teams noted that vaccine work would be further advanced if not for the loss of interest in research after the Sars outbreak was brought under control.The World Health Organization is recommending that people take simple precautions to reduce exposure to and transmission of the Wuhan coronavirus, for which there is no specific cure or vaccine.Despite a surge in sales of face masks in the aftermath of the outbreak of the coronavirus outbreak, experts are ided over whether they can prevent transmission and infection. There is some evidence to suggest that masks can help prevent hand-to-mouth transmissions, given the large number of times people touch their faces. The consensus appears to be that wearing a mask can limit – but not eliminate – the risks, provided they are used correctly.Peter Hotez, a professor at Baylor University in Texas who was involved in the search for a Sars vaccine, said the problem was not making a vaccine but safety-testing and licensing the product.“The receptor for the virus is in the cells of the lungs and allows the virus to get deep into lung tissue. People who are sick get severe viral pneumonia and for reasons we don’t entirely understand, those who are more vulnerable are older iniduals including those with diabetes and hypertension.“Right now, you can look at four to five different techniques being examined by researchers to produce a vaccine. The problem is that is even after manufacturing a vaccine, you still have to go through the safety testing on humans – clinical trials as well as formal toxicology testing in animals. It’s hard to rush and that’s where you tend to get a bottleneck.“The big issue is encouraging an immune response that stops the virus binding to the host receptor.There’s no magic bullet, however, he warned. “Each of the different approaches has an advantage and disadvantage. Sars was a wake-up call nearly 20 years ago. We’ve got better at implementing global health regulations and detection monitoring, no question. But even then it’s hard to anticipate a new pathogen.”“But the one thing the world missed was that we should have been more aware of the risks of coronaviruses. This is the third outbreak to emerge in the 21st century.“There’s a message here. We need to pay the same attention to coronaviruses as we do to flu. What’s so tragic is that once Sars was gone, the investor enthusiasm for a Sars vaccine was zero. If the global health community had followed through and produced and stockpiled a vaccine, something might have been ready to go now.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b8822da489dbce345b14c2d7063d20117df3ebfb/0_74_5559_3337/master/5559.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ae7e98a96aadea75fbed9287af358fc2","title":"coronavirus us public health emergency travel china","story":"The Trump administration has declared a public health emergency over the coronavirus outbreak and announced it will temporarily bar entry to the US for people traveling from China unless they are Americans or immediately related to US citizens. “This is a serious health situation in China, but I want to emphasize the risk to the American public currently is low,” said the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) director, Robert R Redfield, on Friday. “It is our goal to keep it that way.”The new strain of coronavirus has spread rapidly in Hubei province, where nearly 10,000 people have been infected and more than 200 people died. Officials have confirmed six cases of coronavirus in the US, and another 121 people are being monitored for infection.Another 132 cases of coronavirus have been detected in 23 more countries, including among 12 people who had not traveled to China.Under the measures announced on Friday, Americans returning from Hubei province will be subject to 14 days’ mandatory quarantine in an institutional setting upon their return, in order for health authorities to monitor them for the virus. Americans who have traveled to other parts of mainland China will be subject to home quarantine for 14 days.The restrictions will apply to any foreign nationals not immediately related to Americans or US permanent residents, and come into effect on Sunday at 5pm ET.“There is no travel ban,” said Joel Szabat, the assistant secretary for transportation, in response to a question from a reporter. He noted all three major air carriers had already halted flights to China in response to the epidemic.“We have been seeing already a significant decrease in passengers going between the US and China,” said Szabat.The US move comes a day after the World Health Organization declared the outbreak a health emergency of international concern.US authorities will also start funneling all flights from China to seven major airports – in New York City, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Seattle, Atlanta and Honolulu – where travelers can be screened.“We understand this action may seem drastic. We would rather be remembered for overreacting than underreacting,” the CDC’s Nancy Messonnier said.Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Disease, said the measures were necessary because of the “unknowns” regarding the coronavirus.Deputy secretary of state Stephen Biegun said: “I want the Chinese people to know they have the deepest sympathies of the United States of America.”The move is likely to anger Beijing, which earlier on Friday had criticized a travel warning that advised against all travel to China.A Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman, Hua Chunying, said: “The World Health Organization urged countries to avoid travel restrictions, but very soon after that, the United States did the opposite. It’s truly mean.”The virus causes respiratory illness and pneumonia, for which there is little treatment. Antibiotics are ineffective for the disease because it is viral, rather than bacterial.There are a range of symptoms, from mild to severe, associated with the virus. American officials said they are also concerned because the disease can be spread by people without symptoms.Travel restrictions in the US were enacted as part of a presidential proclamation and declaration of a public health emergency."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/903ab67cf1a136dea720e9ee2b0c0ae1c7a11b87/0_117_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6e6716f2ce9b373499d45d656c0609a2","title":"el salvador femicide sentence karla turcios","story":"The boyfriend of a murdered Salvadoran journalist has been found guilty of femicide and given the maximum 50-year prison sentence on Friday, a rare conviction in the deadly gender violence that often goes unpunished in the Central American nation.Mario Huezo was convicted by a judge of killing Karla Turcios, with whom he lived and had a child with, after a nine-day trial in a court that hears gender violence cases in San Salvador.The murder of Turcios in 2018 made headlines and prompted the government to declare a national emergency against femicide – the killing of a woman by a man because of her gender.El Salvador, a country of 6 million people, has one of the world’s highest rates of femicide, according to the United Nations.El Salvador passed a law in 2012 to define and punish femicide as a specific crime with a longer sentence than murder, with prison terms for convicted offenders of 20 to 50 years.The law requires prosecutors to prove the motive for a woman’s murder was hatred or contempt based on gender.Turcios, 33, whose beaten body was found dumped on a roadside, became a household name and symbol of the violence women face in El Salvador that often goes unpunished.A woman in El Salvador was murdered on average every three days in 2019, and prosecutors opened investigations into 148 cases of femicides last year, official figures show.“The conviction sends a message of intolerance toward forms of violence against women,” Silvia Juárez, a women’s rights activist in El Salvador, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. “It sends a message to the rest of the population.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/55fc7011964d023c022b7eab9049eb1b1cd6655d/0_148_5208_3124/master/5208.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=91d08c6f8c5225e9c96fec19dc203258","title":"two people in britain test positive for coronavirus","story":"Health officials tracing anyone at risk from Chinese nationals being treated in NewcastlePublic Health England (PHE) is urgently trying to trace anyone who came into contact with the two people who have tested positive for the coronavirus in the UK.England’s chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty, said: “We can confirm that two patients in England, who are members of the same family, have tested positive. The patients are receiving specialist NHS care and we are using tried and tested infection control procedures to prevent further spread of the virus.”It is understood that the pair travelled to the UK from China recently and are believed to be Chinese nationals. They are undergoing treatment at the specialist Airborne High Consequence Infectious Diseases Centre in Newcastle’s Royal Victoria Infirmary.Cases in the UK have long been expected. The virus has already spread to 22 other countries outside China.The pair had been at the StayCity apartment hotel in York when they became ill. A StayCity spokesman said: “We have been advised by Public Health England that there is minimal ongoing risk of infection to either guests or staff, and as such our York property remains open for business. The apartment concerned will undergo a thorough environmental clean and disinfection by a specialist contractor.”Public Health England (PHE) is urgently trying to trace anyone who came into contact with the two people. It said steps would be taken to reduce the risk to the public and it was “identifying the areas where there is deemed to be a risk”.Professor Sharon Peacock, director of the National Infection Service at PHE, said: “Public Health England is contacting people who had close contact with the confirmed cases. Close contacts will be given health advice about symptoms and emergency contact details to use if they become unwell in the 14 days after contact with the confirmed cases.”Prof Peacock previously said that while staff are working to trace people who have been in contact with the pair, they do not currently have any idea of how high that number might be.The PHE definition of close contact is being within two metres of the infected person for 15 minutes.Guests were continuing to check in for weekend breaks in York on Friday. Outside the hotel, two guests told the  that as recently as Friday morning they had been told by reception staff that reports that two tourists had been taken ill from their apartment on Wednesday were “lies”.“This morning they said it was a lie and not to listen to it,” said Andy Neale, 21, who was staying at StayCity for the night with his girlfriend. “It’s not ideal. They should’ve taken some precaution.”He said the incident had marred the couple’s getaway. “My girlfriend is stressing out, she’s using hand wipes on everything.”A family who were staying in the hotel on a visit from Asia to see their daughter, who is a student in York, said they had been told the reports of cases were “false information”.The PHE supported the decision not to close the hotel. It said: “The design of the accommodation means that there is minimal interaction between guests and, following a risk assessment by our experts, closing the accommodation was not necessary. Appropriate infection and prevention control measures are being implemented.”Earlier, Whitty said: “The NHS is extremely well prepared and used to managing infections, and we are already working rapidly to identify any contacts the patients had to prevent further spread.“We have been preparing for UK cases of novel coronavirus and we have robust infection control measures in place to respond immediately. We are continuing to work closely with the World Health Organization and the international community as the outbreak in China develops to ensure we are ready for all eventualities.”The World Health Organization is recommending that people take simple precautions to reduce exposure to and transmission of the Wuhan coronavirus, for which there is no specific cure or vaccine.Despite a surge in sales of face masks in the aftermath of the outbreak of the coronavirus outbreak, experts are ided over whether they can prevent transmission and infection. There is some evidence to suggest that masks can help prevent hand-to-mouth transmissions, given the large number of times people touch their faces. The consensus appears to be that wearing a mask can limit – but not eliminate – the risks, provided they are used correctly.The chief medical officers for the four countries of the UK raised the risk level from low to moderate on Thursday evening in the wake of the WHO declaring coronavirus to be an international emergency. The UK has been on high alert for days, with 177 people tested for the virus, of whom 175 proved negative.In recent days ambulance workers and paramedics have been seen in protective suits in a number of places. As well as the York incident, a man was taken away from student accommodation in London. The University of Bristol said one person admitted to hospital with symptoms as a precaution had been discharged after being cleared of coronavirus.The UK had comprehensive plans in place for dealing with the arrival of the Wuhan coronavirus. It also has a good track record. Several cases of Mers – Middle East respiratory syndrome, which is also caused by a coronavirus – have been diagnosed in the past in travellers and in two healthcare workers who were infected by patients before anyone realised they had the virus. All were nursed in hospital infectious disease units and recovered.Paul Hunter, a professor in medicine at the University of East Anglia, said: “The report of the first two cases diagnosed positive for 2019-nCoV in the UK is not surprising and was almost inevitable. The chief medical officer’s statement gives no information on where these two members of the same family acquired their infection. The two cases are members of the same family but no information has been released about whether both cases will have been infected simultaneously or whether one would have passed the infection to the other.“The NHS is well able to nurse people with this novel coronavirus as it has successfully and safely managed a number of cases of both Sars and Mers in the past. With the information available it is not possible to judge what risk if any there may be of spread within the community.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4158046.1580514054!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"election 2020 irish voters want change but cannot decide what type research shows","story":"Ipsos MRBI and the  have run focus groups leading up to the last weekend of the general election to research the desire for political change with the electorate.  \t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald and deputy leader Michelle O’Neil: some voters are attracted to party’s message of radical change, but others are nervous about some promises. Photograph:  Brian LawlessPA WireUndecided voters are overwhelmingly in favour of change in next week’s general election, focus group research suggests, but many are struggling to decide which party represents the type of change they want to see.The findings suggest Fine Gael faces an uphill battle to stage a comeback in the final week of the campaign, though senior party figures remain confident that a focus on the economy and Brexit will regain ground for the party before voters go to the polls next Saturday.The research, conducted by Ipsos MRBI for The , finds that some voters are attracted to Sinn Féin’s message of radical change, but others are nervous about some of the party’s promises. Other voters are concerned about endangering the economic progress of recent years, despite a widespread sense that Leo Varadkar’s government is out of touch and has failed to deal with issues such as health and housing.The focus groups were conducted in Dublin and Mullingar last week among specially selected voters who are undecided or open to changing their voting intention. They are not intended as statistically representative of the electorate, or to provide data that can be extrapolated. Instead, they indicate attitudes among typical voters on a range of topics.Dissatisfaction with governmentThe findings bear out and explain poll findings that identify dissatisfaction with the current government, and suggest that a comeback for Fine Gael will be a challenge.Voters identified strongly with Sinn Féin’s message of change, and the performance of Mary Lou McDonald was cited as a positive in many of the discussions. Fine Gael figures said the campaign had now entered the final and decisive phase which they said would be focused on the issues of trust, the economy and how to form a government after the election.It is claimed that Taoiseach Leo Varadkar was always prepared for a tough opening to the campaign, as happened when the opening stages were dominated by issues such as health and housing, where Fine Gael is weakest. Senior party sources said they intended to press Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin on exactly how he will form a government since he has ruled out coalition with Sinn Féin and Fine Gael. Coalition ruled outMr Martin has repeatedly ruled out entering government with Ms McDonald but Fine Gael sources say the party intends to pressure him on the wider issue of government formation with an emphasis on Sinn Féin.“That is how Micheál gets his government,” said one source. “What else has he got?”Those in Fianna Fáil say their strategy will not change as polling day approaches. Mr Martin said he would not “trust” Mr Varadkar not to enter into a coalition deal with Sinn Féin.Those campaigning across all parties and Independents say the rise in support for Sinn Féin in opinion polls is being reflected on the ground.Ms McDonald on Friday said a poll on Irish unity was an “absolute necessity” for Sinn Féin as a result of Brexit.The best news and analysis from the campaign trail"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4157987.1580510368!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"on the canvass sinn f%C3%A9in confident it can retain two seats in louth","story":"With Gerry Adams stepping down as a TD, Sinn Féin face an uphill battle to retain their two seats in the Louth Constituency.  Video: Enda O\u0027Dowd\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tCounty councillor Ruairi Ó Murchu  and former Sinn Féin president Gerry Adams canvassing   in Dundalk, Co Louth. Photograph: Dara Mac DonaillSinn Féin’s canvassers, lit up on a grey January afternoon in their party-branded high-vis vests, are fanning out like ground troops across the Cox’s Demesne housing estate in Dundalk.Gerry Adams, the party’s former leader who is retiring from politics and his Dáil seat in Louth, follows, very slowly. He is wearing a fracture boot. Later, as a constituent and diehard fan rushes out from her house to give Adams a hug, Adams explains he went over on his foot at home.Tagging along with the former Sinn Féin president is the more nimble Ruairí Ó Murchú, a 41-year-old county councillor, who acknowledges the pressure of trying to retain the seat being vacated by this veteran of Irish politics: nobody wants to be the guy who loses Gerry Adams’s seat. Ó Murchú is confident that it was not just the personal vote for a high-profile political figure that elected both Adams and his Sinn Féin running mate Imelda Munster in 2016.The Dundalk councillor came third in last year’s local elections but is confident that “with a good ground game” the party can return two TDs in the election. Hard askÓ Murchú observes, in a nod to the party’s recent polling figures, that the ground is “somewhat better”.“We knew it would be a hard ask, particularly not having Gerry Adams running, and we did have a sobering local election. The results we are getting on the doors – we think we are in a really good place and that we can do this,” says Ó Murchú , a councillor since 2017.The party has poured a lot of effort into this county on the edge of the Border where support for Sinn Féin and Irish unity has been solid for years.The five-seater constituency is a bellwether for the election. Louth is said to have a seat each for Sinn Féin (either Ó Murchú or Munster), Fianna Fáil (undoubtedly, Declan Breathnach TD) and Fine Gael (probably Fergus O’Dowd TD). The final two seats will be a battle between the three parties seeking a second seat and a group of three others: former Labour TD Ged Nash, the Green Party’s long-time contender Mark Dearey and Peter Fitzpatrick, who is standing as an Independent this time around.Fitzpatrick is the unknown quantity the former Louth Gaelic football manager won a seat in 2016 for Fine Gael but left the party in 2018 over its pro-repeal stance in the abortion referendum and his frustrations over life on the backbenches. It is not clear whether as a celebrity candidate with a strong local profile he will take votes from Fine Gael by presenting himself as an ousted rebel, thereby tapping some of the clear anti-government sentiment, or whether he will struggle.Adams is certain of his own party’s chances of retaining two seats in the county.“I would like to think that it is a constituency we have republicanised. On the day if we get our vote out, we will be grand,” he said.If the reaction on the doorsteps of Cox’s Demesne – Dundalk’s first large council estate and a solidly Sinn Féin stronghold – is repeated elsewhere in the county, two TDs is definitely doable.Ó Murchú talks about Adams’s rock-star status and this is clear to see from the greetings he receives as limps about on Thursday afternoon. Asked what rocker his mentor most resembles, Ó Murchú joshes with Adams: “People have been talking about the Bee Gees lately but I am not sure he is too receptive to that jibe.”Republican dogThe only hostile reception for Sinn Féin around this estate comes from a dog named Saoirse who goes for a canvasser on a path to a front door, prompting a hard dash from freedom.“That’s the first dog called Saoirse that has ever attacked a republican, I think,” he says. “He must not be a republican dog he must be pretending to be a republican, a Fianna Fáil dog,” jokes John Connolly, a former IRA blanket man who now works for peace and his community. On the doorsteps, the party’s workers hear little of support for Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael. One man tells Adams he is adamant he won’t vote for “Leo Martin”. The constituent says that he is going to give his number two to Fitzpatrick, pointing to the Clann na Gael Gaelic club across the road from the estate, the sitting TD’s own club.The appetite around here is a clear desire for change and to see Sinn Féin in government. One of the canvassers out with Ó Murchú and Adams, Paddy Agnew, a former IRA member who was elected TD in this constituency during the 1981 hunger strikes, cannot understand the refusal of Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael to countenance coalition government with Sinn Féin.“There is peace everywhere. The war is over,” he said. “What do you have to do? Ian Paisley wouldn’t be doing what they are doing. They need to get on with it.” The best news and analysis from the campaign trail"},{"url":null,"title":"asia","story":"China criticises move saying it contradicts WHO appeal as death toll reaches 259US declares public health emergency, while Germany confirms its seventh caseWuhan and its people have shown tremendous spirit in response to coronavirus crisisHeatwave conditions expected to sweep through Victoria and New South Wales statesDeath toll rises to 170 as US reports first case of human-to-human transmissionIrish citizens to travel to UK as Russia closes border with China in bid to contain virus\u0026lsquoWhole world needs to be on alert now,\u0026rsquo says WHO as death toll rises to 132 and 6,000 infectedSome 47 people were on White Island when volcano erupted on December 9thHigh-speed rail and cross-border ferry services to be stopped, with flights reducedArdern\u0026rsquos Labour Party-led coalition in power since 2017 will face conservative challengeEmbassy exploring options to evacuate six Irish nationals under lockdown in cityIrish embassy in Beijing monitoring situation but has no plans for an evacuationChinese government steps up efforts to restrict travel and public gatheringsChina temporarily bans sale of wildlife as death toll rises to 56, with nearly 2,000 infectedCity of Wuhan to ban non-essential vehicles from downtown area starting from SundayAuthorities rush to build makeshift hospital as number of suspected cases nears 8,500WHO says it\u0026rsquos \u0026lsquotoo early\u0026rsquo to declare emergency as Scotland reports four suspected casesVerdict aimed at preventing threat of genocide rebuffs Aung San Suu Kyi\u0026rsquos assurancesVictims were American residents air tanker crashed while fighting fires in alpine regionWHO will determine on Thursday if outbreak constitutes a global health emergency"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4159023.1580549486!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus australia joins us in imposing china travel ban","story":"Two patients from the same family in England have tested positive for coronavirus, the first such cases in Britain. Major airlines have suspended flights to China and many countries have chartered planes to evacuate their citizens from Wuhan.\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tPeople queue to buy face masks from a shop in Hong Kong as a preventative measure following a virus outbreak which began in the Chinese city of Wuhan. Photograph: Philip FongAFPGetty Images.China has reacted angrily to a US entry ban on foreign nationals who have visited the country in the past two weeks, as countries around the world raced to contain the coronavirus outbreak amid a rising death toll.The US administration on Friday declared the virus a public health emergency, although it insisted the risk to Americans remained low.The Chinese government criticised the measures, saying it contradicted the World Health Organisation’s (WHO) appeal to avoid travel bans and implied that Beijing was not doing enough to contain the virus’s spread beyond China’s borders.On Saturday, Australia echoed measures taken by the US, declaring that no one travelling from mainland China would be allowed into Australia unless they were Australian citizens or residents or their dependents. Entry will be denied to anyone who has left or transited through mainland China from February 1st.The prime minister, Scott Morrison, said that the Australian government had raised the travel advice warning to level 4, recommending that no Australian travel to anywhere in mainland China, following the spread of coronavirus beyond Hubei province, where the outbreak is thought to have begun.Death toll risingThe death toll from the virus rose by 46 overnight to 259 - all in China - with nearly 12,000 confirmed cases.American citizens who have travelled within the past two weeks to Hubei province will be placed in quarantine for 14 days, the longest incubation period for the virus. Those who visited other parts of mainland China will undergo health checks and 14 days of “monitored self-quarantine”.The row came as another airline, Qantas, suspended direct flights to China and the organisers of the Tokyo 2020 Olympics were forced to respond to unfounded online rumours that the Games had been cancelled due to the outbreak. They insisted they were “not considering” cancelling the Olympics and Paralympics. “We will work closely with the IOC and other concerned bodies to draw any countermeasures whenever necessary,” they said.Apple Inc on Saturday said it would shut all of its official stores and corporate offices in mainland China until February 9th.It’s joining a handful of overseas retailers, including Starbucks Corp and McDonald’s Corp to temporarily shut storefronts as a precautionary measure.Japan, where 17 cases have been identified, announced similar restrictions on Friday, barring entry to foreigners who visited Hubei province within the past two weeks or obtained visas there.Singapore is banning entry to all Chinese visitors and foreigners with a recent history of travel to China, starting from Saturday. The ban - one of the most far-reaching moves to deter the fast-spreading virus - in effect shuts out the island’s largest group of visitors and will also bar other travellers who have been to China in the past 14 days.Japan has repatriated hundreds of citizens from in around Wuhan - the capital of Hubei province - three of whom tested positive for the disease.The US’s emergency measures were announced shortly before health authorities identified a seventh case in the US - a California man who became ill after traveling to China.Health emergencyAbout 60 million residents of Hubei province are subject to restrictions designed to slow the spread of the disease. But some people were leaving and entering the area by foot on a bridge over the Yangtze river, reports said, and infections have jumped in two cities near Wuhan.Robert Redfield, the director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said the US travel restrictions had been imposed after the WHO declared the coronavirus outbreak a global health emergency on Thursday.“I want to emphasise that this is a serious health situation in China, but I want to emphasise that the risk to the American public is currently low,” Mr Redfield said. “Our goal is to do all we can do to keep it that way.”The US state department warned Americans on Thursday not to travel to China.Almost 200 Americans evacuated earlier this week from Wuhan have been placed under a mandatory 14-day quarantine on Friday.Matthew McCoy, a theme park designer who lives in China, said he was “very relieved” to have been quarantined. “All of us really want to stay here and make sure we’re all medically clear and the public safe,” McCoy added.Mr McCoy said he had been able to work in his room on the base and had hooked his computer up to the television screen. “Children are outside playing, and everyone is trying to make the experience as easy as possible for each other,” he said.Another evacuee said he had been hoping to get out over the weekend but had accepted the quarantine order. “It’s the right thing to do, and I completely understand, and so do a lot of other people here on the base,” said Jarred Evans, who moved to Wuhan several years ago to play in a Chinese football league.“People want to go home. But its better than being stuck in the epidemic centre,” he said.”The US state department said it was in talks with Chinese authorities about further evacuations of hundreds of other US citizens who remain trapped in and around Wuhan. Most of the Americans who have been brought home are reportedly consular staff and their dependents.UK quarantineDozens of British nationals and their Chinese dependents who arrived in the UK from Wuhan on Friday were spending their first night in quarantine at Arrowe Park hospital on the Wirral, in north-west England, as Britain confirmed its first two cases of the respiratory illness, said to be members of the same family.Britain has also stared withdrawing some staff from its embassy and consulates in China. “As of January 31st, some staff and dependents from the British embassy and consulates are being withdrawn from China. Essential staff needed to continue critical work will remain,” a government statement said. “In the event that the situation deteriorates further, the ability of the British embassy and consulates to provide assistance to British nationals from within China may be limited.”The outbreak has caused serious disruption to sports events, with several competitions that were due to take place in China this month either moved to other countries or postponed.On Saturday, the organisers of the Lingshui China Masters badminton tournament - part of the qualifying process for the Tokyo Olympics - said they had postponed the event, which was supposed to have been held in Hainan later this month, after several players withdrew.Several airlines have cancelled services to China, including British Airways and all three major US carriers. On Saturday, Qantas said it would suspend its two direct flight routes from Australia to mainland China from 9 February."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4158065.1580507881!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"patrick freyne in parliament square brexiteers make hay at final fling","story":" Brexit supporters burned a European Union flag beside Downing Street in central London  as others jeered at pro-EU demonstrators in the final hours before the United Kingdom is due to leave the EU.

They’re all waiting for familiarly triumphalist speeches from Nigel Farage, Ann Widdecombe, Wetherspoon’s Tim Martin and others.All afternoon a few thousand people have been waving Union, St George’s and American flags while singing “Goodbye EU” to the tune of Auld Lang Syne. A stall is giving out free “English apples” while a man sells UK flags made in China (I checked). An Elvis impersonator sings Elvis songs rewritten to reflect BritishEU relations. Another man spends the day ostentatiously standing on an EU flag. People ring bells.Craig Thorpe, from ‘Bikers for Brexit’, tells me that Brexit is going to be so successful most EU countries will also leave. Voting Leave is more about sovereignty than immigration for him, he says. He runs a taxi firm and has many foreign drivers.\u0026nbsp“But migration is out of control, isn’t it?” says Jason Roberts.Kev Blackburn, who’s wearing a red Donald Trump hat, knows a man who can help. What if Trump doesn’t give them a good trade deal? “Like making us eat chlorinated chicken?” says another man.Geoff Courtenay is holding a sign that says “bye bye EU” a few times. He’s a “kipper” he says (UKIPer) but he’s worried about “the border down the Irish Sea”. He says border trade can surely be handled technologically and that Ireland “will have to have a sensible immigration policy”.\u0026nbspDan Day is setting up a table for a petition with the help of a little girl dressed as a Crusader. His huge placard reads: “We the Sovereign Citizens of the United Kingdom demand a redress of our God-given right to Liberty, Free Speech, Assembly, Self-defence, National Self-Determination and Christian Faith.” He has a small gun pinned to his lapel. “It’s a Thompson,” he says. “An English gun.” (It’s not an English gun). “We should have the right to bear arms.”But why? “Coming from an Irishman?” he says. “You should know why.”Nigel Marcham, “The Little Veteran”, is an activist affiliated with Never Surrender, a group that objects to trying veterans for crimes in service. Some of his friends wave flags featuring the Red Hand of Ulster. He’s accompanied by “The Active Patriot” who’s here today livestreaming everything on YouTube. The Active Patriot wears a T-shirt with the slogan: “It’s okay to be white”.\u0026nbsp“I made it specially for today,” he says. “Is there something wrong with being white?”Marcham talks at length about “racism against white people”. Eventually, I say that all of the problems he rails against sound like a product of right-wing classist policies rather than race and I point out that the British parliament is largely made up of white people. “It should be!” says Marcham.In St Stephen’s Tavern, a middle-aged woman responds to a man shouting “Get Brexit Done” by saying: “Brexit is the worst possible thing for refugees, for women, for children for disabled people”.“How did we win two world wars then?” he says.At around three, a small pro-EU protest march arrives and is greeted by people screaming “Fifth columnists!” and “Traitorous scum!”. A man gathers a ring of photographers around him as he burns what he says is an EU flag. “Was that really an EU flag?” someone asks. “It doesn’t look like the right colour.”“All I know is that it wasn’t my flag,” he says.A woman screams into a policeman’s face that he’s part of an institution that condones child abuse. A man from the English Defence League shouts at me: “You’re the Irish journalist. You can go right f**king back home.” He has apparently just seen me on Active Patriot’s live stream. Later I see him dancing blissfully to Sweet Caroline as it plays from a speaker on a truck.Judith Clementson has come from Portsmouth and says she’s been “fighting for this longer than Nigel”. In 1997, she ran for parliament with Jimmy Goldsmith’s Referendum Party. She wants sovereignty and “controlled” migration but believes most people here haven’t actually read the withdrawal agreement. She fears Britain will be embroiled with the EU for a long time. So, why is she here? “I’m celebrating the end of the beginning,” she says.\u0026nbspSixty-four-year old leaver Jeremy Ruygrok is explaining himself to a slightly exasperated remain-voter called Anthony. Ruygrok is a half-Dutch Taoist whose father was a follower of the mystic Aleister Crowley. He has lived all over the world but his business was ripped off, he says, and now he’s homeless in London. He’s been energised by Brexit, he says, “but Britain has been lost to cultural Marxists”.Anthony can’t believe what he’s hearing: “But you’ve literally just won!”“I’ve been black pilled,” says Ruygrok before explaining “the pills”. To be blue pilled, he explains, is to be ignorant of the world’s deep conspiracies. To be red pilled is to see them. To be black pilled is to see them but still believe all is lost. He thinks a civil war is on the horizon. “I don’t really have hope for the future.” He laughs. “But let them have their day.”He’s planning to leave Britain. Where will he go? “Orban’s Hungary” he says.“But you can’t travel there freely anymore,” says Anthony. “You voted for that!”“Orban has said he’ll take us in. They’ve got things right over there.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches. See more here.

The passengers have since arrived at an NHS facility in the Wirral by bus, where they will be quarantined for two weeks.While those attending the group wore hazmat protection suits, the drivers wore no protective gear or masks.Officials said risk assessments had deemed that they did not need protection, because they did not have close contact with the group, which is defined as being within two metres of a person for at least 15 minutes. Rows of seats between the driver and group were left empty.The group in the Wirral are being housed in fully furnished rooms, with access to food, laundry facilities and access to medical staff who will monitor their condition. Anyone with suspicious symptoms will be taken to the Royal Liverpool and Broadgreen Hospital.Prof Paul Hunter, a professor of medicine at the University of East Anglia, said the measures taken by PHE to prevent the possible spread of disease were inadequate.He said it was “worrying” officials had revealed so little about the victims of the outbreak, and said they had a duty to ensure those who had been put at risk knew about it.Professor Sharon Peacock, national infection service director, said anyone who believed they had been in contact with the two people in York should “self-isolate” for 14 days, and call their GP or dial 111 if they developed symptoms.PHE could not explain how people could do this without knowing who the pair are. These are the first two confirmed cases of the deadly virus on British soilProf Peacock said PHE currently do not have “any idea” how many people may have been in contact with the infected patients. Officials said the design of the apartment-style accomodation in York was such that there was “minimal interaction between guests,” so that closing the hotel block was not deemed necessary. The assurances came despite warnings from WHO that the virus, which is mainly spread through coughs and sneezes, can also survive for short periods on surfaces.Guests at the apartment block said staff had not told them the pair had been taken away to be tested for coronavirus, with them only learning about the cases on the news.Yesterday Andy Neale, who was visiting York from Manchester with his girlfriend, said:  “I’m fuming about not being told.” He said: I am a bit shocked because this morning one of the members of staff said it was nothing when I presented them with a news article.We asked again this afternoon at around 3:30pm and they said they were waiting to hear from the NHS and said \u0027don\u0027t worry\u0027. I am quite angry about it.”Yesterday, England\u0027s chief medical officer Professor Chris Whitty said: We can confirm that two patients in England, who are members of the same family, have tested positive for coronavirus. The patients are receiving specialist NHS care, and we are using tried and tested infection control procedures to prevent further spread of the virus.The NHS is extremely well-prepared and used to managing infections and we are already working rapidly to identify any contacts the patients had, to prevent further spread.”In a press conference, Professor Whitty said that anyone in Britain who has returned from China in the last fortnight with coughs and colds should “self-isolate” for two weeks.The chief medical officer warned that the epidemic in China is “spreading out of control” as Britain declared its first two cases.The senior medic said he was confident the UK would handle the threat, but he warned that coping with the disease was a “marathon not a sprint”.Until now, only those who have returned from Wuhan have been urged to take measure to prevent the spread of the disease.The new advice goes further.Prof Whitty said: “If people have come back from China with any symptoms they should self-isolate for 14 days. We are being pragmatic, it’s a relatively subtle shift but it is significant.”He said global figures so far, more than 11,000 cases and 259 deaths are “almost certainly an underestimate”. New research in The Lancet estimates that 75,000 are infected in Wuhan alone. Prof Whitty stressed that the threat level has been raised in the UK - from low to moderate - because of the spread of disease in China, not because two cases have been diagnosed here.He said: “The biggest course of transmission is in China. There are patients outside China but they are below 10 numbers. There have not been any deaths outside China. There have not been any sustained transmissions outside China.  All have managed to prevent sustained transmission .. we will get occasional cases that is not surprising… but we are confident in our ability to manage this.”He said the raising of UK threat levels, after the World Health Organisation declared a global emergency, related to the way the disease is spreading in China.He said: “The risk comes from the epidemic in China spreading out of control. The numbers are going up very fast.”He described the virus as “moderately transmissable” - “not at the top end of the range.”“In terms of mortality the numbers look around 2 per cent,” he said, comparing it favourably to other recent viruses.Ebola had mortality of 70 per cent, with rates of 30 per cent for Mers and 20 per cent for Sars, he said. This afternoon, a flight carrying 83 Britons landed at RAF Brize Norton after being evacuated from China.There were expected to be as many as 150 passengers from the UK on board, and several people complained that they were told too late to make it to the airport.Joe Armitt, who is on the flight, told Sky News that the plane is very empty.Reacting to the news of confirmed cases of the deadly disease in the UK, Prof Paul Hunter, Professor in Medicine, University of East Anglia, said: “The report of the first two cases diagnosed positive for 2019-nCoV in the UK is not surprising and was almost inevitable. The Chief Medical Officer’s statement gives no information on where these two members of the same family acquired their infection. The two cases are members of the same family but no information has been released about whether both cases will have been infected simultaneously or whether one would have passed the infection to the other.“The NHS is well able to nurse people with this novel coronavirus as it has successfully and safely managed a number of cases of both SARS and MERS in the past. With the information available it is not possible to judge what risk if any there may be of spread within the community.”A French flight carrying around 200 people landed near Marseille this morning and they will be placed in quarantine in a holiday camp for two weeks.One of the French citizens evacuated from Wuhan has been hospitalised with coronavirus symptoms.The evacuations come as new figures suggest that as many as 35,000 passengers could be affected by the cancellation of flights to mainland China by UK airlines due to the coronavirus outbreak. Virgin Atlantic have suspended the route between Heathrow and Shanghai for two weeks, while British Airways said on Wednesday that daily flights from London to Shanghai and Beijing had been grounded.The World Health Organisation (WHO) declared a global health emergency on January 30 as the coronavirus outbreak continues to spread around the world. As of Friday morning, 9,776 cases have been confirmed and 213 people in China have died.But Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO director general said the decision to declare an emergency was not a reflection on China\u0027s handling of the crisis - instead it was prompted by the spread of the virus to countries with weaker health systems.“The main reason for this declaration is not because of what is happening in China,” said Dr Tedros. “Our greatest concern is the deportation of the virus … to countries with weaker health systems and which are ill prepared to deal with it.”On Thursday India confirmed its first case of the coronavirus and authorities have now said that 1,000 people are under observation in Kerala. The confirmation came as new infections continued to emerge across the globe - 24 countries and territories have now reported cases. Thailand, Hong Kong, Japan and Singapore have all identified more than 10 cases, while Australia and Taiwan have 9 each, Malaysia 8 and Macau 7. In Europe, France has reported five cases as of Friday morning, Germany four, and Italy has declared a state of emergency after reporting two coronavirus infections overnight. Sweden confirmed its first case on Friday afternoon.Thailand has confirmed its first case of human-human transmission after a taxi driver was infected with the coronavirus. It is the fifth country - following the United States, Vietnam, Germany and Japan - outside China to report domestic spread.But when announcing a global emergency, the WHO also warned against placing trade and travel restrictions on China such as border closures, visa restrictions, quarantines of healthy travellers and evacuating foreign nationals from Wuhan, saying these measures were unnecessary.But countries are continuing to ramp up containment measures - and the US has been sharply criticised by Beijing after raising the travel warning to the highest possible level, effectively warning Americans not to travel to the country and urging those already there to leave. Certain US officials\u0027 words and actions are neither factual nor appropriate, China\u0027s foreign affairs ministry spokesman said. Just as the WHO recommended against travel restrictions, the US rushed to go in the opposite way. Certainly not a gesture of goodwill.But on Friday, the US said it was barring entry for foreign nationals who have travelled to China in the past two weeks. Americans who have spent time in Hubei province will be quarantined.Six of Hong Kong’s 14 mainland crossings with China have now also been sealed, while Singapore has announced it is closing its border.Saudi Arabia has joined a raft of countries in advising citizens not to travel to China, Pakistan has suspended all flights to China and Guatemala is imposing a blanket ban on anyone who has recently been to China. Russia has also confirmed it\u0027s first two cases - despite closing its 2,670 mile border with China and announcing it will stop issuing electronic visas to Chinese nationals. Russia\u0027s deputy prime minister said that the infected people had been isolated, adding that all direct flights to China would he halted from 9pm this evening - with the exception of one airline, Aeroflot.The outbreak is continuing to have huge implications for China\u0027s economy as unprecedented quarantines continue.And on Friday, film makers announced that a new movie, Enter the Fat Dragon, will premiere via online streaming on Saturday instead of in cinemas due to the coronavirus. It is the second film in China to debut online because of the outbreak.Giovanni Torre in Perth writes: The Australian Government has come under fire for its plan to quarantine hundreds of its citizens on Christmas Island, almost 2,000km from the country’s coast, after evacuating them from Hubei Province in China.Australia now has nine confirmed cases of coronavirus, with several more suspected.More than 600 Australians have registered for help after the Chinese government effectively locked down Wuhan and surrounding areas in Hubei province. 150, so far, have expressed interest in the Christmas Island plan.More than 140 of the 600 are children.The evacuees, mostly Australians of Chinese descent or origin, would be quarantined on the remote Australian territory for two weeks.Some of them, and medical experts in Australia, have raised concerns about the plan but the Government maintains it is the most practical solution in the short term.Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton told local media on Thursday that he “can\u0027t clear out a hospital in Sydney or Melbourne or Brisbane”.“I don\u0027t have a facility otherwise that we can quickly accommodate for what might be many hundreds of people, and Christmas Island is purpose-built for exactly this scenario,” he said.Christmas Island has been used by the Australian Government to detain asylum seekers, and the facility in question currently holds a young Tamil family from Sri Lanka who face deportation despite an outcry from the Queensland community in which they had settled.Conditions in the detention facility have long been criticised by human rights advocates.Officials have told the prospective Wuhan evacuees they will need to pay A$1,000 (£512) for the flight to Christmas Island, and agree to stay there for two weeks, before returning to Australia if it is safe to do so.The recent evacuation by the Royal Australian Navy of people from Mallacoota as a result of Australia’s ongoing fire crisis did not include a price tag for those rescued.The head of the Australian Medical Association, Dr Tony Bartone, said Christmas Island is ill-prepared to receive the evacuees, as its medical facilities are inadequate if somebody falls seriously ill.Dr Bartone said Australia was among the most capable countries in the world at containing the spread of infectious diseases, but that Christmas Island was ill-conceived as a health quarantine location.“We feel that the repatriation to Christmas Island, to a place which has been previously the focus of populations under enormous mental and physical trauma and anguish, is not a really appropriate solution. We’ll be calling on the PM and the relevant ministers to find a much more humane solution to dealing with a group of very vulnerable and concerned Australians,” he told local media.Researchers from the University of Queensland are part of a team working to develop a vaccine to the virus within four months.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2020/01/31/TELEMMGLPICT000223280071_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"did not choose brexit did choose democracy","story":"I became quite bloody-minded about Brexit when extreme Remainers attempted to overturn the democratic voteIt’s a lesson we are meant to learn as children. If there’s a plaster to be ripped off, or a foul tonic to swallow, best do it quickly. It’s the same with break-ups, work-outs or injections – and, as it turns out, with political decisions too.I voted Remain in 2016 and the result stunned me. Within hours, I was witnessing quarrels and tears where before there had been political chatter and reasoned debate. The next day, I went to a party in Cambridge that had the atmosphere of a funeral. I felt like a reader suddenly falling into the pages of a book, bereft of the blurb and the index and the contents page.My writing from that initial week shows a rambling attempt to get to grips with this democratic revolution, based on the realisation that all the political facts had changed. What I had not anticipated was that, elsewhere in the great, shocked metropolis where I was writing, the brains of a small but powerful group of other Remain voters had gone into lockdown, like computers endlessly repeating one, static command: “No. No. No. No.”One of the most prominent, Gina Miller, recounted her experience of referendum night. After several hours glued to the television and a period spent vomiting, she went into full-blown denial. “You’re going to do something, Mummy, you always do,” her child said to her and she replied, “I’m not promising anything, but I will talk to some lawyers.”These lawyers, like Japanese knotweed, turned out to be so voracious and single-minded that only the fire of a searing electoral event could eventually blast them away. It wasn’t just the lawyers, though. All around, the vote had set off mysterious processes in certain people’s minds that no observer, let alone the subject, could comprehend.Brexit Day: in picturesFormerly reasoned people became frothing extremists. Timid intellectuals started denouncing the notion of a universal franchise. Sensible professionals who had sneered at conspiracy theorists, and even official government quangos, began touting the idea of a secret Russian plot. A debate arose about how fast Britain’s death rate would have to go in order to kill off “enough” Brexit voters.This was certainly unpleasant, but it also felt rather desperate. Visiting Brussels in late 2016, I was amazed to hear German and Dutch policy wonks wondering quietly whether, actually, Brexit might not happen at all, or whether we would end up remaining in the single market. I wondered how they could misunderstand us so completely.All of this might have died out fairly quickly if the 2017 general election had not, at precisely the wrong moment, upturned a consensus developing out of the referendum. Suddenly, the grief-stricken, shell-shocked counter-revolutionaries began to sense that power – of which they had been cruelly deprived after wielding it for so long – was once again within their grasp.Unfortunately, the idea sent them loopy. Quickly, this small minority of diehard Remainers, who make up such an astonishing proportion of the political classes, parted ways with the rest of us. During several dinners that I attended with “People’s Vote” types, they began to sound increasingly unmoored from reality and increasingly unembarrassed by their contempt for everyone else.Yet, to my surprise, the more success they had, the more it seemed as if we might really go there and start trying to reverse a genuine, democratic vote, the more I began to feel quite bloody-minded about Brexit. The cleverer the arguments became, the more convoluted the legal methods and the more righteous the rhetoric, the more obvious it was how overwhelmingly wrong their project was.The  never wavered | MPs praise the  for its Brexit stanceBrexit was not my choice. But democracy was, and is. Democracy cannot be lightly discarded or ingeniously argued away by lawyers. It must be chosen over and over in order to exist, especially when its results are most unpalatable. Yet this truth, which became more and more obvious to me and most other Remain voters in the country, seemed to become more and more obscure to our politicians and their allies.Perhaps this mania was just what we needed. For it was when the Liberal Democrats, sensationally jumping the shark, vowed to reverse the referendum result without even holding another one that the wrongness of the mission was fully revealed. Even the most extreme, committed Remainers I knew began to feel uneasy. “You can’t just reverse it,” they would say, and in doing so, finally admitted the original result’s legitimacy.Then there was the sweet, sweet joy of election night. It was sweet first and foremost because of the demolition of the Corbynistas. But soon, relief at the settling of Brexit also began to seep in.With incredible swiftness, the Remain project was wholly disbanded, not just legally, but in the hearts and minds of its most avid supporters. No one seems to be more surprised by what a relief this is than the supporters themselves.Of course, there are still a few unreformed reactionaries left. They are still carping on social media, vowing to bury their commemorative Brexit 50ps in the back garden or to wear black each year and walk the streets bewailing our fate. For the most part, however, the country has gone from a toxic soup of recrimination to a mood of quiet dignity and cautious optimism.I know that some Europeans who have lived in this country for years still feel that Brexit has robbed them of their home and cast them adrift. We can only hope that the country’s new spirit of acceptance and self-confidence can convince them that Britain is still the tolerant, enlightened place they thought it was. I think, over time, it will become clear that little has changed on that front.For my part, I find myself curiously reassured. In June 2016, I thought that the referendum had thrown into chaos everything I knew about politics. But, actually, it wasn’t the Brexit vote that did that. It was the shameless, all-encompassing effort to subvert the result of a democratic vote that threatened to turn this country upside down, because it risked depriving us of our most basic political instinct: respect for the act of voting.So, last night I raised a glass not to Brexit, but to British democracy. The point, after all, isn’t just to leave, but to decide for ourselves what happens next.The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

I mean, very basic. I’ve driven a fair few in my time – and this year will be sampling many more. This is a bit of what I’ve learned, imperfectly, thus far.\u0026nbspIt is not, for these purposes, a “hybrid”, like the Toyota\u0026nbspPrius\u0026nbspor any other vehicle that also has an internal combustion engine on board (with one of two very particular exceptions).\u0026nbspAn electric car is a pure thing – it runs completely and solely on its batteries. When they run out, you stop moving.\u0026nbspI like to think of it as a cross between a washing machine, a laptop and,\u0026nbsperm, a car. So, your car is driven entirely by electric power – powerful lithium-ion batteries (like in your laptop) sending electricity to an electric motor (like your washing machine) which drives the road wheels (like on your motor car).\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch. Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.210 Prince of Wales Drive, Battersea, London210 Prince of Wales Drive, Battersea, LondonThe electricity stored in the batteries mostly comes from being plugged into the mains (there are various charging options, most commonly a fast charger attached to the side of your home, if you have the space). Some will be regenerated from the car itself, saving power otherwise wasted when braking, for example.\u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp2 Don’t some electric cars run on hydrogen?Yes, but they are not much more than prototypes, with only a handful of filling stations currently. Critics say using a hydrogen fuel cell to generate the electricity for the batteries simply adds an additional stage of energy accumulation and the manufacture of the hydrogen could be problematic, if it requires a disproportionate amount of non-renewable electricity.\u0026nbsp3 How far will one go on a charge?Well, that depends, but you can count on a modern mainstream electric car these days to bae able to take you 200 to 250 miles (conservatively) on a single charge – a\u0026nbspKia\u0026nbspe-Niro, say, or Hyundai\u0026nbspKona\u0026nbspelectric. In the right hands, 300 miles might be possible. This, by the way is two or three times the usual range you’d experience a few years ago.\u0026nbspFeeling the spark: Drivers learning to love electric carsThe most advanced models, such as the famous Tesla range, will go on and on for near enough 400 miles. Some of the smaller more urban-oriented models, such as the new electric Smart cars will be good for about 100 miles.\u0026nbspThe rest is down to how you drive and when. Winter means the batteries tend to run down faster and you’ll likely get a shorter range.\u0026nbspIf you drive hard and fast you’ll use up more energy than otherwise, just like in a petrol or diesel car. Over along time the ability of the batteries to take and store a charge will deteriorate (just like your smartphone or laptop).Yes. To buy or lease you’re looking at a premium of some thousands of pounds. So, let’s take an example, the Hyundai\u0026nbspKona, a compact\u0026nbspSUV.\u0026nbsp With a conventional petrol engine you can pick one up at a list price of £17,505. For the hybrid version (petrol plus electric power generated on-board) you’ll need to fork out £22,495. For the\u0026nbspBEV\u0026nbspHyundai\u0026nbspKona\u0026nbspelectric, the price jumps to £35,100, or £32,600 when you take into account the government grant for electric cars of up to £3,500. \u0026nbspAgainst the usually higher purchase price or monthly PCP or lease fee you need to balance the savings you make compared t petrol or diesel: far cheaper fuel spending on your electricity tariff) lower running costs (fewer moving mechanical parts and consumables eg exhaust pipe, alternator, engine) and a range of lower taxes and congest and parking charges. Electric cars are exempt from road tax, carry lower benefit-in-kind tax liabilities for commercial users, usually form congestion charges and city bans, and can enjoy cheaper parking. There’s also a government subsidy of up to £500 for a home charger.\u0026nbspWhy have electric cars failed to spark with consumers? Has Tesla hastened the death of Britain’s electric car revolution?Grant Shapps’ plan for electric cars will make China a motoring giantWhether this makes financial sense really depends your pattern of car usage – the number of miles you do a year, and the type of journeys. With a lot of medium range commuting for example (say 60 miles a day) an electric car could pay for itself within a few years for sustained long-distance travelling then a diesel might make more sense.5 What are the advantages of an electric car?Apart from the financial ones it is of course far better for the environment. There are many debates about, say, the cost (in environmental terms) of mining rare minerals for the batteries, or transporting them vast distances to factories, or the energy used in making them. Also obviously an electric car that runs on electricity generated from soar power is better than one where the electricity happens to be generated by burning coal (ins or far as anyone can know this when they plug in).\u0026nbspHowever a reasonable assumption is that all electric cars are greener than any internal combustion engined equivalent, and that any public transport (rail or bus) is usually greener than any private alternative.Don’t forget that electric cars are very refined – being almost silent at any speed, and the acceleration form rest is startlingly fast, though they tend to run out of puff as they approach their top speeds. In other words they can be good to drive and to be driven in.6 What are the disadvantages?Surprisingly few, though it does depend on your circumstances. If you live in a flat or a terraced house, charging from home is obviously impossible or difficult, and the ease of use of an electric vehicle is much reduced. If you imagine that you’ll have to do journeys of more than 400 miles without warning, then an internal combustion engine is a surer way of getting wherever it is you might conceivably wish to go – though you’d need to take a break anyway.\u0026nbspIt’s fair to add that some of the public charging infrastructure leaves a bit to be desired – it could usefully be much bigger, more reliable and easier to use.And of course you do need to balance the financial sums against the clear practical and environmental plusses of being a green driver.\u0026nbsp7 Don’t they take ages to charge?Yes and no. The Tesla is an exception, in many ways, because it has a dedicated network of ultra-fast chargers, as well as being chargeable at home.\u0026nbspMost owners of electric cars have to rely on charging at home – but don’t\u0026nbsp have much trouble charging because they most likely have a home charging point, which does mean off-street parking for the moment. If you take a mainstream option like the Hyundai\u0026nbspKona\u0026nbspelectricity home, using a regular\u0026nbsp7kW\u0026nbspcharging point via its own cable a near-full zero to 80 per cent charge takes around 9 hours.A similar charge with a rapid charger (such as you’d fine at, say, motorway services)\u0026nbsptakes around an hour and a quarter. 75 minutes.\u0026nbspIn an emergency, you can also use a domestic three-pin charging lead, plugged into the mains at home like you’d plug in a kettle. However you’d looking at about 24 hours for a full charge – because the batteries are so big and the trickle form the domestic system so modest.\u0026nbsp8 Will they get easier to charge and go further in future?Yes. Much of the progress in the usefulness of the electric car is coming from improvements in battery “density” – the amount of useful power that can be stored in a an ever-more compact way.The battery pack is usually stored lower in the car, under the floor or the seats, and this can help with keeping the car stable (lower centre of gravity). Given that these units can grow very hot and need ventilation or water cooling for example, and have to be protected from water ingress (if fording a stream say, or just in a heavy downpour) , the progress in engineering in this field is truly impressive.\u0026nbspHowever, eventually the rate of improvement in range and efficiency will slow, and that might well mark an optimal moment to make a purchase or take on an electric car lease. But we cannot know when this will happen.9 What about hybrids?Well, what about hybrids? They are not electric cars. This is because they are, as the name implies, hybrids – a cross between an electric car and a traditional one powered by a petrol or diesel engine. Thus well-known hybrid models such as the Toyota\u0026nbspPrius\u0026nbsphave an internal combustion engine on board, as well as an electric motor and some batteries to boost performance and economy.\u0026nbspIn a hybrid the electric power is “self-generated”, which is to say that it comes from the engine regenerating and recycling power that might otherwise be wasted. So for example some of the power usually lost in heavy braking is instead sent back via the electric motor working “backwards” to the batteries, where it is stored for later use.\u0026nbspI drove 300 miles in an electric car and here’s what happenedMost hybrids pair an electric and a petrol engine because the two units tend to complement each other in use diesel-electric hybrids are rarer. “Mild” hybrids are just that – they have only a small ethic motor and minimal battery storage just to give a slight edge to reduce emissions and improve economy. The green advantage is quite marginal.\u0026nbspPlug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) have the additional option of charging from the mains, as with an electric car, but it is not necessary to do so.\u0026nbspThe drawback with the hybrid technology is the constant trade-offs that have to made between the energy saved through the battery-electric motor system, set against the additional weight of them, which of course tends to raise fuel consumption. Clever software can minimise these trade-offs to more acceptable levels, but they will always be there, as compared to a\u0026nbspBEV. Hybrids, indeed, in their complexity and weight, can represent the e worst of both worlds.\u0026nbsp10 Aren’t electric cars all a bit oddball?They have been, yes, but the next few months year will see the launch of some very well-known models with full-electric versions.\u0026nbsp These will include: the Vauxhall\u0026nbspCorsa-e Peugeot 208 electric Volvo\u0026nbspXC40\u0026nbspRecharge and the Mini electric. They join an already quiet impressive variety of electric cars on sale or soon to go on sale.From the tiny\u0026nbspSkoda\u0026nbspCiti GOe-iV\u0026nbspand Smart EQ through the Renault Zoe to the Nissan leaf to MG ZS and the Jaguar\u0026nbspiPace\u0026nbspthere are already options to match your tastes and budget. And there is also a small market in used models such as the Renault\u0026nbspFluence, Mitsubishi\u0026nbspIMEV, Vauxhall\u0026nbspAmpera\u0026nbspor first generation Nissan Leaf that might also suit.These cars will tend to have shorter ranges, though, while older Renaults may still have their batteries on monthly lease from the company. As always – do your own research, but you can approach an electric car with more positivity than ever before.\u0026nbsp \u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

His celebrity crush is Lily James.Meanwhile, the show has been sponsored by fast fashion brands (Missguided and then I Saw it First) for the last three years, giving viewers the opportunity to shop the female Islanders’ looks directly. Personally, I’ve always thought that Love Island contestants dress terribly: it’s Benidorm beaches meets Kardashian kitsch. But with prices starting at £5, the clothes are devastatingly cheap. Far cheaper than the designer garb we see on most TV stars. So I can understand the appeal. But I also know that every time someone buys one of those bikinis, or sparkly bodycon dresses, they’re adding fuel to fast fashion’s ever-blazing fire.But perhaps the onus is not on the consumer, or even the Love Island star. Lauren Bravo, author of How to Break Up with Fast Fashion, explains that the brands are the ones who should really be shouldering responsibility here. “These days we’re so used to instant gratification, and the idea that anyone can aspire to celebrity, that it seems reasonable for TV stars to sell us clothes and vice versa,” she tells me. “And it’s really hard, because I know what it’s like to love fashion and crave the clothes you’re seeing on people you admire, not to mention the huge social pressures on young people to keep that endless parade of new looks rolling over on their Instagram grid, so telling people who can’t necessarily afford to spend any more that their shopping habits are destroying the planet can feel snobbish and unfair.”Why I\u0027m giving up fast fashion #20PledgesBut, Bravo adds, the fact remains that those clothes simply cannot be made as cheaply as they’re sold. Somewhere down the line, someone is paying the price, whether it’s a garment worker barely surviving on poverty wages or a community grappling with industrial pollution.That’s not to say you can’t “get the Islander look” in a sustainable and eco-friendly way. Bravo suggests heading to secondhand shopping apps, like Depop, where you’ll find plenty of pre-loved items not dissimilar from the ones you see on the show. Some of them will be from fast fashion brands, but if you’re buying it there, you’re keeping that item in circulation as opposed to letting it wind up in landfill.\u0026nbspOr, you could take a closer look at some of the trends championed by Love Islanders, both past and present, and see that many (cycling shorts, mesh, high-waisted jeans and leopard print) hark back to another era, like, say, the 1990s. And what better way to shop Nineties fashion than by heading to your local Beyond Retro or Rokit, which will be jam-packed with original clothing from the decade that is not only more sustainable, but a hell of a lot cooler, too.How to Break Up with Fast Fashion by Lauren Bravo (£12.99, Headline Home) is out nowOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The reading was in line with analysts’ forecasts that it would hit the neutral 50-point mark that separates growth from contraction.New export orders slipped back after rising for the first time in over a year in December. However, the survey was conducted before January 20, the day the world receiving reported numbers of cases of the virus. “So this will be seen as largely meaningless,” said Jim Reid, global head of credit research at Deutsche Bank.There have been 213 confirmed deaths (up from 170 on Thursday) while the number of confirmed cases stands at 9,692 (up from 7,783). The number of confirmed cases has now topped the official recordings of 8,096 cases in the SARS epidemic.Deutsche’s China economists believe the turning point is not far away, and that assuming the measures taken are effective at containing the outbreak, the peak of new cases outside Hubei province — where Wuhan is located — will likely happen at some point next week.There has been growing concern in financial markets that Beijing may have sought to conceal the start and full extent to the virus to contain the risk of panic.Georgieva said the world was facing more unpredictability whether from pandemics, climate shocks and geopolitical tensions. “Preparedness, prevention and early action have to be in the bloodstream of policy makers,” she said.According to research by ING bank, SARS knocked 1.0 per cent off Chinese GDP back in 2003, but the huge uncertainty around the spread of the coronavirus makes the macro impact very difficult to forecast.It said that a 1 per cent fall in Chinese growth would mainly hit the Asia-Pacific region with countries such as South Korea, Thailand and Malaysia losing 0.3 percentage points. The impact on the UK would be around just 0.02 per cent.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The minutes of its meeting showed that it expects the UK House Price Index to have risen quite strongly in both the final quarter of 2019 and the first quarter of this year.Howard Archer, chief economic advisor to the EY Item Club, said the figures were another sign that the UK housing market has “at least temporarily stepped up a gear”.“Mortgage approvals in December were\u0026nbsphighly likely\u0026nbspsignificantly lifted by increased confidence and reduced uncertainties among housing market participants following the decisive general election result,” he said.Why the calm over interest rates might not lastFigures from the bank on Friday also showed growth in consumer credit, rising\u0026nbspby £1.2bn, while credit card borrowing increased\u0026nbspby the most since February, up by £412m.Household spending has helped to drive Britain’s economy over the past few years, helped by record levels of employment and a recovery in wage growth,\u0026nbspbut there were signs of a slowdown in spending in late 2019.The bank’s data also showed that December saw the biggest increase on record in net purchases of British government bonds by foreign investors –\u0026nbspan increase of £28.6bn. The records date back to 1982.Meanwhile, it emerged that the bank will be repaid €58m (£49m) by the European Central Bank after the UK leaves the European Union. Brexit will mean that the Bank of England pulls out of the European System of Central Banks.The bank holds 14.3 per cent of the European Central Bank’s subscribed capital, of which 3.75 per cent –\u0026nbspequivalent to €58m\u0026nbsp–\u0026nbspis paid up. The capital will be reallocated between the other EU central banks.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The Conservative Party won with an overall majorityA dog outside a polling station during the general election in NorthumberlandOne poster on the Debt Camel advice website said their payment was an “absolute joke”, adding that they had paid more in interest on\u0026nbspone of their dozens of loans than they would receive in redress. Another wrote: “My claim was £986. I’m getting about £43. It’s an absolute disgrace.”However, some customers were more positive about the payouts. Sam\u0026nbspWindle, who took out loans with\u0026nbspWonga\u0026nbspseveral years ago, said that although 4.3 per cent was less than he had hoped for, it was better than nothing.His redress amount was initially £5,200 before being reduced to £2,700, of which he received just £121. However, like many other\u0026nbspWonga\u0026nbspcustomers, he was not aware that he was due compensation until the administrators contacted him.Mr Windle, who has now cleared all of his debts, was at one point paying off around £300 interest to\u0026nbspWonga\u0026nbspon each of seven payday loans. “It was a vicious cycle really. I can honestly say the day I paid it all off was the happiest day of my life.”He added: “The only frustrating about the compensation\u0026nbspis that it was due to be paid in January bit that’s been put back to some point in the next four weeks. The communication from the administrators has been pretty poor really.”Sara Williams, a personal finance expert who runs the Debt Camel website, said: “People were told last year by the Wonga administrators what their compensation amount had been calculated at and they were warned their payout would be ‘significantly less’.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

On the average compensation of about £1000, they will get only £43.\u0026nbsp“Some people, remembering the stress the Wonga loans had caused them,\u0026nbsphave described this as an insult and not proper compensation at all.”Wonga had faced a barrage of criticism over the high interest it charged on loans and was accused of targeting those who were most vulnerable.In 2014, the firm wrote off £220m worth of debt belonging to 330,000 customers after admitting making loans to people who could not afford to repay them.Administrators had received 389,621 eligible claims from those said to have been sold unaffordable loans as of August 2019, according to documents filed with Companies House.Prior to its collapse in August 2018, Wonga blamed its difficulties on a “significant” increase in people making claims in relation to historic loans.

The reading was in line with analysts’ forecasts that it would hit the neutral 50-point mark that separates growth from contraction.New export orders slipped back after rising for the first time in over a year in December. However, the survey was conducted before January 20, the day the world receiving reported numbers of cases of the virus. “So this will be seen as largely meaningless,” said Jim Reid, global head of credit research at Deutsche Bank.There have been 213 confirmed deaths (up from 170 on Thursday) while the number of confirmed cases stands at 9,692 (up from 7,783). The number of confirmed cases has now topped the official recordings of 8,096 cases in the SARS epidemic.Deutsche’s China economists believe the turning point is not far away, and that assuming the measures taken are effective at containing the outbreak, the peak of new cases outside Hubei province — where Wuhan is located — will likely happen at some point next week.There has been growing concern in financial markets that Beijing may have sought to conceal the start and full extent to the virus to contain the risk of panic.Georgieva said the world was facing more unpredictability whether from pandemics, climate shocks and geopolitical tensions. “Preparedness, prevention and early action have to be in the bloodstream of policy makers,” she said.According to research by ING bank, SARS knocked 1.0 per cent off Chinese GDP back in 2003, but the huge uncertainty around the spread of the coronavirus makes the macro impact very difficult to forecast.It said that a 1 per cent fall in Chinese growth would mainly hit the Asia-Pacific region with countries such as South Korea, Thailand and Malaysia losing 0.3 percentage points. The impact on the UK would be around just 0.02 per cent.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

And while his performance in that film was certainly worthy of the accolade, you could argue the actor deserved nominations just as much for Nightcrawler, Nocturnal Naimals, Stronger, Prisoners, Enemy, and Donnie Darko. Pam Grier was not only robbed of an Oscar for Quentin Tarantino’s classic thriller Jackie Brown, she was robbed of a nomination full stop. Conversely, her co-star Robert Forster picked up a Supporting Actor nomination. Certainly, an oversight from the Academy.Jim Carrey has been nominated for more Grammy Awards than Oscars, having picked up a nomination for Best Spoken Word Album for Children in 2006 for A Series of Unfortunate Events. The academy, sadly, has never given Carrey a fair chance, despite winning over the world in the likes of Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, Man on the Moon and The Truman Show.Chastain has the aura of an Oscar winner. Somewhere down the line, surely one her roles won her an Oscar? Yet, despite nominations for The Help and Zero Dark, plus stand-out leading roles in films such as Molly’s Game, the actor still does not have a statuette.Of James Dean’s three credited film roles, two were nominated for Oscars – Giant and East of Eden (Rebel Without a Cause was not nominated). Only one of his films, Eden, was released before his tragic passing in 1955.The Academy members should hang their heads in shame for never nominating John Goodman, one of the finest ever character actors, for an award. Considering his brilliant performances in Raising Arizona (1987), Barton Fink (1991), The Big Lebowski (1998), O Brother, Where Art Thou? (2000), and Inside Llewyn Davis (2013) – and those are just his collaborations with the Coen Brothers – he must be wondering what he has to do to be acknowledged by the Academy. Salma Hayek’s career highlight, Frida, came within inches of bringing her an Oscar. Yet, it was not to be – the actor was beaten by Nicole Kidman in The Hours, and Hayak has since been ignored by the Academy.Michelle Pfeiffer was one of the most popular actors working in the 1980s and 1990s, nabbing Oscar nominations for Dangerous Liaisons (1988), The Fabulous Baker Boys (1989) and Love Field (1992). However, as the ceremonies came and went, no victory followed.That Rosario Dawson has become more associated with Superheroes than awards is a tragedy. Her roles in Rent, 25th Hour and Sin City have won her praise from critics and fans alike, but there’s still not an Oscar or Golden Globe mention on her IMDB page.You\u0027d think that Angela Lansbury, having won five Tony Awards and six Golden Globes, would have at least one Oscar at home. Not so. Despite her three nominations – for Gaslight (1944), The Picture of Dorian Gray (1945) and The Manchurian Candidate (1962) – the Dame is yet to triumph at the Academy Awards. Oscar Isaac, his many fans argue, was robbed of an Oscar nomination for Inside Llewyn Davis. The critically acclaimed Coen brothers film failed to make the Best Picture cut, and poor Isaac, who played the eponymous struggling folk singer to perfection, was left without a nod. He was also overlooked for Ex Machina and A Most Violent Year.The Princess Bride, Forrest Gump, Moneyball: Robin Wright has consistently left critics and audiences impressed. And while no Oscars have followed, her work on the TV series House of Card has earned her seven primetime Emmy award nominations.Bradley Cooper’s directorial debut, A Star is Born, had won acclaim across the board and looked set for Oscars glory (with a Best Actor award almost within grasp). However, Rami Malek stole victory away from him at the last moment. Perhaps the best run of his career came between 2013 and 2015, when he was nominated for three consecutive acting Oscars: Silver Linings Playbook, American Hustle and American Sniper.You would be forgiven for presuming Joaquin Phoenix has an Oscar statuette somewhere at home. Yet the star of The Master, Walk the Line and Gladiator – all for which he was nominated – has no such award lying around. Instead, Phoenix will have to make do with a Golden Globe, a Grammy (for his work on the Walk the Line soundtrack) and a People’s Choice Award.Angela Bassett has had one of the most prolific careers in Hollywood history, starring in dozens of TV shows and films. Her roles in What\u0027s Love Got to Do with It (1993), Malcolm X (1992) and Music of the Heart (1999) won awards elsewhere – but not with the Academy.Sigourney Weaver on the set of the original Alien film in 1979Despite playing multiple roles that seem like certain Oscar winners, David Oyelowo has never even been nominated for an award. His role as Martin Luther King Jr in 2014’s Selma has gone down as one of the biggest snubs in recent history and was one of many incidents that led to the #OscarsSoWhite movement.One of the most iconic actors of all time, Marilyn Monroe never received an Oscar nomination. Gentlemen Prefer Blondes (1953), How to Marry a Millionaire (1953) and Some Like It Hot (1959) may have gone down as classics, but Monroe never stood out enough for the Academy.The Big Lebowski, Fargo, Reservoir Dogs, Miller\u0027s Crossing, Con Air, Armageddon, Big Fish, The Death of Stalin and Barton Fink... just several films Steve Buscemi was not nominated for an Oscar for. In fact, Buscemi has never been nominated for an Academy Award.Three Oscar nominations for Woody Harrelson, and three loses for Woody Harrelson – Larry Flynt in The People vs Larry Flynt (1996), The Messenger (2009) and Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri (2017). But, like that widely shared Zombieland GIF, Harrelson will be wiping away the tears with a wedge of dollar bills, his films having made more than $3 billion at the box office worldwide.Mia Farrow may have starred in the classics Rosemary’s Baby, Broadway Danny Rose and The Purple Rose of Cairo, but not a single nomination followed. Surprising for someone who has won three Baftas and a Golden Globe.While many people suspected Idris Elba would score an Oscar nomination for Beasts of No Nation, the Academy’s hatred for Netflix proved too strong (Bafta and the Globes nominated him instead). Even other prime Oscar-bait – Molly’s Game, Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom, Second Coming – failed to land Elba any nominations. No wonder, perhaps, that the actor has stuck primarily to multi-million-dollar blockbusters.Having had acclaimed roles in American History X, Fight Club and Birdman, Edward Norton will no doubt go down as one of America’s most talented actors. Unfortunately, the actor has no Oscars to show it.By starring in both Lost in Translation and Girl with a Pearl Earring, Scarlett Johansson shot herself slightly in the foot in 2003. For the two roles, she landed double Leading Actress nominations at Bafta (winning for Translation) and two Globes nominations. The Oscars? Not one. And despite standout roles in Lucy, Under the Skin, Match Pint, A Love Song for Bobby Long, she still has never been nominated for an Oscar.Samuel L Jackson is one of the most prolific actors working in Hollywood and has one Oscar nomination – for Pulp Fiction (1995). Considering he’s ranked as the highest all-time box office star, having made over $12 billion worldwide, the Avengers actor’s probably not all that upset.GettySamuel L Jackson poses at a portrait session during day three of the 13th annual Dubai International Film FestivalWith four Oscar nominations under her belt, Michelle Williams somehow still has no statuette placed on her mantelpiece. Her closest call came in 2016, when she starred in Manchester By the Sea, when she was up against the supreme Viola Davis, who went on to win the award for Fences.Few actors can attest to being as hardworking as Annette Bening. Revered for her work onstage, she also won acclaim for Oscar-nominated on-screen roles in The Grifters (1990), American Beauty (1999) and The Kids Are Alright (2010). That she was completely overlooked for 20th Century Women in 2017 was a glaring oversight. Kirk Douglas was a leading man in Hollywood’s Golden Age, his roles in Spartacus, Lust for Life and Champion inspiring a generation of actors after him. Still, the actor never won a competitive Oscar – only an honorary one in 1996, for his 50 years in the creative industry.Irene Dunne – nominated five times – is one of the few recipients of the Kennedy Centre Honours for her service to the performing arts. Yet her performances in Cimarron (1931), Theodora Goes Wild (1936), The Awful Truth (1937), Love Affair (1939) and I Remember Mama (1948) all went unrewarded by the Academy.One of the world’s most accomplished character actors, Arthur Kennedy was best known for his supporting roles in films such as Champion (1949), Trial (1955), Peyton Place (1957) and Some Came Running (1958), all of which won him Oscar nods. And despite a leading actor nomination in 1951 for Lights Out, Kennedy still couldn’t manage a win.One of Britain’s premiere Shakespearean actors, Albert Finney was nominated five times across almost four decades, for Tom Jones (1963), Murder on the Orient Express (1974), The Dresser (1983), Under the Volcano (1984) and Erin Brockovich (2000).Six-time nominee Dame Deborah Kerr famously failed to win for the musical The King and I – losing to Ingrid Bergman in Anastasia. Thankfully, the Academy realised their error years later, awarding Kerr an honorary award and calling her “a dedicated actress whose motion picture career has always stood for perfection, discipline and elegance.Another actor with six nominations and no wins. Even a role in 1950s All About Eve, which would win Best Picture, couldn’t push Thelma Ritter to victory. She went on to be nominated four more times that decade, for The Mating Season (1951, With a Song in My Heart (1952), Pickup on South Street (1953), and Pillow Talk (1959).Another much-nominated actor without a win, Glenn\u0027s most recent Close shave came at the 2019 Oscars, when she was nominated for The Wife. She has previously been nominated six time, including roles in The World According to Garp (1982). Fatal Attraction (1987), and Dangerous Liaisons (1988) .Amy Adams comes just behind Close, with six nominations (including The Fighter, The Master and American Hustle). None of those were for Arrival, the sci-fi film that saw Adams pick up Bafta, Golden Globe and Screen Actors Guild nominations. Unfortunately, that same year, she was competing against herself in Nocturnal Animals, which likely split the Oscars vote.Richard Burton holds the record for second-most Oscar nominations without a win (seven to Peter O’Toole’s eight). While Burton’s performance in Who\u0027s Afraid of Virginia Woolf? is often heralded as his best, the actor lost out to Paul Scofield in A Man for All Seasons.Peter O\u0027Toole is the Oscar’s most-nominated actor without a win, with eight nods in total. Although the actor did not take home a trophy for Lawrence of Arabia, The Lion in Winter and Goodbye, Mr Chips, O\u0027Toole was awarded an honorary Oscar in 2002.Jake Gyllenhaal has been nominated for one Oscar – for Brokeback Mountain. And while his performance in that film was certainly worthy of the accolade, you could argue the actor deserved nominations just as much for Nightcrawler, Nocturnal Naimals, Stronger, Prisoners, Enemy, and Donnie Darko.

Unfortunately, that same year, she was competing against herself in Nocturnal Animals, which likely split the Oscars vote.Richard Burton holds the record for second-most Oscar nominations without a win (seven to Peter O’Toole’s eight). While Burton’s performance in Who\u0027s Afraid of Virginia Woolf? is often heralded as his best, the actor lost out to Paul Scofield in A Man for All Seasons.Peter O\u0027Toole is the Oscar’s most-nominated actor without a win, with eight nods in total. Although the actor did not take home a trophy for Lawrence of Arabia, The Lion in Winter and Goodbye, Mr Chips, O\u0027Toole was awarded an honorary Oscar in 2002.He continued: “The people that see you more as a person, they’re gonna come to you as a more rounded being and they’re gonna ask it in a much more sensitive and nuanced way. They ain’t gonna reduce it like that, because they care about the impact of it, and the effect of it.“A lot of the people I’m talking to aren’t respectful of the issue, which is why they’ll reduce it, and they’ll twist it.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspReferencing the recent article that distorted\u0026nbspStormzy’s\u0026nbspquotes about racism existing in the UK, Kaluuya added: “Look at the Stormzy thing\u0026nbsp– boom, and it’s twisted.”Kaluuya appeared alongside Queen \u0026amp Slim star Jodie Turner-Smith on The Graham Norton Show, which was mired with criticism after viewers called out for Jim Carrey for making an “awkward” joke about Margot Robbie’s looks.Queen \u0026amp Slim is in cinemas now.Queen and Slim\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

No Home Record channels the dissonance and avant-garde vibe of New York’s experimental no-wave movement in a nine-song, genre-defiant collection that jumps between industrial, minimal electro-rock and abrasive art punk. Uniting the tracks is their creator’s restlessly questing, non-conformist spirit. It’s great to have her back. (EB)Nilüfer Yanya isn’t down with the “wellness” industry. On her debut album, Miss Universe, the singer-songwriter makes this perfectly clear, tearing into all those “improve yourself” schemes littered across social media and parcelling up that angst as cerebral, skewed alt-rock. ​Synths and saxophone play their part on the smoother, more soulful “Paradise” and “Baby Blu”. Listen to the driving groove of “Heat Rises”, meanwhile, and you’ll be instantly reminded of Kelis and Andre 3000’s “Millionaire”. That said, Yanya is very much her own artist: original and bold. (PS)Five years since their last album, the Ohioan duo have gone back to basics. Gone are the subtle inflections and lacquered psychedelia of Turn Blue Let’s Rock is all about simple hooks and nagging choruses, “an homage”, in the words of drummer Patrick Carney, “to the electric guitar”. Get past the terrible title, and you’ll be rewarded with a viscerally entertaining album that never lingers for more than four minutes per song. If this is genre pastiche, it’s genre pastiche done with skill and savvy. (PS)450 47) Bat for Lashes – Lost GirlsMusically, Lost Girls couldn’t be more Eighties if it were playing a Commodore 64 while eating Angel Delight. Like Stranger Things, everything about it is unashamedly nostalgic: the power drums, the moody atmospherics, the arpeggiated synths. Close your eyes and you can practically see Jason Patric on the Santa Cruz boardwalk in The Lost Boys​. Yes, nostalgia is a fairly generic formula. But listened to as a whole, the album positively thrums with sonic invention, managing to feel both fresh and full of intrigue. Khan once again demonstrates a knack for uncanny storytelling. (PS)On his debut album, the 24-year-old mixes sultry jams that recall the electronic funk of MGMT with nods to the greats: Prince, James Brown, Led Zeppelin and Marvin Gaye. Throughout, Collard exhibits his extraordinary voice, which swoops to a devilishly low murmur or soars to an ecstatic falsetto. On the lustful “Hell Song” he sings “less is more… but more is good”. You’re inclined to agree with him. (RO)When the Missouri singer broke out in 2014, she became known for her lo-fi, introspective sound and the staggering range and power of her voice. On All Mirrors, she dials things up even further than 2016’s Sixties-leaning My Woman, and turns her focus outwards – it is an album, she says, “about losing empathy, trust, love for destructive people” and “owning up to your darkest side”. It is also balletic and haywire, refusing to follow traditional rules of song structure. Listening to it feels like accidentally pressing play on two songs at once, and finding the combination strangely inebriating. (AP)750 44) Lizzo – Cuz I Love YouThis is a polished, playful album, though it has a DIY edge to it: “S**t, f**k, I didn’t know it was ending right there,” she chuckles in the final few moments of “Like a Girl”. “Girl, run this s**t back,” she says after a vivacious flute solo on “Tempo” – a song featuring a guest verse from Missy Elliott, the person who, Lizzo said on Twitter, “made this chubby, weird, black girl believe that ANYTHING was possible”. (AP)There’s no attempt to chase someone else’s wave here no token drill, afroswing or trap beats to satisfy playlist algorithms. Instead, his cold grime sonics are rendered down to their no-frills essentials – brutalist blocks of sad angular melodies and hard, spacious drums. The result is a quintessentially London record, as dark and moody as it is brash and innovative. “We used to do young and stupid,” Skepta concludes on “Gangsta”. “Now we do grown.” (IM)It lacks a centrepiece to match the arresting depth and space of Sweetener’s “God Is A Woman”, but Grande handles its shifting moods and cast of producers (including pop machines Max Martin and Tommy Brown) with engaging class and momentum. One minute you’re skanking along to the party brass of “Bloodline” the next floating into the semi-detached, heartbreak of “Ghostin’”, which appears to address Grande’s guilt at being with Davidson while pining for Miller. She sings of the late rapper as a “wingless angel” with featherlight high notes that will drop the sternest jaw. (HB)The Chicago-born singer’s ninth album is a furious reaction to the social and political events of 2018 – over 11 breathless tracks, he turns that anger into a howl of resistance. Each song feels personal yet relatable – the deep-rooted despair felt on “Trauma” at the sight of wealthy bullies rising to power is a universal one, as is the sense of liberation in just letting go on “What Can You Do But Rock n Roll”. Twelve Nudes is Furman’s most urgent and cathartic record. (RO)On his studio debut, YBN shows off his versatility, but not to the point that it distracts from the underlying message of each song. You have the menacing “Broke as F***”, where the beats and stark piano hook contrasts with Cordae’s rags-to-riches rap. Aged 21, the North Carolina artist flecks songs such as the Anderson .Paak-featuring “RNP” with an endearing kind of nonchalance over the woozy, psychedelic soul of opener “Wintertime”, meanwhile, he wonders how Corretta Scott King felt upon learning Martin Luther had cheated on her. It’s by no means a perfect album in the grand sense of the term, but it is a perfect demonstration of everything Cordae is capable of. (RO)Big Thief’s frontwoman Adrianne Lenker has an uncanny ability to make you feel like you’re in on a secret. Her whispering, spectral delivery and deeply personal lyrics are the key to this. Even on the band’s third album UFOF, with an audience that has grown exponentially in the past few years, the songs are still immensely intimate affairs. The album’s deathly intrigue is drawn from her own personal traumas, which she successfully spins into something that feels universal. But you don’t come away from this record feeling downcast. It’s more a reminder of how fleeting yet beautiful life is, and an appeal to make the most of it. (RO)1350 38) Jenny Lewis – On the LineHere, Lewis does what she does best: adds the glossy sparkle of Hollywood and a sunny Californian sheen to melancholy and nostalgia, with her most luxuriantly orchestrated album yet. Even when she’s singing, “I’ve wasted my youth”, it’s in that sweet voice, with carefree “doo doo doo doo doo doos”, and at a pace that’s so upbeat that it masks the sentiment. It’s a bittersweet mourning of her past. (EB)Few people have had as big a year as Billie Eilish. The first – and currently only – artist born in the Noughties to have a US number one single, she also released her double platinum debut album, the innovative and multifarious, if irksomely titled, When We All Fall Asleep Where Do We Go? There are some missteps –  “Wish You Were Gay” being one of them – but for the most part this is an album as full of charm and bite as Eilish herself. And with a melody that ducks and es in between the beat like a bank robber dodging lasers, the dark, dank pop-trap masterpiece “Bad Guy” is surely a contender for song of the year. (AP)One of the biggest new rap stars to emerge in 2019, AJ Tracey’s variety and the scale of his ambition on this album is breathtaking. Fans will be surprised to discover he sings almost as much as he raps, in pleasingly gruff tones. Each track is a standout, none more so than “Ladbroke Grove”, a hat-tip to classic garage in which Tracey switches up his flow to emulate a Nineties MC. It’s a thrilling work. (RO)The former Chairlift frontwoman’s solo debut (at least, her first under her own name) is an eccentric, experimental delight – PC music by way of classical pop. The product of a orce and a series of adrenal rushes she refers to as “pangs”, the album is musically agile and often lyrically stark: Sometimes I wonder Do I love you too much? Then I tell myself ‘Caroline, shut up’”, she sings on “Caroline Shut Up”. Polachek’s voice is her secret weapon – so jolting and elastic she had to prove it wasn’t autotuned in an astonishing Twitter video. (AP)Simpson recently said he wanted Sound \u0026amp Fury to “hit like a Wu-Tang record”, so each intro is like a one-two punch loaded with brilliant hooks. Then there’s the rollicking “A Good Look” and “Last Man Standing” – it’s pure rock and roll: sleazy, slick and lots of fun. Sound \u0026amp Fury marks another milestone for a remarkable artist. (RO)Of all the excellent bands to emerge out of Dublin’s booming music scene over the past few years, Fontaines DC are the best of them. Perhaps it’s the fact that they’re technically outsiders, having grown up on the borders of the city (or in their guitarist Carlos O’Connell’s case, between there and Spain). Frontman Grian Chatten eschews punk’s tradition of valuing shock value over songcraft and instead offers searing, literary observations of a city with which he has a lovehate relationship. (RO)1950 32) Vampire Weekend – Father of the BrideAlready subject to manic shifts in style and tempo, this hour-long LP roams in lounge pants from Deadhead jams to Zombies-catchy hooks, infectiously kitsch prog, highlife samples and – on “Sunflower” – a scat breakdown. An unfashionable record, then, and that may be its best asset. With such low stakes and barely any emotional intensity, Father of the Bride won’t cement Vampire Weekend’s legacy. But after a highly strung decade on the indie-rock A-list, it gives them room to breathe. (JM)“Making this album has allowed me, for the first time, to find compassion when I have been at my most ungraceful, confused and fractured,” FKA twigs writes in the album’s press notes. “I stopped judging myself, and at that moment found hope in MAGDALENE.” At times, MAGDALENE is just as ungraceful, confused and fractured as its creator was – a rush of baroque electronics, industrial noise, opera, synths, autotune and precarious falsetto. The follow-up to 2014’s LP1 is the sound of a woman teetering on the brink of collapse, gathering herself, and then erupting into a kind of defiance. (AP)2150 30) Bill Callahan – Shepherd in a Sheepskin VestBill Callahan returns after six years with this homely, career-best album in which he sings of his own contentment. “The panic room is now a nursery,” he observes on “Son of the Sea”. Death still looms – often in the form of a black dog that follows Callahan around various tracks – but its inevitability seems more of a comfort than something to be feared: “Everybody must walk the lonesome valley,” he sings firmly. “Yeah, they must walk it by themselves.” (RO)Arriving three years after the release of her debut, Nothing’s Real, Shura’s excellent second record is camp and theatrical, pivoting between a big, poppy sensibility and a minimalist, lo-fi one – sometimes on the same track. Lead single “Religion (U Can Lay Your Hands On Me)” is a slinky shoulder roll of a song, laden with passionate blasphemy: “I wanna consecrate your body, turn the water to wine, I know you’re thinking about kissing, too.” It’s laced, too, with piano – an instrument she’d always been “allergic to” before this record – and opulent orchestral strings. (AP)2350 28) Cage the Elephant – Social CuesOn Cage the Elephant’s fifth album, Social Cues, frontman Matt Shultz reacts to the breakdown of his marriage and the loss of three close friends. He undergoes a kind of Jekyll and Hyde transition through the 13 tracks, the result of which is the band’s best work to date. Single “Ready to let Go” is by far the most explicit – a moody swamp-rock jam where Shultz comes to terms with his impending orce. He bares his soul on Social Cues, and apparently shakes off a few demons in the process. (RO)Howard listened to Brazilian artist Jorge Ben – “where there’s literally, like, 18 different things happening in the song” – while she was making the album, and it shows. “13th Century Metal” builds like an alarm, while “Baby” is scatty and scattered, like something off The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill. Sometimes, there is one instrument too many, but usually the components crash together well. (AP)Written during her recent pregnancy and the birth of her first child, Remind Me Tomorrow shows Van Etten dimming her spotlight on toxicity and instead casting a warm glow behind the record’s psychic overview. As well as expectations of confessional singers, she subverts folk music’s focus on bare-bones songwriting. But the daintiest composition “Stay” is her most perfectly realised yet, over music box chimes and heel-clicking percussion she coos: “You won’t let me go astray You will let me find my way.” After years of making peace with drift and uncertainty, she’s never sounded more sure of anything. (JM)Inspired by the improvisations he was creating while on tour with The xx in 2017, Sam Shepherd found himself making “some of the most obtuse and aggressive music I’ve ever made”. This newfound drive can be heard in singles such as “LesAlpx”, a mind-melting track that climbs breathlessly towards its summit with a pounding bass beat and high, whistling chirps that punctuate the tension. It’s an insight into his brilliant mind and – such is the sheer variety of the album – a way to inspire one’s own imagination. (RO)2750 24) Stormzy – Heavy is the HeadThere are three themes that run through the record: his defiance in the face of doubt the pressure of high expectations and his efforts to lift others up as his success continues to grow. He reminds himself constantly of who he is beneath the gloss that fame has brought: he’s “Rachael’s Little Brother”, “Big Michael”, a guy who likes to watch Avengers and Game of Thrones. All of his best traits are present and correct: sincerity, a smooth flow and forensic-like analysis of societal ills, laced with pathos and humour. The lasting impression is of an artist whose only way is up. (RO)A blunt, bold album on which Hackman’s beatific voice sits atop methodically messy instrumentals. Songs such as “All Night” are so candidly carnal it feels inappropriate to listen to them in public notes of riot grrrl, pop and rock come together throughout the record to create something that is, at times, quite striking. (AP)2950 22) Solange – When I Get HomeThe decade’s second great Solange album churns several deformed, jazzy aesthetics – including Brainfeeder’s gloopy electro-funk and the concoctions of DJ Screw – into a lustrous cloud of R\u0026ampB. The result hints at Seventies soul voyagers like Stevie Wonder yet retains its future-shock, celebrating Houston futurism without pandering to fans of its explicitly political predecessor. (JM)For her fifth studio album, Cate Le Bon went to live in a secluded cottage in the Lake District, where she sang to an empty house and took lessons in wood-carving. Yet her compositions on Reward are lush, warm and whimsical opener “Miami” is resplendent with stately horns and percussion that reminds you of childhood. There’s a fantastic sense of space, too, spun from diaphanous arrangements such as “The Light”, where she meanders delightfully from a clear, lilting call to a deep vocal rumble. It’s an album by an artist intent on readdressing her relationship with her own existence. (RO)Fender drew plenty of early comparisons to Bruce Springsteen – on Hypersonic Missiles they’re entirely warranted, as much for the instrumentation as the lyricism and his vignettes of working-class struggle. There are sax solos (more than one), and pounding rhythms that make you want to jump in a car and drive down a highway at sunset, and blistering electric guitars next to classic troubadour acoustics. He has Springsteen’s rousing holler, and the early indications of someone who could be the voice of a generation – not because he wants to be, but because he sees things and understands. (RO)Swift’s sixth album Reputation was camp and melodramatic, killing off “the old Taylor” and waging war on anyone and everyone who dared to criticise her. It was sincerity veiled as self-parody, insecurity veiled as breeziness – and all the better for that uneasy paradox. But Lover, her new, seventh album, feels like a partial resurrection of the Swift of old: moony romance and earnest earworms abound. It’s the sound of a singer excited to be earnest again. Taylor Swift is dead. Long live Taylor Swift. (AP)The record is an introspective mix of psychey soul, blues, rock and funk, which skips and strolls and swaggers through its 13 tracks – but it is not simply an exercise in nostalgia. Its influences  decades Gil Scott-Heron, Fela Kuti, Kendrick Lamar and Bobby Womack are all recalled. “I’m not going to have an alter ego, or becomes Sasha Fierce or Ziggy Stardust,” says Kiwanuka. “I can just be Michael Kiwanuka.” With an album this good, it’s hard to argue with that. (AP)On his sixth album, Kano’s powers of observation are at their peak. Home has always been at the heart of his music, so he maintains the close-quarters perspective of his 2005 debut Home Sweet Home the swaggering confidence of that record, though, is replaced by a more thoughtful gravitas. He’s an elder statesman of grime, and you can almost see his furrowed brow and shake of his head on “Trouble”, while the frenetic “Class of Deja”, starring fellow veterans D Double E and Ghetts, reminds the listener how he lit the path for future generations. (RO)3550 16) Hot Chip – A Bath Full of EcstasyLyrically, the band offer up some of their most poignant phrases to date on this – their seventh and best record. Second single “Hungry Child”, a trance-y floor-filler, contains the plaintive, “Dreaming never felt so bad Lonely never felt so wrong before” while, over the shuffling beats of “Echo”, Alexis Taylor sings of leaving your regrets behind while seeming to understand the effort required to achieve this. For all its glimmering synths and the robotic pathos of Taylor’s idiosyncratic vocals, this is a record with both heart and soul. (RO)3650 15) MUNA – Saves the WorldSaves the World should see MUNA joining the ranks of those who have brazenly borrowed their sound. Lead single “Number One Fan” banishes intrusive thoughts – “Nobody likes me and I’m gonna die” – just in time for a lavish, self-celebratory chorus, one part earnest, one part tongue-in-cheek. Elsewhere, they are downright defeatist, laments the inevitable pull back to a recent ex (“Stayaway”) or reflecting on a lover’s similarity to an adulterous father (“Taken”). “Hands Off”, meanwhile, toys with temptation before slamming the door shut. It is fierce and forthright. (AP)Fans have already drawn comparisons between We Are Not Your Kind and Slipknot’s seminal 2001 album Iowa. While the latter was even heavier (it would be difficult if not impossible to outdo), the sheer ambition on We Are Not Your Kind is just as staggering. If anything, the dynamic created by placing a bigger emphasis on melody allows you to consider everything without being engulfed by noise. Critics may question how relevant Slipknot are in 2019. The pummelling force of We Are Not Your Kind should be enough to silence them – this may be one of the band’s most personal records, but the rage they capture is universally felt. (RO)Each song is titled after a black woman Rapsody admires: Serena Williams, Sojourner Truth, Maya Angelou, Aaliyah, Oprah Winfrey… and for each one she explores these women’s traits, successes and strife. As on Laila’s Wisdom, Eve conveys Rapsody’s natural feel for funk – “Michelle” (Obama) bounces in on a jaunty piano riff – but other tracks, such as “Afeni”, are pure soul. Nina Simone said an artist’s duty, “as far as I’m concerned, is to reflect the times”. This is precisely what Rapsody has done, in the most resonant way possible. (RO)There’s a deeper sense of personal connection to anchor Julia Jacklin’s lyrical and melodic smarts. That snare drum on “Pressure to Party” keeps a relentless, nerve-snapping pulse throughout, while “Don’t Know How to Keep Loving You” nails a depth of intimacy while acknowledging relationship ennui. Grunge-rinsed, feminist-flipped, upcycled Fifties guitar an’ all: Crushing is a triumph. (HB)Philippakis’s voice is shrouded in the smoke from society’s wreckage. Lead single “Exits”, six scintillating minutes of Eighties “sledgehammer” pop that lumbers into view like a heavy artillery vehicle covered in sequins, concerns the one percenters building underground cities to escape global warming. “Syrups” has Yannis howling a passionate post-apocalyptic vision of robot invasions and sand-clogged towns over a corroded Gorillaz dub that builds to a motoric charge as global panic sets in. An inspired album of scorched earth music. (MB)A talented pianist as well as a rapper and singer, Dave often spits over discordant chords to amplify the urgency of his chosen subject, or else raps in gruff, assertive tones across an emotional sequence that complements his stoic intensity. On “Environment”, he talks about the conflict between what people see of his apparently glamorous life, and the reality behind the scenes where the blood and sweat is drawn out of him. He’s put everything into this album. (RO)Weyes Blood, whose real name is Natalie Mering, accompanies her instrumental idiosyncrasies with strong, luscious melodies and unfussy lyrics. “No one’s ever gonna give you a trophy for all the pain and the things you’ve been through,” she sings on “Mirror Forever”. “No one knows but you.”And then there’s that voice – at once warm and haunting, controlled and untethered. It’s no wonder she’s lent it to the likes of Perfume Genius, Drugdealer and Ariel Pink: it adds a touch of profundity to everything it meets. (AP)The warm splashes of piano that washed over that song also break through the anxious rattle of dance beats on the album’s eponymous opener, the singer so regularly reviewed as “vaporous” promises to “leave the ether, assume form” and “be touchable, be reachable”. His own sharpest critic, he winks at the journalists who’ve called him glacial as he drops from remote, icy falsetto into a richly grained, deeper tone to ask: “Doesn’t it seem much warmer?” (HB)Following the traumatised chaos of 2016’s Skeleton Tree, Ghosteen is a warm cloud of ambient solace – a sonic evocation of the communion he has experienced through his newly porous relationship with his audience. He sounds buoyed, not weakened, by exposing his wounds. (HB)4550 6) Tyler, the Creator – IGORThe production here is superb. Tyler has never been one for traditional song structure, but on IGOR, which is undoubtedly a break-up album, he’s like the Minotaur – luring you through a maze that twists and turns around seemingly impossible corners, drawing you into the thrilling unknown. Its lack of resolution at the close – surely the most torturous element of a great love lost – makes it all the more powerful. (RO)The indie-rock band’s second album in the space of five months (the first being UFOF), was described as the “earth twin” and, indeed, they sound utterly grounded – to each other, and to their surroundings in the arid Chihuahuan Desert of Texas, near the Mexico border. In contrast to her fragile performance on UFOF, here Adrianne Lenker sings in lusty whoops and calls on “Forgotten Eyes”, while “Not”, the record’s dark, brooding soul, caterwauls with feedback screeches and a merciless, two-minute guitar solo that leaves you simultaneously devastated and enthralled. (RO)Bruce Springsteen seems to have told almost every tale in the grand old storybook of American mythologies, except perhaps one: a wide-eyed Californian dreamer finds the Golden State turns sour and flees back east, to some romantic speck of a town, to pine and rehabilitate. It’s the classic pop plotline of Bacharach and David’s “Do You Know the Way to San Jose?”, and it’s a tale Springsteen taps repeatedly here, on his sumptuous, cinematic 19th album, which is nothing short of a late-period masterpiece. (MB)Few albums in 2019 have been as eclectic, or with as singular a vision, as Simz’s GREY Area. She flips between two tones: formidable and reflective. On tracks such as “Offence” and “Boss” she drips with venom delivering lines in a low, deadly buzz over killer bass hooks and punk distortion. On “Selfish” and “Flowers” she’s softer – allowing herself to be vulnerable because she knows she doesn’t have to ditch all sentiment to compete with her male peers. She’s better because she embraces every facet of herself, and offers it to the listener in as clear a statement as possible. (RO)Lana Del Rey has always been obsessed with the past. Hers is a sound rooted in nostalgia, a paean to everything she was born too late to live through: old Hollywood, Sinatra, beat poetry, Sylvia Plath and Fifties Americana. At her best, she mines something fresh from it all. At her worst, she wallows in it. Her new album Norman F**king Rockwell!, named after a 20th-century American artist, does both. (AP)When Aldous Harding performed in London this month, an enamoured fan cried out that they loved her. “I appreciate that,” she replied softly. “But, I’m busy.” The response is Harding to a T – wry, weird, introspective, focused. Her spectacular, singular third album, Designer, is all of those things. Taking the left-field folk that made her name and splashing post-psych pop and jittery orchestral flourishes onto the canvas, the New Zealander harbours secrets while beckoning you in. The debut solo album of the art-punk pioneer was never going to be predictable, easy-listening. No Home Record channels the dissonance and avant-garde vibe of New York’s experimental no-wave movement in a nine-song, genre-defiant collection that jumps between industrial, minimal electro-rock and abrasive art punk. Uniting the tracks is their creator’s restlessly questing, non-conformist spirit. It’s great to have her back. (EB)Nilüfer Yanya isn’t down with the “wellness” industry.

(PS)On his debut album, the 24-year-old mixes sultry jams that recall the electronic funk of MGMT with nods to the greats: Prince, James Brown, Led Zeppelin and Marvin Gaye. Throughout, Collard exhibits his extraordinary voice, which swoops to a devilishly low murmur or soars to an ecstatic falsetto. On the lustful “Hell Song” he sings “less is more… but more is good”. You’re inclined to agree with him. (RO)When the Missouri singer broke out in 2014, she became known for her lo-fi, introspective sound and the staggering range and power of her voice. On All Mirrors, she dials things up even further than 2016’s Sixties-leaning My Woman, and turns her focus outwards – it is an album, she says, “about losing empathy, trust, love for destructive people” and “owning up to your darkest side”. It is also balletic and haywire, refusing to follow traditional rules of song structure. Listening to it feels like accidentally pressing play on two songs at once, and finding the combination strangely inebriating. (AP)750 44) Lizzo – Cuz I Love YouThis is a polished, playful album, though it has a DIY edge to it: “S**t, f**k, I didn’t know it was ending right there,” she chuckles in the final few moments of “Like a Girl”. “Girl, run this s**t back,” she says after a vivacious flute solo on “Tempo” – a song featuring a guest verse from Missy Elliott, the person who, Lizzo said on Twitter, “made this chubby, weird, black girl believe that ANYTHING was possible”. (AP)There’s no attempt to chase someone else’s wave here no token drill, afroswing or trap beats to satisfy playlist algorithms. Instead, his cold grime sonics are rendered down to their no-frills essentials – brutalist blocks of sad angular melodies and hard, spacious drums. The result is a quintessentially London record, as dark and moody as it is brash and innovative. “We used to do young and stupid,” Skepta concludes on “Gangsta”. “Now we do grown.” (IM)It lacks a centrepiece to match the arresting depth and space of Sweetener’s “God Is A Woman”, but Grande handles its shifting moods and cast of producers (including pop machines Max Martin and Tommy Brown) with engaging class and momentum. One minute you’re skanking along to the party brass of “Bloodline” the next floating into the semi-detached, heartbreak of “Ghostin’”, which appears to address Grande’s guilt at being with Davidson while pining for Miller. She sings of the late rapper as a “wingless angel” with featherlight high notes that will drop the sternest jaw. (HB)The Chicago-born singer’s ninth album is a furious reaction to the social and political events of 2018 – over 11 breathless tracks, he turns that anger into a howl of resistance. Each song feels personal yet relatable – the deep-rooted despair felt on “Trauma” at the sight of wealthy bullies rising to power is a universal one, as is the sense of liberation in just letting go on “What Can You Do But Rock n Roll”. Twelve Nudes is Furman’s most urgent and cathartic record. (RO)On his studio debut, YBN shows off his versatility, but not to the point that it distracts from the underlying message of each song. You have the menacing “Broke as F***”, where the beats and stark piano hook contrasts with Cordae’s rags-to-riches rap. Aged 21, the North Carolina artist flecks songs such as the Anderson .Paak-featuring “RNP” with an endearing kind of nonchalance over the woozy, psychedelic soul of opener “Wintertime”, meanwhile, he wonders how Corretta Scott King felt upon learning Martin Luther had cheated on her. It’s by no means a perfect album in the grand sense of the term, but it is a perfect demonstration of everything Cordae is capable of. (RO)Big Thief’s frontwoman Adrianne Lenker has an uncanny ability to make you feel like you’re in on a secret. Her whispering, spectral delivery and deeply personal lyrics are the key to this. Even on the band’s third album UFOF, with an audience that has grown exponentially in the past few years, the songs are still immensely intimate affairs. The album’s deathly intrigue is drawn from her own personal traumas, which she successfully spins into something that feels universal. But you don’t come away from this record feeling downcast. It’s more a reminder of how fleeting yet beautiful life is, and an appeal to make the most of it. (RO)1350 38) Jenny Lewis – On the LineHere, Lewis does what she does best: adds the glossy sparkle of Hollywood and a sunny Californian sheen to melancholy and nostalgia, with her most luxuriantly orchestrated album yet. Even when she’s singing, “I’ve wasted my youth”, it’s in that sweet voice, with carefree “doo doo doo doo doo doos”, and at a pace that’s so upbeat that it masks the sentiment. It’s a bittersweet mourning of her past. (EB)Few people have had as big a year as Billie Eilish. The first – and currently only – artist born in the Noughties to have a US number one single, she also released her double platinum debut album, the innovative and multifarious, if irksomely titled, When We All Fall Asleep Where Do We Go? There are some missteps –  “Wish You Were Gay” being one of them – but for the most part this is an album as full of charm and bite as Eilish herself. And with a melody that ducks and es in between the beat like a bank robber dodging lasers, the dark, dank pop-trap masterpiece “Bad Guy” is surely a contender for song of the year. (AP)One of the biggest new rap stars to emerge in 2019, AJ Tracey’s variety and the scale of his ambition on this album is breathtaking. Fans will be surprised to discover he sings almost as much as he raps, in pleasingly gruff tones. Each track is a standout, none more so than “Ladbroke Grove”, a hat-tip to classic garage in which Tracey switches up his flow to emulate a Nineties MC. It’s a thrilling work. (RO)The former Chairlift frontwoman’s solo debut (at least, her first under her own name) is an eccentric, experimental delight – PC music by way of classical pop. The product of a orce and a series of adrenal rushes she refers to as “pangs”, the album is musically agile and often lyrically stark: Sometimes I wonder Do I love you too much? Then I tell myself ‘Caroline, shut up’”, she sings on “Caroline Shut Up”. Polachek’s voice is her secret weapon – so jolting and elastic she had to prove it wasn’t autotuned in an astonishing Twitter video. (AP)Simpson recently said he wanted Sound \u0026amp Fury to “hit like a Wu-Tang record”, so each intro is like a one-two punch loaded with brilliant hooks. Then there’s the rollicking “A Good Look” and “Last Man Standing” – it’s pure rock and roll: sleazy, slick and lots of fun. Sound \u0026amp Fury marks another milestone for a remarkable artist. (RO)Of all the excellent bands to emerge out of Dublin’s booming music scene over the past few years, Fontaines DC are the best of them. Perhaps it’s the fact that they’re technically outsiders, having grown up on the borders of the city (or in their guitarist Carlos O’Connell’s case, between there and Spain). Frontman Grian Chatten eschews punk’s tradition of valuing shock value over songcraft and instead offers searing, literary observations of a city with which he has a lovehate relationship. (RO)1950 32) Vampire Weekend – Father of the BrideAlready subject to manic shifts in style and tempo, this hour-long LP roams in lounge pants from Deadhead jams to Zombies-catchy hooks, infectiously kitsch prog, highlife samples and – on “Sunflower” – a scat breakdown. An unfashionable record, then, and that may be its best asset. With such low stakes and barely any emotional intensity, Father of the Bride won’t cement Vampire Weekend’s legacy. But after a highly strung decade on the indie-rock A-list, it gives them room to breathe. (JM)“Making this album has allowed me, for the first time, to find compassion when I have been at my most ungraceful, confused and fractured,” FKA twigs writes in the album’s press notes. “I stopped judging myself, and at that moment found hope in MAGDALENE.” At times, MAGDALENE is just as ungraceful, confused and fractured as its creator was – a rush of baroque electronics, industrial noise, opera, synths, autotune and precarious falsetto. The follow-up to 2014’s LP1 is the sound of a woman teetering on the brink of collapse, gathering herself, and then erupting into a kind of defiance. (AP)2150 30) Bill Callahan – Shepherd in a Sheepskin VestBill Callahan returns after six years with this homely, career-best album in which he sings of his own contentment. “The panic room is now a nursery,” he observes on “Son of the Sea”. Death still looms – often in the form of a black dog that follows Callahan around various tracks – but its inevitability seems more of a comfort than something to be feared: “Everybody must walk the lonesome valley,” he sings firmly. “Yeah, they must walk it by themselves.” (RO)Arriving three years after the release of her debut, Nothing’s Real, Shura’s excellent second record is camp and theatrical, pivoting between a big, poppy sensibility and a minimalist, lo-fi one – sometimes on the same track. Lead single “Religion (U Can Lay Your Hands On Me)” is a slinky shoulder roll of a song, laden with passionate blasphemy: “I wanna consecrate your body, turn the water to wine, I know you’re thinking about kissing, too.” It’s laced, too, with piano – an instrument she’d always been “allergic to” before this record – and opulent orchestral strings. (AP)2350 28) Cage the Elephant – Social CuesOn Cage the Elephant’s fifth album, Social Cues, frontman Matt Shultz reacts to the breakdown of his marriage and the loss of three close friends. He undergoes a kind of Jekyll and Hyde transition through the 13 tracks, the result of which is the band’s best work to date. Single “Ready to let Go” is by far the most explicit – a moody swamp-rock jam where Shultz comes to terms with his impending orce. He bares his soul on Social Cues, and apparently shakes off a few demons in the process. (RO)Howard listened to Brazilian artist Jorge Ben – “where there’s literally, like, 18 different things happening in the song” – while she was making the album, and it shows. “13th Century Metal” builds like an alarm, while “Baby” is scatty and scattered, like something off The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill. Sometimes, there is one instrument too many, but usually the components crash together well. (AP)Written during her recent pregnancy and the birth of her first child, Remind Me Tomorrow shows Van Etten dimming her spotlight on toxicity and instead casting a warm glow behind the record’s psychic overview. As well as expectations of confessional singers, she subverts folk music’s focus on bare-bones songwriting. But the daintiest composition “Stay” is her most perfectly realised yet, over music box chimes and heel-clicking percussion she coos: “You won’t let me go astray You will let me find my way.” After years of making peace with drift and uncertainty, she’s never sounded more sure of anything. (JM)Inspired by the improvisations he was creating while on tour with The xx in 2017, Sam Shepherd found himself making “some of the most obtuse and aggressive music I’ve ever made”. This newfound drive can be heard in singles such as “LesAlpx”, a mind-melting track that climbs breathlessly towards its summit with a pounding bass beat and high, whistling chirps that punctuate the tension. It’s an insight into his brilliant mind and – such is the sheer variety of the album – a way to inspire one’s own imagination. (RO)2750 24) Stormzy – Heavy is the HeadThere are three themes that run through the record: his defiance in the face of doubt the pressure of high expectations and his efforts to lift others up as his success continues to grow. He reminds himself constantly of who he is beneath the gloss that fame has brought: he’s “Rachael’s Little Brother”, “Big Michael”, a guy who likes to watch Avengers and Game of Thrones. All of his best traits are present and correct: sincerity, a smooth flow and forensic-like analysis of societal ills, laced with pathos and humour. The lasting impression is of an artist whose only way is up. (RO)A blunt, bold album on which Hackman’s beatific voice sits atop methodically messy instrumentals. Songs such as “All Night” are so candidly carnal it feels inappropriate to listen to them in public notes of riot grrrl, pop and rock come together throughout the record to create something that is, at times, quite striking. (AP)2950 22) Solange – When I Get HomeThe decade’s second great Solange album churns several deformed, jazzy aesthetics – including Brainfeeder’s gloopy electro-funk and the concoctions of DJ Screw – into a lustrous cloud of R\u0026ampB. The result hints at Seventies soul voyagers like Stevie Wonder yet retains its future-shock, celebrating Houston futurism without pandering to fans of its explicitly political predecessor. (JM)For her fifth studio album, Cate Le Bon went to live in a secluded cottage in the Lake District, where she sang to an empty house and took lessons in wood-carving. Yet her compositions on Reward are lush, warm and whimsical opener “Miami” is resplendent with stately horns and percussion that reminds you of childhood. There’s a fantastic sense of space, too, spun from diaphanous arrangements such as “The Light”, where she meanders delightfully from a clear, lilting call to a deep vocal rumble. It’s an album by an artist intent on readdressing her relationship with her own existence. (RO)Fender drew plenty of early comparisons to Bruce Springsteen – on Hypersonic Missiles they’re entirely warranted, as much for the instrumentation as the lyricism and his vignettes of working-class struggle. There are sax solos (more than one), and pounding rhythms that make you want to jump in a car and drive down a highway at sunset, and blistering electric guitars next to classic troubadour acoustics. He has Springsteen’s rousing holler, and the early indications of someone who could be the voice of a generation – not because he wants to be, but because he sees things and understands. (RO)Swift’s sixth album Reputation was camp and melodramatic, killing off “the old Taylor” and waging war on anyone and everyone who dared to criticise her. It was sincerity veiled as self-parody, insecurity veiled as breeziness – and all the better for that uneasy paradox. But Lover, her new, seventh album, feels like a partial resurrection of the Swift of old: moony romance and earnest earworms abound. It’s the sound of a singer excited to be earnest again. Taylor Swift is dead. Long live Taylor Swift. (AP)The record is an introspective mix of psychey soul, blues, rock and funk, which skips and strolls and swaggers through its 13 tracks – but it is not simply an exercise in nostalgia. Its influences  decades Gil Scott-Heron, Fela Kuti, Kendrick Lamar and Bobby Womack are all recalled. “I’m not going to have an alter ego, or becomes Sasha Fierce or Ziggy Stardust,” says Kiwanuka. “I can just be Michael Kiwanuka.” With an album this good, it’s hard to argue with that. (AP)On his sixth album, Kano’s powers of observation are at their peak. Home has always been at the heart of his music, so he maintains the close-quarters perspective of his 2005 debut Home Sweet Home the swaggering confidence of that record, though, is replaced by a more thoughtful gravitas. He’s an elder statesman of grime, and you can almost see his furrowed brow and shake of his head on “Trouble”, while the frenetic “Class of Deja”, starring fellow veterans D Double E and Ghetts, reminds the listener how he lit the path for future generations. (RO)3550 16) Hot Chip – A Bath Full of EcstasyLyrically, the band offer up some of their most poignant phrases to date on this – their seventh and best record. Second single “Hungry Child”, a trance-y floor-filler, contains the plaintive, “Dreaming never felt so bad Lonely never felt so wrong before” while, over the shuffling beats of “Echo”, Alexis Taylor sings of leaving your regrets behind while seeming to understand the effort required to achieve this. For all its glimmering synths and the robotic pathos of Taylor’s idiosyncratic vocals, this is a record with both heart and soul. (RO)3650 15) MUNA – Saves the WorldSaves the World should see MUNA joining the ranks of those who have brazenly borrowed their sound. Lead single “Number One Fan” banishes intrusive thoughts – “Nobody likes me and I’m gonna die” – just in time for a lavish, self-celebratory chorus, one part earnest, one part tongue-in-cheek. Elsewhere, they are downright defeatist, laments the inevitable pull back to a recent ex (“Stayaway”) or reflecting on a lover’s similarity to an adulterous father (“Taken”). “Hands Off”, meanwhile, toys with temptation before slamming the door shut. It is fierce and forthright. (AP)Fans have already drawn comparisons between We Are Not Your Kind and Slipknot’s seminal 2001 album Iowa. While the latter was even heavier (it would be difficult if not impossible to outdo), the sheer ambition on We Are Not Your Kind is just as staggering. If anything, the dynamic created by placing a bigger emphasis on melody allows you to consider everything without being engulfed by noise. Critics may question how relevant Slipknot are in 2019. The pummelling force of We Are Not Your Kind should be enough to silence them – this may be one of the band’s most personal records, but the rage they capture is universally felt. (RO)Each song is titled after a black woman Rapsody admires: Serena Williams, Sojourner Truth, Maya Angelou, Aaliyah, Oprah Winfrey… and for each one she explores these women’s traits, successes and strife. As on Laila’s Wisdom, Eve conveys Rapsody’s natural feel for funk – “Michelle” (Obama) bounces in on a jaunty piano riff – but other tracks, such as “Afeni”, are pure soul. Nina Simone said an artist’s duty, “as far as I’m concerned, is to reflect the times”. This is precisely what Rapsody has done, in the most resonant way possible. (RO)There’s a deeper sense of personal connection to anchor Julia Jacklin’s lyrical and melodic smarts. That snare drum on “Pressure to Party” keeps a relentless, nerve-snapping pulse throughout, while “Don’t Know How to Keep Loving You” nails a depth of intimacy while acknowledging relationship ennui. Grunge-rinsed, feminist-flipped, upcycled Fifties guitar an’ all: Crushing is a triumph. (HB)Philippakis’s voice is shrouded in the smoke from society’s wreckage. Lead single “Exits”, six scintillating minutes of Eighties “sledgehammer” pop that lumbers into view like a heavy artillery vehicle covered in sequins, concerns the one percenters building underground cities to escape global warming. “Syrups” has Yannis howling a passionate post-apocalyptic vision of robot invasions and sand-clogged towns over a corroded Gorillaz dub that builds to a motoric charge as global panic sets in. An inspired album of scorched earth music. (MB)A talented pianist as well as a rapper and singer, Dave often spits over discordant chords to amplify the urgency of his chosen subject, or else raps in gruff, assertive tones across an emotional sequence that complements his stoic intensity. On “Environment”, he talks about the conflict between what people see of his apparently glamorous life, and the reality behind the scenes where the blood and sweat is drawn out of him. He’s put everything into this album. (RO)Weyes Blood, whose real name is Natalie Mering, accompanies her instrumental idiosyncrasies with strong, luscious melodies and unfussy lyrics. “No one’s ever gonna give you a trophy for all the pain and the things you’ve been through,” she sings on “Mirror Forever”. “No one knows but you.”And then there’s that voice – at once warm and haunting, controlled and untethered. It’s no wonder she’s lent it to the likes of Perfume Genius, Drugdealer and Ariel Pink: it adds a touch of profundity to everything it meets. (AP)The warm splashes of piano that washed over that song also break through the anxious rattle of dance beats on the album’s eponymous opener, the singer so regularly reviewed as “vaporous” promises to “leave the ether, assume form” and “be touchable, be reachable”. His own sharpest critic, he winks at the journalists who’ve called him glacial as he drops from remote, icy falsetto into a richly grained, deeper tone to ask: “Doesn’t it seem much warmer?” (HB)Following the traumatised chaos of 2016’s Skeleton Tree, Ghosteen is a warm cloud of ambient solace – a sonic evocation of the communion he has experienced through his newly porous relationship with his audience. He sounds buoyed, not weakened, by exposing his wounds. (HB)4550 6) Tyler, the Creator – IGORThe production here is superb. Tyler has never been one for traditional song structure, but on IGOR, which is undoubtedly a break-up album, he’s like the Minotaur – luring you through a maze that twists and turns around seemingly impossible corners, drawing you into the thrilling unknown. Its lack of resolution at the close – surely the most torturous element of a great love lost – makes it all the more powerful. (RO)The indie-rock band’s second album in the space of five months (the first being UFOF), was described as the “earth twin” and, indeed, they sound utterly grounded – to each other, and to their surroundings in the arid Chihuahuan Desert of Texas, near the Mexico border. In contrast to her fragile performance on UFOF, here Adrianne Lenker sings in lusty whoops and calls on “Forgotten Eyes”, while “Not”, the record’s dark, brooding soul, caterwauls with feedback screeches and a merciless, two-minute guitar solo that leaves you simultaneously devastated and enthralled. (RO)Bruce Springsteen seems to have told almost every tale in the grand old storybook of American mythologies, except perhaps one: a wide-eyed Californian dreamer finds the Golden State turns sour and flees back east, to some romantic speck of a town, to pine and rehabilitate. It’s the classic pop plotline of Bacharach and David’s “Do You Know the Way to San Jose?”, and it’s a tale Springsteen taps repeatedly here, on his sumptuous, cinematic 19th album, which is nothing short of a late-period masterpiece. (MB)Few albums in 2019 have been as eclectic, or with as singular a vision, as Simz’s GREY Area. She flips between two tones: formidable and reflective. On tracks such as “Offence” and “Boss” she drips with venom delivering lines in a low, deadly buzz over killer bass hooks and punk distortion. On “Selfish” and “Flowers” she’s softer – allowing herself to be vulnerable because she knows she doesn’t have to ditch all sentiment to compete with her male peers. She’s better because she embraces every facet of herself, and offers it to the listener in as clear a statement as possible. (RO)Lana Del Rey has always been obsessed with the past. Hers is a sound rooted in nostalgia, a paean to everything she was born too late to live through: old Hollywood, Sinatra, beat poetry, Sylvia Plath and Fifties Americana. At her best, she mines something fresh from it all. At her worst, she wallows in it. Her new album Norman F**king Rockwell!, named after a 20th-century American artist, does both. (AP)When Aldous Harding performed in London this month, an enamoured fan cried out that they loved her. “I appreciate that,” she replied softly. “But, I’m busy.” The response is Harding to a T – wry, weird, introspective, focused. Her spectacular, singular third album, Designer, is all of those things. Taking the left-field folk that made her name and splashing post-psych pop and jittery orchestral flourishes onto the canvas, the New Zealander harbours secrets while beckoning you in.

Flybe said it cancelled 994 flights in the three months to 31 March, compared to 372 in the same period last year.On Thursday, the Bank of England kept interest rates on hold after signals of a pick-up. The minutes of its meeting showed that it expects the UK House Price Index to have risen quite strongly in both the final quarter of 2019 and the first quarter of this year.Howard Archer, chief economic advisor to the EY Item Club, said the figures were another sign that the UK housing market has “at least temporarily stepped up a gear”.“Mortgage approvals in December were\u0026nbsphighly likely\u0026nbspsignificantly lifted by increased confidence and reduced uncertainties among housing market participants following the decisive general election result,” he said.Why the calm over interest rates might not lastFigures from the bank on Friday also showed growth in consumer credit, rising\u0026nbspby £1.2bn, while credit card borrowing increased\u0026nbspby the most since February, up by £412m.Household spending has helped to drive Britain’s economy over the past few years, helped by record levels of employment and a recovery in wage growth,\u0026nbspbut there were signs of a slowdown in spending in late 2019.The bank’s data also showed that December saw the biggest increase on record in net purchases of British government bonds by foreign investors –\u0026nbspan increase of £28.6bn. The records date back to 1982.Meanwhile, it emerged that the bank will be repaid €58m (£49m) by the European Central Bank after the UK leaves the European Union. Brexit will mean that the Bank of England pulls out of the European System of Central Banks.The bank holds 14.3 per cent of the European Central Bank’s subscribed capital, of which 3.75 per cent –\u0026nbspequivalent to €58m\u0026nbsp–\u0026nbspis paid up. The capital will be reallocated between the other EU central banks.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It would most likely be the new USB-C standard or something like it, meaning that Apple would have to change the port used in their iPhones.Apple hits out at EU proposal to force phones to have same chargerEuropean politicians passed the motion by\u0026nbsp582 votes to 10. While it does not introduce any new rules, it calls on the European Commission to examine new legislation, and the Commission has already suggested that it could introduce new rules forcing companies to adopt a single charger.It also suggests that companies should work to ensure they all use the same wireless charging standard. That largely happens already, with most phone companies using the Qi standard.If such a change were to happen, people would no longer need to get a new charger each time they buy a new device, the motion noted.Ten years ago, the European Parliament signed an agreement with technology companies in which they would voluntarily work to reduce the numbers of chargers across different devices. Politicians say that agreement has failed, though some including Apple have argued that those ten years have seen a vast reduction in the number of ports, with just two – Lightning and USB-C – used on almost all new devices.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Show all 25Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.125 25. I Am MotherRickety-looking science fiction thriller I Am Mother delivers where it counts with a twisting, turning plot and several genuine surprises. In the far future, a maternal robot (voiced by Rose Byrne) raises a young woman (Clara Rugaard) as her daughter. But when an outsider (Hilary Swank) makes her way to their bunker their perfect life is shattered forever.In Private Life, a bohemian middle-aged couple struggle to have a child. Kathryn Hahn and Paul Giamatti are hilarious and poignant. And the pathos is piled on as twenty-something college drop-out Sadie (Kayli Carter) parachutes into their life. High-jinks follow, though director Tamara Jenkins ensures the existential sadness that has become part of the protagonists daily life never quite fades. Steven Soderbergh has become something of a Netflix regular, with his Meryl Streep-starring The Laundromat recently premiering on the service. His earlier movie High Flying Bird is about a basketball agent (André Holland) in a game of skulduggery between players (mostly black and uneducated) and team owners (white and wealthy). It’s a great sports film and also a commentary on the racial and social schisms that ide America. 425 22. I Don\u0027t Feel at Home in this World AnymoreA quirky though ultimately quite dark indie movie about two misfits, Ruth (Melanie Lynskey) and Tony (Elijah Wood), on the trail off a burglar who made off with a silver spoon belonging to Ruth’s grandmother. Whimsical on the surface, I Don’t Feel at Home in this World Anymore is in fact a meditation on what happens when you’ve had enough of life’s fundamental unfairness and lash out. Team-up heist movie Triple Frontier stars Ben Affleck, Oscar Isaac, Charlie Hunnum and Pedro Pascal as old marine corps buddies headed to South America for one final pay-day. It’s hugely flawed – but Affleck is convincing as a guy losing his way amidst orce and middle age. And JC Chandor (Collateral) directs the action scenes with pizzaz. It comes close to being a great action flick for grown-ups before ultimately fizzling out. 625 20. A Futile and Stupid GestureStraight-to-video production values don’t do it any favours, but A Futile and Stupid Gesture – a biopic about the founder of American satirical magazine National Lampoon, Douglas Kenney (Will Forte) – has its heart in the right place. It’s a by turns poignant and hilarious accent of Forte’s rise, his descent into drugs and infidelity – and his strained relationship with Lampoon co-founder Henry Beard (an unrecognisable Domhnall Gleeson). Critics trounced this stylised horror starring Jake Gyllenhaal are a vainglorious art critic. Certainly, as commentary on the vacuousness of the art world it’s a whole lot of stating the obvious. Yet enjoyed as a Argento-esque OTT romp, Velvet Buzzsaw is a delight, as director Dan Gilroy subjects his victims to a series of ever more absurdist and grisly ends. El Camino would be higher on the list were it not for the fact it really isn’t a film. Best thought of as a two-hour Breaking Bad episode, it takes up the story of Jesse Pinkman after he’s fled the dying Walter White and driven into the blue yonder. The milieu is the familiar New Mexico underworld of Breaking Bad and its gentler prequel, Better Call Saul. BB fans will nonetheless relish a return, however brief, to the Vince Gilligan expanded universe. Plus all – yes ALL – your faves from the Ballad of Walter White are back for cameos. With his Doctor Sleep adaptation forthcoming, Mike Flanagan has established himself as the latter-day top dog off Stephen King retellings. He gave us a taste of what he was capable of via his gruelling adaptation of 1992 King novel Gerald\u0027s Game, which is about a woman (Carla Gugino) who ends up bound to a bed when her husband dies during a sex game. Don’t try this at a home – or anyone else for that matter – kids. Former Daily Show correspondent Jessica Williams is a revelation in The Incredible Jessica James, which follows a romantically adrift young playwright who tries to come to terms with a break up by projecting blinding over-confidence. She strikes up an unlikely chemistry with Chris O’Dowd’s awkward everyman – with results that achieve a rarefied mix of funny and sweet. Sandra Bullock in a blindfold whispering to two terrified children might not sound like the stuff of blockbuster gold. Sci-fi horror Bird Box is certainly flawed. It also had the ill fortune to come out six months after the thematically adjacent A Quiet Place. Nonetheless, there’s an undeniable pulpy thrill to this tale of aliens that drive you mad on sight (hence the blind-folds). Keep an eye out, too, for a fantastic cameo from Tom Hollander. Ali Wong and Randall Park play former childhood sweethearts from San Fransisco whose lives take very different paths after they consummate their friendship. She becomes a celebrity chef engaged to a dead-eyed property developer he’s a home town schlub still living with his dad. Screwball antics ensue as their paths cross again. So far, so cliche. But there are enough surprises – and one hilarious cameo – to prevent Always Be My Maybe feeling hopelessly formulaic. Netflix has become an unexpected champion of the humble romcom and To All The Boys I’ve Loved Before was the movie that established its reputation in the genre. Lana Condor plays a shy high-school student who writes pretend letters to her crushes. But when the missives are stolen and made public, she feels obliged to enter a fake relationship in order to preserve her dignity. All your favourite romcom tropes are ticked off – but with a knowingness that falls satisfyingly short of cynical.1425 12. The Fundamentals of CaringPaul Rudd takes a break from Ant-Man to play the carer of teenager Trevor (Craig Roberts), who has muscular dystrophy, in The Fundamentals of Caring. A heart-warming road movie ensues as they somehow end up crossing America in the company of flinty hitchhiker Dot (Selena Gomez). Rudd’s likability is dialled all the way up in a feel-good weepie sure to shred the heartstrings1525 11. Mowgli: Legend of the Jungle King of motion capture Andy Serkis ropes in some famous pals – Christian Bale, Cate Blanchett. Benedict Cumberbatch etc – for a fang-baring tilt at Rudyard Kipling. Shunted back because of Disney’s own “live action” Jungle Book remake, Mowgli: Legend of the Jungle is far grittier – a children’s movie with enough tooth and claw not to feel like a fairytale. Eddie Murphy puts in one of his best performances in years in Dolemite Is My Name, a biopic about Blaxploitation comedian Rudy Ray Moore, whose potty-mouthed albums and movies in the mid Seventies were credited with helping invent hip hop. Moore’s “Dolemite” character was based on old black homeless man he encountered in San Fransisco and caused both a sensation and a scandal at the time. Murphy brings this complex figure to life with an alternately hilarious and affecting turn. Lovecraftian weirdness by the bucketful from director Alex Garland. Natalie Portman heads a team of researchers venturing into a quarantined swampland where the laws of nature have been rebuilt from the cellular level up. Annihilation is mind-bending body horror, with echoes of Kubrick’s 2001: A Space Odyssey.1825 8. Beasts of No NationCary Joji Fukunaga will shortly make his Bond debut with No Time To Die. But he was better known for directing original season of True Detective when his adaptation of Uzodinma Iweala’s Ghanian civil war novel Beasts of No Nation was acquired by Netflix. It’s a nightmarish tale of child soldiers dehumanised by conflict, with Idris Elba chilling as the adult commander of the boy combatants. Netflix has been churning out serviceable horror movies for several years now. Apostle, a Wicker Man updating by Raid director Gareth Evans, features the standard feral yokels, to which he brings his own innovation via oceans of gore. Dan Stevens is a naive outsider who, in 1905, travels to a remote Welsh island hoping to locate his vanished sister. He discovers a cult headed by Michael Sheen’s crazed preacherman, a whole lot of trouble and something terrible hiding in the dark.With Bong Joon-ho’s Parasite winning the Palme d\u0027Or, what better moment to revisit his brilliantly weird and charming morality fable from 2017. Co-written with John Ronson, Okja is a by turns heart-warming and chilling story of a young girl (Ahn Seo-hyun) and her friendship with the titular bio-engineered super-pig. It sounds, and frequently is, bonkers but Joon-ho plays with our heartstrings as if manipulating a Straarius, while Cate Blanchett is outstanding as an evil tech messiah masquerading as an environmentalist. 2125 5. The Meyerowitz Stories (New and Selected)Adam Sandler, Ben Stiller, Dustin Hoffman, and Emma Thompson head the cast in Noah Baumbach’s comedy drama The Meyerowitz Stories about worldly Manhattanites struggling with their lives of sophisticated privilege. Baumbach is on solid ground marshalling the inter-familial tension. But he also reminds us why he’s a master at locating universal truths within the self-involved lives of neurotic Americans. Mudbound is an unflinching survey of race and politics in the Southern United States immediately before and after the Second World War. Carey Mulligan and Mary J Blige head the cast, while Dee Rees guides the story with tremendous tautness. Mudbound was expected to receive a clean sweep of Oscar nominations in 2017. In the end it received just four, in relatively minor categories. The first rumblings of Hollywood’s hostility towards streaming and its impact on cinema? 2325 3. The Other Side of the WindFor a reminder how unhinged film-making became in the Seventies, buckle up and lose yourself in this posthumous restoration of never-completed Orson Welles movie, The Other Side of the Wind. What would have been Welles’s swansong is a maniacal, meta meditation on art and fame, with John Huston playing a buccaneering director – in essence, a heightened composite of himself and Welles. There are also parts for Peter Bogdanovich and Dennis Hopper. Welles’s editor, Bob Murawski, together with Bogdanovich and Welles’s daughter Beatrice, assembled the cut from 100 hours of footage. It only occasionally makes sense – but, as an experience, it\u0027s unforgettable. 2425 2. The Ballad of Buster ScruggsWhen Netflix asked the Coen brothers to make a binge-friendly TV series, Hollywood’s quirkiest siblings obviously went their own way. This anthology movie, titled The Ballad of Buster Scruggs, features six stories set amid the Coens’ deeply quirky and revisionist take on the Old West. The spirit of their classic O Brother, Where Art Thou? is tapped enthusiastically, with Liam Neeson, Zoe Kazan, Tim Blake Nelson, James Franco and Tom Waits heading the starry cast. The privileged Mexico City childhood of director Alfonso Cuarón inspired his affecting, quasi-autobiographical treatise on class, privilege and love. Yalitza Aparicio is the semi-invisible maid to a wealthy family, her life a story of small moments unfolding against the backdrop of political upheaval. Netflix was denied its Best Picture Oscar for Roma, but Cuarón was an uncontroversial pick for Best Director at the 2018 awards.  125 25. I Am MotherRickety-looking science fiction thriller I Am Mother delivers where it counts with a twisting, turning plot and several genuine surprises. In the far future, a maternal robot (voiced by Rose Byrne) raises a young woman (Clara Rugaard) as her daughter.

He gave us a taste of what he was capable of via his gruelling adaptation of 1992 King novel Gerald\u0027s Game, which is about a woman (Carla Gugino) who ends up bound to a bed when her husband dies during a sex game. Don’t try this at a home – or anyone else for that matter – kids. Former Daily Show correspondent Jessica Williams is a revelation in The Incredible Jessica James, which follows a romantically adrift young playwright who tries to come to terms with a break up by projecting blinding over-confidence. She strikes up an unlikely chemistry with Chris O’Dowd’s awkward everyman – with results that achieve a rarefied mix of funny and sweet. Sandra Bullock in a blindfold whispering to two terrified children might not sound like the stuff of blockbuster gold. Sci-fi horror Bird Box is certainly flawed. It also had the ill fortune to come out six months after the thematically adjacent A Quiet Place. Nonetheless, there’s an undeniable pulpy thrill to this tale of aliens that drive you mad on sight (hence the blind-folds). Keep an eye out, too, for a fantastic cameo from Tom Hollander. Ali Wong and Randall Park play former childhood sweethearts from San Fransisco whose lives take very different paths after they consummate their friendship. She becomes a celebrity chef engaged to a dead-eyed property developer he’s a home town schlub still living with his dad. Screwball antics ensue as their paths cross again. So far, so cliche. But there are enough surprises – and one hilarious cameo – to prevent Always Be My Maybe feeling hopelessly formulaic. Netflix has become an unexpected champion of the humble romcom and To All The Boys I’ve Loved Before was the movie that established its reputation in the genre. Lana Condor plays a shy high-school student who writes pretend letters to her crushes. But when the missives are stolen and made public, she feels obliged to enter a fake relationship in order to preserve her dignity. All your favourite romcom tropes are ticked off – but with a knowingness that falls satisfyingly short of cynical.1425 12. The Fundamentals of CaringPaul Rudd takes a break from Ant-Man to play the carer of teenager Trevor (Craig Roberts), who has muscular dystrophy, in The Fundamentals of Caring. A heart-warming road movie ensues as they somehow end up crossing America in the company of flinty hitchhiker Dot (Selena Gomez). Rudd’s likability is dialled all the way up in a feel-good weepie sure to shred the heartstrings1525 11. Mowgli: Legend of the Jungle King of motion capture Andy Serkis ropes in some famous pals – Christian Bale, Cate Blanchett. Benedict Cumberbatch etc – for a fang-baring tilt at Rudyard Kipling. Shunted back because of Disney’s own “live action” Jungle Book remake, Mowgli: Legend of the Jungle is far grittier – a children’s movie with enough tooth and claw not to feel like a fairytale. Eddie Murphy puts in one of his best performances in years in Dolemite Is My Name, a biopic about Blaxploitation comedian Rudy Ray Moore, whose potty-mouthed albums and movies in the mid Seventies were credited with helping invent hip hop. Moore’s “Dolemite” character was based on old black homeless man he encountered in San Fransisco and caused both a sensation and a scandal at the time. Murphy brings this complex figure to life with an alternately hilarious and affecting turn. Lovecraftian weirdness by the bucketful from director Alex Garland. Natalie Portman heads a team of researchers venturing into a quarantined swampland where the laws of nature have been rebuilt from the cellular level up. Annihilation is mind-bending body horror, with echoes of Kubrick’s 2001: A Space Odyssey.1825 8. Beasts of No NationCary Joji Fukunaga will shortly make his Bond debut with No Time To Die. But he was better known for directing original season of True Detective when his adaptation of Uzodinma Iweala’s Ghanian civil war novel Beasts of No Nation was acquired by Netflix. It’s a nightmarish tale of child soldiers dehumanised by conflict, with Idris Elba chilling as the adult commander of the boy combatants. Netflix has been churning out serviceable horror movies for several years now. Apostle, a Wicker Man updating by Raid director Gareth Evans, features the standard feral yokels, to which he brings his own innovation via oceans of gore. Dan Stevens is a naive outsider who, in 1905, travels to a remote Welsh island hoping to locate his vanished sister. He discovers a cult headed by Michael Sheen’s crazed preacherman, a whole lot of trouble and something terrible hiding in the dark.With Bong Joon-ho’s Parasite winning the Palme d\u0027Or, what better moment to revisit his brilliantly weird and charming morality fable from 2017. Co-written with John Ronson, Okja is a by turns heart-warming and chilling story of a young girl (Ahn Seo-hyun) and her friendship with the titular bio-engineered super-pig. It sounds, and frequently is, bonkers but Joon-ho plays with our heartstrings as if manipulating a Straarius, while Cate Blanchett is outstanding as an evil tech messiah masquerading as an environmentalist. 2125 5. The Meyerowitz Stories (New and Selected)Adam Sandler, Ben Stiller, Dustin Hoffman, and Emma Thompson head the cast in Noah Baumbach’s comedy drama The Meyerowitz Stories about worldly Manhattanites struggling with their lives of sophisticated privilege. Baumbach is on solid ground marshalling the inter-familial tension. But he also reminds us why he’s a master at locating universal truths within the self-involved lives of neurotic Americans. Mudbound is an unflinching survey of race and politics in the Southern United States immediately before and after the Second World War. Carey Mulligan and Mary J Blige head the cast, while Dee Rees guides the story with tremendous tautness. Mudbound was expected to receive a clean sweep of Oscar nominations in 2017. In the end it received just four, in relatively minor categories. The first rumblings of Hollywood’s hostility towards streaming and its impact on cinema? 2325 3. The Other Side of the WindFor a reminder how unhinged film-making became in the Seventies, buckle up and lose yourself in this posthumous restoration of never-completed Orson Welles movie, The Other Side of the Wind. What would have been Welles’s swansong is a maniacal, meta meditation on art and fame, with John Huston playing a buccaneering director – in essence, a heightened composite of himself and Welles. There are also parts for Peter Bogdanovich and Dennis Hopper. Welles’s editor, Bob Murawski, together with Bogdanovich and Welles’s daughter Beatrice, assembled the cut from 100 hours of footage. It only occasionally makes sense – but, as an experience, it\u0027s unforgettable. 2425 2. The Ballad of Buster ScruggsWhen Netflix asked the Coen brothers to make a binge-friendly TV series, Hollywood’s quirkiest siblings obviously went their own way. This anthology movie, titled The Ballad of Buster Scruggs, features six stories set amid the Coens’ deeply quirky and revisionist take on the Old West. The spirit of their classic O Brother, Where Art Thou? is tapped enthusiastically, with Liam Neeson, Zoe Kazan, Tim Blake Nelson, James Franco and Tom Waits heading the starry cast. The privileged Mexico City childhood of director Alfonso Cuarón inspired his affecting, quasi-autobiographical treatise on class, privilege and love. Yalitza Aparicio is the semi-invisible maid to a wealthy family, her life a story of small moments unfolding against the backdrop of political upheaval. Netflix was denied its Best Picture Oscar for Roma, but Cuarón was an uncontroversial pick for Best Director at the 2018 awards.  Road to RomaTo All the Boys: PS I Still Love YouAll the Bright PlacesCagaster of an Insect CageCreated with Sketch.The 40 best TV shows on Netflix UK Show all 40Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A cartoon about a talking horse, starring the goofy older brother from Arrested Development… on paper little about BoJack Horseman screams “must watch”. Yet the series almost immediately transcended its format to deliver a moving and very funny rumination on depression and middle-age malaise. Will Arnett plays BoJack – one time star of Nineties hit sitcom Horsin’ Around – as a lost soul whose turbo-charged narcissism prevents him getting his life together. A valentine to the Spielberg school of Eighties blockbuster, with Winona Ryder as a small town mom whose son is abducted by a transdimensional monster. ET, Goonies, Close Encounters, Alien and everything Stephen King wrote between 1975 and 1990 are all tossed into the blender by Millennial writer-creators the Duffer brothers. It was clear Stranger Things was going to be a mega-smash when Barb – the “best friend” character eaten in the second episode – went viral the weekend it dropped. Netflix’s Marvel shows tend towards the overlong and turgid. An exception is the high-kicking Daredevil, with Charlie Cox’s blind lawyercrimefighter banishing all memory of Ben Affleck\u0027s turn donning the red jumpsuit in 2003. With New York’s Hell’s Kitchen neighbourhood as backdrop, Daredevil is caked in street-level grit and features a searing series one performance by Vincent D\u0027Onofrio as the villainous Kingpin. The perfect antidote to the deafening bombast of the big screen Marvel movies. Did he do it? Does it matter considering the lengths the Durham, North Carolina police seemingly went in order to stitch him up? Sitting through this twisting, turning documenting about the trial of Michael Peterson – charged with the murder in 2003 of his wife – the viewer may find themselves alternately empathising with and recoiling from the accused. It’s a feat of bravura factual filmmaking from French documentarian Jean-Xavier de Lestrade, which comes to Netflix with a recently shot three-part coda catching up with the (very weird) Peterson clan a decade on. Stranger Things: the Euro-Gloom years. Netflix’s first German-language production is a pulp romp that thinks it’s a Wagner opera. In a remote town surrounded by a creepy forest locals fear the disappearance of a teenager may be linked to other missing persons cases from decades earlier. The timelines get twisted and it’s obvious that something wicked is emanating from a tunnel leading to a nearby nuclear power plant. Yet if the story sometimes trips itself up the Goonies-meets-Götterdämmerung ambiance keeps you hooked. 640 A Series of Unfortunate EventsThe wry and bleak Lemony Snickett children novels finally get the ghastly adaptation they deserve (let’s all pretend the dreadful 2004 Jim Carrey movie never happened). Neil Patrick Harris gobbles up the scenery as the vain and wicked Count Olaf, desperate to separate the Baudelaire orphans from their considerable inheritance. The look is Tim Burton by way of Wes Anderson, and the dark wit of the books is replicated perfectly (Snickett, aka Daniel Handler, is co-producer). If you’re curious as to how Cary Fukunaga will handle the Bond franchise, his limited series, starring Emma Stone and Jonah Hill, drops some delicious hints. It’s a mind-bending sci-fi story set in an alternative United States where computers still look like Commodore 64s and in which you pay for goods by having a “travel buddy” sit down and read you adverts. The Breaking Bad prequel is starting to outgrow the show that spawned it. Where Breaking Bad delivered a master-class in scorched earth storytelling Saul is gentler and more humane. Years before the rise of Walter White, the future meth overlord’s sleazy lawyer, Saul Goodman, is still plain old Jimmy McGill, a striving every-dude trying to catch a break. But how far will he go to make his name and escape the shadow of his superstar attorney brother Chuck (Michael McKean)? Don’t tell Channel 4 but Charlie Brooker’s dystopian anthology series has arguably got even better since making the jump from British terrestrial TV to the realm of megabucks American streaming. Bigger budgets have given creators Brooker and Annabel Jones license to let their imaginations off the leash – yielding unsurpassable episodes such as virtual reality love story San Junipero and Star Trek parody USS Callister, which has bagged a bunch of Emmys. David Fincher produces this serial killer drama based on the writings of a real-life FBI psychological profiler. It’s the post-Watergate Seventies and two maverick G-Men (Jonathan Groff and Holt McCallany) are going out on a limb by utilising the latest psychological research to get inside the heads of a motley assembly of real-life sociopathic murders – including the notorious “Co-Ed” butcher Ed Kemper, brought chillingly to live in an Emmy-nominated performance by Cameron Britton. A right royal blockbuster from dramatist Peter Morgan (The Queen, Frost  Nixon). Tracing the reign of Elizabeth II from her days as a wide-eyed young woman propelled to the throne after the surprise early death of her father, The Crown humanises the royals even as it paints their private lives as a bodice-ripping soap. Matt Smith is charmingly roguish as Prince Philip and Vanessa Kirby has ascended the Hollywood ranks on the back of her turn as the flawed yet sympathetic Princess Margaret. This drug trafficking caper spells out exactly what kind of series it is with an early scene in which two gangsters zip around a multi-level carpark on a motorbike firing a machine gun. Narcos, in other words, is for people who consider Pacino’s Scarface a touch too understated. Series one and two feature a mesmerising performance by Wagner Moura as Columbian cocaine kingpin Pablo Escobar, while season three focuses on the notorious Cali cartel. Reported to be one of Netflix’s biggest hits – the company doesn’t release audience figures – the fourth season turns its attention to Mexico’s interminable drugs wars. A cloud hangs over Aziz Ansari’s future after he was embroiled in the #MeToo scandal. But whatever happens, he has left us with a humane and riveting sitcom about an Ansari-proximate character looking for love and trying to establish himself professionally in contemporary New York. One of Netflix’s early blockbusters, the sprawling soap opera updates Dallas to modern day southern Florida. Against the edge-of-civilisation backdrop of the Florida Keys, Kyle Chandler plays the local detective and favourite son of a well-to-do family. Their idyllic lives are thrown into chaos with the return of the clan’s black sheep (an unnervingly intense Ben Mendelsohn). The story is spectacularly hokey but searing performances by Chandler and Mendelsohn, and by Sissy Spacek and the late Sam Shepard as their imperious parents, make Bloodline compelling – a guilty pleasure that, actually, you shouldn’t feel all that guilty about. You can almost smell the shoddy sanitation and horse-manure in this lavish murder-mystery set in 19th New York. We’re firmly in Martin Scorsese\u0027s Gangs of New York territory, with a serial killer bumping off boy prostitutes across Manhattan. Enter pioneering criminal psychologist Dr Laszlo Kreisler (Daniel Brühl), aided by newspaper man John Moore (Luke Evans) and feisty lady detective Sara Howard (Dakota Fanning). Judd Apatow bring his signature gross-out comedy to the small screen. Love, which Apatow produced, is a masterclass in restraint compared to 40 Year Old Virgin, Knocked Up etc. Paul Rust is Gus, a nerdish movie set tutor, whose develops a crush on Gillian Jacobs’s too-cool-for-school radio producer Mickey. Romance, of a sort, blossoms – but Love’s triumph is to acknowledge the complications of real life and to disabuse its characters of the idea that there’s such a thing as a straightforward happy ending. Hipster LA provides the bustling setting. Who says reality TV has to be nasty and manipulative? This updating of the early 2000s hit Queer Eye for the Straight Guy has five stereotype-challenging gay men sharing lifestyle tips and fashion advice with an engaging cast of All American schlubs (the first two seasons are shot mostly in the state of Georgia). There are laughs – but serious moment too, such as when one of the crew refuses to enter a church because of the still unhealed scars of his strict Christian upbringing. A high-gloss revamping of the traditional TV food show. Each episode profiles a high wattage international chef across its three seasons, the series has featured gastronomic superstars from the US, Argentina, India and Korea. A disastrous group interview in which actor Jason Bateman “mansplained” away the bullying co-star Jessica Walter had suffered at the hands of fellow cast-member Jeffrey Tambor meant season five of Arrested Development was fatally compromised before it even landed. Yet Netflix’s return to the dysfunctional world of the Bluth family stands on its merits and is a worthy addition to the surreal humour of seasons one through three (series four, which had to work around the busy schedules of the cast, is disposable by comparison). Netflix does Bladerunner with this sumptuous adaptation of the cult Richard Morgan novel. The setting is a neon-splashed cyberpunk future in which the super-wealthy live forever by uploading the consciousness into new “skins”. Enter rebel-turned-detective Takeshi Kovacs (Joel Kinnaman), hired to find out who killed a (since resurrected) zillionaire industrialist while dealing with fallout from his own troubled past. Rumoured to be one of Netflix’s most expensive projects yet, for its second run, Anthony Mackie (aka Marvel’s Falcon) replaced Kinnaman as the shape-shifting Kovacs.2140 Rick and MortyDan Harmon, creator of cult sitcom Community (also on Netflix), finds the perfect outlet for zany fanboy imagination with this crazed animated comedy about a Marty McFlyDoc Brown-esque duo of time travellers. Every genre imaginable is parodied with the manic energy and zinging dialogue we have come to expect from Harmon.Mad Men’s Alison Brie is our entry point into this comedy-drama inspired by a real life all-female wrestling league in the Eighties. Ruth Wilder (Brie) is a down-on-her luck actor who, out of desperation, signs up a wrestling competition willed into being by Sam Sylvia (podcast king Marc Maron). Britrock singer Kate Nash is one of her her fellow troupe members: the larger than life Rhonda “Britannica” Richardson.Deadpan animated satire about an idiot super spy with shaken and stirred mother issues. One of the most ambitious modern comedies, animated or otherwise, Archer tries on different varieties of humour for size and even occasionally tugs at the heart strings.Breaking Bad for those with short attention s. The saga of Walter White took years to track the iconic anti-hero’s rise from mild mannered everyman to dead-eyed criminal. Ozark gets there in the first half hour as nebbish Chicago accountant Marty Byrde (Jason Bateman) agrees to serve as lieutenant for the Mexican mob in the hillbilly heartlands of Ozark, Missouri (in return they thoughtfully spare his life). Bateman, usually seen in comedy roles, is a revelation as is Laura Linney as his nasty wife Wendy. There is also a break-out performance by Julia Garner playing the scion of a local redneck crime family.A heavenly comedy with a twist. Eleanor Shellstrop (Kristen Bell) is a cynical schlub waved through the Pearly Gates by mistake after dying in a bizarre supermarket accident. There she must remain above the suspicions of seemingly well-meaning but disorganised angel Michael (Ted Danson) whilst also negotiating fractious relationships with do-gooder Chidi (William Jackson Harper), spoiled princess Tahani (former T4 presenter Jameela Jamil) and ex-drug dealer Jason (Manny Jacinto).Netflix has been binning shows as if it is going out of fashion. But that didn’t stop Drake from persuading it to revive the Channel 4 drama about rival drug dealers in a fictional south London neighbourhood. Middle-aged Irishman Ronan Bennett captures the reality of life for many young black British people with tremendously sensitivity, while the cast is headed by Ashley Walters, Kane “Kano” Robinson, rapper Little Simz and Mercury Prize winner Dave. A police procedural adapted from a long-form magazine exposé of American justice’s entrenched misogyny sounds like nobody’s idea of a fun night in. But Unbelievable makes serious points about how sufferers of sexual assault are marginalised and victim-blamed while also drawing the viewer into a compelling mystery. Unflinching yet never gratuitous, it stars Toni Collette and Merritt Wever as hard-bitten detectives investigating a serial rapist. Booksmart’s Kaitlyn Dever, meanwhile, plays a young woman wrongly accused of crying wolf when a man attacks her in her apartment. Time becomes a loop in this sci-fi parable about a troubled New Yorker who finds herself reliving the final hours of her life over and over. Is the cosmos itself trying to tell her something? Or is she simply losing her marbles. Natasha Lyonne excels as damaged, potty-mouthed Nadia. Her improbable love interest is played by Charlie Barnett.Gerard Way’s surreal comic book has translated impressively to the screen. Umbrella Academy unfolds as a lightly unhinged anti-Avengers. A family of super-powered siblings tries to solve the mystery of the murder of their domineering adoptive father, who plucked them from the arms of their mothers and raised them to be humanity’s first line of defence. Ellen Page, Tom Hopper and Robert Sheehan head the cast in a series that plays out like a Marvel movie directed by Wes Anderson. Watch out for a cameo by R\u0026ampB queen Mary J Blige as an inter-dimensional assassin. Oscar-nominated Ava DuVernay makes a foray into television with a gripping four-part retelling of the 1989 Central Park Five case in which five African Americans were charged with the rape of a jogger in central Manhattan. This return to the world of the Jim Henson 1982 fantasy movie is very much a series of two halves. The first five episodes are a confused hodgepodge of exposition and world building. But once it settles down this prequel to the film spins a fantastic tale of puppet Gelflings and Skeksis vying for power in a feudal kingdom… a game of thrones, as it were. Westeros regulars Natalie Dormer, Lena Headey and Nathalie Emmanuel star alongside Simon Pegg, Mark Hamill and Alicia Vikander.   3340 The Haunting of Hill HouseA rare TV horror that genuinely gets under the skin. Very loosely adapted from 1959 Shirley Jackson gothic classic, Mike Flanagan’s series chronicles the adulthood agonies of a family whose childhood was traumatised by a run-in with a creepy mansion. Rather than lazy jump-scares, the series ratchets up the dread slowly yet unyieldingly. A few episodes in and you may find yourself holding your breath, so searing is the tension. To really freak you, Flanagan has also inserted dozens of hidden ghosts into the background. See how many you can spot – and good luck getting to sleep afterwards. Bonkers on a swizzle stick, this series from Brit Marling and Zal Batmanglij makes Twin Peaks look like an Only Fools and Horses repeat. Prairie (Marling) is an inter-dimensional wanderer with a strange past and an even weirder future. She recruits a group of high school students, teaching them the “movements” that permit travel across time and space. That’s the jumping off point for a meditation on existence, identity and fate. Controversially cancelled after just two seasons – and the mother of all cliff-hangers – the OA is nonetheless a sensory experience worth your time. Did we mention the talking octopus? David Attenborough provides the narration – but the real star is the stunning camerawork and general sumptuousness, courtesy of the team behind BBC mega-hits Blue Planet and Planet Earth. Shots of flamingos running across salt flats and blue whales chilling off the coast of Mexico are the perfect excuse to spring for a Netflix HD subscription. Game of Thrones exited to the strains of a thousand damp squibs imploding at once. And it’s too early to say whether adaptations of the Witcher or The Wheel of Time will be any use. But one fantasy saga worth getting your chainmail in a twist for is this kid’s animated series from Avatar: The Last Airbender director Aaron Ehasz. The setting is bog standard swords and sorcery – there are dragons, elves and magicians – but the execution is riveting. Ethnic tensions between elves and humans are compellingly drawn – and did we mention the dragons? A gothic adult cartoon based on an obscure video game does not sound enticing. Yet this baroque fever dream starring Richard Armitage (Thorin from The Hobbit movies) as the last living member of an excommunicated family of vampire hunters and Graham McTavish as a misunderstood Count Dracula (he’s upset after his wife is burned the stake) is a riveting slow burner. A third season is in production. 3840 Tuca and BertieNetflix has lately turned cancelling shows into a competitive sport. This new animated drama from the creators of BoJack Horseman was canned just two months after its debut despite much critical acclaim. In Netflix’s defence, it is rather wacky. To quote Deadline, it tells of  “the friendship between two 30-year-old bird-women who live in the same apartment building, Tuca (Tiffany Haddish), a cocky, care-free toucan and Bertie (Ali Wong), an anxious, daydreaming songbird.” The humour is surreal but, just like BoJack Horseman, the emotional beats – specifically its depiction of the central relationship – yank the heartstrings.Reality TV, the Netflix way. Imagine Bake Off with glass-blowing instead of marzipan manipulation and YouTube star Nick Uhas in for Noel Fielding and Sandi Toksvig. Ten artists test their glass blowing mastery in a series of challenges. The winner walks away with $60,000 and a residency at the Corning Museum of Glass in New York. Just like Bake Off, it’s riveting viewing even if you can’t tell a kiln from a kangaroo.   4040 Dead to MeLinda Cardellini and Christina Applegate join forces for this super-dark comedy about two women who meet at a therapy group for the recently bereaved. They strike up a natural friendship – but, as we slowly learn, each has secrets they’d rather not share. James Marsden is fantastic as the smarmy ex of Judy (Cardellini) while the behind the scenes involvement of producers Will Ferrell and Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy director Adam McKay provides a clue as to the mad-cap humour. A word-of-mouth success, it has been picked up for a second series.A cartoon about a talking horse, starring the goofy older brother from Arrested Development… on paper little about BoJack Horseman screams “must watch”. Yet the series almost immediately transcended its format to deliver a moving and very funny rumination on depression and middle-age malaise.

Enter rebel-turned-detective Takeshi Kovacs (Joel Kinnaman), hired to find out who killed a (since resurrected) zillionaire industrialist while dealing with fallout from his own troubled past. Rumoured to be one of Netflix’s most expensive projects yet, for its second run, Anthony Mackie (aka Marvel’s Falcon) replaced Kinnaman as the shape-shifting Kovacs.2140 Rick and MortyDan Harmon, creator of cult sitcom Community (also on Netflix), finds the perfect outlet for zany fanboy imagination with this crazed animated comedy about a Marty McFlyDoc Brown-esque duo of time travellers. Every genre imaginable is parodied with the manic energy and zinging dialogue we have come to expect from Harmon.Mad Men’s Alison Brie is our entry point into this comedy-drama inspired by a real life all-female wrestling league in the Eighties. Ruth Wilder (Brie) is a down-on-her luck actor who, out of desperation, signs up a wrestling competition willed into being by Sam Sylvia (podcast king Marc Maron). Britrock singer Kate Nash is one of her her fellow troupe members: the larger than life Rhonda “Britannica” Richardson.Deadpan animated satire about an idiot super spy with shaken and stirred mother issues. One of the most ambitious modern comedies, animated or otherwise, Archer tries on different varieties of humour for size and even occasionally tugs at the heart strings.Breaking Bad for those with short attention s. The saga of Walter White took years to track the iconic anti-hero’s rise from mild mannered everyman to dead-eyed criminal. Ozark gets there in the first half hour as nebbish Chicago accountant Marty Byrde (Jason Bateman) agrees to serve as lieutenant for the Mexican mob in the hillbilly heartlands of Ozark, Missouri (in return they thoughtfully spare his life). Bateman, usually seen in comedy roles, is a revelation as is Laura Linney as his nasty wife Wendy. There is also a break-out performance by Julia Garner playing the scion of a local redneck crime family.A heavenly comedy with a twist. Eleanor Shellstrop (Kristen Bell) is a cynical schlub waved through the Pearly Gates by mistake after dying in a bizarre supermarket accident. There she must remain above the suspicions of seemingly well-meaning but disorganised angel Michael (Ted Danson) whilst also negotiating fractious relationships with do-gooder Chidi (William Jackson Harper), spoiled princess Tahani (former T4 presenter Jameela Jamil) and ex-drug dealer Jason (Manny Jacinto).Netflix has been binning shows as if it is going out of fashion. But that didn’t stop Drake from persuading it to revive the Channel 4 drama about rival drug dealers in a fictional south London neighbourhood. Middle-aged Irishman Ronan Bennett captures the reality of life for many young black British people with tremendously sensitivity, while the cast is headed by Ashley Walters, Kane “Kano” Robinson, rapper Little Simz and Mercury Prize winner Dave. A police procedural adapted from a long-form magazine exposé of American justice’s entrenched misogyny sounds like nobody’s idea of a fun night in. But Unbelievable makes serious points about how sufferers of sexual assault are marginalised and victim-blamed while also drawing the viewer into a compelling mystery. Unflinching yet never gratuitous, it stars Toni Collette and Merritt Wever as hard-bitten detectives investigating a serial rapist. Booksmart’s Kaitlyn Dever, meanwhile, plays a young woman wrongly accused of crying wolf when a man attacks her in her apartment. Time becomes a loop in this sci-fi parable about a troubled New Yorker who finds herself reliving the final hours of her life over and over. Is the cosmos itself trying to tell her something? Or is she simply losing her marbles. Natasha Lyonne excels as damaged, potty-mouthed Nadia. Her improbable love interest is played by Charlie Barnett.Gerard Way’s surreal comic book has translated impressively to the screen. Umbrella Academy unfolds as a lightly unhinged anti-Avengers. A family of super-powered siblings tries to solve the mystery of the murder of their domineering adoptive father, who plucked them from the arms of their mothers and raised them to be humanity’s first line of defence. Ellen Page, Tom Hopper and Robert Sheehan head the cast in a series that plays out like a Marvel movie directed by Wes Anderson. Watch out for a cameo by R\u0026ampB queen Mary J Blige as an inter-dimensional assassin. Oscar-nominated Ava DuVernay makes a foray into television with a gripping four-part retelling of the 1989 Central Park Five case in which five African Americans were charged with the rape of a jogger in central Manhattan. This return to the world of the Jim Henson 1982 fantasy movie is very much a series of two halves. The first five episodes are a confused hodgepodge of exposition and world building. But once it settles down this prequel to the film spins a fantastic tale of puppet Gelflings and Skeksis vying for power in a feudal kingdom… a game of thrones, as it were. Westeros regulars Natalie Dormer, Lena Headey and Nathalie Emmanuel star alongside Simon Pegg, Mark Hamill and Alicia Vikander.   3340 The Haunting of Hill HouseA rare TV horror that genuinely gets under the skin. Very loosely adapted from 1959 Shirley Jackson gothic classic, Mike Flanagan’s series chronicles the adulthood agonies of a family whose childhood was traumatised by a run-in with a creepy mansion. Rather than lazy jump-scares, the series ratchets up the dread slowly yet unyieldingly. A few episodes in and you may find yourself holding your breath, so searing is the tension. To really freak you, Flanagan has also inserted dozens of hidden ghosts into the background. See how many you can spot – and good luck getting to sleep afterwards. Bonkers on a swizzle stick, this series from Brit Marling and Zal Batmanglij makes Twin Peaks look like an Only Fools and Horses repeat. Prairie (Marling) is an inter-dimensional wanderer with a strange past and an even weirder future. She recruits a group of high school students, teaching them the “movements” that permit travel across time and space. That’s the jumping off point for a meditation on existence, identity and fate. Controversially cancelled after just two seasons – and the mother of all cliff-hangers – the OA is nonetheless a sensory experience worth your time. Did we mention the talking octopus? David Attenborough provides the narration – but the real star is the stunning camerawork and general sumptuousness, courtesy of the team behind BBC mega-hits Blue Planet and Planet Earth. Shots of flamingos running across salt flats and blue whales chilling off the coast of Mexico are the perfect excuse to spring for a Netflix HD subscription. Game of Thrones exited to the strains of a thousand damp squibs imploding at once. And it’s too early to say whether adaptations of the Witcher or The Wheel of Time will be any use. But one fantasy saga worth getting your chainmail in a twist for is this kid’s animated series from Avatar: The Last Airbender director Aaron Ehasz. The setting is bog standard swords and sorcery – there are dragons, elves and magicians – but the execution is riveting. Ethnic tensions between elves and humans are compellingly drawn – and did we mention the dragons? A gothic adult cartoon based on an obscure video game does not sound enticing. Yet this baroque fever dream starring Richard Armitage (Thorin from The Hobbit movies) as the last living member of an excommunicated family of vampire hunters and Graham McTavish as a misunderstood Count Dracula (he’s upset after his wife is burned the stake) is a riveting slow burner. A third season is in production. 3840 Tuca and BertieNetflix has lately turned cancelling shows into a competitive sport. This new animated drama from the creators of BoJack Horseman was canned just two months after its debut despite much critical acclaim. In Netflix’s defence, it is rather wacky. To quote Deadline, it tells of  “the friendship between two 30-year-old bird-women who live in the same apartment building, Tuca (Tiffany Haddish), a cocky, care-free toucan and Bertie (Ali Wong), an anxious, daydreaming songbird.” The humour is surreal but, just like BoJack Horseman, the emotional beats – specifically its depiction of the central relationship – yank the heartstrings.Reality TV, the Netflix way. Imagine Bake Off with glass-blowing instead of marzipan manipulation and YouTube star Nick Uhas in for Noel Fielding and Sandi Toksvig. Ten artists test their glass blowing mastery in a series of challenges. The winner walks away with $60,000 and a residency at the Corning Museum of Glass in New York. Just like Bake Off, it’s riveting viewing even if you can’t tell a kiln from a kangaroo.   4040 Dead to MeLinda Cardellini and Christina Applegate join forces for this super-dark comedy about two women who meet at a therapy group for the recently bereaved. They strike up a natural friendship – but, as we slowly learn, each has secrets they’d rather not share. James Marsden is fantastic as the smarmy ex of Judy (Cardellini) while the behind the scenes involvement of producers Will Ferrell and Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy director Adam McKay provides a clue as to the mad-cap humour. A word-of-mouth success, it has been picked up for a second series.The Expanding Universe of Ashley GarciaF1: Drive to Survive season 2The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Last year, the company unveiled the Switch\u0026nbspLite\u0026nbspas well as quietly bumping up the battery life of the larger version of the console. Those were made possible as a consequence of updated Nvidia chips on the inside.EA says people prefer not to play its games on the Nintendo SwitchFurukawa suggested that the console is in its midway phase and that it would be looking for further growth opportunities for the new console.“According to the conventional wisdom for dedicated video game platforms, Nintendo Switch should be entering the midway phase of the hardware lifecycle,” he said. “But we believe we have built a foundation on which we can pursue further growth opportunities for Nintendo Switch.”He pointed to the recent announcement of a special Animal Crossing version of the Switch, which will arrive in Japan alongside the game\u0027s release date in March. That suggests that yet more special designs might come to the Switch, even if there is no update to the hardware inside for 2020.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

While its win was a coup for DreamWorks – the film was the studio\u0027s third victor in a row– it was far from a deserving recipient, especially considering Ron Howard won Best Director over Robert Altman and David Lynch for Gosford Park and Mulholland Drive, respectively.219 Chariots of Fire (1981)While Chariots of Fire is precisely the type of film the Academy usually takes under its wing, the fact it won was a big surprise, considering everybody present had expected Reds to win the top prize. The Warren Beatty film would have been a far worthier winner, too.Cold Mountain lucked out by being nominated in what was a particularly weak year for Best Supporting Actress. Renée Zellweger recovered from failing to win for Chicago the previous year and, in doing so, earnt the unremarkable drama its Oscar-winning tag.Viewers of the Oscars have grown used to unexpected victories, but none was more ill-judged than when Paul Haggis\u0027 drama Crash beat Brokeback Mountain to Best Picture.519 Dances with Wolves (1990)It\u0027s quite soul-destroying to think that Dances with Wolves scooped a total of seven Oscars in the same year that Goodfellas was nominated.Alicia Vikander\u0027s performance in The Danish Girl is by no means weak, but it was nothing on Rooney Mara\u0027s affecting turn in Todd Haynes\u0027 film Carol. Had Tom Hooper not won five years before for The King\u0027s Speech, it seems unlikely that the drama would have picked up any nominations.Put simply, The English Patient isn\u0027t a very good film. Of the nine (nine!) Oscars it won, Juliette Binoche\u0027s trophy for Best Supporting Actress was perhaps the most surprising. The French star herself could barely contain her shock. This will most likely be this list\u0027s most controversial placement, but let\u0027s be honest: Gladiator is not the fantastic film it\u0027s regularly hailed as. Ridley Scott\u0027s overlong historical drama boasts plenty of swords-and-sandal bravado, but not much else.The musical Going My Way may have been the biggest cinematic hit of its year, but it certainly wasn\u0027t better that classic noir Double Indemnity, which it beat to win Best Picture. In fact, it\u0027s nowhere near director Leo McCarey\u0027s greatest film (he won six years previous for the Awful Truth and would be nominated again for The Bells of St Mary\u0027s two years later).There\u0027s a reason why Grand Hotel is the only film to ever win Best Picture without receiving a nomination in any other category. An entertaining film, sure, but nothing more.1119 The Greatest Show on Earth (1952)It\u0027s ironic that a film with the word greatest in its title has gone down as one of the worst winners in Oscars history. A prime example of when the Academy voted for spectacle over quality.To those who don\u0027t care about awards ceremonies, Green Book is a crowdpleaser that boasts decent performances from Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali. To everyone else, it\u0027s the damp squib that somehow came out of nowhere to snatch Best Picture from under Roma\u0027s nose. The Imitation Game won Best Adapted Screenplay, which begs the question: what the hell was this distinctly average film doing having any nominations at all?Meryl Streep has won enough Oscars for the world to know she\u0027s evidently one of the finest actors who\u0027ll ever live. Her win for The Iron Lady, though, was one Oscar too many.The year of 1999 marked one of the most remarkable Oscar ceremonies in history for the sole reason that the majority of its winners were terrible choices. Right up there was Roberto Benigni, who beat Tom Hanks (Saving Private Ryan) and Edward Norton (American History X) to win Best Actor for, of all things, Life is Beautiful.It might finally be accepted that disgraced film director Roman Polanski shouldn\u0027t be handed accolades, but back in 2003, this was still what the Oscars were doing. He won Best Director for The Pianist, an award the French-Polish filmmaker could have done without.1719 A Place in the SunA Place in the Sun is a fine little film, but fine little films shouldn\u0027t be winning Oscars –\u0026nbspespecially when they see off competition from more deserving opposition. In this case, director George Stevens beat John Huston (The African Queen), William Wyler (Detective Story) and Elia Kazan (A Streetcar Named Desire) to the Director prize.1819 Shakespeare in LoveYou have to hand it to Shakespeare in Love, it played the Oscars campaign trail perfectly, overtaking war favourites Saving Private Ryan and The Thin Red Line to win the evening\u0027s biggest prize. This doesn\u0027t mean its success has gone down as anything more than evidence of poor judgement from the Academy.It\u0027s often good to hold your hands up and admit that a film is nowhere near as good as you recall. Sadly, Slumdog Millionaire is one of those. While its win no doubt put smiles on the faces of commuters reading the morning papers the next day, the shine has worn off its success in recent years. The rightful winner –\u0026nbspThe Dark Knight – wasn\u0027t even nominated for Best Picture.A Beautiful Mind is one of the mustier Best Pictures winners of the century so far. While its win was a coup for DreamWorks – the film was the studio\u0027s third victor in a row– it was far from a deserving recipient, especially considering Ron Howard won Best Director over Robert Altman and David Lynch for Gosford Park and Mulholland Drive, respectively.219 Chariots of Fire (1981)While Chariots of Fire is precisely the type of film the Academy usually takes under its wing, the fact it won was a big surprise, considering everybody present had expected Reds to win the top prize.

Her win for The Iron Lady, though, was one Oscar too many.The year of 1999 marked one of the most remarkable Oscar ceremonies in history for the sole reason that the majority of its winners were terrible choices. Right up there was Roberto Benigni, who beat Tom Hanks (Saving Private Ryan) and Edward Norton (American History X) to win Best Actor for, of all things, Life is Beautiful.It might finally be accepted that disgraced film director Roman Polanski shouldn\u0027t be handed accolades, but back in 2003, this was still what the Oscars were doing. He won Best Director for The Pianist, an award the French-Polish filmmaker could have done without.1719 A Place in the SunA Place in the Sun is a fine little film, but fine little films shouldn\u0027t be winning Oscars –\u0026nbspespecially when they see off competition from more deserving opposition. In this case, director George Stevens beat John Huston (The African Queen), William Wyler (Detective Story) and Elia Kazan (A Streetcar Named Desire) to the Director prize.1819 Shakespeare in LoveYou have to hand it to Shakespeare in Love, it played the Oscars campaign trail perfectly, overtaking war favourites Saving Private Ryan and The Thin Red Line to win the evening\u0027s biggest prize. This doesn\u0027t mean its success has gone down as anything more than evidence of poor judgement from the Academy.It\u0027s often good to hold your hands up and admit that a film is nowhere near as good as you recall. Sadly, Slumdog Millionaire is one of those. While its win no doubt put smiles on the faces of commuters reading the morning papers the next day, the shine has worn off its success in recent years. The rightful winner –\u0026nbspThe Dark Knight – wasn\u0027t even nominated for Best Picture.The 2020 Oscars take place on 9 February.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Inouye Solar Telescope (DKIST) in Hawaii — which is twice the size of the next largest solar scope — have captured an array of cell-like structures that cover the surface of the sun, each taking up space roughly the size of the US state of Texas.It is hoped that by focussing on these areas, scientists may be better able to predict changes in the sun’s surface — including solar flares that can knock out power grids and put satellites at risk.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesFrance Córdova, National Science Foundation (NSF) director, said: “Since NSF began work on this ground-based telescope, we have eagerly awaited the first images.\u0026nbsp“We can now share these images and videos, which are the most detailed of our Sun to date.

It also confirms a prediction of Einstein\u0027s general theory of relativity.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesFrame-dragging has been spotted on Earth, where satellites have examined the gravitational field of our planet as it rotates. But the effect is very small, difficult to measure and hard to examine.More massive objects, such as neutron stars or white dwarfs, give scientists the chance to examine the phenomenon at a much grander scale.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s groundbreaking decade of space exploration: In pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Mystic Mountain, a pillar of gas and dust standing at three-light-years tall, bursting with jets of gas flom fledgling stars buried within, was captured by Nasa\u0027s Hubble Space Telelscope in February 2010The first ever selfie taken on an alien planet, captured by Nasa\u0027s Curiosity Rover in the early days of its mission to explore Mars in 2012Death of a star: This image from Nasa\u0027s Chandra X-ray telescope shows the supernova of Tycho, a star in our Milky Way galaxyArrokoth, the most distant object ever explored, pictured here on 1 January 2019 by a camera on Nasa\u0027s New Horizons spaceraft at a distance of 4.1 billion miles from EarthAn image of the Large Magellanic Cloud galaxy seen in infrared light by the Herschel Space Observatory in January 2012.

The pulsar served as something of a clock: they could watch as the pulses arrived, measuring them very precisely, over a period of twenty years, and watch for changes as they did.Scientists release audio recording of sound of gravitational wavesThey found that the pulses did indeed drift, as predicted by the theory. After discounting other possible causes, they were able to conclude that the drift was caused by the white dwarf causing the phenomenon of frame-dragging.The idea that rotating bodies would be able to drag spacetime\u0026nbsparound with them was first suggested by Austrian\u0026nbspmathematicians Josef\u0026nbspLense\u0026nbspand Hans\u0026nbspThirring, who suggested it three years after Einstein published his\u0026nbspgeneral theory of relativity.Though the effect can be seen at a very minor and subtle level on Earth, using gyroscopes and other technology, it is 100 million times more potent in the case of a rapidly spinning white dwarf.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The Conservative Party won with an overall majorityA dog outside a polling station during the general election in NorthumberlandOne poster on the Debt Camel advice website said their payment was an “absolute joke”, adding that they had paid more in interest on\u0026nbspone of their dozens of loans than they would receive in redress. Another wrote: “My claim was £986. I’m getting about £43. It’s an absolute disgrace.”However, some customers were more positive about the payouts. Sam\u0026nbspWindle, who took out loans with\u0026nbspWonga\u0026nbspseveral years ago, said that although 4.3 per cent was less than he had hoped for, it was better than nothing.His redress amount was initially £5,200 before being reduced to £2,700, of which he received just £121. However, like many other\u0026nbspWonga\u0026nbspcustomers, he was not aware that he was due compensation until the administrators contacted him.Mr Windle, who has now cleared all of his debts, was at one point paying off around £300 interest to\u0026nbspWonga\u0026nbspon each of seven payday loans. “It was a vicious cycle really. I can honestly say the day I paid it all off was the happiest day of my life.”He added: “The only frustrating about the compensation\u0026nbspis that it was due to be paid in January bit that’s been put back to some point in the next four weeks. The communication from the administrators has been pretty poor really.”Sara Williams, a personal finance expert who runs the Debt Camel website, said: “People were told last year by the Wonga administrators what their compensation amount had been calculated at and they were warned their payout would be ‘significantly less’.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

On the average compensation of about £1000, they will get only £43.\u0026nbsp“Some people, remembering the stress the Wonga loans had caused them,\u0026nbsphave described this as an insult and not proper compensation at all.”Wonga had faced a barrage of criticism over the high interest it charged on loans and was accused of targeting those who were most vulnerable.In 2014, the firm wrote off £220m worth of debt belonging to 330,000 customers after admitting making loans to people who could not afford to repay them.Administrators had received 389,621 eligible claims from those said to have been sold unaffordable loans as of August 2019, according to documents filed with Companies House.Prior to its collapse in August 2018, Wonga blamed its difficulties on a “significant” increase in people making claims in relation to historic loans. Fellow payday lender QuickQuid was put into administration last October after experiencing similar difficulties.The Money Advice Service website\u0026nbsphas a guide on alternatives to payday loans, and you can also contact a free helpline on 0800 138 7777Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Those who find smaller bugs may only receive $500.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesUnlike some other bug bounty programmes, Microsoft is explicitly targeting gamers and asking them to see if they can find issues.

The time to jump ship isnt when there are serious problems.The Queen pulled no punches when she sat down with Prince Harry after he and Meghan released the bombshell news they were quitting.At a summit in Sandringham, her Majesty laid down the law - saying they can no longer formally represent her despite the couple insisting they wanted to fly the flag for the Queen after quitting the Firm.In her decisive statement, the -year-old monarch also revealed the couple would pay back the £.m of taxpayer money spent on refurbishing Frogmore Cottage.Under the new deal, Harry and Meghan will retain their HRH status — but have agreed to not use their titles while trying to forge a new le in North America.It has since been reported Kate Middleton will be front and centre of the Royal Family with Prince William vowing Megxit wont ruin their plans.A source claimed : William knows he will have a lot more work this year and is happy to perform whatever duties the Queen asks of him. But he is determined that won’t be to the detriment of his charity work.It comes after speculation of a feud between brothers William and Harry during the so-called Megxit drama, with it claimed they have since made peace.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The figures lay bare that the five-week policy simply isn’t working - it just drives people further into poverty.Unless the DWP moves to a policy where benefits are paid promptly the queues for food banks in Glasgow, and across the country, will continue growing.One million people are already receiving it and by the time the system is fully rolled out in , nearly  million will be on it.But there are big problems with the flagship new system - it takes  weeks to get the first payment and it could leave some families worse off by thousands of pounds a year.And while working families can claim back up to  per cent of their childcare costs, they must find the money to pay for childcare upfront - we’ve heard of families waiting up to  months for the money.Working parents across the country told us they’ve been unable to take on more hours - or have even turned down better paid jobs or more hours because of the amount they get their benefits cut.It’s time to Make Universal Credit work. We want the government to:Together, these changes will help Make Universal Credit Work.Join our Universal Credit Facebook group or email UniversalCredit@the-sun to share your story. In the written question, DWP minister Will Quince said: The Department’s deductions policy strikes a fair balance between a claimant’s need to meet their obligations and their ability to ensure they can meet their day-to-day needs.From October , Universal Credit deductions have been reduced to % of a claimant’s standard allowance down from % to better achieve these objectives.If youre struggling to make your benefits stretch to cover the bills then here are a few ways that you can get extra cash.You could also be missing out on much-needed cashyou arent on the right benefits, so make sure you check what youre entitled to.Apply for an advance - Claimants are able to get some cash within five days rather than waiting weeks for their first payment. But its a loan which means the repayments will be automatically deducted from your future Universal Credit pay out.Alternative Payment Arrangements- If youre falling behind on rent, you or your landlord may be able to apply for an APA which will get your payment sent directly to your landlord. You might also be able to change your payments to get them more frequently, or you can split the paymentsyoure part of a couple.Budgeting Advance - You may be able to get help from the government to help with emergency household costs of up to £youre single, £youre part of a couple or £you have children. These are only in cases like your cooker breaking down or for help getting a job. Youll have to repay the advance through your regular Universal Credit payments. Youll still have to repay the loan, evenyou stop claiming for Universal Credit.Cut your Council Tax - You might be able to get a discount on your Council Tax or be entitled to Discretionary Housing Paymentsyour payments arent enough to cover your rent.Foodbanks - If youre really hard up and struggling to buy food and toiletries, you can find your local foodbank who will provide you with help for free.

He will surely find himself in court very soon.This week a senior US attorney, Geoffrey Berman, said the prince had offered “zero co-operation” to the FBI and prosecutors.This is over his friendship with the paedophile sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein.Andrew admits he kept his friendship going with this horrible financier for longer than he should.No kidding, your highness. You still visited the bloke after he had been convicted of having sex with an underage girl. There has been no convincing explanation as to why you should have done so. Indeed, when you tried to explain it, on TV to the BBC’s Emily Maitlis, you sounded both deluded and deceitful.But there’s worse, of course. With Andy, somehow, there always is.He is himself accused of having sex with a -year-old lass procured for him by Epstein.This is Virginia Roberts. She is one of five women bringing a suit against the now dead Epstein and they want Prince Andrew to testy.Andy denies ever having laid a finger on Roberts. Well, OK, maybe a finger , but nowt more.Andrew has been implicated in this grotesque scandal for a long time now. The sensible thing to have done would have been to speak to the US investigators right at the outset.Becauseyou’ve got nothing to hide, there’s nothing to worry about, is there, matey But Prince Andrew’s actions have not appeared as the actions of a man with nothing to hide. He has preicated at every stage. He needs to understand that just because he says he is innocent of everything, it doesn’t mean everybody has to believe him, you know And there are plenty out there who certainly do not believe him.Sources close to Prince Andrew say he is “angry” and “bewildered” over the accusation that he offered the FBI zero co-operation.Well sure. He’s always bewildered. He’d be bewildered by a piece of paper with “see other side” written on both sides. He’d be sitting there trying to work it out for ages. He is not the sharpest tool in the box.If you’re angry and bewildered, your royal personage, then give the FBI a ring first thing tomorrow morning, US time, and tell them you are anxious to help in their inquiries.Because until this business is sorted out, there is a dark cloud over the Royal Family. And thus a dark cloud over Britain.The terrible suspicion is that our Royal Family is coming apart at the seams.Put all of our minds at rest, Andrew. Talk to the police. And tell the truth.THE Scots have banned the smacking of children by their parents.Braying the bairns was a kind of national sport up there. I think people in Carlisle and Berwick could make a killing.Set up special centres where Scottish mums and dads can cross the border and beat their children without fear of punishment.You could sell special souvenir slippers or canes marked with “I Came To Carlisle To Bray The Kids”.A WOMAN with an apparent IQ of a small bowl of Maltesers has demanded that firms stop men chatting about football in the workplace. Ann Francke is from the Chartered Management Institute.She says that saying stuff like, “Hey, Leeds tore our lads a new a**ehole on Tuesday night” excludes women.No it doesn’t! It doesn’t exclude women who like football, does it  Whereas it does exclude men who couldn’t give a toss about the Leeds v Millwall game.Should we continue this sexist stereotyping and ban women from talking about Strictly or vaginal yeast infections What, under your regime, Ann, would people be allowed to talk about  Every subject excludes someone.TURKEY – the world’s worst country, in my view – is to introduce a “marry your rapist” law.A man charged with rape will be let off scot-freehe agrees to marry his victim.What the woman – or perhaps more usually, girl – thinks about this will not be taken into consideration.All this is part of president Tayyip Erdogans fervent wish to drag Turkey back into the seventh century.And he is having great success in his ambition.WELCOME to the world of , a newspaper for rich, stupid people living in North London.In yesterday’s issue they were terried about what to put in their morning cup of tea, other than tea.Milk is out because of greenhouse gases caused by the dairy industry. Coconut milk leads to chopping down rainforests. Almond milk is unkind to bees.What can they do  Can I suggest dandruff  Scrape it off your head and shove it in your cup.There was also a truly hilarious piece about wild swimming by an idiot called Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett.She says it’s an elitist activity. And for rich people to pretend they’re not part of the capitalist system which drives climate change.No, not kidding. : A world beyond parody.I WONDERour new Government has made its first big mistake.Allowing the Chinese company Huawei a role in the development of G seems to me both naive and immoral.If you deal with a Chinese company the size of Huawei, you are basically dealing with the Chinese government.And this a regime that is trying to stle freedom of speech and democracy across its vast territory. Most obviously, in its bullying of Hong Kong.But worse than that is its treatment of Muslim Chinese people in the west of the country. Thousands upon thousands are held in “re-education” camps. Not to mention their occupation of Tibet.More pragmatically, China is a hostile, totalitarian, Communist country. The notion it will act in good faith is frankly laughable. Our vital communications network will effectively be in the hands of our enemy.No wonder the Chinese are so anxious to make this happen.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

There have also been instances of protesting fire- fighters setting themselves alight — albeit with fire extinguishers on hand to douse the flames.You are much more likely to have seen these disturbing scenes on social media than on the television news, probably because such images don’t fit with the anti-Brexit narrative of most UK broadcasters.You see, it was supposed to be Britain that collapsed into chaos, while our continental neighbours basked in the stability allegedly afforded by European Union membership.Most of us are vaguely aware that the image we are often presented of President Emmanuel Macron as the smooth-talking glamour boy of modern European politics is somewhat at odds with the situation on the ground in his country.We have heard a bit about the gilets jaunesprotesters who have been staging huge and sometimes violent protests every weekend across France for more than a year now.But despite France being our closest continental neighbour, we don’t quite know what is going on or why — mainly because these extraordinary scenes are so seldom explained or even covered by flagship news programmes.The truth is that civil stre in France, including the sheer level of violence and fury now being directed at its political establishment and at the police who enforce their will, is in danger of spiralling out of control.In painful contrast to La Belle Epoque, the famous “beautul era” of creativity and gracious living France enjoyed for the  years before the First World War, the country is now sliding into Le Mal Epoque — the bad times, which show little sign of ending.The immediate cause of the latest protests is Macron’s economic reform programme, a dose of unpleasant medicine the French economy probably needs to digest but which its powerful and militant trade unions have no intention of allowing to pass.Macron aims to abolish ious “sweetheart” pension deals enjoyed by dferent occupations, including many public sector groups, and create in their place a single national pension scheme he says will be more affordable and fairer for all.Some groups face having their pensions calculated on their career average earnings for the first time, rather than their final salaries at retirement, as  separate schemes are rolled into one. Everyone is faced with working longer, as the retirement age rises from  to  .Macron is also taking a tougher line on the pay and traditionally quite lax working practices of French public sector employees, which is what the firefighters have taken particular objection to.A six-week transport strike has just ended, while the country is also suffering from a wave of power cuts as electricity workers withdraw their labour.When you throw into the mix other major social problems, such as the alienation and chronic high unemployment suffered by youths from ethnic minorities in the “Banlieues” — grim outer estates that encircle Paris and other major French cities — and the ever-present threat of Islamist terrorist atrocities, then the multiple sources of pessimism and anger among the French public become clear.And that is before the famous gilets jaunes are taken into the equation. These protesters, mainly provincial, traditionally-minded people from small towns and villages, began their demonstrations as a protest against punitive new rates of tax on petrol that Macron had introduced to the acclaim of environmentalists and other fashionable metropolitan groups.That grievance has now morphed into a more general contention that Macron is a president for the rich and well-connected.Leftist union leaders have started to ape the language of the gilets jaunes.Firebrand Philippe Martinez — a kind of French Arthur Scargill — says Macron and his inner-circle are disconnected from reality and need to “shake the hands of a few who actually work”.In British terms, modern France is perhaps best likened to our experience in the s and early ’s, characterised by excessive trade union power, strikes, riots, terrorism, outbursts of police brutality and a general pervading sense of aggression on the streets.With the next French presidential election shaping up as a choice between more Macron or Marine Le Pen, with her Far-Right connections, some in France have started to look across the Channel for a better example.Leading lights in the centre-right Republican Party have even praised Boris Johnson as offering, “a third way between globalists and populists”.As Britain gets ready for a Brexit knees-up tomorrow, with no sign of violence despite the years of political angst we have gone through, we should count our blessings.Many in France would give almost anything to be in our shoes right now.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I suddenly had to find a months money.I didnt know what I was going to do.Nichola, who works for a charity and used to be a benefits adviser, wasnt eligible for the Flexible Support Fund or a budgeting loan to help with the costs.She added: I looked at every opportunity for some help, but I dont have a wealthy family, or someone in the area to look after my child.Nichola says the current system unfairly penalises lower earners, when other childcare systems dont require Brits to fork up upfront.And like many working mums, over the school holidays she has to folk out thousands of pounds extra upfront too.Its women who are struggling the most here,  per cent of single-parent families are women, she added.I dread to think what its like for people on minimum wage, how they can afford it.How can you justy paying childcare costs upfront for someone earning £, in advance, but not someone who is on £, Its so frustrating, so detrimental, to iniduals lives, and potentially hundreds of thousands of lives.One million people are already receiving it and by the time the system is fully rolled out in , nearly  million will be on it.But there are big problems with the flagship new system - it takes  weeks to get the first payment and it could leave some families worse off by thousands of pounds a year.And while working families can claim back up to  per cent of their childcare costs, they must find the money to pay for childcare upfront - we’ve heard of families waiting up to  months for the money.Working parents across the country told us they’ve been unable to take on more hours - or have even turned down better paid jobs or more hours because of the amount they get their benefits cut.It’s time to Make Universal Credit work.

Three decades since the rot set in with the drive towards a United States of Europe. Seven years after David Cameron promised a referendum and ½ traumatic years since Leave won it. It is hard to exaggerate the magnitude of this moment.Or the relief that Brexit, after all the ision and rancour, will at last be done. That our democracy ­ultimately prevailed over those who fought to thwart it.Other EU nations saw their referendums overturned or ignored. We would not be bullied into a rethink.It is true that nothing much will change this year during the “transition period”. But at pm Brexit becomes irreversible.We will be the first country to leave the EU. And in The Sun’s view we will never rejoin, never again surrender our independence.Instead we will be firing the starting gun on a new era full of excitement, potential and promise:The birth of a new Britain, setting our own laws, controlling our borders and trading independently with the entire world.This will not be Little Britain — quite the opposite. Brexit is not some nostalgic fantasy about the Empire.We will be outward-looking, a magnet for the brightest and best migrants — and for those already making a living here, a permanent, welcoming home.Many Sun readers will be ecstatic to be out. Some not so much. We understand that.But this paper — which was always pro-Common Market but increasingly eurosceptic as the EU grabbed more and more of our ­sovereignty — backed leaving all the way.So we want to pay tribute here to the heroes of Brexit, the men and women without whom it would never have happened:Boris Johnson, who went from eurosceptic Brussels reporter to charismatic figurehead of the Leave campaign and finally to the Prime Minister whose election victory last December  assured he could deliver Brexit.Michael Gove, his cerebral and articulate Cabinet ally who sacriced political and personal friendships to fight for his principles.Dominic Cummings, the campaign genius who with Matthew Elliott and the Vote Leave team triumphed against huge odds in  and last year helped orchestrate Boris’s ­decisive win at the polls.Nigel Farage, the controversial former Ukip chief whose pressure forced David Cameron in  to offer a referendum — and whose Brexit Party then terried the Tories into getting serious about delivering Brexit in full . . . out of the single market and customs union.Dan Hannan, the brains behind the project for  years, whose powers of persuasion rallied Tories to the cause. His ally Douglas Carswell was pivotal too.Jacob Rees-Mogg, Iain Duncan Smith, Steve Baker, Bill Cash and their ERG of Tory backbenchers whose refusal to compromise was admirable, evenThe Sun did despair of it when it threatened to destroy Brexit entirely.They have been vindicated. As has the ERG’s founder, the late ex-Tory MP Michael Spicer.We salute the Tory Cabinet ministers who campaigned for Brexit — notably Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, Home Secretary Priti Patel and Environment Secretary Theresa Villiers.From the Labour benches, Gisela Stuart and Kate Hoey shattered the Left’s bizarre consensus that the EU is a near-flawless bastion of liberal values and backed Leave.Ex-Labour MP Caroline Flint, like millions of other Remainers, insisted that upholding the result and our democracy was paramount.But other heroes and heroines planted the seeds of Brexit much earlier.Such as Corbyn’s idol Tony Benn, who before the first referendum on our Common Market membership in  rightly said it “would mean the end of Britain as a completely self-governing nation”.Margaret Thatcher, who in  discovered EC president Jacques Delors plotting to hand back union powers she had removed. She was having none of that — as her famous Bruges speech made clear.Later, as calls grew for yet more Brussels control, she told the Commons: “No, no, no.”The Sun’s “Up Yours, Delors” front page in  summarised our own feelings.Eurosceptic tycoon James Goldsmith launched the Referendum Party in  with just one policy: a vote on EU membership. Three years later Ukip picked up the baton.But not all our Brexit heroes backed Brexit.Many of its most outspoken opponents inadvertently steered millions towards Leave, hardened their resolve and even turned Remainers into Brexiteers:David Cameron, who promised a referendum he was far too confident he would win and catastrophically misjudged the electorate.George Osborne, whose apocalyptic predictions failed to terry Leave voters.Angela Merkel, whose refusal to give Cameron a better deal for Britain cost both dear.And the EU’s Jean-Claude Juncker, Donald Tusk and Michel Barnier, whose sneering and threats emboldened rather than cowed us. Likewise the EUParliament’s Guy Verhofstadt, who foolishly let a camera crew capture his team boasting of turning the UK into a “colony”. Imagine the effect that had.Then, of course, there’s Jeremy ­Corbyn, who damaged the Remain campaign and then gted Boris a stonking mandate.And ex-Lib Dem leader Jo “revoke Brexit” Swinson, who agreed to last month’s election under the delusion she could win it — but managed only to lose her own seat.There’s John Bercow, the ex-Speaker whose blatant bias and constitutional trickery convinced Leavers they made the right call. And his arrogant Tory co-conspirators Dominic Grieve and Oliver Letwin, who hoped to establish a Remainer pseudo-Government to enforce a second referendum — testing the public’s patience to their own destruction.Let’s not forget too the former Tories who merely pretended to “respect the referendum”, notably Anna Soubry, who then said single market and customs union membership was inevitable and charmingly told Leavers: “Suck it up”. And how about the glittering cast of Remoaner foghorns Take Tony Blair who, but for The Sun and others, would have forced us  years ago into the disastrous euro — the “burning building with no exits” as William Hague accurately described it.Blair, who then opened our borders to a flood of low-skilled migrants, ­further exposing the folly of free movement.Or his old spin doctor Alastair Campbell and former lackey Andrew Adonis, whose deranged doom-mongering and playground insults hardened Leavers’ hearts and repelled pragmatic Remainers at the same time.Or John Major, whose decision to adopt the  Maastricht Treaty, tying us even closer to the EU — but without a referendum — turbo-charged euroscepticism. A man whose increasingly shrill anti-Brexit outbursts merely convinced Leavers they were right.And how about the clueless celebs who thought abusing Leavers would compel them to think the “correct” thoughts  Or the BBC, whose routine europhile propaganda delivered vast numbers of votes for Leave  But there are Brexit heroes still greater than any of these:They are the .million voters, many Sun readers among them, who braved every threat and every slur, backed Leave in  and stuck to their guns last December.The Sun salutes you.Brexit will not be plain sailing. We are under no illusions. But we are convinced a fully independent Britain has a rosier future.And YOU made it happen. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

At last we will take back control of trade, human rights and migration.You will forgive us I hope, Mr Juncker, a moment of celebration as we raise a glass to an independent and prosperous future. It has been a hard path to get to this point — one you, of all people, know.But as we drink and make merry you — and everyone  from Amsterdam to Zakynthos — should know this.We are not going to wake up tomorrow morning feeling any less European.Ireland, France, Belgium and the Netherlands will still be our neighbours.We will still be eating Brie and driving Volkswagens, and we will still be sending brown saucein the other direction.Indeed, we might now feel more European.No longer will we have to worry about those fabled traffic jams which were going to block the M. We won’t be bothered about the planes not taking off or shelves emptying of fresh food.We will be able to get on with sharing and enjoying European civilisation.We will still be watching European football matches and knocking back German beer.

The tragedy of this was that “Europe” became a dirty word.It became a byword for inefficiency, for overbearing rules, for having things foisted on us that we didn’t really want.But from pm tonight, all that goes. Europe can go back to being synonymous with culture, good food, great landscapes.And we are in good company.

Sleep issues are complicated, encompassing many areas of health.“By working through my  three core principles of sleep — Behaviour, Environment and Diet — you will address many of the basic areas of sleep hygiene that can help you on the way to achieving the sleep of your dreams.”Rob believes that everything you do during the day can affect the way you sleep.The principles of B.E.D. cover everything from how you spend your time in the evening , what your bedroom looks likeand the food you choose to eat .On average, we spend around a third of our lives asleep.The recommended amount of kip for adults is between seven and nine hours each night but this may dfer depending on your age, sex, health and other factors.Before teenage years, children generally require more sleep, which helps to support growth and development.So how much shut-eye do you actually need :BABIES: Young infants need around  hours of sleep at night and approximately two-and-a-half hours during the day.PRE-SCHOOLERS: Under-fives require -and-a-half hours at night and a daytime nap of around one hour and  minutes.PRIMARY-AGED CHILDREN: Up to  years, kids need between nine-and-a-half hours and  hours.TEENAGERS: Nine hours.ADULTS: From the age of  upwards, we need between seven and nine hours.OAPs: Sleep requirement reduces in advancing years to between seven and eight hours.CHEESE GIVES YOU NIGHTMARES: Cheese contains an amino acid called tyramine, which is a common trigger  for migraines. It also triggers the release of a hormone called norepinephrine that can stimulate the brain. Both these factors  may inhibit sleep.COUNTING SHEEP: With this trick for dozing off, it does not matter what you count. If it is sheep jumping over a fence, it is the   visualisation aspect that is important. Focusing on that can help distract you from thinking – and the repetition will hopefully lull you to sleep in double-quick time.TAKE A WARM BATH: A warm soak in the tub will ensure that your body experiences rapid cool-down afterwards, which will make you feel sleepy.WEAR SOCKS: The additional layer can improve circulation in  the feet, which might mean you drop off quicker.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It will also keep paying into the EU’s budget.  nBlue passports stripped of EU branding will start being issued to all new applicants, instead of the old burgundy ones, and m special p coins will enter circulation.  n Jeremy Corbyn gives Brexit message declaring apostoday is only the beginningapos   nWhat happens next   n  n   nThe UK can now formally begin trade talks with other countries, like the US and Australia, so they are ready to kick in at the end of the year.  nThe Government will be hoping for some quick wins so it can show it is making a success of Brexit.  nA new team within No , headed by the PM’s chief Europe adviser David Frost, will lead the UK’s trade talks with the EU, our biggest trading partner.  nThey’re only expected to get going properly in March after the EU agrees its negotiating “mandate” - and many believe they won’t be finished on time.  nCan the transition period be extended   nThe Brexit deal says the transition period can go on for another two years - until the end of . But the government passed a law banning any extension to show how serious it is about leaving.  nBut it can still change its mind right up to the end of June. Beyond that, the  December becomes a hard deadline.  nWe will continue to follow EU rules for the rest of the year and start paying our £bn ‘orce bill’ to the EU which stretch for several years. n Jubilant Brexit backers descend on Parliament for aposmost exciting moment of their leapos   nWill the trade talks be a success   n  n   nThe Government hopes so as they were touted as one of the biggest benefits of Brexit, but they have very little time.  nAny deals with other countries are likely to require controversial trade-offs, such as any agreement with the US over food standards and the NHS.  nEU officials are sceptical we’ll be able to strike a deal within the year.  nIf we do, there will be a new set of rules from  January .  nIf not, we could crash out on ‘WTO terms’ - the basic rules that slap high tarfs and restrictions on trade.  nWhat will Boris Johnson do next   nNo is desperate to move on from Brexit and to focus on domestic policy. The PM will have a big Cabinet reshuffle and is expected to make a string of announcements that benefit new Tory constituencies in the Midlands and North.  nHe won his election victory on a promise of “levelling up” the British economy with greater investment into areas devastated by a decade of Tory austerity.  nBut with tough trade talks and another looming deadline, Brexit isn’t going away, eventhe PM has restricted parliamentary scrutiny of the next phase.   nWill our economy be stronger after Brexit   n  n   nThe full consequences of Brexit are uncertain. Much depends on whether we get a trade deal with the EU. Without one, the UK will “fall out” onto damaging WTO terms.  nEvenMr Johnson manages to strike a Canada-style agreement with the EU, the Treasury’s own forecasts estimate that Britain’s economy would be .% smaller - more than £bn a year - after  years than it would bewe’d stayed in the EU.  nThe Government claims the economy could be boosted by trade deals with other countries - but the long-promised “Brexit idend” looks unlikely. n Inside Boris Johnsonaposs exclusive Brexit bash with English sparkling wine but no champagne   nAnd what about our place on the world stage   nMr Johnson has promised post-Brexit Britain will be an outward-looking global power, building on relationships with old Commonwealth allies and newer “Five Eyes” security partners.  nBy leaving the EU we may have more freedom, but we will also have markedly less clout in a world where the three major global hubs are the US, China and the EU.  n For decades Britain saw itself as a bridge between Europe and the US - but with Brexit and Donald Trump those relationships are under strain. nAnd while we remain a major global economy, our departure from the single market makes us less attractive to many foreign investors.  nIf the UK splinters after Brexit, with Scotland going it alone, it could put at risk its right to a seat on the United Nations Security Council.  nWill I still be able to travel to Europe   n  n   nUK nationals will still be able to live, work and drive in the EU as they do now until the end of the transition. Future travel restrictions will be hammered out over the next  months.  nYou won’t need a visa from  January you’re a tourist. But British citizens will no longer be able to spend more than three months in the EU without applying for a work or study visa.  nYou may also need to show aticket, that you have enough money for your stay, and stop using EU passport lanes at European borders.  nThe UK will bring in its own immigration system to control EU migration from the end of the year - though the Government always had the option of reducing immigration from outside the EU, but chose not to for economic reasons.   nWhatI fall ill on holiday   n \" data-content-type \"picture \" id \"_ea-ee-dc-b-fcdd \" src \"internal: article  \" width \" \"    n   nYou will be able to continue getting treatment in EU hospitals as you do now until the end of the transition period.  nAfter that, the European Health Insurance Card , which gives Brits access to EU healthcare in an emergency, will no longer work.  nThere will not be one EU-wide regime on healthcare so it is up to the UK to strike “reciprocal” health cover with inidual states.  nA pact with Spain - home to , British expats - is likely to be among the first agreed.  nButno deals to look after each others’ citizens are struck, British travellers will require adequate health insurance, while EU migrants here will be charged £ a year to use the NHS.   nWhat will happen to EU citizens   nEU citizens can continue arriving freely in the UK to live and work until  December .

That historic decision back in June  has ided the nation and will be greeted by a mixture of joy, sadness and relief - but also uncertainty. What does our departure actually mean for our economy, our laws and our place on the world stage  How - and when - will the biggest constitutional change in half a century impact on the lives of you and your loved ones Here we take a look at what Brexit means for you:What has changed   Not much. Although this is the legal moment the UK becomes the first nation ever to leave the EU, in practical terms you’ll notice very little dference. That’s because we are in a ‘transition period’ until the end of the year during which the UK will continue to follow EU rules - although we won’t have any say in them as British MEPs have lost their jobs and the UK won’t attend any more summits. It will also keep paying into the EU’s budget. Blue passports stripped of EU branding will start being issued to all new applicants, instead of the old burgundy ones, and m special p coins will enter circulation.  The UK can now formally begin trade talks with other countries, like the US and Australia, so they are ready to kick in at the end of the year. The Government will be hoping for some quick wins so it can show it is making a success of Brexit. A new team within No , headed by the PM’s chief Europe adviser David Frost, will lead the UK’s trade talks with the EU, our biggest trading partner. They’re only expected to get going properly in March after the EU agrees its negotiating “mandate” - and many believe they won’t be finished on time. Can the transition period be extended  The Brexit deal says the transition period can go on for another two years - until the end of . But the government passed a law banning any extension to show how serious it is about leaving. But it can still change its mind right up to the end of June. Beyond that, the  December becomes a hard deadline. We will continue to follow EU rules for the rest of the year and start paying our £bn ‘orce bill’ to the EU which stretch for several years.  The Government hopes so as they were touted as one of the biggest benefits of Brexit, but they have very little time. Any deals with other countries are likely to require controversial trade-offs, such as any agreement with the US over food standards and the NHS. EU officials are sceptical we’ll be able to strike a deal within the year. If we do, there will be a new set of rules from  January . If not, we could crash out on ‘WTO terms’ - the basic rules that slap high tarfs and restrictions on trade. What will Boris Johnson do next  No is desperate to move on from Brexit and to focus on domestic policy. The PM will have a big Cabinet reshuffle and is expected to make a string of announcements that benefit new Tory constituencies in the Midlands and North. He won his election victory on a promise of “levelling up” the British economy with greater investment into areas devastated by a decade of Tory austerity. But with tough trade talks and another looming deadline, Brexit isn’t going away, eventhe PM has restricted parliamentary scrutiny of the next phase.  Will our economy be stronger after Brexit   The full consequences of Brexit are uncertain. Much depends on whether we get a trade deal with the EU. Without one, the UK will “fall out” onto damaging WTO terms. EvenMr Johnson manages to strike a Canada-style agreement with the EU, the Treasury’s own forecasts estimate that Britain’s economy would be .% smaller - more than £bn a year - after  years than it would bewe’d stayed in the EU. The Government claims the economy could be boosted by trade deals with other countries - but the long-promised “Brexit idend” looks unlikely.  And what about our place on the world stage  Mr Johnson has promised post-Brexit Britain will be an outward-looking global power, building on relationships with old Commonwealth allies and newer “Five Eyes” security partners. By leaving the EU we may have more freedom, but we will also have markedly less clout in a world where the three major global hubs are the US, China and the EU.For decades Britain saw itself as a bridge between Europe and the US - but with Brexit and Donald Trump those relationships are under strain.And while we remain a major global economy, our departure from the single market makes us less attractive to many foreign investors. If the UK splinters after Brexit, with Scotland going it alone, it could put at risk its right to a seat on the United Nations Security Council. Will I still be able to travel to Europe   UK nationals will still be able to live, work and drive in the EU as they do now until the end of the transition. Future travel restrictions will be hammered out over the next  months. You won’t need a visa from  January you’re a tourist. But British citizens will no longer be able to spend more than three months in the EU without applying for a work or study visa. You may also need to show aticket, that you have enough money for your stay, and stop using EU passport lanes at European borders. The UK will bring in its own immigration system to control EU migration from the end of the year - though the Government always had the option of reducing immigration from outside the EU, but chose not to for economic reasons.  WhatI fall ill on holiday   You will be able to continue getting treatment in EU hospitals as you do now until the end of the transition period. After that, the European Health Insurance Card , which gives Brits access to EU healthcare in an emergency, will no longer work. There will not be one EU-wide regime on healthcare so it is up to the UK to strike “reciprocal” health cover with inidual states. A pact with Spain - home to , British expats - is likely to be among the first agreed. Butno deals to look after each others’ citizens are struck, British travellers will require adequate health insurance, while EU migrants here will be charged £ a year to use the NHS.  What will happen to EU citizens  EU citizens can continue arriving freely in the UK to live and work until  December . But they must apply by June  for “settled status”, which gives them the right to stay in the UK. Those who haven’t lived in the UK for five continuous years have to apply twice - first for “pre-settled status”, then again for settled status when the hit the five-year mark. After the transition period, new EU migrants will be subject to a points-based immigration system. They will have to prove their skills and probably earn a minimum salary.  Will I still get my workersapos rights  The Government will set its own workers’ rights after the transition with many fearing they will be watered down - or dropped entirely. Currently the EU has limits on night work and requirements for daily and weekly rest breaks. It also sets a -hour limit on the working week while giving employees the right to four weeks’ paid annual leave, plus bank holidays. Some expect anti-age discrimination measures to be removed - meaning there will be little or no protection for younger or older workers. Agency workers could be stripped of their right to equal treatment as permanent staff. Ministers have said they will continue maternity rights but there are no guarantees.  What  changes for me from January    You will no longer be guaranteed free mobile phone roaming in the EU as the issue will be left to operators. Duty free willon flights and boats to the EU. But there are likely to be some checks on lorries and vehicles crossing the Channel that could lead to delays. There will also be new checks on goods crossing between Britain and Northern Ireland under the terms of the Irish backstop. You may also need an international driving permit as well as a ‘green cardapos to prove you have the right car insurance and a GB bumper sticker. Pet owners can carry on bringing their animals to the EU on ‘pet passports’ until December, but after will need to obtain a health certicate. The Supreme Court will be the highest court of appeal in the UK and there will be no direct role for the European Court of Justice in British le.  Is the Union under threat  Boris Johnson has spoken about the “awesome foursome” of England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.But Brexit may be the catalyst which breaks up the country, with nationalist sentiment on the rise in Scotland and a steady march towards a reunied Ireland bolstered by the limited border down the Irish Sea. Wales - which backed Brexit - is more integrated with England than the other “celtic” nations. ButScotland goes it alone and prospers then Wales could want to follow a similar path.

I decided against getting smashed in front of the TV watching Johnson’s Churchillian B-Day speech, although I stuck a tenner on him saying “we’ll kick them off the beaches”. I didn’t get down to the Parliament Square gloat-fest to hear everyone do a Vera Lynn as it looked a bit Eartha Kitt. And I wasn’t invited to the anti-elitist Vote Leave celebration in venture capitalist Jon Moynihan’s £million Cha mansion, so I missed Jacob Rees-Mogg dressed as Prince singing “tonight one’s going to party like it’s ”. I just sat at home, making bonging noises with the cat’s litter tray at pm, thinking of the future. And I decided to embrace it. That’s right. No more Brexit angst from me. No more remoaning. It’s time to move on. So as I wrap myself in my Got Brexit Done tea towel, let me raise a glass of Wetherspoon’s Sparkling White Clfs of Dover wine, and point out all the reasons we have to be cheerful now we’ve left the EU. Homeless beggars will get a boost as half the country refuses to have the new Brexit coin in their pocket and tosses it to them. The epidemic of coffee-fuelled halitosis in workplaces will be wiped out as Eastern European baristas go home and the obesity crisis will be addressed as people refuse to feed their kids President Slander’s ­Chlorinated Fried Chicken.

Brexit found that almost three quarters of Brits believe the UK is ided, with most thinking it is becoming more so. Weve talked to some of the real people affected up and down the landShareCommentsByRos Wynne JonesReal Britain columnistClaire Donnelly:,  JAN Updated:,  JAN NewsCan Remain and Leave voters overcome their dferences  \" to FREE daily email alerts from Mirror - politicsSubscribeWe will use your email address only for sending you newsletters.

For millions more, it’s a moment of sadness and uncertainty as we break ties with our continental neighbours. An exclusive poll for the Daily Mirror found that % of us feel the UK is currently ided. While the figure is down from the % who felt Britain was ided last year, schisms in the country are still very much apparent. So also on Friday we relaunch Britain Talks for . Last summer thousands of Remainers and Brexiteers met to talk about big issues and discover what they had in common – you can see the results at britain-talks.mirror This summer, we plan to repeat the experiment, from Friday June  to Sunday June . We’ve partnered with the Jo Cox Foundation’s Great Get Together, and organised our event on the same weekend for maximum impact. The Foundation is named after murdered MP Jo Cox, who said: “We have far more in common than that which ides us.” As the fourth anniversary of the Brexit vote approaches, Britain Talks feels more important than ever. Deltapoll interviewed , and the results also showed % of us think the UK is continuing to “get more ided”, while just % see change happening the other way.  Asked which three issues most ide our country, the biggest is still Brexit, which % of people see as the greatest ider. This is down from % last year, suggesting the issue is becoming less isive. But other issues are continuing to split the nation – wealth , immigrationand left-right politics . As one of our first ever Britain Talks participants, Jon Conor Lyons says there are new isions growing. “After the general election it did feel people were becoming even more entrenched,” he says. “You saw people saying, ‘ you voted this way, you’re an idiot’.  “And here in the north, where the Tories made gains, there is that danger that we’ll see more ision. If we don’t talk about that and find ways to talk about the choices we’ve made, things will become more entrenched.” Catherine Anderson, CEO of the Jo Cox Foundation, said: “It has never been more important than it is today to get Britain talking again. Today emotions will be running high. Some people feeling fearful about the future post-Brexit, others excited. But we are going to have to come together as a country and sooner rather than later. “Britain Talks will play a huge part in that healing process and we’re delighted that it will again go hand-in-hand with the Great Get Together on June - when we remember Jo Cox’s words that we all have ‘more in common than that which ides us’.” What Britain Talks participants said... Jon Conor Lyons, , Student, Labour councillor and Remainer from Manchester, met Ada Pratt, , Tory Brexiter and retired nurse, from Littleborough, Greater Manchester. Jon said: “I didn’t think Ada and I would get to know each other in the way we have. We’ve found a lot in common and we wouldn’t have done that any other way. “A lot of the toxicity comes from social media, where you’ve taken the human element out, you’re just reducing people down to their politics. You have to move past that and see them as a person. They’re not a monster with dferent views than you. They’re not someone you can just dismiss. “People are more than just their politics but the deep isions in our society can stop us seeing that. “I wasn’t sure what we would have in common but there’s a lot. We’re both engaged with politics and we’re both proactive in our communities. It’s challenged the perceptions I had about meeting an older lady from a town. “I’m so glad I got involved.”  Ada added: “Meeting Jon was interesting because of who he is but also because he’s young. It feels like we’re always getting told that old people have ruined everything. But Jon has given me hope for the future. “He was easy to talk to, and he wasn’t bigoted or judgemental. We found out that we’ve come from quite similar backgrounds, from working class families, so we share values in some ways. “Jon was happy to listen, and it made me realise that young people do have a lot to contribute, a lot to say. It wasn’t just talking, it was seeing how his le is, it made it easier to understand what le is like for a lot of his generation. “Church bells might ring out on  January - but we still have plenty to talk about. We need to find ways to move forward as a nation don’t we ”  Abi Reader, , Dairy farmer, from rural south Wales met Sarah King, , a vegan fashion blogger from Bristol. Abi said: “Sarah and I don’t live that far from each other, but our lives couldn’t be more dferent. Taking part was about seeing the bigger picture - discussing the big issues rather than getting stuck in the usual arguments. I think Sarah and I both looked at things from each other’s perspective. “You don’t just bump into people with completely dferent views to yours, you have to make an effort to find them and be ready to listen. It was a big deal to have Sarah visit my farm, it was a really special thing to do. “One of the biggest things I took from the experience was this feeling of pride. I realised how rich my le was. “I’ve not become a vegan - I have salad with my ham and that’s as far as it goes! But I did enjoy listening and talking through some of the issues.”  Sarah responded: “I would like to stay in touch because it was such a positive experience. It was great to meet someone completely out of my normal circle but open to chat, and Abi was so welcoming. To have that chance to communicate was great. “You do see a lot of confrontation on so called debates on TV - where they pit people against each other but there is no real dialogue. The election has made things worse, it’s closed down conversations. It happened so quickly, there was the sudden sht – I’m that team and you’re this team. “There is still a lot to talk about. As veganism becomes more mainstream it’s on the news agenda more but there are lots of tensions within the vegan community, especially around class and race and it would be good to discuss some of these things too. It was interesting to speak to someone who is an authority in their field.” Bob Roberts, , fisherman and business owner, Scarborough, Yorkshire met Razan Alsous, , Syrian refugee and business owner, Huddersfield, West Yorkshire. Bob said:: “Meeting Razan certainly made me think - when she explained her story you can’t help but think about why people make a journey like that, what brings people who really are in need of help to the UK. There still has to be a balance but on a human level, talking to Razan you can completely understand why you would flee and how hard it is to start again. “It’s very dferent talking face to face, being with someone. You can’t just dismiss someone’s experiences when they’re sitting there with you. “You’re two humans sitting together, not just two lots of ideas. And you can’t write off someone’s views when you’re sat having a cup of tea. “Meeting Razan confirmed some of my views and gave me a chance to think about some others. I’m still a big believer that immigration policies have to be strengthened. “Brexit is such a dficult issue and for me there are particular ideas we’ve got to discuss. We’ve got a very signicant coastline, that will be right at the forefront of negotiations, and we’ve got to be ready for that.”  Razan said: “Britain Talks was a really good experience for me. I don’t always get to meet people I can talk to about politics, people who might have a dferent idea to me, so meeting Bob was really important. “It was good to hear someone’s real views - someone being honest and direct - instead of just general views, I was getting to hear about things from a new angle. “Talking can help you think about how you see things and also to make decisions - to think more about how you want to do things. Are you deciding for yourself or for others  “Having these debates has to be better for society. And I hope it presented a more positive story about who refugees are to the media. As refugees we aren’t always good at doing that. There’s a lot of bad feeling towards immigrants and refugees and we need to talk about that and where it comes from. “There’s no problem with being dferent or having a dferent point of view than anyone ,we can talk to each other with respect,we can sit down and really listen to each other. “There is a lot we don’t know about each other’s le and we need to find out more so we can find out how we can live together. Because the world is changing, we’ve got to change the model of how we live together and understanding has got to be part of that. “Bob was so nice and respectful, and we did have more in common than we think. Deep down we both want the same things, like most people do.” Stevie Sinclair, , Rangers superfan and thalidomide campaigner met Stephen McBride, , Celtic fan and publican in Glasgow. Stevie said: “It was very worthwhile for me. Yes, we do have a rivalry through football but being a similar age, from a similar generation, we were able to share a lot of football memories too. Steve was very knowledgable, so it was easy to spend time with him. “It’s not every day you’ll see a Celtic and Rangers fan taking a drink together but it was good, we had a lot to talk about and I’m really glad I got the chance to do that. “There is ision everywhere - whether it’s football or the politics, we all have our traditions and views. We need to talk about politics and these things between ourselves, to work out how we make sense of things without things getting silly. “We need to keep talking and meeting - not just talking on social media. You see friends falling out on there. We should be able to share our opinions, embracing things that are dferent, chatting more to more people to find out what people really think, rather than just assuming we know. “Meeting in real le means you can stop things getting heated, have a laugh - humour goes a long way.” "},{"url":null,"title":"first job loss brexit confirmed","story":"w.mantis  First job loss of Brexit confirmed at exact moment Britain left the EU n Steve Baker, the former Brexit Secretary, is the first man to lose his job over Brexit.

Jubilant Leavers began arriving from mid-morning, singing “Rule Britannia” beneath Winston Churchill’s statue. Some were wrapped in Union flags or dressed in suits made up of the British emblem as they chanted: “What do we want  Brexit! When do we want it  Now!” Clare Fawcett, , a personal assistant from Southampton, said: “It’s bloody amazing, this is the most excited I have ever felt in my le. “I have never looked forward to something as much as this, ever.“There were times I thought it wouldn’t happen and democracy would die. But today, democracy is being delivered. “It makes me very proud to be British.” Clare admitted Brexit was “a leap into the unknown”, but added: “I’m confident the great British people will make this a success.” Demonstrators held placards bearing anti-EU messages including “EU no more”, “Independence Day”, “Lock up the traitors” and “Let’s go WTO” in a reference to the UK reverting to World Trade Organisation rules.Ten Union flags raised by officials fluttered in the breeze, while protesters also waved American flags and chanted “USA! USA!” and “Bye bye, EU”. Foreign TV crews watched in bemusement, while police stood by to prevent trouble flaring. Businessman Jeff Wyatt, , dressed as a crusader and came to Westminster from Milton Keynes, Bucks, to mark Brexit Day. He said of his costume: “It’s purely patriotic symbolism. I’m proud of England and Britain.“I’m not feeling excited, I’m feeling like we are at the end of the beginning. “We have had three-and-a-half years of the Westminster class trying to thwart the decision of the British public. “But we are leaving the tyranny of the EU. This is going to the start of the toppling of the EU. “It’s great to among a big group of Leavers, but the fight definitely isn’t over.”  Retired schoolteacher Andrew Bullock, , said: “It’s a great atmosphere, I’ve been looking forward to happening for months and months. “I thought it was going to happen in March, then in October, but the day has finally arrived. “Lots of people did everything they could to try and stop it. “I knew we would get there eventually but it took a long time coming.”  Banners and supporters for far-right groups were also visible in Parliament Square - with members of the Football Lads Alliance and anti-Islamic political party For Britain joining the celebrations.Despite being just hours from getting what they wanted, namely Brexit, a number of the people in the square were not joyous.Mike, , from Bolton, told the Mirror he was happy Brexit was done but there were still too many foreigners in the country and pedophiles MPs in Parliament."},{"url":null,"title":"theresa rakes 400000 speeches after","story":"w.mantis  Theresa May rakes in £, for speeches after stepping down as PM over Brexit n David Cameron also netted £,

couple stranded in Mexico after flight home erted due to fight on boardEXCLUSIVE: Rachael and Mark Pocock are furious at TUI for sending no information to them for hours while stranded in Mexico

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailA British couple are stranded in Mexico with their two-year-old child back at home - after their flight was erted when a passenger was arrested. Rachael and Mark Pocock were due to fly back from San Jose Del Cabo yesterday but claim the bus arranged to collect them from their hotel at midday never arrived. They claim they received no word from flight operator TUI for three hours, with their flight scheduled at .pm. The couple, and the eight others waiting for the transport, turned to Google and found that their flight, coming in from Gatwick, had had to land in Winnipeg Airport in Canada.The airport authority has confirmed a man was taken away by police on Thursday after Flight BY had to land there at .am local time. Manitoba RCMP said they were called to the scene due to an unruly passenger - with a fight understood to have broken out in the air - and as a result, the flight due to pick up Rachael and Mark never arrived. The Pococks are desperate to get home to their baby Amelie while Rachael, , had also organised a surprise th party for her husband with family flying in from the US and is very concerned we wonapost get to it. The couple, from just outside Nottingham, have been rehoused in a room at hotel Sandos Finesterra with a couple of strangers as they wait to come home.  Weaposre making the best of it, but we heard nothing at all from TUI for hours - itaposs disgraceful. Itaposs hot and everyoneaposs very anxious. Hopefully a bus will collect us tomorrow, said Rachael. Itaposs all quite distressing when itaposs supposed to be a luxury holiday - weaposve got our two year old at home with our parents. Thataposs our main concern is getting home. Referring to the two women who they are sharing with she said: We donapost know them and they donapost know us. We are not complaining about the hotel because the staff have been brilliant. But TUI should be ashamed. She became concerned because she understands there are very few international flights from Cabo. She claims the holiday already got pushed back at the last minute by TUI, as they were originally due to come home on January  giving them several days before the surprise party in Cambridge, where Mark is from. When their bus did not arrive this morning, Rachael and Mark, who are the only Brits staying at the hotel, began to panic with their flight leaving in a few hours.  The hotel did not know what was going on, she claimed. Itaposs so hot and everyoneaposs sat around in their best clothes not knowing whataposs going on. Rachael eventually got an automated text message from TUI around pm which confirmed their fears that the plane was delayed until the following day due to an incident on the board the flight, causing it to ert. It explained that they would be able to stay an extra night at the hotel, with the flight now due to leave at pm on Friday. Rachael then emailed the TUI holiday rep who did not respond until around pm, apologising for the delay. We’ve been working throughout the day to ensure that everyone has rooms for the night and I thank you for your patience, the rep said. I was in touch with the hotel director and her team throughout the day and hopefully they relayed my messages to you to keep you informed. There was a major incident with a guest onboard the LGW flight today which resulted in the flight being erted to Canada. It was originally scheduled to arrive back in Mexico this afternoon but at the last minute was delayed further and will now be arriving tomorrow around am.

Shoppers had rushed to stock up on the anti-bacterial spray after labels claimed the product could kill the human coronavirus - but scientists have warned that it has no evidence.Amazed shoppers claimed they aposhave found a cureapos of the deadly Wuhan virus as they shared images of the cleaning agent on Twitter.The label at the back of the bottle shows: Dettol Anti-Bacterial Surface Cleanser is proven to kill viruses: Influenza - Type A HN, Human Coronavirus and RSV. Some were shocked to the finding as one said: How did they know this before the outbreak   But experts explained that the term aposcoronavirusapos can be attributed to a group of RNA viruses and the recent outbreak is being referred as the Wuhan-strain, according to Plymouth Live.Dr Jonathan Stoye, head of ision of virology, The Francis Crick Institute, states the common cold can also fall under the Coronavirus category, which is most likely what the Dettol labels are referring to, not the fatal Wuhan strain. So perhaps is not the time to start loading up fast on cheap domestic sprays at the supermarket - Dettol in particular.  “It should be made clear that the Wuhan virus is only one of many types of human coronavirus – another is associated with many common colds, Dr Stoye said. Presumably, the cold virus has been tested for sensitivity to Dettol.” Professor Jonathon Ball, professor of molecular virology, University of Nottingham said: “There are lots of viruses, coronaviruses included, that contain an outer layer made of oils – or lipids to give them their correct term – and this layer is sensitive to the actions of lots of commonly used disinfectants, including soap.  “Whilst these disinfectants would not have been tested directly against the novel coronavirus, the virus will have the same kind of lipids in their outer surface, which can be removed by commonly used disinfectants and soaps. “This is well known and not new.”An expert in disease control at Exeter University said that the coronavirus outbreak should be a matter of concern but not worry or panic for people in the South West. Dr Bharat Pankhania said at all times, not only during outbreaks, good hand hygiene went a long way towards control and reduction in person-to-person spread of infections. “I often observe people in public toilets not washing their hands or not washing and drying them properly. It is no wonder that we have outbreaks,” said Dr Pankhania, a senior clinical lecturer at the University of Exeter’s College of Medicine and Health. The virus, reportedly first spread in Wuhan of central China, has killed  people and infected over , people globally.

Eight weeks went by of the exact same behaviour of Bea headbutting me in the chest and snfing that specic area until one day I felt a lump in one of my breasts. I went to the doctors to have it examined and so they analysed it and carried out a mammogram and then confirmed to me that it was a fast-growing form of breast cancer and it had started spreading to my lymph nodes. Linda, from Bargoed, south Wales, has undergone successful treatment. She has since been extremely grateful for her dogsapos behaviour. I started chemotherapy and throughout that time Bea and Enya continued with their behaviour until after my third session of chemo when they both completely stopped all of a sudden, she said.  I had six months of chemotherapy and then had an operation to remove the lump followed by a month of radiotherapy. After the lump had been removed it was analysed which revealed that the chemotherapy had actually killed the cancer cells. I remembered the moment Bea and Enya had stopped snfing me and wonderedthat had been the exact moment the chemotherapy had been successful at tackling the cancerous cells in the lump. During one of the appointments with my doctor I explained what Bea and Enya had been doing and the story spread throughout the whole hospital. My doctor was amazed and told me that I should go home and thank my dogs because they had saved my le. As their behaviour had made me keep checking for lumps my cancer was caught in its very first stages which means we were able to successfully tackle it – my doctor even said it was one of the best cases they had ever seen and treated.  It is well known pets, particularly dogs, have heightened senses hundreds of times better than those of humans. This makes them ideal to be trained as assistance and medical detection pets so they can alert owners with health conditions of any serious impending medical event. Research is also currently being undertaken to seedogs can detect diseases, such as cancer, through smell. Linda shared her story with her vet Jordi Colas, owner and veterinary surgeon at VetsPets, Caerphilly, south Wales, during a check-up for one of her other German shepherds. Jordi said: When Linda told me her story I was absolutely amazed but I wasn’t too surprised. A dog’s sense of smell is millions of times better than our own and so they are able to detect every single inidual aspect and tiny odour concentrations of a certain smell.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailAs a newly qualied GP looking for his first post, Dr Amir Hannan thought the cosy little surgery advertised simply as ‘ Market Street, Cheshire’ looked perfect. It was only when he phoned and asked where to send his application that his we realised who used to run the practice. The rookie doctor was stepping into the shoes of Dr Death. It was the surgery in Hyde run by Harold Shipman who murdered around  of his patients, making him the most prolic serial killer in history. The old mill town, seven miles from Manchester, was devastated by the evil doctor’s crimes. He worked and killed there from  until he was caught in , and every resident knew someone whose le had been cruelly cut short by Shipman. It was on January ,  –  years ago today, that he was convicted and jailed for le for murdering  of his patients. Dr Hannan arrived in Hyde nine months later, and was soon all too well aware of what he was letting himself in for. He says: “The day before I started, my we and I were watching TV and it came on the news – they were in  Market Street in Hyde and there were a whole load of elderly men and women all sat on the floor of the waiting room. They were angry, protesting that a new doctor was going to be foisted upon them. I just thought, ‘Oh my God – I am walking into a war zone’. “That gave me my first taste of what was going to come. I arrived to find that Shipman’s we had turned up the night before and taken the computer system away because it had been owned by Shipman.” Giving his new premises a thorough examination, like any good doctor, it was Dr Hannan’s heart which suddenly skipped a beat when he stumbled across the couch on which Shipman had murdered a number of his patients. He says: “There was a side room off the surgery that had the couch in it. He had put the patients in there, murdered them, shut the door and then carried on his consultations and nobody knew. So there I am on day one, I have no computer, and that couch had to go immediately.” Shipman hid in plain sight, murdering mostly elderly female patients. His killing method was injecting diamorphine, a pharmaceutical heroin. Born in Nottingham in , as a boy he was very close to his domineering mother Vera. Chillingly given his subsequent killing spree, he was fascinated by how morphine eased Vera’s pain when she was dying from lung cancer.  His mother died aged just  when Shipman was . Determined to become a doctor, he graduated from Leeds School of Medicine in , four years after marrying Primrose Oxtoby, with whom he would have four children. After finishing his training, he joined a practice in Todmorden, West Yorks. Shipman’s career almost came to an abrupt and early halt. He became addicted to the painkiller Pethidine and was caught forging prescriptions. He left the practice and entered drug rehab, hit with a fine and a conviction for forgery. But the General Medical Council decided no further action should be taken, as did the Home Office. Shipman was free toto the profession and in  secured a post at the Donneybrook practice in Hyde. He became known as a hardworking, honest GP and in , after more than a decade at Donneybrook, set out on his own, starting up the practice in Market Street.  He was followed by devoted patients, many of whom would later refuse to believe the man they thought of as a pillar of the community was an angel of death.  It was March  when it became apparent Shipman’s elderly patients were dying at a higher rate than expected and in very similar circumstances – usually fully clothed, sitting up in an armchair or reclining on a settee. Despite respected members of the community – a funeral director, a taxi driver and another GP, becoming suspicious, a preliminary police investigation said there was no cause for concern. Shipman’s records appeared to be in order and little wonder, for the doctor had carefully falsied them.  In the end the family GP would finally be snared by his own greed. In June ,  year-old former mayoress of Hyde Kathleen Grundy was discovered dead hours after Shipman visited, leaving relatives perplexed as she had appeared to be in good health. They were further alarmed when they discovered her will had been changed, leaving her whole estate, worth £,, to Shipman. The doctor insisted no autopsy was necessary but Kathleen’s daughter Angela Woodruff refused to accept Dr Shipman’s explanations. Her mother’s body was exhumed and a postmortem revealed she died from a morphine overdose administered within three hours of her death.  Matching the time frame in which Shipman had visited her, the doctor’s home was searched and medical records, a strange collection of jewellery and the typewriter used to forge the will were uncovered. Police soon learned the calculating killer had urged many families to get their loved ones cremated to hide his crimes, produced falsied medical notes when questions were raised – and even pretended to call the emergency services in front of relatives only to “cancel” the ambulance after he pronounced the patient dead. Shipman went on trial at Preston crown court charged with  counts of murder and one count of forgery and was found guilty on all charges.  The disgraced doctor was given a whole le sentence and four years later, he hung himself at Wakefield Prison, aged . He remains the only British doctor ever to be found guilty of murdering his patients. The subsequent Shipman Inquiry looked into how he had got away with killing for so long, and why he had done it. But in the end its chair Dame Janet Smith said: “I think Shipman’s crimes were without motive. “The psychiatrists warn me that it is possible that, in Shipman’s own mind, there was a conscious motivation. All I can say is that there is no evidence of any of the features that I have observed, in my experience as a judge, that motivate murderers.”  What is clear is that Shipman’s killing spree shattered trust among his patients in Hyde – which Dr Hannan has been rebuilding. The -year-old GP says: “When the story first broke it was complete disbelief. People said no, you go to your doctor for him to help you, not for him to murder you. “This is a deprived area. People here die  years earlier than the national average which is one of the reasons nobody picked up on the excess deaths. It was almost, what do you expect  You live in Hyde. “It might not be talked about on the news any more, but it is still very vivid in people’s minds and it causes distress and mental health problems. I am still dealing with the fallout of Shipman to this very day. It doesn’t go away.” Ingrid Brindle was one of Shipman’s patients. “I thought he was an excellent doctor because I had a long-term medical condition and he gave me everything I needed,” she says. “I really thought he was excellent and so did a lot of other people.” It was important for Dr Hannan to regain the trust of his patients. It was one simple act which changed everything. He said: “I remember about three years into the job I was talking to a patient during a consultation and just turned my computer screen round so they could see what I was typing. As I turned that screen around there was a flicker of a smile I had never seen before.” From then on Dr Hannan, who has moved to the new Haughton Thornley Medical Centre in the town, gave every patient access to their medical records, and ensured that they understood them. He says: “It’s possible Shipman convinced his victims, ‘Well, you’ve got heart disease so that is why I am giving you this morphine’. And they just went along with it, because why would you question a doctor ” "},{"url":null,"title":"half items bought sales waste","story":"w.mantis  Half of items bought in sales are waste of money -

For this reason more than a quarter actively avoid sales, the study of , adults by gfgaff found. A third said they stay away from the January sales and  per cent tend to shun Black Friday.  However, grabbing a bargain is still very much a source of joy for those polled - nine in  said they aposloveapos picking up a good deal. For  per cent, finding that piece of treasure is a badge of honour - they will happily boast to friends, family and colleagues about their special purchase. A fth take bargain hunting so seriously they will even adopt strategies when shopping in the sales - including planning purchases in advance and getting to the store before it opens. They will also seek out refurbished or second-hand items - in fact, a quarter think shopping second-hand or for refurbished items is a more effective money saver than the sales.  A spokesperson for gfgaff said: Shopping for refurbished items in particular is a great way of getting more bang for your buck. You get what is effectively a new item but at a cheaper price - so when consumers say shopping for refurbished items is a better method for saving money, they certainly have a point. The study also found half of consumers are aposapprehensiveapos about discounts amid concerns theyaposre not getting a good deal. Six in  said busy crowds are one of the biggest downsides about shopping for a bargain, while almost a quarter think sales require apostoo muchapos effort. In fact,  per cent even went as far as to describe shopping in the sales as aposstressfulapos, according to the OnePoll research. But for more than a fth the biggest drawback is getting carried away and spending too much money. Yet just  per cent of purchases are ed to the shop they bought them from.

The nine-year-old was reported missing by her mum Karen Matthews almost  years ago in February , sparking the biggest manhunt since the search for the Yorkshire Ripper. While detectives feared she had been kidnapped and desperately appealed for information about her whereabouts, Shannon was in fact cooped up in a bedroom less than a mile from her Dewsbury home. After a harrowing  days, she was found at the home of Michael Donovan - uncle of Matthewsapos then-partner Craig Meehan. When the missing child was discovered, police also found a note revealing how Shannon - who was lured away by the promise she was being taken to the seaside - was expected to occupy herself during the days she was missing. The list of rules warned her that she must stay hidden - even limiting how loud she could turn up the TV. The heartbreaking note reads: Rules. You must not make any noise or bang your feet. You must not go near the windows. You must not get anything or do anything without me been here .  Keep the TV volumeonly up to  or lower. You can play the Super Mario games and you can play some DVDs and you can play the CD music. It is signed off with the initials I.P.U - which is thought to stand for aposI promise youapos - a threat Matthews used against Shannon, who has since been given a new identity. The scruffy bedroom containing cheap wooden furniture was the former sleeping area for Donovanaposs two daughters who were taken into care before the kidnap. An electronic keyboard and, bizarrely, a glue gun were found on top of a metal framed double bunk.  Underneath there is a CD by Busted, one of Shannonaposs favourite bands, and a leaflet giving details of a range of Sold Out action PC games. Near a smoke alarm case there is a copy of Arrive Alive, a colourful highway code book for youngsters. Matthews, , had hoped to cash in on a £, reward for her daughter, but was jailed in  when her plot was foiled. Police described Matthews as “pure evil” after she was found guilty of kidnap,  ­imprisonment and perverting the course of justice. She and Donovan were both sentenced to eight years in prison and released in  after serving half their terms.  The disgraced mum is reportedly now engaged to convicted child abuser Paul Saunders, . The paedophile, from Blackbird Leys, Oxford, was jailed for five years for abusing a vulnerable girl over a period of three years but is now back walking the streets.  Saunders preyed upon his victim when he was working as a driver taking the elderly to hospital and disabled teenagers to college. He admitted engaging in sexual activity with a child, making indecent images of a child and two counts of sexual assault between  and  when his victim was aged between  and .

At pm last night we waved goodbye to our -year membership of the EU. Many will embark on this uncertain journey with optimism, others with trepidation, but everyone realises this is a decisive moment. The immediate task is to secure a new trade deal with the European Union which protects jobs and business. There must be no undermining of environmental and consumer protections or chipping away at hard-won workers’ rights. We also need to strike new trade agreements with dozens of other countries including the United States, Australia, India and Japan. In this instance no-deal would be better than a bad dealit meant giving US firms access to the NHS or allowed America to export its chlorinated chicken and hormone-pumped beef to these shores. Having “taken back control”, Boris Johnson’s Government must build a fairer Britain which spreads wealth more evenly and leaves no area of Britain behind. The “levelling up” he promises would not be necessarythe Conservatives had not waged a war of austerity which has hollowed out communities and starved vital services. Mr Johnson claims this is a moment to improve lives in every corner of the UK. The Mirror will be watching to make sure the Prime Minister makes good on his word.  Trust the NHS THE coronavirus came to our shores yesterday with the confirmation that two people have tested positive for the ­potentially deadly virus.

But the bite speed was low, suggesting it was also a scavenger.”  nThe beast’s skull is similar to that of T-Rex, which came almost  million years later.  nDr Muller, a biologist at Brazil’s Federal University of Santa Maria, added: “During the late Triassic, while the first dinosaurs were fighting over small prey, dynamosuchus collisensis was probably searching for carcasses or easy to catch animals, like today’s vultures and hyenas do.  n  n“Some palaeontologists say T-Rex did the same.

The boyaposs grandmother was handed nine years in prison for the -month-oldaposs death by a Russian court. The court heard horric evidence that little Maxim Sagalakov’s crying had annoyed drunk grandma Zhanna Miyagasheva, , and she aposstarted to suffocate the boy until he was silentapos. Her husband Alexander Miyagashev, , then took the helpless boy and placed him in the burning stove of the familyaposs house in Kharoy village in Khakassia region. Their daughter Viktoria Sagalakova, , ed to find the child’s charred remains in the stove. Senior prosecutor Maxim Rodionov told the court forensic analysis aposreliably established that the death of the child occurred precisely because of the actions of Alexander Miyagashev, since he placed him in the furnace and burned the boyapos. The child died aposfrom  per cent burns to the bodyapos and exposure to carbon monoxide poisoning. Sentencing the couple, judge Viktor Galimov said: The forensic expert explained that before being placed in the stove the child had a heartbeat. “He was breathing, with a normal body temperature. “That is, there were signs of le.  The court heard that the grandfather had burned alive puppies and a cat.

Alexander denied putting the baby in the stove and told the judge: Your Honour, I did not kill. She killed. “I smoked, went to sleep, then ent to the toilet. She told me: ‘I killed our grandson’.” Neighbour Evgeniy Borgoyakov told Russian television the grandfather had “turned mad from alcohol”. He said: “We hear he pushed the baby into the wood-burning stove. “That was it.”  Other neighbours said that the couple often looked after the child and previously took good care of him. The mother who was in court said she could not believe her parents had killed her child. Reports said she planned to appeal the sentence.

There is no suggestion that I personally falsied this email.“The suggestion is that I forwarded the email after it had been falsied by someone .“I refute the allegations made against me and I can confirm I will be appealing against my removal from my post.Mr Christie also said he felt that the penalty seemed to be “disproportionate” to the accusations made against him.“No other allegations have been made against me,” he said.“I have worked in my current role for  years and have had an association with the council for  years.“I continue to have a huge respect for my council colleagues, council officers and elected members.“This is a very unfortunate time for me and I will need to take time to look at things moving forward.“I don’t wish to say anything further at this stage but will be making my intentions clear in due course.”Blue Parrot had provided sound equipment for DSMT for previous shows.DSMT producer and manager Lina Waghorn said: “I am shocked and saddened that Kenny Christie is no longer working with the council.“He was a great asset to DSMT and an inspirational teacher.”It’s understood students at DSMT were informed on Sunday January  that Mr Christie was “moving on to new projects”.It was made clear to students he was not ing and that Kris Mordente, a St John’s Academy teacher, would be taking over director permanently.A source at DSMT said: “It’s just a bit strange that he’s gone. Kenny was DSMT and DSMT was Kenny. I don’t think anyone knows how we’re going to operate without him.“He had been growing distant for a while, we have only seen him three times since August and at one point Lina mentioned bringing in an assistant director.“It’s not something we’d expect, I think everyone here including Lina would be reluctant to let him go.”A Blue Parrot spokesman said the company was not awarded the DSMT contract because “strictly speaking, we did not meet the deadline.”A Dundee City Council spokesman said: “We do not comment on inidual personnel matters.”Kenny Christie has been described as one of the most “sought-after” musical theatre directors in the country.He has worked with DSMT for over  years, producing several musicals like Les Miserables and Annie.His directing career began at the age of , producing a one-act play as part of the SCDA drama festival.In , Mr Christie became the world record holder for the fastest theatrical production, taking one piece from book to stage in just . hours.He has also taught and organised dance workshops ,in Dundee and Perth, and has worked with Dundee City Council to organise dance activities for school pupils.Mr Christie has also held the title of chairman of the Heads of Instrumental Teaching Scotland, as well as being the first Youth Adviser for Scotland for the National Operatic and Dramatic Association.Kenny Christie’s sacking comes in the wake of a separate fraud scandal that has rocked Dundee City Council in the past year.In October, the council’s head of construction Mark Ross quit in the midst of an investigation into claims he was treated to a golfing trip on the Spanish coast by bosses of a firm awarded an £ million local authority contract.The £.m deal to provide heat and smoke and carbon monoxide detectors was awarded to Edmundson Electrical without going out to tender.The trip to Spain took place weeks after the contract was awarded and included Mr Ross, a senior Edmundson staff member, another council employee and representatives of two other firms.It was later revealed that the second council employee was Kenny Muir, who also worked in the council’s construction department.He was sacked from his role earlier this month.Mr Muir is the fourth senior employee to leave construction services since September, following the resignations of Mr Ross and electrical supervisor Iain Gardyne, who is accused of selling thousands of pounds’ worth of council smoke alarms online."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2020/01/DNic_John_Wilkie_Spiders_Snake-15.jpg ","title":"forfars very own spider man unveils creepy crawly collection including 36 spiders","story":"While living with dozens of spiders, scorpions and massive snakes may seem like a living nightmare for some people, it#s all in a day#s work for one local animal enthusiast.Delivery driver John Wilkie has been keeping snakes and lizards since he was in school, and five years ago he fell in love with keeping spiders as pets.The father of two now has a collection of more than  arachnids, including ins tarantulas, which he keeps in a small annex outside of his cottage in Forfar.He said: #I started seeing my friends posting pictures of their tarantulas online five years ago, and I was just stunned by some of the colours.#I decided to go for it myself and bought my first tarantula.#It#s just something a bit dferent and interesting.

That’s being kind. The rest, including myself, haven’t been good enough.”That’s the brutal assessment of Dundee’s season from experienced midfielder Paul McGowan.The Dark Blues are in doubt of even achieving a play-off place in the Championship after picking up just eight points from their last nine league fixtures.In that time, rivals and league leaders Dundee United have raced away at the top of the ision and sit a massive  points ahead of the Dens Park club.As the campaign heads into the business end, Dundee are searching for a spark to finally ignite their season.And McGowan insists that has to come tomorrow when they head to Morton.He told the Tele: “It’s been really disappointing recently, we’ve not been good enough.“People have a go at us for saying the same stuff but it really hasn’t been good enough.“You can see we are lacking in confidence, we are gting teams goals and not scoring.“We need to get back to basics, get back to being hard to beat and stop gting teams goals, giving head-starts and then get a run going.“Our confidence isn’t high at the moment after the results we’ve had.“We need that one result to turn it in the other direction.“We’ve found ourselves in a sticky moment but we need to start dominating games and asserting ourselves.“I’m bored even saying these things, it’s getting so old.“We have to speak to the press and say what we have to say but we need to start doing it on the pitch.“As a squad we are not doing enough.“Probably only two, maybe three players can look in the mirror and say they have done enough.“That’s being kind.“The rest, including myself, have not been good enough.“What can you say  It’s not been great.“We are letting ourselves down, letting the manager down and letting the fans down.“That’s the way it has went but we still have a chance to get up through the play-offs.“That’s the best way, we’ll keep going in the league but United are too far in front, I won’t lie about that.“We need to start playing and winning games.”Cappielow is by no means the easiest place to turn your form around.David Hopkin’s Ton have picked up  points from their last five Championship matches and were minutes away from beating Dundee United at Tannadice last weekend.And Dundee’s last trip to Greenock should serve as a big reminder of the dangers they pose. vw, px\"  Peter Grant’s header just before half-time was enough for the Greenock side to seal a - victory back in September.“The last game down there, there was nothing in it. We gave away a silly free-kick and they scored from that and held out,” added McGowan.“They make things hard, go very direct and make it a horrible game. Credit to them, they have picked up some good results and nearly beat United at Tannadice last week.“We know what to expect and we have to be up for it.“That’s what they do, they go a goal up and make it hard, work their socks off all over the pitch and have players that can hurt you.“It will be a hard game at Cappielow so we’ll have to be at our best to get anything.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/09/DNic_Taw_Teams_Podcast-7-846x564.jpg ","title":"united enforcer calum butcher urges winning run to seal promotion","story":"It’s in our hands, now let’s go get the title.That’s the message from Dundee United midfielder Calum Butcher.The Terrors welcome Arbroath to Tannadice tomorrow, sitting  points clear at the top of the Championship table.It looks a case of when notUnited will seal the deal and end their four-year absence from the Premiership.With glory so tantalisingly close with only  games remaining, Butcher is keen for United to kick on and wrap things up as soon as possible.Despite already smashing their targets until this point, the best way to do that, according to the -year-old, is get back to winning ways after a cup exit at the hands of Hibs and a draw with Morton in the past week.“We split the quarters and we knew at the start of the season to achieve promotion what kind of targets we needed to hit,” he said.“On the run we’re on we have exceeded that a little bit but we know there’s  games left and we have to win the majority of those to make sure we go up.“It’s in our hands and we know,we go out and perform like we can, we’ll do that.“I don’t think there’s any complacency, no one has got above their station and everyone is working for the team.“For us to achieve promotion, we need to stick together. There’ll be dips along the way, like Tuesday night, but we need to bounce back tomorrow.”First up for United is the challenge of Dick Campbell’s Red Lichties tomorrow afternoon.The teams have played out two tight games this season with United coming out on top by one goal on both occasions.However, a scrap wouldn’t bother Butch, so long as they pick up those all important three points.“They’re a dficult side to play against as we’ve seen, home and away,” he added.“It was tough at their place because of the conditions but the onus will be on us at home. It’s a dferent game.“Last week was dficult against Morton. They had something to hold on to but we did really well to come back into the game in the last minute.“It was a big point for us.“It was, obviously, very disappointing to go out on Tuesday night but, ultimately, it’s about the league and promotion.“It was a strange feeling to lose on Tuesday after such a long period without losing a game, so that’s something we’ve got to deal with. I think, personally and for the boys in the dressing-room, we were looking forward to tomorrow straight away just to get back out there and win a game again.“We’ve dusted ourselves off and we’re ready to go tomorrow.”A lot has been made of the rumours surrounding Lawrence Shankland’s future at the Tangerines as the January transfer window gets set to slam shut at midnight.However, Butcher insists the noise around their star man has had little affect on Shanks or the squad.“Lawrence is a great guy and since he’s come here, from day one, he’s got on with it.“He knew that he had to score goals and he’s done that. He’s been absolutely fantastic for us.“He deals with everything great.

All have end-stage organ failure, be it kidney, liver, lung or heart, and require a le-saving transplant.Organs for transplant usually come from bodies of people who agreed to donate before death. But as this does not produce enough organs, both Scotland and England plan to bring in an #opt out# system, meaning that on death a person#s agreement to organ donation is assumed unless they had actively opted out.Live donation is an alternative to awaiting a cadaveric organ. As people can live happily with one kidney or half a liver, family members or altruistic iniduals sometimes offer to donate these organs. Since matching donor and recipient tissue-type, however, is generally required these donations are not always acceptable.Now groups of tissue-type incompatible donor recipient pairs are getting together to mix and match, producing duos who are tissue-type-compatible. So let#s say Annie is rejected as a kidney donor for her sister Jean for incompatibility reasons, and similarly, Arthur is rejected as kidney donor for Jim. But pairing donor Annie with recipient Jim and Arthur with Jean could lead to two successful transplants. A recent report from the US describes the first ever bi-organ exchange involving a liver-kidney swap * .In this specic case a daughter wished to donate a kidney to her mother with renal failure but was rejected because she might later develop the same kidney problem. So she offered half of her liver in exchange for a kidney for her mother. Another donor was eventually identied who wanted to donate half her liver to her sister with liver failure but was rejected because her liver was too small. But she was cleared for kidney donation. So on the day of the swap four operations took place and two needy people received le-giving new organs.Although not presently being considered in the UK, with the ethical issues sorted, this multi-swap procedure opens the way for extended chains of donors and many more lives saved.*Torres et al Am J transplant. :-."},{"url":null,"title":"tarbert club on target for 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe first competition of the new year at Tarbert Gun Club also served as the January leg of the club#s winter league.A full house of  teams turned out on Sunday January , and the early shooters had to put up eith windy conditions which made the clays dance.

Nearly three years later I fear the dream is still a long way from that reality.Mid Argyll Youth Development Servicescertainly seems to have ambitious plans for an indoor skate park and this is to be lauded, however a quick look online will show an apparent apathy with regard to moving forward with the project. A young man created the #Lochgilphead Skate Park Association# on Facebook in , yet a final post in  indicated how little the proposal had moved forward. If the project needs more money to actually get it built we need to know how much, so that appropriate funding can be sought.What is causing the project to take years to come to fruition The potential for help by the £ million Tarbert and Lochgilphead Regeneration Fund in  was dashed when councillors instead decided that improvements to road junctions, streets, a cycle track and indoor bowling were more important, and allocated a staggering £, to feasibility studies for these projects alone, this is before any work is actually done, you understand.That is a great deal of money for feasibility studies and design works.Let us be realistic # in nine long years the community has gone from the initial excited buzz about a skate park to finally managing to purchase a plot of land upon which to build it in early . From there it seems the project has not been able to move.In the meantime the youngsters who worked so hard to give momentum to the project appear to have given up hope and are now probably giving thought to employment prospects rather than having fun.It is a sad state of affairs.But rather than giving up hope, let us reignite this campaign for our children to have the dream of a skate park in Lochgilphead whilst they are still young enough to enjoy it.Nick MacIneskar, TayvallichSir,With regard to your story in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser #Inveraray seawall in need of attention#, would it be possible to contact BEAR Scotland and ask themthey could also create an access point to the shore Possibly at the bus stop at Barn Brae.

What I fear is that instead of addressing the issues which are negative to iniduals and society, legislators believing that by extending what are regarded as crimes changes society for the better. Their belief is wrong.We know that parking on pavements is wrong #upskirting# is horrying smoking in a car in which they are children is unacceptable dropping litter is shameful driving through a red light is dangerous.What we need is the range of social and cultural influences that help us feel that we should behave in a positive way. In the s, s and s the majority of people regularly attended churches and religious organisations. In these environments people developed feelings of what was right and wrong. Positive behaviour was also developed by participating in the extensions of these organisations through activities in young mother groups women#s guilds, choirs, and religious celebrations. These helped develop positive moral compass in people.Equally, most children and young people went to youth organisations such as the Girl Guides, Scouts, the BBs, army and naval cadets. Even into the s local authorities ran youth clubs and had excellent people called #youth leaders#. No more. #We cannot afford them# is the call of the day. Without them the honourable behaviour of society will continue to deteriorate.So my plea to politicians is simple # stop making us all criminals by passing more and more laws and start supporting and encouraging agencies, groups and people who indirectly and directly instil in iniduals behaviour of which all can be proud.Finlay CraigCoveSir,There is all the hoo-ha at the moment over the lesser royals deciding its going to be a better le that beckons from opting out from royal duties # perhaps wanting a less stressful, more normal, le for themselves and their family as ordinary people away from the media hype and national newspapers.It was lovely, however, to see in the same week front page on the local paper a real regional award for a less well-known commoner.An MBE given for services to the local youth community, making this two great awards for Lochgilphead in recent years and showing that local strong ladies in Mid Argyll do have what it takes.Hard work and true Scottish grit and determination in their hearts for the area and community. More of the same meritorious awards for the ordinary people of Scotland please.Credit to all editors and staff for their outstanding journalism given over the years in all of Scotlands progressive, thriving local papers.Stephen Jones, Oban"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures january 3 2020 2","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThis week#s photograph whas been submitted by Tom Cullen of Ardfern.The serene scene was taken overlooking the Crinan estuary at about .am on Friday January ."},{"url":null,"title":"lochgilphead bowls into 2020","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowLochgilphead Bowling Club launched into the new year with the first of its indoor singles competitions.Some  members played for the Argyll Arms Ardrishaig trophy on Saturday January  and after some great matches throughout the afternoon it was Alan Guy and Neil Ward that progressed to the final.In a closely fought final, Neil Ward edged the victory in the last end, winning -."},{"url":null,"title":"tarberts senior citizens party the night away","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowWet and windy weather failed to dampen the spirits of Tarbert’s seniors as they gathered in the village hall for the senior citizens# Christmas dinner.A large number of willing volunteers had organised a sumptuous meal and decked the hall with multi-coloured fairy lights and balloons to provide a warm welcome for their guests.The familiar venue quickly came alive with smiles, hugs and the happy chatter of friends gathering for this much-loved annual event which has been going for more than  years.Elma McGougan and Jean Johnston, who had served on the original organising committee, reminisced about their experiences, explaining they ran fund-raising events and that many in the village donated money and goods so the dinner could be provided free of charge.The event, held this year on Friday January , is still organised by a committee and continues to be generously supported by businesses and iniduals in the village and surrounding area.Elma said: #In the s, the women on the committee made soup and brought it along. We did not have the new kitchen then. The hotel has always cooked the turkeys for us but cooking big pots of potatoes and vegetables was quite a job with just the gas rings. Back then, we had ice-cream and jelly for dessert.#Jean added: #It was all good fun and we had loads of laughs.#Elma continued: #We used to have sales to raise money for the dinner. Santa was on the stage and Jean’s children were his elves. They were only little then.#We modelled the clothes and the older women loved the bargains. We thought they were old, but they were probably the age we are now,# Elma said laughing. #We would shout #Roll up, roll up# to get them to come and see what we had on offer.#After a warm welcome from compère Martin Jefferies and a prayer of thanks for the food, the five-course meal was expertly served by members of the organising committee and their youthful helpers.A raffle, again free of charge, saw a large number of guests receive prizes and no-one was left disappointed as the remainder of the guests received selection boxes.Tarbert’s seniors showed they know how to party as dancers left their seats and enthusiastically took to the floor as soon as the musical entertainment began.A stunned Margaret Henderson was named #Citizen of the Year#, confessing she never expected to win the award.For more than  years, Margaret has collected money to support the Tarbert Sea Food Festival and Music Festival. Later, Margaret dressed up as Mrs Brown from Mrs Brown’s Boys to entertain the audience, something for which she is well-known.Martin Jefferies thanked everyone who had helped make the evening such a success with the happy gathering agreeing with loud applause.By Joan Crooks"},{"url":null,"title":"winning start to new year for star youths","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe Now kicked off with a flying start for both Red Star s and s.The s headed to Glasgow in a top of the table clash against Glasgow Boys.

A wee van and a motorbike were behind them at the time and they let them pass and they disappeared down the twisty road at an incrediblespeed.They reached Tighnabruaich at about  o#clock and saw Fulmar in the water, but when they stopped to speak to Johnny Malcolm and Donald Turner they were told she was not in the water more than # an hour and still not fully rigged. They were quite right but George Smith said they were busy getting Psyche ready for launchingbut they would be out first thing in the morning to bend on the sails and finish off the rigging.They got their storesin the yard and with these and their luggage went aboard in two trips. Things were soon put sufficiently enough in order to allow them to get to bed and after watching Psyche go down the slip they were soon in their bunks. It was a beautully clear evening but distinctly cold.Next morning they were up at sevenand about eight the yard men came out and finished up their jobs. Jimmy Smith fixed up the slipping clutch and suggested we do away with the present gear lever fancy arrangement which was not strong enough for its work. This the Skipper agreed to though it meant a less handy working but it did away with the pin and shield that broke up the dog-house seat, they being replaced by a removable hatch cover. It certainly made sitting in the dog-house more comfortable.The Skipper went ashore to the village for meat and some curtain hooks while Archie watered ship and the other two continued cleaning and clearing up aboard.At quarter to twelve they were away under full sail and in brilliant sunshine but with a cold north-westerly they ran to Ardlamont then beat up to Tarbert, being passed just outside Tarbert as an aeroplane flew close overhead, by Blink. They noticed a huge oil tanker doing trials just off Arran.They were anchored off the herring pier before  o#clock and they had supper-cum-lunch then went ashore. The Pilot to visit a friend, the others to get milk in the village then to walk to the end of the road on Loch Fyne. On their way they spoke to an enthusiastic English pair, working in their garden, who wanted to know off which yacht they had come.During the evening Arcturus and Tunnag came in and one or two motor boats. Zaidie was in when they arrived and Leonora was anchored across Loch Fyne in Buck Bay.All aboard, Margaret and Archie went off to the islet in the harbour to get some roots for their new garden then soon afterwards all turned in, for though it was a glorious looking evening it was perishingly cold and the stove, lit as soon as they anchored, had been very welcome.On Sunday they were again up early and found a dull overcast day. The Pilot, ashore for water, heard a poor weather forecastfrom a fishing board. On the strength of this they hurried breakfast and by  o’clock were away with a south-westerly breeze.The Skipper gave the first beacon a rap with the boom-end as they ran out of the harbour. The beat down to Ardlamontand thee ran the engine for five minutes to get out of a nasty lop. The sun came out for about five minutes but by the time they had reached the Carry Buoythe rain had started and it got heavier and heavier.The wind strengthened with the rain and they moved up very fast into Tighnabruaich Bay then up to Loch Riddon to anchor off the pier at Ormidale. As they passed Tighnabruaich they saw Torridon was on Fulmar’s mooring and they watched her crew panicking to get off before Fulmar arrived. They wondered what the Torridons said when they saw Fulmar pass on through and realised that they could have stayed where they were. As they passed Glen Caladh the new Jansi of Kames passed under a not very healthy-sounding engine.They had lunch and the stove was lit then Margaret and Archie went ashore to visit friends and when they came back they brought with them a big sack of coal . The late afternoon and evening were spent below talking and listening to the rain hammering on the deck.Monday morning it was dry but blowing hard. They got the anchor early and motored to the moorings. The sails were hoisted to dry them and St Roma came close by to make their number and at one time a big school of thrasher whales went through the Kyles heading east and at a great speed.About noon they went ashore for a visit to the hotel and for a run round the Ardlamont road . Back aboard they had lunch and soon after packed up and came home."},{"url":null,"title":"the cinema on wheels returns","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe screen machine will be rolling back into Mid Argyll at the end of the month.Bringing with it a host of movies for film fans the Screen Machine will be in Campbeltown Road car park in Tarbert from Wednesday January  to Thursday January  and Lochgilphead Resource Centre car park from Friday January  to Sunday February .Musical fantasy film Cats, based on the Andrew Lloyd Webber stage musical, features an ensemble cast including James Corden, Judi Dench, Jason Derulo, Idris Elba, Jenner Hudson, Ian McKellen, Taylor Swt, Rebel Wilson, and Francesca Hayward.Also known as Star Wars: Episode IX, Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker is an epic space-opera film.

So how did Britain look before human interventions  Dense forest  or open woodland Research now favours the latter.Plants and animals evolved in equilibrium for thousands of years before humans impacted the landscape. Essential to this balance were ‘keynote species’ including aurochs , bison and tarpan . By grazing, these animals trampled and eroded soils, dispersed seeds and redistributed nutrients, thereby keeping the forest open. This in turn encouraged growth of large trees while also creating numerous habitats and microenvironments for a wonderful ersity of plants and smaller animals.Now this bioersity is severely threatened by modern monocultures , and massive quantities of pesticides, fungicides, fertilisers and #weed# killers. It is no wonder that insect numbers have plummeted, many bird species are endangered and wild-flower meadows have virtually vanished. So could we recreate this natural order on unproductive land and save our wildle For Isabella Tree and her husband Charlie Burrell the answer is a resounding #yes#. In her book #Wilding#, Tree describes #wilding# their , acre farm at Knepp, West Sussex, that had been unproductive for years.They introduced longhorn cattle, Exmore ponies, deer and pigs but otherwise left well alone. Within months they saw a dference # most scrub was cleared, producing an explosion of plant and animal species. And where grazers were deterred by spiny or unpalatable plants, oaks emerged that will eventually form an open woodland.But Knepp is isolated. More rewilding sites are needed with wildle corridors between them to support the populations and genetic ersity essential for long-term survival.Surely parts of Argyll are ideal for rewilding. We already have beavers creating new waterways to support aquatic species – now how about some large grazers to open up the landscape and perhaps one day recreate the ancient Celtic rainforest "},{"url":null,"title":"karen-flies-flag-outdoor-film-festival","story":"FEATURING a Paralympic gold medallist, World Record holders, a star of BBC natural history programmes, two hugely respected Polar guides and a breath-taking selection of more than  films from around the world, this yearrsquos Peebles Outdoor Film Festival promises a feast of entertainment.Starting on Friday , the festival opens with four action-packed sessions - a screening of favourite films from previous years, a taster session with a wonderful programme of brand new films, an appearance by father and son endurance cyclists Rich and Tom Seipp, and ending with a session of short films exploring wild places on our doorstep alongside a headline appearance by ing and natural history presenter Miranda Krestovnikoff.Programme director Rich Rowe said: ldquoItrsquos a wonderful start to the festival and really sets the tone for an exhilarating weekend.\"This year, we are delighted to also welcome Paralympic champion and hand cycling adventurer Karen Darke ndash someone whom wersquove tried to have at the festival for several years now but whose schedule has always been so busy.Now based in Inverness, but a well-known figure locally following her regular rides in the annual Tour Orsquo the Borders, Karenrsquos story is a remarkable one.Paralysed from a young age following a climbing accident, Karenrsquos love of cycling ndash and the freedom it gives ndash has opened a whole new world of possibilities.In a blog for FINDRA Clothing, the sponsor of Karenrsquos session, she revealed: \"When things get tough in my head, I turn to my bike.\"And when things get tough in my body, I also turn to my bike.Karenrsquos talk will explore some of the many epic cycling adventures that she has experienced across the worldrsquos continents since winning hand cycling gold at the  Rio Paralympic Games.However, as she will point out, medals and globe-trotting only begin to touch on what cycling is all about for her.Karen explained: ldquoThe combination of movement and nature that cycling brings has certainly been the lsquodoctorrsquo of my le.ldquoFrom injury to wellness, from stressed to feeling free, from lonely to sharing deep experiences and connections, it never fails.

We can offer a crime prevention service to seewe can improve things around the football club.\"There are mobile CCTV cameras but we have to go through a process to get those as they are quite highly sought after. They were deployed in December on the School Brae to great effect and are a massive deterrent for crime.ldquoThe youth issues in Peebles I think were only caused by a very small hardcore group and we seem to have hit the right group over December, and I think thatrsquos why yoursquove seen such a good result.ldquoIrsquom not by any stretch of the imagination saying that youths are an issue in general, most kids are good kids, we just need to target the right ones andwe can try and ert them by getting them into the youth hubs and making them into law abiding kids then all the better.Questions were asked about the amount of parental support police receive when youths are identied for anti-social behaviour and taken home.Sergeant Harrison said: ldquoIt depends on the family. Sometimes you get parental support and sometimes the parents instinctively try to defend their children and we donrsquot get a lot of support. However, we deal with each incident as it happens and then try and work with that family. We like to see parents taking responsibility for their kids.Community councillor Lawrie Hayworth, added: ldquoOur concerns are never with the local officers that we have here.

Through time Willie and Jimmy both retired early from the firm through ill health and when Dan retired in  the business was taken over by Williersquos son, William , and long time colleague, Bill Reid . Graham became the fourth generation Williamto work in the business after leaving school and in  took over the business when his father, Bill, retired.The Douglas family took over the building of the annual Border Union Show and Kelso Ram Sales in  and the Championship Dog Show since the first Show in , completing  years for the former and  years for the latter respectively in .It is interesting to note they succeeded Messrs. Bulman, builders Kelso who had been involved with BUAS since . To have had only two main Contractors in over  years is indicative of their skills and loyalties.Graham was very clever at school with a good practical brain and I heard from his le long friend, Andy Shortreed, that he was an expert at, among other things, technical drawing and would make all manner of things out of wood and other material.He was encouraged to study and utilise these skills while at High School in Hawick but Graham was stubborn! All he wanted to do was leave school and join his father, Bill, and be a fencer, which he duly did in .Countless number of farms and estates throughout the Borders have benefited from Grahamrsquos skill, as have the three core events at BUAS. His younger brother, Neil, was in partnership with Graham for a number of years before ing to utilising his skills with heavy plant machinery.I cannot have more regard and respect for Bill and Graham and how they nurtured me when I joined BUAS as Secretary in . I listened and I learnt from them all the ins and outs of both the Showground and preparing these massive annual Events and bringing them together in such a professional manner and with an uncanny calmness that sometimes was frustrating but one knew that come the day the target was reached. The Ram Sales have evolved over the last  years with many changes and updates and it was a pleasure working with someone who was always conscious of the huge responsibility he had to the many thousands of people, whose livelihoods were often very dependant on a good Ram Sales or a good Show, whether buying, selling, exhibiting, a Trade Stand, providing a service or a member of the public.Grahamrsquos other passion in le was his racing pigeons, which he has bred and raced for over  years - and for the last  with his friend and near neighbour in Lilliesleaf, Bob Spearman. They had many years of great fun and indeed numerous successes with their birds and it was always a great pleasure and exciting for those at the Showground when in the spring Graham would very often bring a crate of young birds when he came to work and released them as part of their early training. A master breeder even he did not understand how the young birds knew which direction was home!He had a great eye and would spend many long evenings just watching the birds to learn which would be potential race winners and which to keep as breeding stock. They had their fair share of success in UK races, whether from Edinburgh or the south coast of England but their biggest success was when one of their favourites ndash Bonnie Lad ndash finished th out , birds released from the South of France. No-one does fathom how these incredible birds find their way home and I believe these two wise owls were also baffled but enjoyed the discussion and banter over a pint or two in the local pub.

I use this phrase to describe the spectacle of street lights at night when viewed from a vantage point.One of the best places in East Lothian to view the lsquoupside down skyrsquo is from the road by Farsquoside Castle. This vantage point gives you views over Wallyford, Musselburgh, Portobello and Edinburgh beyond.These urban areas create a sea of lights which look like a sky full of bright stars, except, of course, itrsquos lsquoupside downrsquo and theyrsquore not really stars. But it looks spectacular in its own way. In fact, views with bright city lights are these days often considered tourist attractions.But Irsquove recently realised something: while the lsquostarsrsquo of the lsquoupside down skyrsquo are getting more numerous and extensive every year, the real stars in the actual sky are becoming more dficult to see at least where I live.Literally thousands upon thousands of houses are being built in the western part of our county. Much of the rural landscape in this part of East Lothian, which I knew when I was a child, is going fast.Most of me understands and accepts the needs for this, but a part feels sad at the loss of a recognisable landscape. And already I have noticed that a by-product of this has been increased light pollution in areas close to where I live. It is going to get much more noticeable as more development takes place.I know many people will say there are many more things to think about, especially in late January, when the Christmas turkey is coming home to roost and all those bills have to be paid at a time when we are already financially drained from festive expenditure, and stressed out. Thank goodness for Burns suppers, a highlight of a month that often seems both the darkest and longest of the year.But this is all the more reason to pause. When was the last time you really had the opportunity to sit under a dark night sky full of visible stars  This is one of naturersquos free gts and stargazing has real benefits for our mental health and emotional wellbeing.I remember some years ago, when visiting a friend in a very rural part of Scotland, I went out to put something in the bin. My friend came out to seeI was OK, as I hadnrsquot ed after  minutes. I had been struck by the beauty and power of the starlit sky, unpolluted by city lights. Without noticing the time, I had sat just gazing at the universe above me.I can remember the sense of awe and peace it created. Sure, part of it was also the quiet and stillness in that area, but sitting under the canopy of stars is what overwhelmed me in that moment.Itrsquos an experience fewer of us can enjoy because of the increase in light pollution, but also noise and general busyness all around us. So we often donrsquot even realise what wersquore missing. Perhaps there is a cause and effect here: the less you notice the absence of something, the less you think itrsquos important or relevant.Our ancient ancestors understood its power. But I think we have lost the sense. I recently asked a group of young people how many of them had sat under the stars and just gazed and wondered at them. Sadly, none had done so, and some thought the idea ldquoweird. I think a lot of adults would share that opinion.But taking time to sit and really wonder at an unpolluted night sky can fill us with awe, as I experienced that evening at my friendrsquos house. It makes us feel small and in so doing it puts our worries and anxieties in perspective. It can promote inner peace and calm.For sure, the bills wonrsquot go away neither will the stress at work or whatever is dominating your thoughts most of the day. But in taking time to pause and wonder at the vast and almost timeless beauty of the stars, your soul gets time to catch up. It can help you see things dferently, in a more creative way. Itrsquos a form of meditation with something bigger than we can imagine, but also something incredibly beautul.And itrsquos fascinating, as you try to identy the dferent constellations, and perhaps realise how much you donrsquot know or have forgotten. Could you identy the northern star, and what constellations can you see  Sailors in days of old were experts at identying the stars to aid direction, but Irsquom sure they also marvelled at the unhindered beauty and mystery of them as well.There are still many places in our county where we can be wrapped in star-lit darkness. But as the lsquoupside down skyrsquo gets bigger and brighter, the real stars are fading in so many places.The real shame is, as the stars disappear from our sight, they may disappear from our consciousness as well.Letrsquos not let that happen. Let us gt our children, and ourselves, with the noticing and gazing at the real stars in our sky and somehow find the time, even briefly, to stargaze."},{"url":null,"title":"garry-oconnor-referees-haddington-amateur-teams-successful-charity-match","story":"Haddington Town FC took time out over the festive period for a special friendly in aid of Back Onside.Former Hibernian and Scotland striker Garry OrsquoConnor, who is an ambassador of the good cause, refereed the match, which saw members of the amateur teamrsquos squad come up against one another on January .Matt OrsquoConnell, chairman of the club, which was formed last year, said they were determined to help support the charity, which helps young people and adults who face mental health challenges.He said: ldquoWersquore a club that was founded on the idea of bringing local guys together into a positive social and active environment.ldquoItrsquos well documented that the highest proportion of suicide across Scotland is men aged - and thatrsquos something we hope to positively redress in our town by facilitating a great environment in which local guys can improve not only their physical but also their mental health.ldquoOur connection with the charity Back Onside was really born of their slogan, #SupportThroughSport, a powerful statement that really resonated with us.ldquoTheyrsquore a great charity who are doing a hell of a lot across the UK and so for us, a small amateur club barely nine months old, to play a small part in helping a charity who share our ethos was immensely rewarding.Haddington Town play on Sunday mornings in Division Two of the Lothian and Edinburgh Amateur Football Association , alongside fellow county side Meadowmill.The charity match, played at Knox Academy, finished - in favour of the lsquoawayrsquo Haddington Town team.Libby Emmerson, founder and CEO of Back Onside, said: ldquoWe are beyond grateful for the support received from Haddington Town Amateur Football Club and guest referee Garry OrsquoConnor.ldquoAs a small charity with a huge clientele, community events such as the Haddington Town AFC charity match are key to raising funds and awareness so that we can continue to support those facing mental health challenges.Mr OrsquoConnell thanked everyone for their support, with the match raising pound, ndash more than double the target.He said: ldquoHuge thanks to Libby Emmerson, FES FM and Garry OrsquoConnor.

To turn the area over to commercial activities from November, with an unsightly and unpassable clear-up lasting from January to May, is to commandeer the place for more than half the year. Eight weeks would be acceptable  is not.Naturally, this eyesore wont be published on any VisitScotland website. Most sightseers wont ever catch a glimpse of this inglorious aftermath. Meanwhile, between now and the middle of May, those who live and work in Edinburgh must pass by and avert their gaze, wondering how their city became a mere pawn of the entertainment industry and not an illustrious capital of which they could once be proud. As one of many disgruntled locals tweeted, this is ruination \"in the name of greed\".I cannot think of a city of comparable elegance, venerability and wealth ndash a Unesco World Heritage Centre to boot ndash where the first thing you see as you emerge from the train station, or arrive from the airport is a wasteland. Welcome to Scotland! Here we dont roll out the red carpet, but ndash after an agonisingly long delay ndash we do renew the turf.Theres a palpable feeling at the moment that Edinburgh is undergoing seismic change, under our noses but without public consent. News last week that planning regulations could be relaxed to allow restaurants, cafes, and a host of other non-retail outfits to move into Princes Street is a fresh cause for concern. If approved, this new dispensation could mean that one of Europes most beguiling bouleds ndash the street that sells Scotland ndash could become home to a casino, cinema, or even a sports facility.Why should this concern us  Given the tawdry quality of some of the shops currently trading, wouldnt bright cafes or restaurants be a welcome improvement  After all, the array of tartan tat, cheap-as-chips fashion and even an emporium dedicated to sugary sweets ndash the smell alone could rot your teeth ndash is hardly in keeping with the magnicence of the venue.Yet given some of the poor decisions already taken by the councils planning committee, it is hard to feel confident that this incomparably lovely avenue is in safe hands. One member of the committee says the idea is to create a \"more authentic\" space. Im not sure what that means, but it sounds like double-speak for attracting lucrative footfall. And while pubs wont apparently be allowed onto the street, this relaxing of regulations extends to George Street, Hanover Street, Frederick Street and Castle Street. Like it or not, the face of the New Towns commercial district is set for a facelt.With the demise of House of Fraser at the West End, now transformed into a whisky experience, and towards the East End the once-beloved Jenners department store due shortly to close , the heart of the city is struggling to keep up with bewildering change. Fortunately, nothing so awful is in the pipeline as the notorious proposal some years ago to build an elevated shopping mall in the gardens. Perhaps the most worrying aspect of a less stringent commercial climate is the signal it sends, and the trend it looks set to deepen.Wherever you go, Edinburgh is turning into a visitor attraction, a living museum and gallery. Useful shops for locals are a rarity. In their place is a proleration of chic cafes, glitzy on-trend eateries and luxurious hotels, all pandering to the tourist market. Thanks to the make-over of old premises and investment in new, the capital has a superficial shine, a high-cost stylish patina. But as Dickenss Mr and Mrs Veneering showed, putting your faith in appearances is risky. Yes, it creates jobs, though mostly of a lowly-paid, transitory kind. But at what cost  Do people make the trip to Edinburgh for its pubs and coffee shops, or to soak up the atmosphere of culture, history and daily le that, over centuries, have made its name Princes Street has undoubtedly been in need of improving its image for a long time now. Some initiatives are to be welcomed, such as the Quaich project, to renovate the run-down Ross Bandstand, and to \"wild\" the western part of the gardens, so they look less like a postcard from the s and rather more invitingly freeform. While that is a laudable aspiration for one side of the street, however, the other is in danger of losing whatever soul it has left.I understand that the council is in a dficult position, trying to safe-guard the future of a district caught in the retail nightmare of swtly changing, quixotic customer behaviour. That it is hoping to welcome a greater ersity of trade suggests that in one aspect at least, human habits are unchanged: eating and drinking and watching the world go by. In fact, we are consuming far more than we ever did before, willing to spend money as well as countless hours sipping lattes and beer and scoffing burgers and sushi. So much for austerity. When it comes to leisure, wallets fly open.There would be nothing wrong with broadening Princes Streets commercial scopeyou could trust those at the controls. Sadly, I have no such faith. On the evidence of recent years, the citys development is geared towards immediate gratication, mainly for migrating flocks of cash-splashing customers. Where is the long-term perspective, tailored to the true character of the city, and to the requirements and concerns of those who live in it  Why bother to ask. Such a perspective requires serious thought, knowledge and imagination, luxuries the current decision-makers dont want to afford. As they say, Rome wasnt built in a day ndash but a theme park could be."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/10966399.jpg?type=article-full","title":"no-faffing-about-demands-reroute-landslip","story":"More than , tonnes of material reached the carriageway, despite catch-fences above the carriageway, in the early hours of Thursday morning following heavy rainfall.Commuters were initially directed on the huge reroute westbound and eastbound by Traffic Scotland before being directed to the Old Military Road which runs parallel to the stricken road.The Scottish Government spent millions on reopening the single-track Old Military Road in  as an alternative for drivers faced with a long detour.It was originally built in the mid-th century and used to move troops around the country.:Rest and Be Thankful closure -Motorists face -mile ersion after landslipBusinesses who rely on the important Highlands artery, believe a permanent solution to the landslip issues has to have been found by now.And Aileen Morton, the Argyll and Bute Council leader said there should be \"no more preicating and faffing about\" after a decade ofrequests for a permanent solution and that the Scottish Government should make a commitment to resolving the issue \"right now\".Iain Jurgensen, chairman of the Argyll and The Isles Tourism Co-operativesays a solution is available to reroute the road using an existing track which has not got the same slippage issues.Bear Scotland said on Thursday that staff were at the Rest And Be Thankful and would begin a clearance operation when it was safe.The A connects the Central Belt, via the A from Glasgow, to the Kintyre peninsula, all the way down to Campbeltown.The latest major landslip to hit the road came on the day of the Inverary funeral of one of the leading campaigners for solutions to the A, Donald Clark, who ran the George Hotel in the town, and sat on the road taskforce.Mr Jurgensen, who is also managing director of Portavadie, the popular holiday resort overlooking Loch Fyne, said: \"That road is a leline.

We just live in a very touch-deprived society. Itrsquos just awful.ldquoYou see people after theyrsquove hadlots of touch and theyrsquore really peaceful, content and happy and they lose the jaggedness that lots of people have.As a lawyer for more than  years before retiring last May to focus on his therapy work, Mr Fraser dealt with countless acrimonious orces and saw first-hand the effects of touch and affection deprivation.He said: ldquoOne of the things cuddle parties try and do is break the unfortunate connection that people have got with affectionate touch and sexual touch, with the consequence that people are simultaneously over-sexualised and touch deprived.As adults, who do we get touch from, he asks, especially without demand. One cuddle party-goer who was only ever touched when her husband wanted physical intimacy and received no affectionate contact was ldquoessentially starved of touch.Mr Fraser said: ldquoComing to the cuddle parties enabled her to experience affectionate, consensual touch with no sexual agenda.A hug that lasts for  seconds releases the hormone oxytocin, known as the cuddle or love hormone, which can lower blood pressure, slow heart rates and improve mood.Researchers have found that the same areas of the brain that respond positively to gentle touch also help to develop a sense of body ownership, or what Mr Fraser calls ldquoembodiment, the sense of inhabiting onersquos own body and setting healthy boundaries.The first cuddle party was held in  in the United States and soon migrated to British shores where the y started with regular events in London, facilitated by Ms Sonnenbaum.She said: ldquoA cuddle party is a way to ask for and receive loving touch in a safe non-sexual setting. This helps with finding out about our own touch preferences and communicating about them effectively without fear of being judged or rejected.ldquoWe practise saying both lsquoyesrsquo and lsquonorsquo confidently to each other. Strong personal boundaries and the ability to say lsquonorsquo are the prerequisite for letting people come close to us ndash or  this wouldnrsquot feel safe.She added: ldquoWith the rise of one-person households in big cities people donrsquot get a lot of touch which is non-sexual and my suspicion is that people have casual sex just to satisfy their skin hunger.Mr Fraser said: ldquoPeople have said things like, lsquothis is my worst nightmarersquo. But itrsquos only touch that you wish to receive ndashyou donrsquot want to get hugged by somebody, you donrsquot get hugged by them.ldquoThis is the opposite of being indiscriminately touched by other people. Itrsquos reprogramming people and itrsquos empowering people.Consent is vital and never more so than in the post #MeToo era when even consensual physical intimacy can be shadowed by fears of accusation and abuse.Mr Fraser said: ldquoThe traditional idea of consent is a bit like an army besieging a castle and the people inside surrender and open the doors and then the army can come in and do whatever they like. You agree to something and then yoursquove got to just accept whatever follows. Our idea of consent is entirely dferent ndash itrsquos based on enthusiastic consent in the moment.The importance of being able to say no to touch of any kind canrsquot be underestimated, said Mr Fraser. He added: ldquoIf a person canrsquot say no then they and the person in contact with them are both fundamentally unsafe. You have to have clarity because itrsquos onlyyou have a no that your yes means something.lEveryBody Loves Cuddle Party Workshop, CCA Glasgow, Sunday February , pm-pm."},{"url":null,"title":"royal-botanic-garden-not-common-garden","story":"Royal Botanic Garden: Not so common or gardenRoyal Botanic Gardens Edinburgh#s Mark Hughes, Research Scientist.

I donrsquot think even now a lot of people realise the research and the science that happens here and whatrsquos been involved in bringing a lot of these plants to the UK ndash the work of the Scottish botanist George Forrest for example.Some people have called Forrest the Indiana Jones of botany and he really does deserve that title. He was a plant collector who became associated with the garden in  and went out to China. It was very risky and he couldrsquove died on numerous occasions.In  hersquod settled just off the Tibet border at a time when a lot of people in that area were quite hostile to Western influences. He heard that there was a plan to besiege his mission and kill everyone so he and two missionaries tried to escape and made their way down the river in pitch darkness on narrow paths ndash one slip and they would have been dead. They were surrounded and cut off. They had to run for their lives.Forrest was running towards the river on his own and did a five-hour climb but discovered sentries at the top so had to head back down. They were trying to track him by his footprints so he had to bury his shoes and wade up the river and hide during the day. He spent five or six days doing this but eventually, some locals helped him. Around , specimens in the Botanic Garden have Forrestrsquos name on them. We wouldnrsquot be in the shape we are nowit wasnrsquot for George Forrest.I worried when I started here that I knew nothing about plants, but for me itrsquos been about the people behind the plants and how incredible they were. Charles Austin for example was around at the time of Linnaeus and was horried at the idea that plants could have sexual parts. But Austin was a great lecturer ndash once, he self-medicated on coffee when it was unusual and described his blind spots and hallucinations to his students.I have a great love for the collection of plants. I can look at a plant and say lsquotherersquos the plant that Forrest named after his wersquo or lsquotherersquos a plant that someone almost died to getrsquo. My favourite is primula vialii. If you get a whole swathe of them together, itrsquos the most incredible sight.Hannah Wilson, Phd studentI grew up in Yorkshire and have always been interested in nature but it was quite haphazard me getting into botany. My undergraduate degree is in mathematics but I finished the course and decided I didnrsquot want to do maths anymore. I got a summer job in a garden near my parents and got into rhododendrons and ended up working there for four years. Irsquom now studying for a PHD looking at begonias in New Guinea.Begonias are a very interesting group to research because theyrsquore so erse and we have a very good collection here at the Botanics. Later this year, Irsquoll be going on the Botanicsrsquo th anniversary expedition to the central range of mountains in Papua New Guinea. Wersquoll be starting in the north and heading south and wersquoll be ascending m. The idea is that all along the -mile route, we will set up base camps and survey the incredible ersity of plants there. We will be camping in the forest and sleeping in hammocks because therersquos no flat ground. Irsquove never slept in a hammock before!We are definitely going to find new plants on this trip. New Guinea is still very much under-studied itrsquos incredibly erse. Papua New Guinea makes up only about . per cent of the global land area but itrsquos estimated to harbour up to  per cent of all global plants, animals and insects. People have always assumed that the flora of Papua New Guinea is safe because itrsquos so remote and dficult to get to, but there is a global threat from climate change. But the more immediate threat in New Guinea is logging and mining and palm oil plantations.Itrsquos exciting to be at the Botanic Garden this year and itrsquos humbling when I remember that Irsquom a tiny part of such a huge institution. Historically, itrsquos been a lot about the plants themselves and collecting them and we still do a lot of that, but now I see us moving towards bioersity loss and the climate crisis.Martine Borge, conservation horticulturistI grew up in Norway and went up into the mountains a lot and always felt connected to the vegetation that was all around it gave me a sense of place. We would pick things to take home and I love working with my hands. Irsquove got mud under my nails right now. Some of the sites we work in are dficult to get to but I love that side of the job. Sometimes we have to use drones just to get a look at a plant.I work on the Scottish Rare Plants project and Scottish rare plants that are threatened. We have  per cent of Scotlandrsquos threatened species growing here within the gardens and I look after them the other side is having some of that material available for reintroduction and bringing the plants back into the wild to try to establish more healthy populations. Getting things re-established can be a challenge ndash all the threat may still be present and we are facing climate change as well.One of our big projects is with a plant called alpine blue sow thistle which is only growing in four sites in the Cairngorms. Itrsquos on the brink and all the sites are tiny little ledges where itrsquos safe from grazing from sheep and deer. Itrsquos a big problem for most threatened plants in Scotland. We collect material and itrsquos grown here and wersquove been able to cross-pollinate between dferent populations. It can be sad to see them clinging to ledges but we have five new sites for the thistle. You feel very attached to the plants you work with ndash they are so charismatic and having a connection to plants is good for your general wellbeing.I am worried about where we are in Scotland ndash we have a lot of beautul wild looking spaces but actually a lot of those spaces are grazed and you can see that they are very bare and botanically quite poor. We need links between populations and habitats and a reduction in the number of deer.The Botanics mean so much to me and I feel proud to work here. Wersquore very much ahead of the curve on conservation. We have so much to learn from plants ndash they are making use of renewable resources all the time and doing their thing. A big thing is not taking plants for granted some of them have uses that they havenrsquot even worked out.David Knott, curator of the living collectionsI was born in Edinburgh and actually learned to walk in the Botanics. My grandfather was an old-style pharmacist and grew a lot of plants in his garden my parents werenrsquot terribly keen on gardening so it skipped a generation. I came to the Botanics as a student of horticulture over  years ago. If you have a passion for plants, the Botanics is one of the finest plant collections in Scotlandnot the world. We have , plants over four gardens.In our gardens, therersquos definitely been a sht to more ecological planting. We have a Chilean hillside at Benmore, a Tasmanian forest at Logan, Nepalese planting at Dawyck and here in Edinburgh we have a Chinese hillside. Growing plants that are endangered is an increasing part of what we do ndash understanding the threats as well. We want to explain and conserve for a better future.One of my favourite plants is the Scottish primrose which grows up on the Sutherland coast. The emotional connection to plants was brought home to me when we had the storm of  when we lost a number of substantial trees in each of our gardens. What was interesting to see were the emotions of regular visitors to the garden. They were horried to see the extent of the damage and the support we got surprised me ndash I could see how much people enjoy and respect the gardens.Recovering from the storm is a process of replanting but the timelines are very dferent from human timelines ndash yoursquore planting not just for one or two generations but five or six. When we lose trees, itrsquos sad but itrsquos obviously an opportunity to replant as well.The effect of climate change in the gardens is something wersquove been aware of for - years. In the last ten years, wersquove had our windiest, coldest and warmest weather. Wersquove just installed a rain garden to mitigate some of the impacts of climate change ndash the aim is to capture and reduce the run-off.Gardeners are by their very nature optimistic. Losing a tree in a storm or a plant to a disease leaves a gap and an opportunity. We have to garden more sustainably so we mitigate some of the impacts of climate change. Itrsquos about going back to the basics that our parents or grandparents were using.Dr Mark Hughes, researcherI am from Cumbria originally and worked in industry for years before I quit and went to university to do botany and Irsquove now been working on begonias for  years. My interest started when I was an undergraduate and was the botanist on an expedition to Ecuador and spent a lot of time looking for begonias. I became fascinated by them.What fascinates me most is the massive ersity ndash itrsquos the fastest growing group in terms of the species that are being discovered. On average, across the world, wersquore discovering between  and  new species every year. Some of them have very tiny distributions, they might grow on one rock and nowhere . Itrsquos important we carry on doing this work to ensure all these rare plants have a voice and recognition ndashthey havenrsquot got a name, they can be ignored ndash a fundamental first step to getting protection for bioersity is making sure they have a name. It grows and it has a voice.What wersquore trying to do is stop extinctions by bringing things in to cultivation ndash we can give plants an official threat status at ious levels from least concern to critically endangered. We can discover something only for it to go straight on the threatened list, which happens quite a lot.Sometimes itrsquos heart-breaking. Irsquove been to parts of Borneo for example to parts of the country which are meant to be protected and therersquos not a tree left standing. You can feel powerless itrsquos a mixture of coal mining and palm oil. It would be easy to feel overwhelmed, butI can just save a handful of things, that is still worthwhile. Itrsquos important not to get despondent because there are still people doing really great work. There is a gradual awakening and people feel they have more of a responsibility ndash we have to translate that into some kind of action.We are still in a golden age of discovery ndash itrsquos estimated that globally the biggest flora of the world is the undiscovered flora and I can go into a forest and think lsquowhat the hell is that  That is totally newrsquo.Therersquos probably about , species still to be discovered. As for begonias, because there are nearly  species, wersquore kind of running out of names because you canrsquot use the same name twice so we have to get quite creative quite often I name them after people whorsquove been associated with collecting them. There is a begonia named after me ndash begonia hughesii. Itrsquos lovely. Irsquoll leave a bit of a legacy.The Botanics has stood the test of time because it has always modernised. We depend on our archive and our past but wersquore never the same. We are focusing far, far more on conservation - we are realising the value of applying what wersquore doing more directly to conservation and that will be part of our new strategy for the future."},{"url":null,"title":"fiona-rintoul-without-gaelic-cannot-understand-history---embrace-future","story":"This level of multilingualism is normal in Switzerland and in many countries across Europe. Itrsquos normal in other parts of the world too. In Tunisia and Morocco, everyone ndash literally everyone, from elderly peasants to small children ndash speaks French as well as Arabic. Years ago, I met some Congolese engineering students while working in China. They spoke French, Lingala, their own tribal languages and, yes, Mandarin Chinese.In all, around % of the worldrsquos population speak more than one language. And yet, here in the UK we cleave to the eccentric belief that it is normal ndash desirable even ndash to be monoglot.ldquoThey all speak English, donrsquot they  is a common but lame excuse for not engaging with other tongues. And sadly, our aversion to learning foreign languages seems to be growing rather than abating.Despite initiatives such as the Scottish Governmentrsquos + programme, which aims to ensure that every child has the chance to learn two modern languages in primary school, language entries at National  and  level have dropped by a fth since . In England, Wales and Northern Ireland, GCSE and A-level language entries have been declining since the turn of the century.:Alan Simpson: It is time to rip up the Gaelic blueprint and start againItrsquos almostas we think that learning another language might somehow corrode us, chip away at head space meant for greater things. Nowhere is this more evident than in attitudes to Gaelic here in Scotland.Gaelic is not a foreign language it is a native language. Without it, we cannot properly understand our history or pronounce the place names in our own country. Whether we live in a Gaelic-speaking area or not, Gaelic is part of our collective Scottish heritage.It is a joyous miracle that Gaelic has survived as a living language despite the slings and arrows chucked at it by outrageous fortune. And yet, people moan about dual-language road signs, which would be considered normal anywhere , and rage against the spending of pound million a year by Bograverd na Gagraveidhlig to promote the Gaelic language.This is an amount that would scarcely keep some English Premier League footballers in designer undies for six months. Or to put it another way, itrsquos pound a head. I personally feel Irsquove got more than my poundrsquos worth from all the Gaelic words Irsquove learnt from the road signs.Recently, we hit a new low in linguistic ignorance when MSP Liz Smith, the Scottish Conservativersquos education spokeswoman, suggested that Comhairle nan Eilean Siarrsquos Gaelic first policy in primary schools would disadvantage children. Her remarks called to mind my -year-old neighbour on Harris who was punished as a child for speaking Gaelic in school and was not taught to read and write his first language.That harms children ndash and the adults they become. Teaching them in their native language first does not.Of course, children in the Hebrides can and must learn English too. They will then be in the hugely advantageous position of being bilingual. And when you are bilingual, you become like my Swiss friends you find it easy to learn further languages.:Homes for Gaelic speakers and a Google office in South Uist... what will it take to revive Gaelic in Scotland We desperately need people who can do that. Adult minds can be prised open to accommodate language learning, but the best time to do it is childhood. All language learning enriches us, and we should welcome any initiative that encourages multilingualism, be it the Comhairlersquos Gaelic first policy or the Scottish Governmentrsquos +.This is partly about economics. You can do business in English in a lot of countries. But you can do it much betteryou have people who speak the language of your target market and understand its culture. Research from the British Chamber of Commerce shows that % of UK SMEs that export have no foreign-language ability for the markets they serve. This kind of monolingualism shaves some .% off Britains GDP.Itrsquos not just about economics, though. Itrsquos also about how we are in the world.For to be an English-language monoglot is to live in a gilded cage. You donrsquot have to make an effort other people do that. You donrsquot have to struggle for words and make mistakes others must expose themselves. But in the end, you are the loser.You miss out on the opportunity to see the world in an alternative way that learning a foreign language brings. People understand your language, but you donrsquot understand theirs. Which effectively means that they know you, but you donrsquot know them.This is how the UK came fatally to misunderstand Germany in the Brexit negotiations. German language learning in the UK is in a parlous state. Only a tiny minority of British people can read German newspapers and books or watch German TV. And so, it became possible for UK politicians to think that for Germany the EU is all about flogging expensive cars, when in fact it is about peace our time, and Germany ainrsquot going to compromise the latter for the former.Yesterday, we left the European Union. If more people in the UK had engaged in the mind-expanding business of learning another language, we would perhaps never have voted to leave. Not just because we would have been better able to take advantage of the colossal economic and cultural opportunities that free movement offered, but also because we would have better understood our neighbours.Now wersquore out, and itrsquos brave new world time. English will no longer be as important a language in the EU as it was, possibly spelling the end of what might be termed the English language century.It could be time to embrace multilingualism or die. Here in Scotland, we can start at home by respecting our Gaelic culture, not as a pretty relic with some good tunes, but as a living, breathing part of us. Not to do so is a form of self-starvation. Gaelic is a gt to treasure, not a burden to shoulder."},{"url":null,"title":"rab-macneil-phrase-coin-grammar-drama","story":"First, as I understand it, many of you are worried about the economy. To some, this is such a dficult subject that economists themselves always get it wrong .But the economy is perfectly simple. Herersquos how it works. Somebody makes things. Somebody buys things. We all live happily ever after. Irsquom sure you can grasp the gist.However, in order to buy things, one must have coinage. And, even though much of this is now electronic or virtual, clunky coins in the hand or pocket seem fittingly symbolic to celebrate the past that we are now about to enter.Accordingly, a p commemorative Brexit Day coin has been issued. A harmless gesture, you might think, in normal times. But these are not normal times. People have become unhinged. A coin has been issued, and they have gone doolally.Opponents of Brexit ndash people with a passionate interest in trade agreements ndash have reacted with uncharacteristic extremism and irrationality, some even threatening to decorate the coins withswastikas ndash yup ndash this referring to the historical fact that the Nazis once held a democratic referendum to find outGermanyrsquos citizens wanted to invade Europe.Among those exercised disproportionately is fantasy author Sir Philip Pullman, who called for a boycott of the coin on the grounds that the rubric was allegedly ungrammatical. He lamented, in particular, the lack of a so-called Oxford comma after ldquoprosperity in the words ldquoPeace, prosperity and friendship with all nations.What an interesting and surely well-meant phrase. Who coined it, as it were, originally  Was it Hitler  At any rate, the grammar Gestapo goose-stepped all over it though, soon, a Resistance sprang up, arguing that the comma was purely optional and even ndash look away now, Martha ndash an Americanism, presumably being named after the famous university city there.Nothing is simple any more. Although a simple man myself, I was ndash seriously ndash once accused in a bookof knowing what an Oxford comma was, but it turns out that I did not.I thought it separated phrases. Thus,I write, ldquoIt was blue and hellip, without a comma after ldquoblue, the expectation is that more description of ldquoIt will be forthcoming. However,Irsquom intending to say, ldquoIt was blue, and I wanted one, the comma is neededso as not to lead people up a garden path that promises more adjectives but doesnrsquot deliver. Similarly, yoursquoll see that, earlier, I bunged in a comma when saying: ldquoA coin has been issued, and they have gone doolally. Thatrsquos because, without the comma, the expectation is of more verbiage about the coin, whereas the subject has now changed . Drsquoyou see Most people donrsquot do this and, as a bit of a grammar stormtrooper myself, that irritates me, though not intensely. At any rate, thatrsquos what I thought an Oxford comma was, and I donrsquot see anyway why a commq is necessary in lists such as ldquopeace, prosperity and friendship. Using it to separate the last and penultimate items serves no purpose.But, truthfully, I donrsquot have a clue about such stuff. I just sound sentences in my head and shove in punctuation where I detect a hellip pause. At the end of the day, all thatrsquos required is that you make your meaning luculent.One wonders what Sir Philip would have made of the rubric on the old threepenny bit which read: ldquo+Elizabeth.II.Dei.Gratia.Regina.F:D: Latin  Itrsquos all Greek to me.In the meantime, perhaps he could spend his unwanted coinage in the new p lavatories at Drumnadrochit. At least there, he would know that his colon was in the right place.++++IN these dystopian times, I live by the motto: ldquotwo wheels bad, two legs good. I might also make a casefor: ldquotwo wheels bad, four wheels good. At the time of going to press, I cannot find anything particularly meaningful in ldquotwo wheels bad, four feet good.However, perhaps dogs might find it useful. At any rate, yoursquoll notice the common denominator in each motto: ldquotwo wheels bad. Hitherto, this has applied only to cyclists, those narcissistic bullies who cause danger to pedestrians and motorists alike.However, they could soon have an ally in other equally irresponsible road-users: to wit, hooligans gadding about on E-scooters.The British Government will shortly hold a consultation on allowing these satanic conveyances on roads used by normal people, despite warnings from abroad that the result will be ldquoanarchy.In France and Germany, E-scooter users have been accused, as with cyclists here, of ruining green or scenic footpaths. They also share with cyclists a predilection for pavements.George Orwell wrote about ldquoold maids bicycling to Holy Communion through the early morning mist. That was bad enough. Think how much worse it would bethe old louts were on E-scooters.++++AS someone who dislikes controversy, Irsquom not going to comment specically on the Mystery of the Alastair Stewart Tweet. The ITN newsreaderrsquos communication was allegedly racist, evenall indications suggest otherwise.Some perspective: As noted previously, the original equality campaigners were good, enlightened iniduals slowly, they gained the ascendancy and, for a while, all was well then the original ideals were twisted back on themselves and are now misused to damage innocent parties.However, this third stage has gone on a while now. In the s, I wrote in my local paper about a menace who drove about the town in the wee smarsquo hours waking people up with his street-cleaning machine.My description of himincluded, inter-alia, the observation that he was black-haired, which caused his union branch to raise the possibility that this was racist.A few years later, I confronted some clots about their incompetence, saying the job would have been better carried out by chimpanzees at the zoo. Whereupon, they pointed out that one of their number was of mixed-race. Cue jaw hitting floor. Why make such a connection Lesson: many people become so obsessed with racism that they become racist.++++OFFERED a choice of carrot or stick most Earthlings would opt for the former. The stick breeds resentment, the carrot happiness, and the happy learner scores higher than the resentful one.This has been proven in a study of , American children by Brigham Young University. Dr Paul Caldarella found that pupils in classes with the highest praise-to-reprimand ratio paid attention  to  per cent longer than those where scolding was prevalent.That said, my feeling is that humiliation and shame are better weapons in the battle to educate the nationrsquos nippers.True, it would breed resentment in many. However, it worked for me. A shy child, I blushed madly whenever I was the centre of attention, prompting the other inmates to point at me and shout: ldquoBeamer!Accordingly, I figured the way to avoid this persecution was to get things right. I was shamed, effectively, into becoming the knowledgable and wise figure you see before you today.Spare the rod and spoil the child was always poppycock. The correct formula is shame the child and watch it learn. The probability that, outside school, it will smash windows and pee on cars is beyond the scope of this discussion.Read more: Pullman calls for boycott of Brexit p over missing Oxford comma"},{"url":null,"title":"opinion-matrix-britain-can-take-control-future","story":"On what was a historic Brexit Day, the comment focused on the end of a relationship with Europe as we know it.The Daily Its editorial says Britain is taking back control and once \"our lawmakers are fully in charge, there will be no one  to blame for error or inaction.

In each case, however, this is above all a time for pragmatism.The UK may now be set upon a dferent path from the EU, but the degree to which it will erge will not become clear for months, indeed years, to come. It may take decades before it is clear whether we are heading in an entirely new direction or, like other European nations currently outwith the EU, on a parallel, perhaps fairly closely aligned, path.Setting aside previous dferences is essentialthis journey is to proceed as smoothly as possible. It was welcome that the former Brexit minister Steve Baker should say this was no time for ardent Leavers to gloat, and should recognise that many are saddened by the outcome. By the same token, the most fervent Remainers should accept that the new circumstances will not be improved by constant carping and doom-mongering.Scotland, where a sizeable majority voted against Brexit, has dferent needs and concerns from much of the rest of the UK. The priority must now be to focus not on previous preferences, but on protecting those interests.That will entail the government at Holyrood working with Westminster in order to make the new settlement work. Those whose ultimate goal is independence need, for the moment, to focus on the immediate challenges facing Scotland. Ensuring a stable future for agriculture, healthcare, immigration needs, fisheries and a host of other areas will mean making responsible choices, rather than obstruction in order to further ision, or foolish gestural politics about EU flags and the like.Similarly, Westminster must demonstrate genuine respect for the way in which those sectors may require special attention, accommodation and support, rather than attempting to strongarm Holyrood. Boris Johnsonrsquos government must also adjust to the fact that,those who ndash like most Scots ndash voted Remain should accept Brexit and move forward, there can be no justication for stirring up English nativist feeling.The national interest of Scotland, England and the UK as a whole will be served only by a willingness to accept, with equal vigour and honesty, the opportunities and dficulties we all now face, not by amplying or denying them.It may be that those challenges will increase the pressure for independencethe Prime Minister intends to maintain a United Kingdom, let alone forge the new spirit of unity and optimism his rhetoric suggests, he will have to acknowledge them ndash as he has done for those in the north of England. From today, it is irrelevant that they were largely Leave voters, and Scots largely Remain voters: vital decisions need to be made ndash especially in areas where EU funding or regulation was most signicant ndash to safeguard communities, livelihoods and economic stability.This is a time for humility, cooperation and practical action from those who, like Mr Johnson, successfully advocated this new direction in our politics, and one for acceptance from those who opposed it. The day-to-day priorities of voters all across the UK have been obscured by years of wrangling on this issue its resolution, for good or ill, makes it the more urgent that politicians across the boardtheir focus to them. And whether it proves to be for good or ill will depend on a clear-eyed view of the real priorities of most voters.There is no longer any point in painting le outside the EU as a triumph or a disaster: it is where we are. What matters now is to picture the ways in which we can make a success of the new landscape, and to draw up plans for overcoming the problems, and seizing the opportunities, that it presents."},{"url":null,"title":"letters-let-us-hang-eu-values-respect-compassion","story":"July . Porte Maillot, Paris: Fast forward a couple of months and that same girl who had liked my T-shirt is standing waiting for me as I get off a bus in the centre of Paris. I have come to Paris with pound in my pocket and aticket in  days. Fortunately, I have a European passport and I am allowed to work in France. The very next day I am employed in an Irish bar near Place de Clichy. It is in this bar that I am able to earn a wage. The  days come and go, and before I know it I am \"living\" in Paris. With little to no French, it is in the very same bar that I meet my future we.January , Nanterre Prefecture: Fteen years later, I am still in Paris, happily married to my beautul French we, Eve, who has given birth to our three wonderful daughters. I am fluent in French , our children bilingual and I have just been afforded the privilege of French citizenship. I am a business owner and make a living bringing young French students to Scotland to combine sport and education. A business activity that adds more than pound million to the Scottish economy annually.My point is obvious. Without the European Union and the freedom for a young Scot to live and work in France I would not have been able to live the le I have today. The opportunity afforded to me through the EU is something for which I will be eternally grateful. France has given me an opportunity ndash an opportunity to better myself and it has been an opportunity which has made me the man I am today.Forever a proud Scot, I am today also a very proud and humble Frenchman and as I look towards the future of a Europe without the UK, I do so with a ping of sadness and regret.Whatever happens now, herersquos hoping for a better future, where love, respect and compassion are values held in the highest regard across Europe and beyond.Chris Ewing, Paris.WITH others in my family, I have worked both home and abroad to make Scotland, the UK and the EEC EU work well together. I suppose we now know how successful those efforts were. After meeting Robert Schumans challenge of making war on the continent \"materially impossible\", we can only speculate what other fights might we have taken on in partnership ndash climate change, cyber war, the war on world hunger and disease So it is worth reflecting what country the UKs inhabitants are getting back. The UK has been a member since , but conscious of the EEC since its own birth, and actively pursuing membership for well over  years. In that period, this country has changed beyond recognition ndash not least in the constitutional arrangements underpinning devolution in the home nations.So, as we leave, what chance that Leave voters, Remain voters, and those who did not vote at all, will look around them to what the UK has become ndash leaving victory, defeat, defiance or dissent behind  EU withdrawal might have been less isive with some awareness of how dferent parts of the UK could have their own red lines and priorities recognised. On withdrawal, that awareness will become essential.If that can be done, we will better understand how laden or empty the promises that have been made. In the meantime, we can only hope we avoid the danger Sylvia Plath recorded in her journals, that ldquoin this move toward new horizons and far directions...I may lose what I have now, and not find anything except loneliness.Okay. Whats next John Edward, Edinburgh EH.MOST of the rest of the world is now convinced that the average Brit is not too bright. The real impact of Brexit will not be felt for over a year and will almost certainly result in the withdrawal of foreign car plants and the collapse of our native car industry. Food will certainly rise in price, along with all imports. Our farming and fishing industries will suffer, but since they all voted Leave, they only have themselves to blameThe main problem for the rest of us is high unemployment, combined with low paid and insecure jobs. The Government consists of mainly multi-millionaires who have prudently transferred their main assets offshore. They plan on making a killing out of a low-wage, low-security workforce and will keep benefits low so that many will live at the poverty level.The future is less bright than the Brexiters would have you believe and this, combined with the ongoing slow but sure dismantling of our NHS, will ensure a poor and fairly short-lived workforce who have no rights and little say in events, but who have taken back control and now have their own sovereignty.James Evans, Dumbarton.ldquoWHO do you think you are kidding, Mr Johnson,If you think old Englandrsquos won Kenneth Fraser, St Andrews.LET me get this right, John Edgarclearly wants an independent Scotland to join the European Union. So, having achieved a break from Westminster to achieve some sort of \"freedom\" which separatists so desire and I dont understand, he wants to sign up to being governed and administered by Brussels. Can he please explain what is \"independent\" about being under the control of the European Union Of course, the financial and economic criteria for joining the EU means that an independent Scotland will have very little chance of becoming part of the union ndash Nicola Sturgeons regime with financial mismanagement has guaranteed that.Douglas Cowe, Newmachar.IT may be true that every cloud has a silver lining, as Nigel Farage declares that following Brexit he will now be spending more time in America .Always look on the bright side.R Russell Smith, Kilbirnie.Read more: New dawn for UK but countryrsquos isions remain"},{"url":null,"title":"last call to nature fund applicants","story":"Nature enthusiasts are being encouraged to submit ambitious ideas to improve habitats, safeguard species and tackle the causes of bioersity loss.Applications are being invited for the latest round of the Bioersity Challenge Fund .But anyone applying will have to be quick – applications for this round must be received by midnight on Monday, February .

He played in bands in London, rubbing shoulders with the Rolling Stones, Eric Clapton and his jamming buddy, Ritchie Blackmore, who went on to form the legendary rock bands Deep Purple and Rainbow.He even jammed at a party with Cream bassist and vocalist, Jack Bruce.A visit from Screaming Lord Sutch, who wanted him to go to Germany with him as a bass playermade Jim think again about a career in rock music.His first passion was always art, and comic book art was his favourite genre.He declined Lord Sutch’s offer and after a few years ed to his beloved Orkney. Here he continued drawing for TV comics before working for AD. He was then head-hunted by the American giants, DC Comics and Marvel Comics.Sadly, Jim suffered with Parkinson’s Disease for over  years and passed away on December , .Despite the diagnosis he continued drawing, painting and writing original sci-fi stories for many years.This celebration of his le and art is dferent from other recent exhibitions, as it contains his le story, original artwork and artefacts relating to him.It also features many Orkney related pieces, rather than just sci-fi heroes like Judge Dredd and Batman.Local characters from the th century hang alongside paintings showing the story of St Magnus, wartime Hoy and illustrations from books, like The Bard of Ballarat and Willick o’ Pirliebraes.Jim’s we, Wendy, said: “I am delighted that the Orkney Museum is having an exhibition of my late husband Jim’s work.#The fact that a young boy from the small Orkney island of Hoy should become world famous in his chosen field of comic book illustration is an achievement in itself, but there were many other aspects to Jim’s le.“This exhibition gives an insight into his early le in Hoy, as well, as his time in the RAF and the excitement of being in the London music scene during the ‘swinging sixties’.#I think it is a true reflection of the times he lived in and I hope it will interest the folk who see it.”The Orkney Museum is open Monday to Saturday, .am-.pm, .pm-pm.

After Members of the European Parliament voted to back the Brexit Withdrawal Agreement, they sang Auld Lang Syne, Robert Burns’ version of an old Scottish folk song about friendship, as a way to bid goodbye to the United Kingdom.European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen quoted George Eliot, saying “Only in the agony of parting do we look into the depths of love”, and told the UK that “we will always love you and we will never be far”. Guy Verhofstadt MEP, the European Parliament’s Brexit coordinator, tweeted: “It’s sad to see a nation leaving, a great nation that has given us so much: culturally, economically, politically, even its own blood, in two world wars. It’s sad to see the country leaving that liberated Europe twice.”The outpouring of goodwill was palpable and obviously genuine.: Watch: MEPs belt out Auld Lang Syne as European Parliament backs Boris Johnson’s Brexit deal: Brexit: EU flag will fly at Holyrood after Brexit, after government overturns decision of impartial parliament bodyIn contrast, Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage expressed the hope that the UK’s departure would be the beginning of the end for the EU. “It’s a bad project. It isn’t just undemocratic, it’s anti-democratic,” he claimed, ignoring the fact that Britain was leaving as a result of a democratic process.The vision of the world espoused by Farage, Donald Trump and other members of what some call the alt-right and others view as the far-right is of entirely separate nations in a state of constant struggle. So Trump, the US President who puts ‘America first’, makes trade war on countries who dare to act in their own interests. After France planned a new tax on tech giants, who pay infamously little, Trump threatened vast tarfs on its goods.If the EU collapsed and populist leaders in the Trumpian mould emerged across the continent, all promising to put one over rival countries with dferent agendas, how long would it be before those trade wars turned into something more serious The EU has helped keep the peace in Europe for a letime after millions died in two horrendous world wars. And the fact that the UK and Ireland were both members meant those who were prepared to commit murder in Northern Ireland’s Troubles began to look as foolish as they were callous and brutal.There are legitimate criticisms to be made of the EU and it should take Brexit as a sign of the need for reform.

It is a familiar backdrop beloved by broadcast journalists, used in countless TV reports stretching back decades. It has become a visual shorthand for Brussels and everything it represents.This gigantic slab of late s modernity is the home of the European Commission – the executive wing of the European Union – and the beating heart of the entire European project.The Berlaymont may lack the gothic grandeur of Westminster or the design flourishes of Holyrood, but remains an impressive sight. The complex gives off an air of quiet authority – much like the hundreds of civil servants who work across its  floors.It was opened six years before the UK joined what was then called the European Community and it will stand long after Brexit is finalised.: How Scotland learned to love the European UnionWhen I visited for the first time last week, as a guest of the now-closed European Commission office in Scotland, the Brexit train had long since departed the . The UK was coming out of the EU and everyone I spoke to accepted that fact.No one naively believed that perhaps the whole thing could still be called off. Instead, there was a calm anticipation of what now lies ahead –  months of intensive negotiations on everything from security arrangements to fishing rights.If prizes were awarded for political deal-making, then the EU’s trophy cabinet would be bulging. You can’t forge a -state alliance without learning a trick or two when it comes to sitting round a conference table.Reaching agreements on incredibly complex issues is what the EU does. But that doesn’t mean it’s looking to give the UK a kicking for daring to rip up its membership card. A sense of sadness hung over the Berlaymont. Collectively, no-one doubts the EU will get the job done, and that the institution will continue to thrive, come what may. But inidually there is genuine regret that Brexit is happening. “A great shame,” was a phrase I heard more than once when the subject of the UK’s departure was raised.Those who work in Berlaymont believe, fundamentally, that the EU is a force for good. Member states might disagree on the route, but they all agree on the destination – peace and prosperity across the continent.They knew the UK had complaints about certain things. But it was presumed they could be worked out, in time. Nothing seemed so grave that pushing the ejector button was the only option left.Some regret that the EU did not take a more proactive stance ahead of the  referendum. The EU decided it was an internal matter for the UK and stood back. Brexit was an earthquake that few in the Berlaymont predicted. But the building will stand firm, regardless of the aftershocks.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"eu would be stupid to prevent independent scotland from rejoining says mep","story":"A senior MEP has said it would be \"stupid\"Scotland was not allowed to \"swtly\" rejoin as a member stateit voted for independence in the future.Ska Keller, co-president of the Green bloc of MEPs at the European Parliament, said there was a widespread sympathy in Brussels with Scotlands position given that a majority of Scots had voted Remain at the  referendum.Ms Keller, who served in regional German government before being elected to Brussels, was speaking as a guest of the Scottish Greens in Glasgow today.She added that Scotland also meets the criteria to permit re-admission - rubbishing claims the countrys deficit would hinder accession to the EU.: How Scotland learned to love the European Union\"This is something thats being discussed across the European Parliament, of course we have the new EU Scotland friendship group that has been established,\" she said.\"I cant speak for other groups or parties, but for us Greens its a very important thing.

A request for a transfer of power, through a section  order was made by Ms Sturgeon last monthin the aftermath of the SNPs landslide election victory north of the border. But it was swtly rejected by Boris Johnson a few weeks later. The Scottish constitutional convention of the s was the driving force behind the creation of the Scottish Parliament and Ms Sturgeon set out plans for a similar body to help build the case for independence.\"We will invite Scotland elected representatives - MSPs, MPs, the MEPs elected last year and council leaders – to come together to endorse a modern Claim of Right for Scotland through a new Constitutional Convention,\" Ms Sturgeon revealed.\"To declare that it is for the Scottish Parliament to decide whether and when there should be an independence choice and build support for that principle amongst civic Scotland.\"The Scottish Government has already begun work on a new new case for independence, in the same vein as the Scotlands Future document publish ahead of the  vote.This will ensure Scots have the information they need to \"make informed choices about the future of the country\", Ms Sturgeon added.\"In the coming months, the Scottish Government will publish the outcome of that work,\" she said.The “New Scotland” series of papers” will seek to provide the information and answers people want.\"They will provide detail on how Scotland can make the transition from a Yes vote to becoming an independent country.\"But Tory leader Jackson Carlaw said Ms Sturgeon was seeking to keep the \"isive debate going\" in Scotland.\"Nicola Sturgeon’s determination to plough on with preparations for another vote on independence is predictable, depressing and entirely wrong-headed,\" Mr Carlaw said.“People across Scotland are sick and tired of her relentless pursuit of a referendum they simply don’t want.“What people do want is action now to improve education, health, policing and all the other services they rely upon.“On the day we leave the EU they want a government which focuses on Scotlands economy and jobs.“And they want Nicola Sturgeon to put her referendum plans where they belong – firmly on the backburner.\"Pamela Nash, chief executive of Scotland in Union, said: teh speech was designed to distract from the SNP’s \"catastrophic failings\" in government.“It is sickening that Nicola Sturgeon is willing to neglect struggling schools and hospitals, and waste even more public money on her never-ending campaign to ide the people of Scotland. She even failed to rule out a Catalan-style ‘consultative’ referendum that would result in an expensive legal battle,\" she said.The decision to allow the Electoral Commission test the question comes after concerns that it may be advantageous to the pro-independence campaign. Although the watchdog tested the question ahead of the last referendum, subsequent research saw it reject a Yes No approach for the  Brexit referendum on the basis that this could sway the outcome in favour of the positive \"yes\" response. Instead voters had a \"Remain or Leave\" option in the EU vote.Ms Sturgeon said the current question is \"simple, intelligible and well recognised across the country.\"But she added: \"Parliament made clear it wanted it re-tested and it is the next practical step we need to take within our powers to prepare for a referendum.\"Ms Sturgeon said the UK Governments rejection of another independence referendum is \"a sign of weakness, not of strength\".She said: \"If they had any confidence in the argument for the Westminster union, they would have no problem with the people of Scotland having the right to choose.\"It is the fear of defeat that is making them so desperate to deny us the choice. We should draw encouragement from that.\"The SNP will double their campaign budget to push for a second vote, according to the First Minister - but she urged activists to listen to people who are against independence.She said: \"Our party campaign is therefore ready to ramp up. We aim to double the SNP campaign budget this year to support new independence materials, local newspaper adverts and a new campaign film focused on undecided voters.\"It is vital that as we campaign we listen and engage respectfully.\"There are many people out there who voted No in  now thinking about independence dferently in light of Brexit.\"We must show that we understand the complexity of the issues they grapple with and that, for many, emotions will be mixed.

Matthew Taggart, , who is in the first year of a foundation degree apprenticeship in Civil and Environmental Engineering at Translink in Belfast, said he believes the opportunity to gain qualications with no fees while getting paid to work is something that all young people should consider.Workplus, which helps employers develop talent through apprenticeships, estimates that almost poundm will be earned by the successful candidates over the period of their apprenticeships, some of which will last up to six years, with the possibility of permanent jobs.Those successful will take up positions at companies including Farrans, Translink, Atkins, Liberty IT, Jacobs and McAdam Design in the autumn to gain on the job training in career areas including engineering, construction, IT, administration and accountancy.Matthew said: “After my AS Levels at Ballymena Academy I went straight into a Workplus apprenticeship with Translink and spent two years doing a Level  BTEC. “Now I’m in the first year of a foundation degree, working on projects at Translink which are both interesting and challenging four days a week and attending classes at South West College in Omagh one day a week.“The greatest benefit of being an apprentice is that I’m able to work and learn on the job, while also working towards the qualications I need to apply for jobs within the industry.“Some of my friends who are at university wish they’d taken the same path as me because I’m earning a wage and as my fees are being paid I’ll have no debt at the end. I’d recommend that all young people considering higher education take a look at the apprenticeship opportunities available with Workplus.”Gavin McFarland, Programme Manager at Translink, said: “Workplus gives us access to a large pool of talented young people. Our Civil Engineering apprentices are valued members of our Infrastructure and Projects team. They take full advantage of opportunities to develop their academic learning and professional qualications, while earning an attractive salary. We are pleased to support Workplus and would recommend it to other employers seeking to attract talented young people. “Richard Kirk, Director of Workplus, explained: “Many of the young people who are applying for Workplus Apprenticeships are telling us that full time study along with the debt and career uncertainty at the end is not the right route for them.“Our apprentices get real jobs, good pay with a starting salary between pound, to pound, depending on entry level, as well as access to training and professional networks that will transform their lives.”Applications for this year’s Workplus scheme are open until February  at www.workplus.app "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_2719899.jpg--.jpg?1580378297000\n","title":"my top 10 artie mcauley s musical memories","story":"THE next rambler on our new musical meander down memory lane is the inimitable Mr. Artie McAuley.

I’ll try where I can to find outanybody nearby owns the property. These places are almost always in a bad state of repair – broken windows, roofs and doors missing. “If it’s somewhere that’s been left open you’re not breaking and entering and you’re not going in to commit a crime so you can’t be prosecuted for that either. Michael likes to tell a story through the items that have been left behind“You’re going in at your own risk. If you can’t get in you write it off and move on. Like I say it’s a grey area so I prefer to keep a low profile and let my pictures speak for themselves.”Michael shares the photographs he takes via his Facebook and Instagram pages entitled Forgotten Places NI: “I respect people’s privacy andI’m ever asked to take any photos down I do it straight away.“I do it for the love of old buildings and their contents, it’s as simple as that. It’s a hobby and I don’t try to make any money from it. “I had been taking photos for my own pleasure to start with but when I showed them to other people they said I needed to share them online because they were so good. That’s why I started up Forgotten Places NI.”An old ambulance found at a derelict propertyMichael’s photographs are posted with a short description of the property but little detail about the location unless it’s somewhere that’s easily recognisable. He said he likes to keep his best finds to himself: “I know a couple of other guys who do this. There’s ones who take photographs and sell them. Mine is purely a hobby.“I’ll get messages from other people asking where I’ve been. I don’t always tell them. It’s dog eat dog. It sounds stupid because there’s nothing to gain from it. It’s one-upmanship to find somewhere that no one  has posted about.Masonic supports Charity work Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"“I don’t get why people would exchange locations. I don’t see the point. It’s finding the places and not knowing what’s going to be inside that does it for me. If you go somewhere that’s already been documented it takes the excitement out of it.”Most of the properties are in a bad state of repairHe said: “What I do I call it documenting. I go in take pictures and write a wee blurb about the place I’ve been. “Sometimes it’s a property that’s got a ‘for sale’ sign at it. You’ll come back in three months and it’s gone, it’s been flattened for redevelopment. It’s sad because when you’re in it you get a real sense of the character of the house, the essence of it.”Michael said he used to have a penchant for ghost hunting, but with his new pursuit he tries to steer clear of the paranormal: “I used to have a bit of a fascination with paranormal investigation, though I think it had more to do with the old buildings. I love walking round old places as you can pick up so much of the history from just walking around. “I used to do a few paranormal investigations so that gave me an appreciation of old buildings, the character of them, just how dferent they are to the ones now.“With Forgotten Places NI I don’t like to spook things up to be scarier than they are. That said, there’s a post I put up just this weekend about a house that I called the House of Ambivilence. It really did have mixed feeling about it. “It looked lovely from the outside, a nice farmhouse. Downstairs had a nice calm atmosphere, but when you went upstairs, honestly, you wanted to get out again, something just didn’t sit. I felt uneasy about the atmosphere. A well lived in room“That’s not generally the case, mostly you get a good feeling about the place because of the items you find in them – kids’ toys, religious pictures, birthday cards. It’s that connection I like.”Michael’s photos are largely focused on derelict properties in NI but he has also ventured into the Republic of Ireland: “Banbridge is a good location to have as a base. I can be in the south in  minutes, quicker than to get to Belfast.“For me it’s trying to find places that haven’t been documented. Everybody’s done Cairndhuand because of its popularity it has been subject to vandalism. Nevertheless it’s a fascinating place. It doesn’t matter what people do to it.” Michael, who has three children, said: “My daughter would come out with me from time to time for a wee spin. We’d trek up country roads to seewe can find any or maybe I’ll have some place marked to check out. “I’ll maybe read around online about an area to seethere’s any stories relating to old mills, old schools. You can look at satellite images before you go. We’ll maybe have eight or  places marked.“These places that I’m going into, people don’t even know they’re out there. There’s hundreds of them. I mark them on my Google Maps – there’s five or six hundred on there to explore.”Michael said he has a bank of photos stored on his phone that he hasn’t shared yet: “If I didn’t go out for another three months I’d have enough to keep posting. “Looking back at some of my older photos, they aren’t great. I think I’ve got better. “In July or August I had , likes on the page, by December it had doubled, now I’m pushing towards ,. “It’s amazing because I’m not doing anything with it, I’m just publishing photos with a small bit of a story, I’m not promoting it or trying to make money from it.”Michael is quick to point out that he is not the first person to find beauty in the Province’s derelict properties. He said Abandonned NI set the benchmark for this sort of photography.Michael said his obsession was a year-round one: “I’ll be out in winter as well as summer. In winter it’s good because the foilage dies back and you’re able to see things that would previously have been hidden. I remember once crawling through a hole and the hedge to find this property that you’d never know was there.” Asked what led him to begin searching for old houses Michael said: “It was my son who got me started, it must have been about three or four years ago. “He showed me this video on YouTube of a guy in America who was exploring this derelict mansion that used to belong to a drug dealer. “It looked fantastic, all the broken windows and doors hanging off and the stuff that was left inside. “My son said we should try to find something like that here. I said, ‘you’re not going to get something on that scale but we’ll have a look’. “What we did was we went to Cairndhu which is near Larne. It’s pretty much where everybody that does this starts. It’s so well known, it’s such a tragic story of how it fell into such disrepair. It’s so vast. As soon as I got in I was hooked.”Cairndhu which was built around  is the former home of Sir Thomas Dixon. It became a convalescent home before it was closed in .Michael said: “There are people on social media who tell me about a derelict house near to them, sometimes it can be just a shell. For me that’s not that interesting. “What I find interesting is somewhere that has personal possessions still inside. It could be furniture, it could be letters, there’s houses you go into and you’d think people had just walked out and left everything still in it.Michael said his passion was driven more by what people had left behind inside the properties rather than the buildings themselves.He commented: “Some people would look at a man in his forties out exploring the country like this as stupid, but for me it’s just that sense of adventure. “It’s good to be out and about. It’s a healthy interest and no one is harmed.“It’s like how you feel when you’re a kid when you go out exploring. “I’m not sure I was even this adventurous as a kid. Maybe I’m making up for it now.“It’s that excitement of the unknown, that danger of not knowing what you’re going to find. That’s why I do it. “It’s those wee unassuming houses that look like nothing and you go in and they’re just filled with stuff. You find out all about the owners, the le that they led.”Discussing some of the remnants of the past he has uncovered, Michael said: “You see so many of the old Singer sewing machines.“There was one house where I found the shell of a Mk II Jag. I found an old ambulance as well.“For me the best finds are the wee personal things like a Valentine’s card or a kid’s note that says ‘mummy has been mean to me and daddy’ – you’re hoping that was just a wee fleeting moment.”He continued: “I try to capture those items as they sit to tell the story of the house. “I take the photos on my phone, maybe I’ll upgrade to a fancy camera someday though photographers will tell you it doesn’t matter what you use, it’s your eye for a photo.“People say to me they can imagine a story around my posts. In my wee blurb I’ll not give the location away unless it’s a well known building. I’ll just describe it a wee bit as best I can and let the pictures tell the story.”Offering suggestions as to why houses end up derelict yet full of possessions, he said: “A lot of the time you’ll get an elderly person who will pass away, they may have nobody to leave it to or they may leave it to the family and they can’t agree what to do with it so it just sits.“Sometimes you get people who buy the property for the adjoining land but don’t knock down the original property.”Some of the items left behindThe scene in an abandonned kitchenBoots no longer made for walkingThis cupboard remains well stockedAn Evening Prayer"},{"url":null,"title":"new ulster hockey kirk cup sponsorship deal to help raise funds for ni children s hospice","story":"Ahead of the final, NI Law Firm of the Year, Millar McCall Wylie, has announced a sponsorship deal with Ulster Hockey to back the competition through to the end of .Chief Operating Officer, Christopher McCandless said: ldquoWe are thrilled to be sponsoring the Kirk Cup, both this season and next.

I want to be in a position to make robust decisions on key issues and I hope Casement will be one of those.”Another key decision for Minister Mallon will be on the York Street Interchange, which was specied as a commitment for the Executive in the New Deal, New Approach document.“There was a procurement process that was challenged. We now have to commence that procurement process again,” she explained.“It certainly is an issue that needs to be addressed. Anyone who travels in that part of the city will know it is hugely congested when it comes to traffic. It is also bad for emissions and the climate which is one of my priorities.“I want to try and progress that but also balance it around connecting people and doing what we can to tackle the climate emergency.“The project is stated as commitment for the Executive but it also features in the New Deal New Approach and I very much welcome that commitment is in there.“Infrastructure is central to the new document and it recogniseswe are serious about transforming lives and ensuring people have real opportunities in areas were people are really struggling then we need to be investing in infrastructure.”As for a possible Glider extending to link South and North Belfast, Nichola saidone of her priorities is “about increasing public transport and people’s access to it”.“I have asked officials for an urgent briefing to see where that is but encouraging people to use public transport and encourage people to walk and cycle are priorities for me.”After three years of no Stormont Executive, Nichola said she is under no illusions to the challenges facing her around Infrastructure, including a huge backlog of work to tackle street lighting, potholes and climate change.“The financial situation that I have inherited is extremely challenging. If you look from , there have been systemic signicant budget cuts to the department.“One of the areas which has been affected has been street lighting and it is something I am very aware of. It is on people’s front doors and gives people a sense of safety and confidence.“If we want to make a dference to people’s lives, we need to address issues like street lighting and pot holes.“I would be hopeful of working with Minister Conor Murphy in the Department for Finance to secure more money to address some of these issues.“Pot holes is a big issue across the North and mainly due to budget cuts to the department. I want to try and address it.“I think we could be doing so much more in Belfast, especially around cycling. We need to encourage and facilitate parents who want to be able to walk their children to school. It will involve safety mechanisms but it is something I want to have a big conversation about with not only my officials but people as well. It is beneficial for the climate but also for people’s physical and mental health.”Asked about many people’s negative attitudes at -hour bus lanes in the city, the Minister stressed she is keeping an open mind but called for better conversations around such controversial issues.“It is about a balancing act. It is about encouraging people to use public transport but in a way to promote local businesses as well.“I have an open-door policy here and I want to engage with everyone. When we all put our heads together, that is when you get to a better place for policies and decision-making.”As for rumours of potential water charges being introduced for residents, she was quick to spell out her position.“The SDLP is opposed to water charges and I have been very quick to say that it won’t be the case under my watch.“I also welcome the fact both the First and Deputy First Minister have come out as well to say it also. I view my role as important in helping struggling families and not to add to their burden.”On a personal level, Nichola is “excited” about her role over the next two years but stressed she will not forget about her local constituents in North Belfast who elected her to Stormont in the first place.“It’s very exciting. It is a very big department. I think a lot of people think it’s just about roads but in actual fact, the department impacts on everyone’s daily lives.“Infrastructure covers things like whether houses can be built or not which is important because we have a housing crisis and other things like waste and water.“When you turn on your water tap, how you travel to and from school and work, MOT to ensure your vehicle is safe, road gritting in winter – all fall within the Department for Infrastructure.“I haven’t forgotten I am here only because the people of North Belfast elected me. I am keen while I take up this role I don’t lose sight of that and continue to be focused also on my constituency and the service I provide.“I will still be a familiar face around North Belfast. The reason that I got into politics is to serve people who put their faith in me.“I won’t lose sight of that and I am very clear that I want to be in the constituency and welcome people to still come to me with their problems and their issues because my job is to try and help them.“I am a parent too and for all parents, it is important to balance your work and your le. I am very lucky I have a supportive family. I look forward to family time and spending time with my children is important but I will do my absolute best in this role.”As for her hopes for her two-year tenure at the helm of Infrastructure, Nichola concluded: “I really want to make the most of these two years. I understand I am coming into a position where we haven’t taken decisions for three years so there is a backlog.“There are huge financial restraints but I really want to make an impact. At the end, I want to look back and ask what did I do to improve people’s lives, better connect people, have a thriving and balanced economy and an improved climate.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"janines wedding day is captured on camera","story":"WELL-known local woman Janine Howard will feature in tonight#s edition of the popular BBCNI documentary series, True North.‘Saving Face’ follows the story of -year-old Janine and her preparations for her marriage to fiancé Matthew Light in October.Janine was just two years old when she was diagnosed with leukaemia.

He has alerted the relevant authorities. The site is just yards from the St Gall’s GAC clubrooms. Belfast City Council waste bags, household fridges, cemetery headstones, construction rubble, wood and huge amounts of other waste have een dumped on to the land and the massive mound is sliding close to the Ballymurphy Stream.The land is known as Milltown Glen and is situated between Maguire’s Garage, Milltown Cemetery and the Bog Meadows.Michael Culbert of St Gall’s GAC said that the issue of land ownership needs to be claried. “There is a gateway that runs from Milltown Cemetery, a lane, and it’s that land that is being dumped on,” he said. “We want a clean environment, we care about the environment. We have all age groups at St Gall’s, from six-year-olds up and have been in this area for approximately  years. We have never seen the like of this. This is a beautul glen, you have the Bog Meadows and here it’s the epitome of fly tipping. This is going on in the heart of West Belfast and it’s not on. We need someone with responsibility to hold whoever is doing this to account for the contamination of this area. We don’t want the river polluted.“It needs to stop and it needs to be cleared up and now our local councillor Steven Corr has taken up this issue.”Ulster Wildle Nature Reserve Officer Deborah McLaughlin told the Andersonstown News that the dumping has got worse since the start of the New Year.“This is an absolute eyesore and I have contact DAERAin relation to it as a lot of the rubbish will end up in the stream,” she said. “We are concerned at the level of fly tipping going on and concerned for health and safety. DAERA are aware of the issue and at the minute we are waiting to hear back from them.”Local Sinn Féin Councillor Steven Corr said the illegal dumping is “destroying the landscape”.“What we are seeing is a localised environmental nightmare,” he went on. “We are only a few feet away from this stream being contaminated. I can’t get my head around why somebody thinks it’s ok to do this. There are lorry loads of rubbish being dumped down a riverbank, killing wildle as it goes. I’ve never seen anything like this, on this scale, in West Belfast. This is fly tipping on an industrial scale, there is industrial waste on the site, glass, headstones. There is confusion as to who is responsible for the land but we would be calling on the Rivers Agency and the NIEAto work with us. Belfast City Council have offered support as their bags are also being dumped on the site. This land needs to be secured as a matter of urgency.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"mclaughlin pays tribute to reds second half hunger","story":"CLIFTONVILLE boss Paddy McLaughlin paid tribute to his side’s second-half effort in their dramatic injury-time County Antrim Shield comeback win against Ballymena. The Reds battled back from Leroy Millar’s early opener in the second half to stage a smash-and-grab - win and McLaughlin felt his side emptied everything into their search for a route back into the game. “I’m delighted,” reflected McLaughlin. “You saw how much effort that players put into the second half and you’ve got to give Ballymena credit – they were good on the break, got their lead with a soft goal we gave away and they defended their lead really well. But you saw how much our boys put into the second half, they emptied their heart on to the pitch and gave us everything.“To get the equaliser, we were happy with that and to go into extra time because I thought the momentum was with us. But to go and win it a minute later was an incredible finish to the game. It’s a sore one for Ballymenayou’re a Ballymena fan or player tonight. I’m sure they’re going back absolutely devastated at losing the game in the th minute. Unfortunately someone had to lose and you don’t want to see young players going off with their heads down but you can’t take it away from our boys. They gave it everything and they probably slightly deserved it in the end.” McLaughlin refused to take any credit for substitutes Thomas Maguire and Ryan Curran popping up with the late goals, but he praised the duo for putting their personal disappointment to one side for the good of the team. “The players on the pitch did the business,” he added. “The players on the pitch worked Ballymena really hard, they tried their best to work opportunities, Ballymena defended brilliantly well, you can’t deny them that, but when the seven minutes went up we looked like we had a goal in us. I was just hoping it wasn’t going to be one of those days where it would be a sad story – could we have done this and should we have done that “I felt we would get one chance in that seven minutes and take it to extra time, I felt we were finishing the game the stronger. For Thomas [Maguire] and Ryan [Curran] to pop up, fair play to them because I’m sure they were disappointed not to be starting the game. They put their own personal disappointment to one side to go and do a job for the team.”Such was the intensity of that seven minutes of madness, McLaughlin was unable to remember his feelings during the late drama but acknowledged the backing of the Red Army and paid tribute to their “incredible” support. “I pulled two hamstrings running on to the pitch celebrating and anything after that, I don’t know what happened,” admits McLaughlin. “Your emotions take over you because you can see what it means to the players and what it means to the supporters. You can’t go through any interview and not talk about the supporters tonight. “That was incredible support that Cltonville brought tonight in the County Antrim Shield on a Tuesday night. I think there is only one team in the ision that has that support and it’s Cltonville. You saw what it meant to the players and supporters from the goals went in. My mind went blank straight away and only now am I settling down.”Tuesday’s victory ends a four-year wait for silverware and McLaughlin hopes it will give his players a taste for future success. “Sometimes the first trophy is the hardest one to get. “I didn’t come here to make up the numbers, I came here to try and establish Cltonville back as a contender for the ision and as a team who should be challenging to win trophies. “If I didn’t see that potential in them, I wouldn’t have come up,” said the Derry man. “When I see the quality within the playing squad and the support they get when things are going well, when I see how hard they work, I know they’ve got potential to win trophies. All that hard work’s been justied tonight. “It’s one trophy but we’re not going to rest on that, we want more. It’s such a young squad and for a lot of them it’s their first senior medals. Hopefully now they’ll get that appetite for success and to challenge for trophies even more and you never know where this team might go.” "},{"url":null,"title":"beers over brexit life goes on say belfast pub goers","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthsundayleEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It never did,\" he recalls.\"John would sometimes exclaim My God! or Oh Jesus! and Ian would jokingly reprimand him for taking the Lords name in vain, but that was the height of it.\"They always put \"Northern Ireland PLC\" first, Nicholson says. \"The constitutional issue didnt arise.\"This was mostly during direct rule. There was no Stormont executive. The three of us were the voice of Northern Ireland abroad.\"We worked together through awful times - the Shankill bomb, Greysteel and other atrocities. We had to learn a dferent style of politics in Europe.\"Our system at home was so combative. Over there, it was all about compromise. You realised you didnt always get your own way and you learned to make friends.\"Nicholson says his proudest moment came when the trio met the then European Commission president Jacques Delors in  after the IRA ceasefire.\"Delors said, What can I do for you gentlemen  We said Its what you can do for the people of Northern Ireland. They need help from the bottom up. Out of that meeting came the EUs Peace and Reconciliation Fund which has delivered over bn for Northern Ireland.\"Naomi LongAlliance leader Naomi Long wore suffragette colours - purple and green - as she delivered her final speech in Brussels on Wednesday.\"I wanted to mark how far Northern Ireland has travelled,\" she says. \"I grew up watching three male MEPs representing us. We left the EU represented by three women.\"Elected eight months ago, Long was just starting to find her way around the parliament. \"I got lost loads of times,\" she laughs. \"Its a vast and confusing place at first. I got locked in the Visitors Centre one night. I had to take photos on my mobile phone and send them to my assistant to come and rescue me.\"Long previously sat at Westminster as East Belfast MP. \"The Brussels parliament had the feel of an airport terminal,\" she says.\"The House of Commons is very dferent. Its steeped in history. Its beautul and atmospheric but the chamber is small and it can be very crowded.\"The European parliament was built for purpose. Its much more civilised and comfortable. You had your own seat and desk.\"I liked the u-shaped chamber compared to the oppositional Commons. Everything in Brussels was about being inclusive and securing a consensus, not just a majority. I will take that away with me and I hope we can do it at Stormont.\"Long describes the parliaments Brexit co-ordinator Guy Verhofstadt as \"a real character\".\"If people think I talk a lot, they need to hear him. He wasnt always helpful in what he said but he did do battle for Northern Ireland\".The \"most intriguing\" MEP Long met was the Brexit Partys Claire Fox. She was \"a left-winger in a right-wing party. I felt she was a person of genuine principle when so many of her colleagues were just there for the publicity and the ride.\"She genuinely engaged with the Remain argument. She was intellectually stimulating but politically frustrating for me.\"Long describes the journey to Strasbourg - where the European parliament sat one week a month - as \"a camel trek\". It involved \"numerous planes, trains and automobiles\" and could take up to  hours.Michel Barnier and Diane DoddsDUP MEP Diane Dodds agrees and says the parliament should \"be like every other one and sit in one place\".She accuses the EU of double standards: \"It aims to become a zero carbon economy by  but it adds signicantly to its own carbon footprint by the travelling circus of moving from Brussels to Strasbourg once a month.\"Being an MEP meant \"a very transient lestyle\", Dodds says. She was first elected when her daughter Robyn was . \"It was dficult for both of us. Sometimes I tried to come home mid-week but that wasnt always possible.\"Like other MEPs, she lived for years in hotels - not apartments - in Brussels and Strasbourg. \"I didnt mind. Im a relaxed person. I dont fuss,\" she adds.Having grown up on a farm, the highs of her MEP role was whenever the focus was on agriculture. The lows were the  Brussels airport and metro station bombs which killed  people, and the  Strasbourg Christmas market attack.Dodds says: \"After the airport bomb, Arlene Foster and Peter Robinson rang me to seeI was okay. I was in my office on the phone when I heard a thud.\"Another bomb had gone off at the metro nearby. I dont think Brussels has ever recovered its equilibrium.\"Two years later, I was sitting in a restaurant in Strasbourg with staff after visiting the Christmas market when suddenly police burst in, turned off the lights and ordered us away from the windows. A gunman had shot dead five people in the next street.\"Martina AndersonLike Dodds, Sinn Fein MEP Martina Anderson found the journey to Strasbourg taxing. \"During Storm Brendan, it took me  hours and four flights to get there - from Belfast to Cardf to Paris to Amsterdam to Strasbourg. It was a demanding job, and you had to be up for it,\" she says.There were other challenges. \"My mother Betty had Alzheimers and we cared for her at home. Near the end, it was very dficult,\" Anderson says.\"Three times, she was at deaths door. I got phone calls to come home and I thought I wouldnt make it. I was terried she would die before I got to hold her one last time.\"My husband put the phone to her ear so I could talk to her. She pulled through twice. The third time, she didnt but I did make it home to be with her before she passed away.\"Another \"awful time\" was in  when Anderson was told Martin McGuinness had died. \"I headed to the airport immediately. I was distraught. It was the worst journey of my le. I just wanted to be with him as he was brought home,\" she says.\"I was too upset to drive. A friend came to Dublin Airport to pick me up. Im sure the speed limit was broken many times. As we came down the flyover we could see Martins coffin coming to Free Derry Corner. I just got out of the car and ran to the cortege.\"Anderson is most proud of \"working so hard with the EU to get them to understand that the Good Friday Agreement had to be protected in all its part and of securing a protocol to the Withdrawal Agreement ensuring there will be no hardening of the border\".In her Brussels office, she had a photo of a Derry GAA team, Ballymenas coat of arms - a gt from a cross-community delegation - and portraits of  leader Countess Markievicz and trade unionist Jim Larkin.\"Ive taken them home with me but Ive left my clothes and other bits and pieces with charities in Brussels for those in need,\" she says.Jim AllisterTUV leader and former barrister Jim Allister was a DUP MEP for five years. He found the travelling made the job \"surprisingly more exhausting than being at the Bar even though it was much less intellectually demanding\".Living in a hotel four nights a week was a \"big adjustment\", he says, \"although Im not sureit was a burden or a relief to my we Ruth\".He adored Strasbourg. \"It had a stunning historic centre on the River Ill, a beautul cathedral and some nice parks. It was lovely in summer but very cold in winter,\" he says.\"Outside of Grand Place, there wasnt much to like in Brussels.\"Allister says while he went to Brussels \"a Eurosceptic and left an even stronger one as a result of what I saw\", it was still \"a great privilege to stand up and speak on behalf of my country and I took it seriously\".He felt the multiplicity of languages killed the parliament as a debating chamber.\"It was a stilted place. The interpreters are very skilled but theres still a natural lag between the spoken word and when you hear it in your ear,\" he says. \"It ruled out the cut and thrust of debate.\"The other thing I struggled with was the restricted speaking time. Your mic was turned ofyou went over two minutes. Saying what you wanted became an art.\"Allister sat near Nigel Farage whom he came to know well. \"Hes a fantastic orator - he has it down to a tee. He was utterly fearless, I had a lot of time for him.\"Fond farewell: Nigel Farage in celebratory mood at the EU Parliament this week but Diane Dodds is more reservedSo did the teetotal TUV leader socialise with Farage who is known for his love of a pint  \"We had the occasional meal together. But no, I didnt go out on the tear with him as you put it.\"He was also impressed with Tanaiste Simon Coveney when he was an MEP and Fine Gaels Mairead McGuinness. They were \"very knowledgeable\" on agriculture and \"made their mark\".He didnt rate Sinn Fein president Mary Lou McDonald. \"She sat on the far side of the chamber with the communist brigade. She was in the early stages of her career. I never thought she was someone who would go far,\" he says.\"Her contributions were mediocre. She would now appear more capable than she came across then so maybe the European Parliament just wasnt her thing.\"The TUV leader didnt warm to then EU Commissioner Lord Mandelson who was his \"usual aloof self\".Allisters time as an MEP was dominated by the Lisbon Treaty which he had strenuously opposed.\"I stood up for British sovereignty but I was swimming against the tide.\"I saw Denmark, Holland and the Republic reject the Treaty but the EU wouldnt take no for an answer. Brussels bared its teeth and bludgeoned them into changing their minds.\"I was a dissident voice on the constitutional affairs committee against the encroaching bureaucracy. Its a role with which Im entirely comfortable,\" he adds.Lord KilclooneyLord John Kilclooney was a UUP MEP from -. He would often invite high-profile MEPs to Northern Ireland. Danish parliamentarian Kent Kirk, who invaded British fishing waters in his boat in , came to meet the fishermen in Annalong, Kilkeel and Portavogie.Kilclooneys most famous guest was Austrian MEP Otto von Habsburg, a devout Catholic who had helped eject Paisley from the parliament after he challenged the pope. \"I took Otto to meet Cardinal O Fiach in Armagh,\" Lord Kilclooney recalls.\"We arrived in an RUC car. OFiach came down the marble staircase totally overdressed in his full regalia.\"It was am and he said to Otto Will have you a wee one  I said Well just have coffee and OFiach replied What kind of an Irishman are you \"As the UK bids au revoir to the EU, Northern Irelands -year relationship with Brussels comes to a close. When politics at home was bitter, it was usually dferent over there. We will all surely miss the colour, the controversy and, most of all, the characters."},{"url":null,"title":"how northern ireland business figures felt about brexit then and now","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthsundayleEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

In , business is still coming to terms with the result and its impact. There is an overriding sense of dismay at the situation we find ourselves in. While NI Chamber and others have been working hard to ensure the best deal for business, as the transition period begins, uncertainty about trade and export has not been addressed and companies remain in the dark on too many crucial issues.Mark O’Connell, Chief executive, OCO GlobalNI in good position to take advantageMark O’Connell, Chief executive, OCO GlobalThen: I thought it was a bad idea in , and the intervening period had hardened my views. But you have to look at it from dferent perspectives. From the hard Right Brexiteer who felt left behind and blames immigration and European integration for their hardships then it promises a new dawn, while for the liberal elite establishment of the UK - intellectuals, artists and business leaders - it isolates and damages Britains voice and influence in the world and access to EU funding in RD and cultural collaboration.Now: Most UK business lobby groups are relieved that our internal argument is coming to an end and the uncertainty that has stled investment decisions may soon be over. Few international companies are enthused about Brexit and many have already voted with their feet and stalled investment or relocated. Northern Ireland is potentially in a very good position to take advantage of the one country, two systems status it now finds itself in.Glyn Roberts Chief executive, Retail NIThere will be no celebrating todayGlyn Roberts Chief executive, Retail NIThen: During that election campaign Retail NI campaigned for Remain vote. We had expressed concern with the likely impact Brexit would have - the disruption for the economy and all that goes with it.Now: We do have real concerns about the west-east and east-west trade for businesses, but we have to accept that Brexit is now happening and we have to make the best out of what is going to be a dficult and challenging situation. Were halfway through the Brexit process and we still need to get a trade deal.By no means are we out yet and our worry is getting the trade deal done in this short space of time is going to be a huge challenge.There will certainly be no celebrating today. Our priority has to be that all of the relationships and networks we have built up over  years will remain. It is the worlds biggest single market. While we are facing the Brexit situation with great trepidation we need a big bold radical plan for the economy and how we move forward.Richard Kennedy, Chief executive, DevenishWe need to ensure frictionless tradeRichard Kennedy, Chief executive, DevenishThen: When the news came through in June  that the people of the United Kingdom had voted to leave the European Union, my initial reaction was one of extreme disappointment. As an international company with ambitious growth plans outside of our home markets, I knew it would have a huge impact on us, and the local economy.Now: At Devenish we have been preparing for Brexit since the result was announced. There have been many twists and turns since then and we have been monitoring the situation closely, refining those plans along the way.Leaving the EU without a deal would have been disastrous for the agri-food industry. The Withdrawal Agreement is far from perfect, but it ends much of the uncertainty that has been a constant throughout this process.We need to ensure that an agreement is reached between the UK and EU that maintains a frictionless trading relationship between the two.Phillip Logan, Director, Algram Modern Living, ex-DUP MLANow there is a bit more certaintyPhillip Logan, Director, Algram Modern Living, ex-DUP MLAThen: I campaigned on a personal level to leave from the sovereignty point of view, and identity point of view. From my point of view it was mainly down to identity and having control of our own laws.Now: Its certainly brought a little bit of uncertainty and that has had an effect on business. But Westminster messed about on the issue for too long, failing to implement what people wanted. But since Westminster moved on with Brexit, confidence has come back, and there is a bit more certainty. We havent seen any increase in cost prices relating to Brexit. But there is still a long road ahead. However, I have no regrets. We will be more successful.Liam Duffy, CEO and owner, Classic Mineral WaterBrexit could easily have been avoidedLiam Duffy, CEO and owner, Classic Mineral WaterThen: My views are that Brexit was a very poor decision back in  which was based on misinformation on the leave side and the remain side not doing enough work to ensure it didnt happen. It very easily could have been avoided.Now: In  my views have not changed. Its still a poor decision. I havent spoken to one businessperson in the past three and a half years who is happy with Brexit, nor have I heard anybody set out the advantages in a plausible and rational manner. Were lucky to be able to source our raw materials here in Northern Ireland so we will not be relying on importing these from across the border."},{"url":null,"title":"belfast telegraph transfer test guide reveals scores accepted by every northern ireland school","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthsundayleEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

We have considered other sanctions but after taking everything into account dismissal is the only appropriate sanction to be taken”.The Grocery Store Manager told the Labour Court: “The reason she was dismissed was because she attended her belly-dancing class while she should have been at work”.Dunnes stated that Ms Kipli conducted the class knowing that she would get paid under the companys sick leave scheme.Ms Kipli’s solicitor submitted that the entire process – beginning with the back-to-work meeting of May th  - that culminated in Ms Kipli’s summary dismissal was unfair and that the decision to dismiss her pre-determined.The Labour Court found that the deficiencies in Dunnes’s procedures were not of such gravity as to imperil the fairness of the process to dismiss Ms Kipli.The Labour Court found that Ms Kipli had admitted that she had both attended and taught the dance class having first denied that she had done so."},{"url":null,"title":"maldives rejoins the commonwealth","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthsundayleEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Football clubs, Brooke Park Bowling Club, users of the fitness suite, youth groups and dog walkers from the local community aired their views at a public meeting yesterday evening. It was chaired by People Before Profit councillor Shaun Harkin and council officials were on hand to provide a response to any queries. Independent councillors Gary Donnelly and Sean Carr were in attendance as well as SDLP Councillor Mary Durkan. Mr Harkin began by saying that Derry City  Strabane District Council must be more “transparent” about its plans for the site as there had been rumours circulating that the old leisure centre may be demolished to make way for parking facilities. googletag.cmd.push Dalton Kehoe, of Rosemount Resource Centre, said speculation had emerged that a new centre may be built at the old Foyleville Day centre. Issues verbalised at the meeting centred around the top section of Brooke Park which includes the leisure centre, G and grass pitches and parking facilities. They included the need for additional changing facilities for the outdoor pitches, proper maintenance of those pitches, the need for new equipment in the gym and the possibility of reduced prices for community groups. The prospect of increased opening hours to bring the park in line with tier one facilities such as Templemore Sports Complex and Foyle Arena was also to council officials. googletag.cmd.push Rosemount residents also highlighted concerns around excessive dog fouling in the park and the need to fine those responsible. A recent letter from football coach, Paul Roddy, fast-tracked the meeting which had originally been scheduled last October but was pushed back due to Westminster elections. Speaking at the meeting, Head of Community Development at Derry City  Strabane District Council Barry O’Hagan recognised that errors have been made in the past and that Brooke Park Leisure Centre should have been consolidated on one site. He added that to increase opening hours, to purchase extra equipment and offer concessions for youth groups would have to be paid for somehow, and would likely lead to increased rates. Mr O’Hagan went on to say that he and other council officials are happy to speak to community groups to take on board their grievances. He made it clear that no decision has been made to close the old leisure centre but recognised that upgrades are required. Mr Roddy said that groups which have used the facilities for years have been left out in the cold. He said the standard of facilities in Derry wouldn’t be accepted in Belfast or Magherafelt where his team recently played. “They would laugh at us, it’s ridiculous.” He believes that the grass pitch should be at intermediate standard with dug outs and a standing area for supporters and suggested that council needs to be more pro-active in terms of development. One service user said that people have left Brooke Park to train where because of the reduced weekend opening hours. He had asked about the possibility of Brooke Park opening earlier and was ignored, but he said when Templemore temporarily closed, its users were accommodated at Brooke Park and it opened earlier. Cllr Donnelly said that was unacceptable and suggested a proposal could be brought before the council to bring opening times at tier two facilities in line with tier one centres. It was agreed that a motion could be brought before the council about Brooke Park facilities but that the community must be fully consulted beforehand with another public meeting organised shortly to allow more people to have their say.

Carpooling is the sharing of car journeys so that more than one person travels in a car and prevents the need for others to have to drive to a location themselves. Advantages are plentul, the reduced number of cars on the road is more environmentally friendly, it eases traffic congestion, travel costs are shared with other riders and it reduces stress by allowing you to read, listen to music, or relax when youre not driving. In addition, it saves time, prolongs the le of your vehicle and allows you to meet new people. googletag.cmd.push Millions of people car share across Europe but there is a reluctance to do so in Ireland and Britain. Well-travelled Spaniard, Venancio Calero moved to Derry two years ago from Alicante in Spain. He gained a PhD in Physics from a French university and now works as an engineer at Seagate Technology. His passion in le is travelling and he has moved around the world, residing in several European countries. In his view, there is a missed opportunity in Derry for carpooling, Venancio explained: “I am trying to promote a non-profit initiative for carpooling around the city. “Carpooling is something that I really miss from the countries I have lived before Spain, France, Germany and Poland, and I think in Derry it could be really convenient especially when connecting to the centre and west of Ireland. googletag.cmd.push “However, the available pages here are really mis-used, and it would be greatDerry would focus on one and find the travel offers there and the people start to try carpooling. The name of the page is ‘Northwest Carpooling’. “Ive published on some pages and groups across Derry, it has got some audience, but still not enough to really connect to people and get their trust.” He added: “I think that Derry misses big opportunities since the standard carpooling sites are not being used and the travel offers on those sites are negligible. “For me, it is a pity since without car it is sometimes dficult to reach most of the cities or towns around Ireland on a short travel time. It sometimes becomes even double the time with the current offers. “A centralised carpooling site for Derry would make mobility much easier across Northern Ireland, but also will ease the travelling to the centre and the west south-west of Ireland. “I find that carpooling is also the best way to travel for those who like to socialise and have to make long trips with their own cars, in addition to save travel costs and makes mobility more efficient for the environment. “I’m hoping that people from Derry will give attention to carpooling, start to share their trips and it will start to become a popular way to travel around. I think Derry could also become a good hub for carpooling and reaching the city from dferent locations will be much easier than it is now.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Evidence provided by a senior departmental official to Stormonts Economy Committee revealed the full extent of “dficulties” facing Ulster University in the development of its Belfast campus. Heather Cousins from the Department for the Economywas questioned about problems with the Belfast campus by MLAs on the committee. Ulster Universityhas requested a loan of poundm from DfE to complete its Belfast campus. The NI Audit Office had previously said the final cost was expected to be poundm over budget. googletag.cmd.push It emerged that overspend at the Belfast campus would now impact on commitments made in the New Decade New Approach document to expand UU’s Magee campus to , students. Latest figures available show the campus has , students, , of which are full-time. Speaking at the meeting, SDLP MLA for Foyle, Sinead McLaughlin, said a business case for overall Magee expansion aimed at attracting , full-time students has been submitted but Ms Cousins informed her that it has expired and a new one is required. The meeting was told that UU was asked for it last year but its council was not in a position to provide it and Ms Cousins said the major capital project in Belfast will have to be delivered before anything  happens. googletag.cmd.push In response, Mrs McLaughlin commented: “You’re saying quite categorically that a new business case is required for the expansion of Magee because the business case is not fit for purpose nor do you have confidence in their ability to deliver it at this time.” When told that summary was correct in the “short-term”, Mrs McLaughlin added: “What is short-term to you  Because in Derry we’ve been waiting sixty years for this.” Ms Cousins again stated that an updated business case must be submitted as the current one “doesn’t stack up”. The “very out-of-date” case amounted to poundm in capital funding and poundm resource “that we just do not have and unless there’s new money it’s hard to see how that will happen because when there is new money it goes to health and schools.” There is no “skills balance” in the country, the SDLP representative argued, as it is all centred around the East. “We need all of NI to work, therefore our skills strategy and funding and resources need to be put to good use throughout NI.”  ‘Stringent conditions’ Mrs McLaughlin also asked about the review of further and higher education and MaSN places. At present, NI’s higher education system’s capacity is managed through the maximum student numbercontrol mechanism, under which the number of full-time undergraduate students at each institution is restricted. The DfE official indicated thatthere were full fees then a cap on student numbers would not be needed. Universities are given a total number of places and it is up to them how they are distributed. There are “stringent conditions” in place for Ulster University to pay back the public funds. The amount is so high because the university got into “dficulties” and assurances are needed that that it will manage its finances in future, Ms Cousins explained. As part of the business case put forward there was a report that showed the vulnerability of UU’s finances in general. Ulster University Belfast is now running to a revised schedule of  when it will be complete with a projected overspend of poundm – that will be drawn down over two years. UU must then repay that loan. It will be under “closer scrutiny” but because universities are autonomous bodies they are responsible for the management of their projects. “The measures that we’re putting in place now are because of the dficulties that they’ve got in to which also impacts on their financial stability and as a department we are more concerned with their financial stability than anything  which is why we are recommending the additional loan and conditions attached to it,” Ms Cousins said. She went on to say that UU has to demonstrate its financial sustainability and capability of its council and senior management. Oversight The meeting was told that the department was aware that things were going wrong in the past year. It was not receiving regular reports and the university council was not getting information. UU did not ask for assistance until recently when business cases were produced. DfE has confidence that an appropriate project director is in place but caveated that by saying it is “not without risk” because “fit out and IT” costs are still needed. Independent MLA Claire Sugden said there should have been better oversight to ensure the project didn’t run so badly over-budget. Revealing it is unprecedented, Ms Cousins said there have been major capital projects at both universities and the department has never taken these steps before. In answer to another question from Ms Sugden, she said UU provided medical school business case but were required to provide an additional case on the medical workforce which is not yet completed. Until that’s done the department of health can’t make recommendations about the medical school. Sinn Feacutein MLA John O’Dowd also pointed out that it would now cost poundm rather than poundm which was the projected overall cost stated in committee members’ documents and questioned why the university had been given additional leeway.

Creator, Tony McCourt, , said a similar Facebook page exists for the Brandywell area so he felt it was only right to set one up for Creggan.  Within a day it had , members and less than a week later it has amassed over ,. Built in the s, Creggan is one of Derry’s best-known estates. It has been home to an abundance of artistic and sporting talent, including Olympic athletes, a Eurovision winner, a Top Ten rock band and international footballers. googletag.cmd.push In the late s and early s, Creggan became a byword for political resistance all over the world. On the Memories of Creggan Facebook page, people have been sharing cherished photos of relatives, historically signicant portraits of the Troubles, images of friends playing on the street, tales of famed characters from the estate, all sorts of myths and legends true and untrue, and everything in between. Former Creggan residents who have emigrated all over the world, including those from America and Australia, have joined the page to reminisce and share old tales from their childhood. “Everybody is enjoying it,” Tony explained, “they’re all sharing old memories.” googletag.cmd.push Friends contacted Tony to tell him that they can’t get their mothers off the page, one of the ladies is -years-old and is “loving all the old photos so much”. He added: “They’ve said they’re getting no housework done and no wains are being watched because they’re all too busy on the page. People are talking about their schooldays and friends who haven’t been in touch for many years are reconnecting.”  Memories Tony spent most of his childhood in Creggan and lived there until he got married at the age of . His brother, Peggy, still lives in Creggan and Tony has happy memories of “great neighbours and friends”. “The page brings back good memories. Nobody had anything but everybody shared what they had with each other.” The Troubles were never far from peoples’ minds, and people had their own troubles, but Tony prefers to recall the joyful times. “There was a lot of heartbreak at that time. But I like to remember all the positive experiences I had growing up. Playing football in the street all day when there were barely any cars around. “I remember the first TV on the street, it was the Kennedy’s and we used to go in to watch the FA Cup final. I also remember watching Popeye and the Lone Ranger. “I had a bad leg at one time and I remember a friend of mines carrying me to Grianan Fort and back again.” Moving forward, Tony would simply like to see people use the page in a positive way. “There are no real rules, we’re just asking people to keep it clean and to refrain from any insults. “Everyone is finding it funny going through all the old photos and that’s what it’s all about.” With that said Tony was off to the attic to unearth a few more boxes of photographic treasures from his boyhood.  ‘Heroes’ Peggy McCourt has lived in Creggan Heights for sixty-two years, asked what the estate means to him, he proclaimed: “Creggan means community.” He explained: “It was tight-knit no one had very much but what they had they shared be it a cup of milk to a drop of sugar, or can you lend me ma three slices of bread. “We all grew up in the Creggan, most of the families came from the Springtown Camp so hardship was a way of le but they made sure their wains were fed and watered, even going without themselves. “Then came the civil rights movement, then a full-blown war on the streets but again the Creggan community rallied around those who were affected by the conflict. “So many young people were first interned just because they were Catholic, many were arrested, put though interrogation centres and ended up in prison.” Peggy continued: “The hunger strikes took their toll on many families but no matter what went on Creggan grew into the best estate in Derry – in the world. “Growing up was hard at the time we lost so many friends and family members but it was a fun place to grow up, friendships formed that still last to this day. The friends I had sixty odd years ago are as strong as when we first met.  “No video games, all street games, football, rounders, even cricket, hopscotch, all these plus many more sitting out till  or  telling ghost stories, then you ran home the living day lights scared out of you. “Creggan is more than a council estate, its a way of le, its in your blood, we don’t even have to look anywhere for heroes, Creggan is full of them they are called ma’s and da’s.”   If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Here is a player by player look at Magherafelts performance. Peter McKinney – It was a third clean sheet in five competitive games and this one was well earned. His save from Tiernan Kierans was one of the main reasons why they won. His handling was top notch, he saved two earlier efforts and kicked intelligently. Finn Diamond – Missed the win over Cavan but was a welcome ee to the St Marys defence. Was given the job of picking up Niall McKenna. While the Monaghan man notched three points from play, Diamond added to the Magherafelt attack with his runs forward. He played the pass for McElhennons point. googletag.cmd.push Matthew McNeill – Went up against Lochlainn Power. He did have help from Eoin McEvoy but he held the Macartans man scoreless. Got forward, used the ball well and was imposing in the air. Made a brilliant block to deny Power and really stepped up in extra-time. Shea McSorley – Picked up Michael Hamill initially who mainly played deep and it left McSorley to sweep back in front of the defenceanyone  attacked. Was perfectly positioned to pick up a breaking ball from the last Monaghan high ball pumped in, hoping to engineer a late goal. Eoin McEvoy – Played as the sweeper against the wind in the first-half to close down the space but still got forward when he could. Was positioned more in the wing back area in the second-half and had a huge role in Magherafelts comeback including an inspirational effort when they trailed by three points. googletag.cmd.push Conleth Mallon – Gave away height to Conor McCooey before he eventually dropped off to play deeper. He had to find the balance between getting forward. Playing at wing-forward in the second-half. Saw plenty of possession, rarely wasted it and kicked an important score. Johnny McErlain – Started at centre-back and with McEvoy behind, it allowed him to hold the middle and push forward to midfield. In extra-time, he played as the sweeper and his presence never gave Monaghan a snf of the goal they needed to save the game. His long ball led to Kevin McNicholls point. POLL Who was tour man of the match  Click here... Aidan McCluskey – Began at wing-back on Darragh Treanor but morphed into a more central role as the game wore on. Was off-target from frees but always had the courage to have a go. Never shirked the responsibility. His point levelled matters mid-way through the second-half. Eunan Quinn – Started at midfield on Dylan Ballantine. Had a strong first-half where he won kick-outs and presented himself for the pass coming from defence. Struggled to impose himself in the second-half and was replaced with  minutes remaining. Dan Higgins – He took his goal with the composure of a veteran. Only for a last ditch tackle, he couldve added a second in the next play. Put himself about well at midfield and was able to get forward to add a point. He won McErlains high ball in lead-up to McNicholls point and set-up Callum Ormsby for the clinching second goal. Eunan McElhennon – Sliced over a classy score, into the breeze, to get the Convent off the mark. He was a brilliant link man in the counter-attacking side of their game. He was always looking to get involved in the play and made an inch-perfect interception when the result hung in the balance. Ryan McKenna – It was his kick that handed Magherafelt the passport to Clones and he once again delivered when the pressure was on. Missed a few chances and did a lot on unselfish running to get on the ball. With his teams hopes resting on this shoulders, he slotted over the th minute equaliser to force extra-time. Sean Duffin – Played much of the game at wing-forward where he won a dficult possession that led to Conleth Mallons first-half point. Found it more dficult to get on the ball in the second-half and was replaced by Callum Ormsby. Conhuir Johnston – He may only be in Year  but he certainly didnt show it. Played up front with Kevin McNicholl and led the line. St Marys began extra-time on the front foot and his confident strike put them ahead on their way to victory. Kevin McNicholl – Lost the first two balls to Ronan Boyle but continued to show and proved to be an effective ball winner. Always took the right option, was comfortable on the ball and was rewarded with a point during Magherafelts purple match in the final quarter. SUBS Callum Ormsby – Came in for Sean Duffin and emphatically hammered home the second Magherafelt goal. Ryan McEldowney – Brought on for Eunan Quinn and was unlucky to miss a chance to level the game before McKennas last gasp heroics in normal time. Caolan Crozier – Replaced Kevin McNicholl at half-time in extra-time and gave fresh legs. Joe McVey – Played the last  minutes after coming in for Ronan McKenna. Conor Fowley – A stoppage time replacement for Shea McSorley. MATCH REPORT - St Marys - St Macartans -. Click here...

It’s not an easy thing to do but the plan is on February  and  from pm to pm in the Nerve Centre there will be a photography exhibition, short film showcases and, obviously, a gig. The event will be a creative arts festival following the completion of the Education Authority’s CADi scheme that provides young people with qualications and key skills in the creative arts such as film, live sound, photography, graphic design and events management. Live sound is underlined because, obviously, it’s the most important thing in the world.The festival will contain an exhibition of photography, showcase of short films and two days of music including  bands highlighting the musical talent throughout Northern Ireland. googletag.cmd.push  PICTURED: Megan Watton and Oisin Clenaghan. This celebration of youth culture has been completely organised by the young people involved with the CADi project to showcase youth within the arts. This should be just about enough to keep the adults interested.Featured acts include Villa in FranceGrace Mullan,Vanilla Days, Meeks, Wasted Wild,Juno Hasson and Aimee Tourish, a bit of trad from Jordan Lively and songstress Maya Patterson, all who have been paving their way through the music scene across the north coast and Derry and in recent months.I spoke to one of the organisers, Megan Watton, and first asked what does CADi mean and what made you all want to do it in the first place  “Well, I joined three years ago it stands for Creative And Digital Innovation.“The course is one year and you get an OCN level one, two or three, depending on what age you are which is the equivalent to an A level or GCSE. “I, personally, wanted to do it because it would give me new skills and quality’s I could use in the future. It has been a programme run by the education Authority for three years and the numbers grow each year The Nerve Centre has been a fantastic help as they provide the tutors of each discipline events management, film, photography, graphic design and sound.They also have connections in the music scene which helps when booking bands,” she added. “Just that this programme has aided so many young people with their mental health and self-confidence and the out of school conditions helps. Without CADiI wouldn’t have gotten into my tech course.” Ethan Martin, who also helped organise it, said: “CADi means working with others in a small group to achieve the same goal. It’s been hard as we had to learn how to run an event, the Nerve Centre has been a huge help.”Events manager team member Clodagh McKenna, said: “The CADi Youth Takeover is an event for young people by young people. “It’s a chance to show how talented the youth of Northern Ireland is particularly in its music scene which has so many hidden gems. It also contains amazing work from the photographers, and film makers from the CADi programme.“CADi is a cross community programme aimed to give young people aged - the opportunity to gain skills in areas they wouldn’t usually get an opportunity to within school. “These include photography, graphic design, live sound , film and events management. The bulk of the programme consists of three residential weekends which lead up to the final event.“We’ve worked hard over the past couple of months to produce an event we hope the public will love. CADi really is like a second family to lots of us and you can see that when we come together. “We’ve created friends and memories that will last a letime.” AdultMarty Coyle said: “The CADi courses are a fantastic opportunity for young people to get some real-le experience in arts related subjects whilst gaining a qualication at the same time. “The upcoming two-day event at Nerve Centre will showcase the hard work they have put in throughout the course, showcase their own work as well as presenting a broad demographic of their peers within the arts throughout Northern Ireland”.

I got this cold off all the little two and three year olds in nursery, not that I actually wanted it you understand. Of course I understand we can’t keep our children off nursery because of a snfle, butthey’ve a proper cold with coughs, sneezes and that yucky green stuff it means they are not well - not well enough to be in nursery. For just as I didn’t want this cold neither did they, but because a few decided to come in with their nasty cold germs, with the yucky green stuff, we’ve now all had it - thanks. googletag.cmd.push Of course, I understand this is not the children’s fault but, and sorry to say, it is down to those few parents who think ‘go to nursery however snotty and yucky you may be’. So I’m writing this article, for a few reasons, the first to say please do keep your child off nursery they aren’t well, it’s no fun for them and no fun for anyone  when they get the bug too. I know le can be hard with a sickly child, I know how much we need that break sometimes but please, please keep your bugs at home. googletag.cmd.push My next reason is to share with you some tips, ideas and thoughts that I’ve heard and used over the years to help with coughs, cold’s and sneezes, please do remember though I am not a doctor soyou decide to use one of these ideas that I’m passing along to you then do check with a pharmacist or doctor that is is okay to do this with your baby, toddler and  or child. . DO make your child wear a vest or t-shirt under their jumper. Believe me I have met a few children this winter who just wear t-shirts, and always look and feel cold, winter clothes are for winter and summer clothes for summe.!  . TEACH your toddler how to blow through their nose, yes literally show them how to blow, this makes runny noses so much easier to manage. Yes of course you have to hold the tissue for them, butthey can blow then that means less of the runny stuff.  . DO put a little vaseline around their noses when your little one has a cold - this stops their nose getting sore, but also makes it sooo much easier to wipe. . Do keep this little pot of vaseline just for their nose though. . TREAT, some people do use medicines, paracetamol, baby Sudafed etc and this is a personal choice, it’s up to you as parents. But as my mum said, ‘with medicine the cold will be there a week, without medicine it’ll be there for a week’. The medicines are designed to make your little one feel better, they won’t necessarily cure the cold. Remember you know your child best, whether this be they need a little something, or an appointment at the doctor.  . WHEN your little one goes to nursery do pack a spare outfit including socks, shoes or wellies and trousers - not for toilet accidents but because it is till nice to play outside but it can be wet or muddy and it is not nice to sit about later in damp clothes.  . HELP your two and three year olds learn how to blow their nose AND put the tissue in the bin not back in the box- it is a skill and does need practise but the sooner they learn the more comfortable they feel. . TEMPERATURE, a normal temperature in babies and children is about .C but this can y slightly. A fever is usually considered to be a temperatureof C or above’ . It is handy to have a thermometer at home for these worrying times - do ask for advice from a pharmacist about which is best to buy and easiest to use. But always be mindful of your little one’s temperaturethey are poorly - and especially mindful with babies.  . PLEASE don’t wipe their nose with kitchen roll - this can make it sore, use tissues with balm in them - yes I know they can be more expensive but bargain shops do great deals.Be careful wiping noses with wet wipes as some can sting - soft tissues and vaseline don’t! . EXTRA, sometimes people use a vapour, like Vicks, to rub onto their baby, toddler or child’s chest, or feet, these can be soothing when applied to the body but you can also get them as a humidier, or as an oil to pop in the bath - it’s up to you to choose what is right for your little one. Please do be aware that there are age restrictions on them and not all are suitable for all ages.  . DO make your child wear a coat and a hat for very cold weather and maybea scarf and glovesit’s very chilly.  . DON’T force your child to eat too muchthey are poorly, little and often is best, snotty noses can often lead to sickly tummy’s, but do make sure they are getting plenty of fluids so they do not become dehydrated, water, water and more water or failing that juice. . . EVEN though it’s cold outside and your little may be full of cold sometimes a walk in the fresh air for a short time can help - fresh air can make you feel better and help your little one sleep better too - just remember to wrap up warm.  . DO encourage your little one to eat lots of vegetables and fruit, all the time not just when they have a cold, these are full of vitamins that will help them to develop a good immune system. Fingers crossed these few little things help, good luck fighting the cold bug. Atishooooo!

Fr OKane has been involved with St Eithnes since the idea of a second school for the parish was first suggested. He was there through the years of planning and, no doubt, fought for finances from the Western Education and Library Board and Department of Education. Fr OKane was has been here for St Eithnes as a constant support to the entire school community as well as being a wonderful ambassador for the school.  PICTURED: Fr Paddy OKane, right, checking on the progress of the building of the new school. googletag.cmd.push I know that St Eithnes is very much in the heart of Fr Paddy as Fr Paddy is very much at the heart of the school. “I would like to thank him for all that he has done for the school and for his continued support in the future. From its small beginnings with a staggered intake of children in  the school has now grown to over  pupils,  teachers and  classroom assistants. Everyone has a part to play. We have parents and parents of former pupils who volunteer with us too and grandparents that are making all the costumes for the school show and have made a beautul quilt for the th anniversary. googletag.cmd.push  PICTURED: The original staff of St Eithnes Primary School with principal, Gerry Cosgrove, seated centre.  This small army of helpers continue to provide a vital support to staff and our children, directly through support in class and indirectly by providing many resources for our school. They are always on hand to help and I know that whenever I need something for the school or for the children I can lt the phone and be assured that help is always at hand, and that is so very much appreciated.

In this era of scepticism and rejection by many of the Christian Gospel, he will need to be Brave, and to offer a Bright and Beautul Gospel to all.Dean Wright said that in both his le and in his sharing of Christ, the new bishop had ldquocourageously sought to change lives through his teaching and explanation of the word of God and through the power of the Holy Spirit.ldquoDavid has been a champion for the poor. He has spoken out against violence when it would have been easier to stay silent.

It has been downgraded to a Type II emergency unit which we believe is not sufficient. The Downe was only one of two hospitals in the past  years which had had its needs fully assessed before it was built.ldquoThere is a clearly established case for a -hour emergency service in Downpatrick operating seven days a week and nothing has happened at the Department of Health or anywhere  to suggest otherwise. Service changes were made in the past due to staffing issues, nothing .Mr McGrady also revealed that changes are planned at the Downe with surveyors visiting the hospital recently to examine where the proposed new MRI scanner will be located.He said the provision of the scanner will result in an extension being built and also open the door to allow the hospital to do so much more in terms of diagnostics and other opportunities,Campaigners also insisted at last weekrsquos meeting that space is needed to reopen  beds closed in the same week of the new Downersquos official opening in , highlighting the need for everyone mdash including politicians and Newry, Mourne and Down Council mdash to work together on this particular issue and that it was time for the ldquoinjustices of the past in terms of local health care provision to be addressed.Mrs Anne Trainor highlighted the lack of investment in local hospital services in the past and said it was time that the Downe Hospital was firmly on the ldquolips of the decision makers and that the local area got its fair share of funding.Looking to the future, she saidthe Downe does become a centre of excellence for the elderly, this will pave the way for other new services to add to those already in place.She also backed calls for more beds to be provided in the Downpatrick hospital and is keen to see the local council taking an active role on health and working alongside campaigners.ldquoHealth is the single most important issue and we have been hammering home this message for years, she declared.ldquoNewry, Mourne and Down Council needs to play a serious role in the delivery of healthcare. The former Down Council put its hands in its pocket to help the hospital campaign but its successor has been lacking in this regard.Mrs Trainor added: ldquoWe want a fully ing hospital that provides this community with the services it needs. We already have an excellent hospital and fantastic staff, but the community deserves what everyone  has.ldquoWe also need to to engage with local medical providers who are the experts.

In addition to her work with children, Laura is also keen to show her support for the work carried out by the charity.Explaining the nature of her work, Laura said that it centres around helping children deal with emotional behavioural problems through play.She has a dedicated toolkit to help which includes sand trays, miniature toys, stuffed toys, hand puppets and books containing therapeutic stories to help deliver the so-called Play  Grow project.A qualied play therapist who is registered with Play Therapy UK, Laura has been working with children since  and previously spent time working in Downpatrick where she did her voluntary placement with Action for Children based at the Ballymote Centre.She explained that the opportunity to set up her new service came about as a result of her volunteering work with Le Change Changes Lives, with her work focusing on children aged between four and .ldquoI work with children who have emotional behavioural problems, those dealing with bereavement and loss or who have separated or orced parents, Laura continued.ldquoI also work with those who have anger of anxiety issues, those who may have become withdrawn, have communication problems or have suffered forms of abuse or nightmares. I also work with those who are being bullied or who are bullies themselves.Laura, who offers a free consultation with parents, said children can release their inner feelings through play.She explained that play is a childrsquos natural medium of self expression, highlighting the number of times children ask their parents to play with them and have a chat. Laura said children feel most comfortable in this environment.ldquoAs play is what children are comfortable with, it makes sense that you would use this method to help them through a dficult time. This is particularly effective for children who cannot or who do not want to talk about their problems.ldquoThey can play out their feelings and problems anda child wants to talk to me here of course they can do that. Some children say that they do not want to talk about whatever trauma is in their lives and I say to them that is great because they do not have to.ldquoHowever, they will still express those feelings through play and may in fact not be aware that this is what they are doing. The metaphor is very powerful in the play therapy room and children can hide behind a mask to demonstrate their feelings and using a puppet is a very good example of that.Laura said her work is a method of helping children with behavioural and emotional problems to help themselves, explaining that is the children do all the work.ldquoI am just here as a facilitator, she said. ldquoPlay therapy is not always fun and sometimes the children will encounter dficult feelings. I adopt a child-centred approach where the child leads the way and the therapist follows which is non directive.ldquoOne of the most important aspects of play therapy is the element of control. For some children when something has happened in their le or environment it is a thing which they cannot control which causes trauma. When they come here, this is the one place they can come in and say lsquoright we are doing this my wayrsquo and it can take back control.Laura described play therapy is ldquonon judgemental and said children know they are in a safe environment and can express themselves in any way in which they will be accepted or who they are.She added: ldquoThe children will learn that while here they can be themselves and they will feel comfortable to be themselves.Laura can be contacted on   or via her social media page..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29th January 2020 New.jpg","title":"New minister at Lissara church  ","story":"A NEW chapter in the history of Lissara Presbyterian Church opened last weekend with the installation of the Rev Alan Burke.A large congregation attended last Friday eveningrsquos service in Crossgar with the new minister looking forward to his time working in the area.For the past two and a half years, Mr Burke was assistant minister at the Loanends and Killead churches near Aldergrove.

We have been clear we will not be doing so.”And in what Number  billed as an “address to the nation”, to be released an hour before the moment the UK leaves the EU, the Prime Minister will promise to heal the bitter isions opened up by Brexit.He will call Brexit “the moment when the dawn breaks and the curtain goes up on a new act”.“It is a moment of real national renewal and change.”As Brexiteers prepare to celebrate the UK’s withdrawal at the stroke of pm on Friday, in European capitals there was sadness at the breaking of a bond dating back  years.Mr Johnson will spend the evening in Number  hosting a celebratory reception for senior ministers, officials, and supporters of the  referendum campaign to leave the EU.Brexiteers will gather for a party in Parliament Square led by Nigel Farage, while Union flags are already flying around Westminster.In official events, Downing Street will be illuminated with a light show while a new commemorative p coin is entering circulation.In Brussels, the UK flag will be removed from the EU institutions, with one Union flag expected to be consigned to a museum.In Scotland, which voted to stay in the EU in the  referendum, candlelit vigils are planned.The Leave a Light On gatherings are taking place in Aberdeen, Dundee, Glasgow, and Stirling, among other locations, and participants intend to send a message to the EU to keep open a place for Scotland.In Northern Ireland, the campaign group Border Communities Against Brexit was staging a series of protests in Armagh, near to the border with the Republic of Ireland.try catch  TrendingAlastair Stewart tweet: Julia Nightingale pays tribute to ITV news presenter forced to step down after social media error of judgementNI snow alert: Heavy snowfall expected overnight - temperature to feel a bitterly cold -degCNI snow  ice alert: Hour-by-hour NI weather forecast for duration of Met Office yellow status weather warningNI snow due to arrive earlier than originally thought - gales now expected too as temperatures set to plummet to -degCStephen Nolan challenges everyone to join him in weight loss challenge afterdisappointment of putting weight back on remains profound        v.. -  applyImgSrcs\" i sb  for   sb* sb u  o.dataset.srcu  u.replaceo.setAttributeo.setAttributedocumentwindowapplyImgSrcs JP  JP  JP  \"NA-BELFNEWS-\"JP  \"Politics\"      Follow Us On       Explore News Sport Irish League Football Whats On Lestyle   Farming Le   More from the Belfast News Letter  Announcements Buy a Photo  Directory Jobs Homes Cars Local Guide  Public Notices  Reader Shop Must Read Read This Events   Useful Links Contact Us   Place your Ad Advertise a Job Subscribe  Readers Charter        ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings  Terms and Conditions  Privacy policy    d.onerror  d.onload  d.src  [\"secure-uk.imrworldwide cgi-bin m ciuk-hcgccsi\", escape, \"rp\", escape, \"tscompactrnd\", .getTime].join"},{"url":null,"title":"sam mcbride brexit has loosened the ties that bind northern ireland to britain  ","story":" getRequiredClientIdforjpiconsole.log requiredClientIdcatch]EV.Core.updateUserProfile]EV.Core.updateUserProfile....... , , , , Would you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast News Letter via email \"Newsletters\"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia, publisher of Belfast News Letter, via occasional emails keeping you informed about new features, relevant offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"By clicking on register, you will be creating an account with Belfast News Letter and agreeing to JPIMedia Publishing Ltd#s standard Terms and Conditions.

It was Powell who monumentally overestimated his influence with Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher..ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget .photo-article-notier-default .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p @media.photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p #jp .main-content .ev-widget#sticky-footer .sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner p @media@media#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_text,#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_button #sticky-footer .fluid-container #sticky-footer .mobile-sticky-footer_button When on  November  the treaty was signed in Hillsborough Castle, giving the Republic’s government for the first time a say in the internal affairs of Northern Ireland, Powell was stunned and bitter, denouncing Mrs Thatcher in the Commons as a Jezebel.Almost three and a half decades later, unionism again finds itself betrayed on a constitutional issue by a British Prime Minister who once boasted about his unionism.But there the comparison stops. This time unionism’s response has been radically dferent from that of Ian Paisley and Jim Molyneaux.The s attempts to boycott government, refuse to pay TV and dog licences and try to make councils ungovernable descended into farce while the street protests and ‘third force’ paramilitary organisations did more harm to unionism than they did to the Agreement.This time the DUP, which is far more dominant within unionism than the UUP was in , appears to have few ideas about how to undo damage which stems not only from a decision – Brexit – which it backed, but which comes in a period where Arlene Foster has had more power over the government than any other unionist leader since Edward Carson. While Powell believed he had the ear of the Prime Minister because of his intellect, ideological affinity with Margaret Thatcher and his deep roots in the Conservative Party, Mrs Foster relied on sheer political power for her influence.The DUP leader and many of her senior colleagues weren’t afraid to flaunt that power, humiliating Theresa May by forcing her to fly back from Brussels in December  when she was about to sign up to a deal which would involve Northern Ireland maintaining regulatory alignment with the EU in order to avoid a hard Irish border.Ultimately, Mrs May secured the insertion of a new paragraph to that key document – but even at the time it appeared to simply introduce ambiguity over whether Northern Ireland would in fact leave the EU on the same terms as the rest of the UK.But another aspect of that Joint Report was nodded through by the DUP even though its implications were remarkable.Paragraph  contained a commitment from the UK to the avoidance of a hard border and then crucially for the first time defined a ‘hard border’ as “any physical infrastructure or related checks and control”. It was a sweeping definition which went far beyond the images which the phrase ‘hard border’ would conjure up for most people – customs posts, passport control, barbed wire and soldiers.‘Dawn of a new era’ as Brexit gets doneBrexiteers at Stormont sing God Save the Queen as clock strikes  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"So sweeping was the definition that it went beyond the dictionary definition of ‘hard border’ – and also meant that the current arrangements at the border, where cameras are already in place at key locations, is a ‘hard border’, something most people would regard as absurd.That lack of attention to detail was reminiscent of Mrs Foster’s approach to RHI and on its own would have been deeply problematic.However, it was accompanied by behaviour from some of her colleagues which undermined the party’s interests.Several months earlier, in February , senior DUP figure Nelson McCausland was dismissive of the implications of his support for Brexit, saying of the post-Brexit border: “I wouldn’t care what sort of situation I face as long as I’m out of Europe”.Less than a year later,North Antrim MP Ian Paisley Jr boasted that the Joint Report – which was riddled with ambiguities and bear pits – meant that the DUP had “done over” Taoiseach Leo Varadkar.In a statement, the arch-Brexiteer accepted that the document was “imperfect”, but went on to claim that as a result of what had been agreed Northern Ireland “has not been designated some purgatorial relationship of neither being in our outside the EU but will be treated completely the same as every other component part of the UK”.With what even at the time appeared unwise bragging, he said: “Frankly, whatever efforts are made to characterise this week Leo Varadkar was done over by the EU, the UK and the DUP.”Talking bullishly about the possibility of the UK quitting the EU without a deal, the North Antrim MP said that should “put the fear of the almighty into the Republic” which would see its economy “crippled”.The absence of any humility in what Mr Paisley mistakenly believed was his moment of triumph was typical of how many in the DUP have a tendency to swagger when they think they are on top. Not all in the party exhibit this characteristic and Sir Jeffrey Donaldson was among those who overwhelmingly adopted a more measured tone, perhaps realising that the hubris of some of his colleagues had become – and remains – a strategic liability.A lack of sympathy at the DUP’s plight, extended to schadenfreude in some cases, meant that when the party had a valid concern it found few open ears. Ultimately Boris Johnson, who they enabled to become Prime Minister, came to support the UK leaving in a way which creates a trade border – the extent of which is still unclear – in the Irish Sea.He proposed that Stormont would approve that arrangement by a simple majority vote, rather than allowing both unionism and nationalism to each have a veto, as envisaged in the Good Friday Agreement. That gave the DUP the chance to argue that this was a profoundly problematic abandonment of the principle that Northern Ireland cannot operate as a majoritarian society. But, having thrown about its weight for more than two years, the party found few willing to listen to its concerns.There has been some evidence in recent weeks of the DUP softening its rhetoric and last night Arlene Foster attempted to make a conciliatory gesture by travelling to Dublin to be interviewed on The Late Late Show. But while tone can be changed to suit circumstances, the more alarming issue for some unionists will be the lack of attention to detail which has consistently marked Mrs Foster’s approach to Brexit.Having backed Brexit on a whim without even the pretence of having considered its practical implications, and in the face of warnings from other unionists that it could tear apart the Union, there is still no evidence of humility, still less contrition, from the DUP leader.But regardless of Mrs Foster’s future, the events of the last four years have wrought a legacy which will linger.The Union has been, perhaps irreversibly, undermined.And not only have soft nationalists and many centrist voters been enraged, pushing them towards Irish unity, but there has been a deep imprint left on many unionists. Overwhelmingly, they do not support Irish unity, something which shows how great the task of nationalism will be to persuade them in a future border poll.But, yet again, they have had their faithin a British government shattered.

This year, she will celebrate her ninety second birthday and she discusses a letime of activism across Europe.Veganuary is an annual event which encourages people to go vegan for a month. In last yearrsquos campaign, a quarter of a million people pledged to try a vegan diet.More NewsVale school pals brave the shave for animal charityPenarth father of four is recognised in New Year Honour list for services to cricketHouse prices increased in the Vale of Glamorgan, latest figures showOnce a fringe movement, veganism is quickly gaining a vast appeal, especially amongst the young, as the environmental benefits of a plant-based diet become clearer.According to a study by the Vegan Society, , people in the UK were vegan in  ndash  and a half times higher than in . Almost half of these were people aged below .Veganism has brought with it a lucrative trade in plant-based produce as businesses move to accommodate the concerns of their customers and promote ethical alternatives to meat.Long before veganism became a dietary and commercial trendsetter, however, June Holder, a -year-old woman from Penarth, had her eyes opened to the costly effects of meat consumption. After eating a vegan breakfast at a local cafeacute, she settled down to tell me her story.ldquoIrsquove been vegan for  years, she said. ldquoMy daughter had a stall at Camden Market, and she used to collect masses of money for animal rights there. It was her who first introduced me to the cause.ldquoLater on, I organized a charity coffee morning and sent the money I raised to Compassion in World Farming. In , they sent me a magazine which showed what happened to the animals. Well, I sat down that morning and read what theyrsquod sent me ndash and I was vegan!Whilst the public has become more receptive to veganism, June still encounters hostility: ldquoPeoplersquos reactions y when I tell them Irsquom vegan. They become hostile because theyrsquore guilty, I suppose.ldquoI remember that a vegan group had a stall in the market a few years ago. They were advertising parts of Alsatians to eat. People were horried. So, when they were angry, I had a chance to talk to them. lsquoYou accept that any animal can be treated like this except when it comes to your dogsrsquo, I told them. Well, they had to accept it. How could they not Originally from Penarth, June moved to Dinas Powys from Barry after her husband, Derrick, passed away  years ago.Derrick was the owner of Holders Menswear, a menrsquos fashion store which was once renowned throughout the Vale of Glamorgan and beyond.Junersquos decision to become vegan sparked  years of dedication to activism. She joined the Animal Welfare Party, and, in her sixties and seventies, she travelled across the UK and Europe to campaign for animal rights.ldquoI demonstrated in many places. I went to Brussels twice to protest against the exportation of live animals. The International Fund for Animal Welfare took us in a coach.ldquoI was in the front row of the crowd, up against these spikes and razor wire. If they had started to push from the back, I dread to think what would have happened.ldquoThe night before the protest I had this thought: lsquoThe danger is not to protestrsquo. I wrote it on a little board.ldquoPeople kept tapping me on the shoulder and passing the board around the crowd and eventually it made its way back to me.What does the message mean ldquoIt means that it is more dangerous not to protest against these injustices that are happening.June still has a copy of the placard. Later, at her home, she retrieved it from a trove of scattered paraphernalia accumulated after years of protest.She has written prolically throughout her le about events which have provoked and enthused her. One poem describes the day of protest in Brussels. It reflects Junersquos unceasing dedication to animal welfare but also her frustration at the pace of change:ldquoThe writer of these verses was, quite some time ago, in Brussels with a poster which now rings yet more true. lsquoThe danger is not to protestrsquo is what the message said.ldquoThen round it went to young and old for everyone to read. From countries all round Europe, but the farmers paid no heed. Live transport, a huge issue then, continues just the same.Another poem read:ldquoChristmas is a time to spend, but why not save instead  In sheds around the country to sate the publicrsquos lust for something huge to set their feast. The turkeys just exist.ldquoTen million in this country at Christmas time alone. Is this the way to talk of peace and teach our children love Veganuary runs throughout January.

The UKrsquos withdrawal from the EU will begin later this month and we have a Conservative Government in Westminster until at least .Regardless of the numbers in the Commons, the Labour Party still has to stand up for those we represent.

This offers the membership and the country a broader choice.I am yet to decide who I will back in the forthcoming election but I know that I want to see a vision from each of the candidates. For me, that vision needs to be a realistic reflection of our last decade out of government in Westminster, but also a strategy for reconnecting with our voters and securing a Labour government which can deliver for those who need us most.Finally, I want to thank the staff across the NHS and wider public services for their hard work under increasing pressures, particularly during the winter period.Our public services work hard all year round and many take the sacrice of working over the Christmas and New Year period for which I, and many others, are extremely grateful.As everyou would like to speak with me, you can call my office on    or write to me at Vaughan.Gething@assembly.wales or Office of Vaughan Gething AM, Room C, National Assembly for Wales, CF NA. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The pupils were then asked to redesign the maps by using their knowledge of the local area. They identied key landmarks, short cuts and potential barriers to walking and cycling.The pupils also developed a set of symbols and a map key which will be used in the new map.Sustrans also held a parent engagement workshop where they invited families to identy routes that they and their children use.Sustrans will produce a bilingual pocket-sized travel map which will be available to students, staff and parents for free. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Who they are will have a real influence on Welsh Labourrsquos prospects in  and beyond. We are the most successful part of the UK Labour family over the last decade in terms of winning elections and running a national government. However, that cannot be taken for granted. An unpopular UK leader could make our task much harder next May.The first and most important attribute the next UK leader must have is the ability to fulfil the mission of our party - to become a party of government again across the UK, not just a party of protest. I want someone who can implement our labour values in government, not just talk about them.That requires some honesty about why we took such a beating at the general election, together with the willingness and strength to do something about it. Offering more of the same would be a betrayal of people who need a UK Labour government and will condemn the UK [or what is left of it] to a further decade of the Tories.We didnrsquot get hammered in  for one reason alone - there were a number of them. Agreeing to the election in the first place when we plainly were not prepared. Agreeing to an election certain to be dominated by Brexit. Our vacillation on Brexit when people wanted certainty and leadership. The factional infighting. The demonisation of the last UK Labour government, asthat would encourage people to vote for us. I grew up with  Tory years in power and I know that things really did get better following Labourrsquos victory in .An overloaded manesto with some popular policies but without a key central message. A costed manesto that then had a huge extra spending pledge added to it, meaning that people didnrsquot believe that we were serious or credible one even the policies they liked. A staggeringly inept UK campaign that wasted the amazing dedication of our volunteers, prepared to go out in the cold and rain to campaign. Our abject failure on anti-Semitism. This and much more.Many people recognised that Boris Johnson is a dishonest man who is completely out of touch with most peoplersquos lives. Lots of people still voted for him or refused to vote Labour because they could not trust and support us. Our own people - long term Labour voters - struggled to support us. Our leader was undeniably part of the reason why. Blaming our defeat solely on the mainstream media or whichever side of the Brexit ide we favour isnt honest and will not help us to win in the future.I donrsquot much care whether someone claims they are from the left, soft left, centre or old right of the Labour Party. We all have a stake in our party and the countries of the UK. These are serious times and we need a serious figure who can nail the Tories and the clown in number ten.Irsquove been interested in what Lisa Nandy has to say and believe that Lisa and many other figures have a key role to play in rebuilding our party ndash first as a credible opposition, then as a credible alternative government at the next UK General Election.However, I think the person best placed to win the argument, and even more importantly to help us win an election, is Keir Starmer. Itrsquos not the protesting, or the taking part that counts. Itrsquos the winning and the decisions you get to make in government that can change peoplesrsquo lives and change the country for the better. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

There are things being said by many that we need to listen to.But, after speaking to many of the candidates personally, and asking them all tough questions - I am backing Keir Starmer for Leader. I think hersquos got what it takes to hold this government immediately and robustly to account to build a team of all the talents and crucially that he has the vision, ideas and credibility to win again.Keir joined me on the streets of Penarth speaking to voters and local businesses during the election campaign ndash and it was clear by the warmth of the reception he received that he is someone who has the immediate credibility and credentials to be our future prime minister, and would work in partnership with Welsh Labour.He has crucial experience of public service and confronting powerful vested interests for the good of the country. He acted to prosecute MPs who had abused expenses and Murdoch journalists in the phone-hacking scandal when he was Director of Public Prosecutions.We need to win back these voters that we lost in the last general election. It was heart-breaking on election night, to see Labour lose places like Wrexham and Bridgend.The UK Labour Party must get back to being a party that votersrsquo can trust.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

In the last few years Pulse PR has worked with clients include Applegreen, during the roll-out of its first stores in Northern Ireland, jewellery retailer Argento that has over  high street stores in Ireland and one of Ireland’s most iconic gt wear brands, Belleek. And with a business spirit which has helped take root due to her father’s own entrepreneurial background, Grainne’s developed her own firm over the last  years – growing with the changing media landscape, creating communications and marketing strategies, working with tech start-ups from the ground up and building on strong media relationships. “For seven years I had worked with PR agencies and businesses such as Barclays, Tayto and Tesco. I was approaching  and I decided it was now or never,” she told Ulster Business. Networking at Down Royal Racecourse with a pocket full of business cards saw her leave with three clients, and from that, the business was born. Although Pulse PR was initially centred around work with public relations and press, Grainne now works with a lot of start-ups, particularly those within tech – her business is also based at Catalyst, formerly the Northern Ireland Science Park, which is the largest technology park here. One of those she’s now working closely with is IRP Commerce – a £m turnover software development company which made it on to Deloitte’s Technology Fast  list of high growth technology companies seven times. “That relationship started eight years ago with a press release, and now I work with them to target retailers, manufacturers and distributors across the UK, promoting its e-commerce  at national conferences and building strategic relationships with key players in the e-commerce industry. When I started it was very traditional PR, and dealing with newspapers and magazines. Now, it’s also grown further into the digital sphere with online PR, blogging and video testimonials. “I’ve seen a big sht in how my time is spent from when I started  years ago. Although clients still value print coverage, there is definitely a demand to create engaging campaigns for social media. “Because of how the world is changing, I have had to ersy as well. It’s about being flexible and realising the developing trends, and trying to adapt. I’ve always been comfortable in front of the camera or with a microphone in my hand so turned this into a business opportunity to host events, commentate on radio or host  at tech conferences – there is an under-representation of women in this sector so it’s a gap I believe I fill.” As a self-employed businesswoman, Grainne extends her reach with clients by collaborating with freelance photographers, designers and videographers. “You have to get results for your clients. I purposely keep my client list manageable so I’m not competing against myself and I can broaden the scope of activity I do for them,” she says. Grainne also works with Catalyst on its Springboard programme as a marketing domain expert, giving start-up companies assistance when they are bringing their product to market. She says most of her clients come through referrals from other companies she’s been involved with. “Referrals are great as it means I’ve done a good job for the person referring me. I also find a lot of work comes from people I have previously worked with or went to school with. Northern Ireland is known for having two degrees of separation – this also applies in the business world.” She’s also been working with the Ulster Farmers’ Union this year to help promote the organisation’s Open Farm Weekend. It’s an initiative, sponsored by Bank of Ireland UK, to allow members of the public to pay a visit to a farm for the first time. “This is a new sector for me, but the principles are the same – find out the end user and then apply the right marketing tools to engage with them. “It’s about fitting in with a company and how that business thinks – being adaptable and working out what they want, and trying to help them grow. It’s about presenting a strong and clear message, developing strong media contacts and also working across digital and print media to boost reach.” In  years, the media and PR landscape has evolved, including how information is consumed. “But I’m still a firm believer in knowing the basics,” she says. “It’s about having the experience and the education to be able to do it. After my degree and Master’s, I studied to gain additional post-graduate qualications from the Chartered Institute of Marketing. I’m a firm believer in le-long learning. Too many people starting in the industry think all the need is a smartphone and an Instagram account. “It’s competitive, but there’s always enough business for everyone out there. You really just need a few clients and then you turn your focus to them, as well as working with others as and when they come. A few projects naturally ended last year so I’ll be expanding my client list in the coming months. It’s always exciting to start with a new company or entrepreneur. “It’s about being flexible and being aware of what is going on with your clients, and being proactive. Being a sole-trader means you are flexible and can work closely with companies, either in their office or remotely as an extended member of their marketing team. I have often thought about employing more staff, but I believe clients want to see me working on their account, rather than meeting me at the pitch and then being passed over to a junior member of staff. “There’s a great satisfaction in helping an innovative small business, which is set for bigger things, and working alongside them in getting their message out there, building, growing and creating jobs. You really want to work with them and help build their business. “It’s about building the relationships and contacts, and that’s something you can’t teach. People buy from people and I believe one of the reasons I have kept many of the same clients for  years is because I always go the extra mile and am true to my word.” Grainne’s desire  years ago to go it alone with Pulse PR is something she says is very much part of the family story. “My father Malachy is an entrepreneur, a mechanic by trade, but he’s always been able to turn his hand to everything,” she says. My sister Orla was also self-employed as a pharmacist. I’ve been brought up in that environment and we’ve always had support and a ‘can do’ attitude from our mother Geraldine. I had a baby, Gabriel, four months ago but didn’t get the option to take maternity leave. This is the downside of being self-employed, but the flipside means I can work from home when I need to.” As for the next  years, Grainne says it’s about trying to give something back, using her skills to help those who have little or no experience in knowing how to bring their message and products to the fore. “I’m still as passionate about business as I was  years ago. I’m excited to see how I can continue to use my skills to add value to clients to ensure their message and their voice is heard.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/234234343334.jpg","title":"stormont deal business back new assembly","story":"Posted on Friday  January  by John Mulgrew Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Julian Smith and Irish Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney. Pic Kelvin Boyes Northern Ireland’s business community has given its support for a deal which has seen the Assembly up-and-running after a three year stasis. The Northern Ireland Assembly couldon Fridaypolitical parties back a deal tabled by the UK and Irish Governments. DUP leader Arlene Foster has indicated that her party will back the deal, while Sinn Fein said its leadership will meet to discuss it on Friday. The UUP has said they will consider the deal, but are willing to attend the Assemblyit sits. In a joint statement urging politicians to accept the ‘New Decade, New Approach’ deal, NI Chamber president John Healy, vice president Ian Henry, and chief executive Ann McGregor, said: “After three years of paralysis, we now have a workable deal that will allow an Executive to start addressing the problems within our health service and education system. They will also be able to take action to grow our economy and support the community and voluntary sector. “We therefore encourage the five main political parties to progress it urgently. Business, health and education cannot wait any longer - failure is not an option. “Now is the time for our politicians to show mature leadership and help navigate a path to the future by accepting this deal.” Secretary of State Julian Smith and Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney published the New Decade, New Approach deal on Thursday evening and urged parties to back it andto Stormont on Friday. Reacting to the news, Trade NI – the alliance of Retail NI, Manufacturing NI and Hospitality Ulster – said: “We welcome the draft deal published by the British and Irish Governments in the final round of talks to restore devolution. We strongly encourage all the main parties of Northern Ireland to sign the deal today and get the Assembly back up and running.” “As our three organisations represent the majority of the businesses that make up private sector jobs in Northern Ireland, we are cautiously hopeful that the deal and aof the Assembly will see the development of policies and legislation at devolved level and the kick start that our economy desperately needs. The clear prioritisation of the Northern Ireland economy highlights the many challenges that businesses have faced over the past three years and our message to the parties is that we support you in your endeavours to secure this deal.” “While this is a good start, improvements are still needed to drive the economy forward and support the growth of business across Northern Ireland. As stated in our Vision  document, Northern Ireland’s potential is signicant but reform and growth is needed to create the modern economy we are capable of and deserve.” FSB NI policy chair, Tina McKenzie, said: “Businesses will welcome the agreement published last night as a step forward towards restoring devolved government, something for which FSB has been calling since the collapse of the institutions three years ago. “The draft agreement contains some positive commitments to bolster the local economy, on issues like skills, infrastructure and Brexit. However, theof devolution is by no means a panacea it just means that at long last we have elected representatives in place to tackle a very dficult task. “The next Executive must move quickly to deliver on the myriad issues which have been left unaddressed for far too long. While the health service will be high on the agenda, we must not lose sight of the need to bolster our SME economy, which is the absolute bedrock on which the first-class public services to which we all aspire are built. “Ministers must move swtly to support our economy at one of the most turbulent times for many decades, starting by lowering the rates burden on small businesses, whilst also moving forward rapidly with key infrastructure projects which have stalled and ensuring that our schools, colleges, and universities are providing students with the skills they need for the jobs of the future. “In order to begin to address these issues, the parties must put pragmatism first and get back round the Executive table.” Colin Neill, chief executive, Hospitality Ulster, said: “We encourage all parties to seize this opportunity and sign up to the deal published late last night to get the Assembly and Executive back as quickly as possible.” “This is the best chance to bring the devolved government back to le. Our message to the party leaders is clear, we support you in your endeavours and encourage you to get the New Decade, New Approach agreement over the line today. Redmond McFadden, president of the Londonderry Chamber of Commerce said: “The Londonderry Chamber as well as other representatives of business, education, health, trade unions and civic organisations, held a meeting with the five main political parties at Stormont last night. “At that meeting we pressed the urgent need for the parties to agree the draft deal which was published by the British and Irish Governments. Three years without Ministers making local decisions has had an enormous impact on our economy and wider society. A lack of effective and meaningful representation here is curtailing investment in our region, stling job creation and driving our young people away. Simon Hamilton, chief executive of Belfast Chamber, said: “Belfast Chamber welcomes progress towards the restoration of the Northern Ireland Executive and encourages the local political parties to reach agreement. For the last three years, our members have seen how an absence of decision making has stunted growth and stled investment. The proposed priorities for the Executive contain some issues which Belfast Chamber has been supportive of for some time. “Other policies which could boost our economy are noticeably missing but we look forward to joining with our colleagues across the business community to ensure that the new Executive pursues an agenda that grows jobs and boosts our economy.” Northern Ireland Local Government Association chief executive, Derek McCallan said: “I am very pleased that the British and Irish governments have tabled a draft deal on restoring the NI Executive. I hope that an agreement can be reached quickly to get the Stormont institutions back up and running immediately. For three years, our eleven local councils have been the only ing form of democratically elected government in Northern Ireland. Local government has been a vital democratic anchor during this period and ensured the provision of crucial public services for local citizens. “It’s time to bridge the democratic deficit and unlock the potential of local government in Northern Ireland by investing in our local councils. An Executive commitment to a devolution bill and greater financial powers and resources will drive a transformation in Northern Ireland’s democratic governance and help create a more sustainable democracy, environment and economy for Northern Ireland.” Kirsty McManus, national director, IoD NI, said: “The ‘New Decade, New Approach’ deal is to be welcomed, filled with ambition that,fulfilled, can deliver real improvements for the people and businesses of Northern Ireland. “We would therefore urge all parties to get behind the deal to enable the speedy restoration of the Executive. “Commitments from the British and Irish governments for some crucial pieces of infrastructure such as the York Street Interchange, upgrades to the A and A road and Northern Ireland’s wastewater network are particularly pleasing. “The expansion of university provision at the Magee campus in Derry meanwhile will go some way to rebalancing the regional economy. “Plans for multi-year budgets and increased civic engagement will also improve overall governance. “From a business perspective however, we would have liked to have seen more around a new skills agenda, which urgently require focus alongside a renewed look at the Apprenticeship Levy which is not included in this deal. “On behalf of our members, we will also monitor closely commitments to bring forward legislation that will allow unfettered access to the Great Britain market for local business following Brexit.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail_MM-Photo-1.jpg","title":"manufacturing month ni to showcase strength of sector","story":"Posted on Tuesday  January  by Ulster Business Economy Minister Diane Doods with Manufacturing NIs Stephen Kelly Northern Ireland’s burgeoning manufacturing sector will be showcased as part of a major initiative to highlight the strength and excellence of the industry here.

The revamp is part of the Department of Finance’s Reval – which is a reassessment of the rates system which businesses pay. While still a draft schedule of values, each council will also have to apply its own regional rate, based on the new proposed figures.“The Cathedral Quarter isn’t just about eating and drinking,” Gareth Neill, BID manager, Destination CQ told Ulster Business.“We have a vibrant ecosystem of arts and culture and fantastic built heritage that makes this area stand out, hospitality plays an integral part to the quality of le in this part of Belfast – for a city to be striving to attract new residents, increase our tourism offer these are crucial to the city’s success. “We are concerned about that the potential knock-on effects to the affected business owners and there’s a very real possibility it will have an impact on the price of a pint to the people who come to socialise in Cathedral Quarter. The knock-on effect of outdated methodology for calculation of rates on licensed premiseshas a potentially crippling effect on jobs and character of this area.”A spokesman for Land  Property Services said: “In Northern Ireland, nearly % of pubs will have no change or a decrease in their Net Annual Value .“Any business rate payer who thinks their new valuation may be incorrect, can contact LPS to arrange an informal review and supply any relevant information before the new valuation list comes into force on  April .”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/mip1.jpg","title":"mipim taking belfast to the world","story":"Posted on Friday  January  by Ulster Business Joe ONeill and Suzanne Wylie Belfast Harbour boss Joe O’Neill will help lead a private and public sector delegation to MIPIM – the world’s biggest commercial property event – as chairman of the taskforce. He chats to John Mulgrew about the big announcements, fighting off the competition and attracting a global giant to Northern Ireland For Joe O’Neill and the wider delegation heading to potentially warmer climates, the proposition of selling the city and wider region to major investors has gotten easier.In the five years since Belfast ed to MIPIM – an event which sees tens of thousands descend on Cannes in France for four days of real estate and development – the private and public team, and taskforce, have developed a “strong ” in which to sell the city and Northern Ireland, with hopes of attracting a big name insurance or tech firm on the list.“MIPIM is a great  for the promotion of city-wide initiatives, and demonstrating to investors and to occupiers the growth potential in the city, and the opportunities for them and that the key stakeholders are all aligned behind an appropriate growth agenda,” Joe says.“You see dferent sizes and scales of stands out there – you see some really ambitious stands and proposed developments, so Belfast has to see it’s entry point into that. Belfast first and foremost will be competing against peer group cities within the UK… but then it is a worldwide show, so you will be competing against other cities.”Belfast is leading a major delegation this year, and will also be joined by representatives from other Northern Ireland councils, including those that are part of the Belfast Region City Deal, such as Mid  East Antrim. That deal is also going to be a focus for announcements and development, during the event.This year’s delegation will be led by a host of top private sector developers in Northern Ireland, alongside Belfast City Council and organisations such as Belfast Harbour. That includes Bywater, Wirefox, Titanic Quarter, Tribeca, McAleer  Rushe and Graham Group, along with the two universities and others working within related fields from law, professional services and the supply chain.For Joe and the delegation, MIPIM represents an opportunity to announce some of Belfast and Northern Ireland’s wider major new infrastructure and commercial plans. Previous visits have included the announcement of major offices schemes, hotels and apartment developments.“We will have a series of announcements – some of those announcements will be new, and some will be progress, and demonstrating to investors or occupiers that progress has been madeit’s a multi-year scheme, to show we are delivering.“… we have new projects coming through the pipeline in ious sectors. This year we are looking at launching schemes around digital innovation. That aligns with one of the themes in the Belfast Region City Deal, for the city and councils in the deal. We have a particular focus on cyber-security as an investment and operating location – particular those from the US.”Joe says that would be in addition to the already well-established cyber-security development at Catalyst in the Titanic Quarter, and that new names are coming in to the marketplace creating a “cluster” around the sector, and setting up Belfast and beyond as a new global hub.“We are looking at announcing some details around the Belfast-Dublin-London corridor,” Joe says.“As an economic corridor, or triangle. Post-Brexit, there are clear synergies in developing a proposition where companies can avail of the three locationsthey are looking at a global footprint, and see advantages to locations in three cities.”The issue of increasing connectivity between Belfast and Dublin also remains high on the list – improving the speed and frequency, and making developers aware of the new Belfast Transport Hub, which will transform the city’s rail and bus connectivity when complete.For Belfast Harbour, it’s also bringing the expansion of its already successful film studios to MIPIM, amid further plans to grow and develop the hub to attract big names and become the largest of its kind outside London.“We will be revealing more of our expansion plans, which is being supported by NI Screen,” Joe said. Some of those delivering their own presentations to potential investors will include the Harbour, Belfast City Council, Catalyst and the universities. “We are out looking around, when we are there, at what dferent cities are doing – seeing whether something works well, and looking at our competitive advantage in that area.”As for the strengths and attraction for potential investors, Joe says: “Skills, talent and technology are very much at the fore. Agility as a small region and to be able to respond, and seeing that team Belfast is there and that we are aligned with a particular project. It doesn’t have to be taken back home and introduced to someone .“There is the emergence of Belfast as an attractive city – investment opening up, and people are always looking at new markets. “Part of the initial roll-out when I took on the chair of MIPIM, the role was to go around to ask those who were on board previously to ask about it,it had changed. Everyone noticed and recognised considerablechange over the last four years. “We were pioneering and establishing ourselves four years ago, now they felt we were very much a concerted and effective operating team… the collective was a powerful message, and having  or lunches involving all of the stakeholders at one time. It’s a really strong  to take on the next chapter.”So, for Joe and the rest of the MIPIM delegation, what would be considered a major goal or success on the back of the visit to the commercial property show in March  “A particular focus this year is to attract key institutional investors – the big insurance companies for example. That’s a chicken and egg situation… you need to have product, to have product you have to show that you have occupiers and a steady revenue stream. “What we have been able to say to the investment market is ‘we have product and we now have sustainable occupation coming through… now it feels like the right time for you as an investor, to come in, and to support further investment’.”Asked whether replicating the successes of our neighbours in Dublin in attracting tech giants such as Apple, Facebook and Google is also on the cards, Joe says: “Something like that, or a major investor. For them to do that – a technology or an investment company – they need to see that the public, private and third-tier sectors are all collaborating together to make an effective market, and I think we are good at doing that now.”And the timing couldn’t be better for the delegation – now able to go in with a clear mandate and message with the restoration of the Executive and ato day-to-day power-sharing politics.“The positive thing for us is with the government and secondly, somearound Brexit… it takes those two challenging issues off the table.” πView all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/JM.jpg","title":"were in for another busy year ahead","story":"Posted on Friday  January  by Ulster Business Are we in, or out  By the time you’re reading this, the UK is likely to be – from a technical perspective at least – about to leave the EU, and go it alone.In the four weeks or so since the last edition of the magazine, we’ve had a strong Tory majority pushing Brexit over the line and the restoration of devolution after three years without elected officials on the Hill. As we enter a new year and decade, there’s a sense, or a hope, of ato some form of normalised business environment. Brexit isn’t what business wanted, speaking generally, but it appears it’s what we’ve got. The minutiae of trading arrangements are still not worked out. Some sectors are more content than others, but we shouldn’t forget that Northern Ireland had a previous withdrawal deal on the table – largely backed by business – little over a year ago which could have set us apart as a unique trading environment, maintaining strong links with the Republic and the wider EU marketplace. But some of those in the political sphere seemingly put their own self interest and ideology above the future of the economy, and those who live in it. Tonight, some will take to the streets in and around the heart of the UK Government to show to the world their joy – perhaps misplaced – over the exit from the EU. For some, purely from a nationalistic perspective, its a chance to satisfy all the cliches that have plagued us over the last three years or so and for others, a chance to revel in an perceived brave new world – forged and fuelled by thoughts of a rose-tinted Britain gone by, Crystal Palace, heaving smoke stacks, heavy industry and fish and chips served up in newspaper on a pebble beach. For Northern Ireland business, and many people here, much of that platonic ideal is dficult to comprehend – especially among a younger generation. You just have to look at the breakdown in demographic of voters in the last General Election to see that. For some, tonight will be a time to mourn.
