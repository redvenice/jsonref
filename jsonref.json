It is unclear if any more are still set to be brought in from previous deals. The Department of Health paid out roughly £585million on contracts securing visors.This suggests ministers paid the equivalent of nearly £4.80 per visor used, roughly 24 times more than the shields cost when bought in bulk. And of its surplus stock, 339,154,151 are deemed \u0027not fit for use in healthcare settings\u0027. SAGE advisors warned visors were unlikely to give \u0027any protection\u0027 against Covid transmission in July 2020, with the Government placing its last order for visors at the end of June 2020.A Department of Health spokesperson said: \u0027Our priority throughout the pandemic has been saving lives, and we have delivered over 19.1 billion items of PPE to frontline staff to keep them safe.\u0027Having too much PPE was preferable to having too little in the face of an unpredictable and dangerous virus, given this was essential to keep our NHS open and protect as many people as possible.\u0027Now we are confident we have sufficient PPE to cover any future Covid demands, we are taking decisive action to save up to £93 million of taxpayers\u0027 money per year by reducing storage costs for excess stock.\u0027 "},{"url":null,"title":"easyJet slammed sharing photo customer flight number tattooed wrist","story":"Share this article Another social media user responded: \u0027Holy s***.

Even when she was at finishing school, Valerie had begun to see through Victor’s naked ambition, according to Mr Light. In one blunt letter she accused him outright of ‘feathering his nest’.Valerie and Rodney’s romance was straight out of Downton Abbey. While working as a plumber, he came to mend the lavatory at the Belmont residence and was ‘gobsmacked’ by her beauty. She was similarly smitten.Having left school at 14, he was a 29-year-old orcee with two children: hardly a suitable type for the Bettys proprietor’s daughter.Claire Belmont tried vainly to end the relationship then urged Mr Light to at least take elocution lessons.‘I said, “Not on your nelly!” I didn’t care what they thought of me,’ he scoffs.Theirs was no society wedding. There wasn’t even a reception. They were married in May 1964 in a Harrogate register office with Claire and Victor acting as reluctant witnesses.Valerie wore her black and white Bettys uniform, ready to dash back to the tearooms for her afternoon shift, but her pinny couldn’t disguise the fact that she was six months pregnant.At first, they lived with Claire Belmont and her eccentric housekeeper, who swigged Guinness and would alternate wearing her shoes on the wrong feet so the soles would wear evenly. But Mr Light worked three jobs and they eventually scrimped enough to buy their own modest house.By then, it was clear Valerie would never rise in the company ranks. After having three children, she worked in the canteen at an ICI factory, and as a shop assistant with Next, before re-joining the family firm to process mail orders for Bettys by Post.When Valerie came home in distress one evening, because Victor had berated her for some perceived failing, Mr Light flew out of the door intending to punch him, but she pulled him back.‘He treated her like muck,’ says Mr Light, fury flashing in his eyes.It appears so, yet many years would pass before they discovered the full extent of his shabbiness.The details are arcane, but during the legal dispute her lawyers claimed that Victor had the company articles altered to Valerie’s disadvantage.She was unable to sell any of her inherited stake in the business outside the company without the consent of other shareholders.These shares were held for her in a trust, and as one of the trustees, Victor was also accused of keeping their value low to avoid paying Valerie high idends.She would receive annual cheques for a few hundred pounds. Mr Light says the truth began to dawn when he went, wired-up with his secret recording device, to that meeting.‘First Victor said Val’s shares were worth ten bob, then maybe a quid. He were making it up as he went along,’ he says, shaking his head.It wasn’t until 1995, when she was 51, that Valerie at last became a wealthy woman. With her £4 million settlement, she bought an enchanting 11th-century house, set in nine acres in a village near Harrogate — and a red Porsche Boxter with personalised plates.She and Rodney holidayed in Mauritius and drove from to Deauville to Paris in his Model T Ford. Sadly, their joy was short-lived. Three years later she died of heart disease, leaving her husband bereft.When he last met Victor Wild, shortly before he died in 2020, he claims the great man asked for his forgiveness. Mr Light’s reply was short and sharp.Today, eight members of the Belmont dynasty hold shares.None of them work in the business, but there is a ‘family council’ whose ethos informs board decisions.This new generation is clearly genuinely committed to upholding the founder’s values.Responding to Mr Light’s story this week, the company said: ‘Maintaining family harmony while running a business is often a challenge for family firms — and there are times in our history when this has been true for us. Although it is nearly 30 years ago, we know that in the early 1990s our family owners had a lot to navigate.‘The period resulted in plenty of learning which now lives on in the way the family work together and shapes the family’s and business’s ways of working.’Coming from a company that has become a national treasure, it was an uplifting message.However, we can safely assume Mr Light will not be joining the throngs queuing for Easter tea in Harrogate this weekend or next.‘Go to Betty’s? Me? I’d bloody-well rather starve,’ he snaps."},{"url":null,"title":"Andrew lot Disgraced duke wants return public life","story":"Share this articleDuchess of York linked to further payment in court case - BBC NewsPrince Andrew, disgraced and downbeat, dreams of a comeback | News | The Times"},{"url":null,"title":"Meghan Markle join Prince Harry Invictus Games Netherlands week","story":"Share this articleMeghan Markle and Harry WILL be at Invictus Games on 1st trip since quitting royals - World News - Mirror Online"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bacb477e70329257e0f29cc695b9e5c0bbbbb03b/0_0_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=8419f059eb266fa296e2b8a8cc6cfcea","title":"everton v manchester united premier league live","story":"Anthony Gordon scored the only goal of the game on a raucous afternoon tt Goodison Park, where the fans and players of Everton fed off each other’s energy for 90 minutes.

And rightly so and they got today from minute one to minute 95.” “We expected them to have chances. They’re a top team with top players. It was about sticking together and riding the storm. We managed to do that. It’s a massive relief for the players, management and everyone associated with Everton.” On Frank Lampard’s half-time talk: “He said just to stay in the game. We finally felt compact. We knew they were going to dominate the ball, so it was about staying compact and communicating and riding that wave.” On his own performance and fitness: “It was good for me to get out there. I’m always wanting to help the lads. It was good to do that today, but I don’t think I’ll train for a week!” On Everton’s hopes of staying up: “It’s a massive fight. One game at a time.

The next game is about getting points on the table, that’s our main focus and to stay up.”He was one of several players who impressed alongside Anthony Gordon, Vitalii Mykolenko, Allan, Alex Iwobi, Richarlsion.

Set-piece penalties could be the difference if the scoreline is close. If the set-pieces are clean then speed will be key. England have Jess Breach and Abby Dow in the back three who are electric in open space. But the hosts aren’t the only ones with stars waiting in the wings with Jasmine Joyce and Lisa Neumann ready to pounce on opportunity. There’s just under 15 minutes now until we see how this one will pan out.Middleton spoke about the team’s new contracts. The Wales Rugby Union handed out 12 professional contracts and over 10 retainer deals to players in January. The result has seen them win both of their games in the tournament so far, Wales hadn’t won a match in the Women’s Six Nations since 2019 before the 2022 event began. “Wales’ new contracts have galvanised and lifted their group and that’s shown in the nature of their performances and two wins out of two to date,” Middleton said. “They have looked well organised and have finished strong in both games. “That’s testimony to the work Ioan (Cunningham) and his staff have put in and, of course, the attitude of the players. It’s great to see and makes for a top-class game and a stadium that will be bouncing.”So far England sit at the top, due to points difference, with France and Wales equalling the defending champions on points.  If Wales can beat their rivals they will top the table ahead of France’s clash against Scotland tomorrow. Then if the French win away from home they would top the table on points difference. But, the more likely of options, England will keep hold of their top spot and France will be hoping Wales can halt the Red Roses’ amount of tries. So far England have scored a whopping 131 points from two games which amounts to over 20 tries.The Red Roses are on a 20-match winning streak but Wales head coach Ioan Cunningham says the team are excited at the prospect of ending it. He said: “We can’t wait. We want to see where we’re at. We want to compete against the best in the world, so this is a great opportunity for us.  “The players train and play with and against the England players week-in, week-out so while we respect the side, there is familiarity, not fear. It will be fantastic to play in front of a huge crowd which will hopefully include some Welsh voices.” Read the full story: The record for a women’s rugby attendance in England was set at the Red Roses’ 2020 fixture against Wales where 10,974 fans turned out. But reports suggest Gloucester have sold over 11,000 tickets with more available on the gate. We will have to wait for confirmation on that but the game looks set to break another record. Wales, Scotland and Ireland have also set attendance records in their matches in this year’s Women’s Six Nations. What a ground-breaking event the 2022 tournament has been so far!It is a glorious Saturday and we are being treated to some lovely weather. Apart from keeping up to date with the rugby, what are you up to?Abby Dow starts at full-back with an exciting return for Jess Breach, who hasn’t played for England since May 2021 due to injury, on the wing. Emily Scarratt comes back in at outside centre and Lucy Packer makes her first start at scrum-half. In the forwards, Sarah Bern comes into the front row, Poppy Cleall moves to the second row as captain Sarah Hunter returns at No 8 and Marlie Packer is back in the squad at flanker. Wales, meanwhile, have made five changes to their starting line-up from their victory over Scotland. There’s an entirely new half-back partnership with Robyn Wilkins and Ffion Lewis starting at fly-half and scrum-half respectively. Donna Rose starts at prop, Sisilia Tuipulotu wins her first start for Wales at lock and Sioned Harries comes in at No 8 with captain Siwan Lillicrap shifting to flanker. The third round of the Women’s Six Nations will kick-off with England v Wales and it sees both teams attempting to extend their winning runs in the tournament. Neither side have lost so far but it will be a tall order for the visitors to bag a win. They have never defeated England in the tournament with nine of the 10 meetings in the Women’s Six Nations seeing the Red Roses put 30+ points over Wales. But the game should be a lot closer than previous years. Wales’ form has improved since the Wales Rugby Union introduced professional and semi-professional contracts in January. So while we are expecting England to take the win today, it won’t be as simple as previous results suggest. The team news is out so stay tuned for those updates.

Any Second Now, ridden by in-form Mark Walsh, is current favourite for the Grand National at 91, 81 in other places.Aintree 4.15 A hot handicap chase to tee up the National. Plenty are in with a shout but at the likely odds, Killer Kane could be a decent each-way option to follow-up his win in a Listed handicap at Sandown Park last time.Flooring Porter showed at Cheltenham last month that he is very difficult to beat if he gets a soft lead, but Tom O’Brien, who chased him home on Thyme Hill, will be more alive than ever to the danger and last year’s winner could be a value bet at around 3-1 to reverse the Festival form.Edwardstone is as tough and reliable as they come and was a comfortable winner of the Arkle Trophy at Cheltenham last month. He is a worthy odds-on shot to complete a six-timer with his third Grade One success of the campaign.Several of these have experience at Grade One level while Good Risk At All is making the step up from handicaps, but the form of his easy win at Ascot in February is backed up by a strong time and early odds of around 7-1 underestimate his chance.National day kicks off with an ultra-competitive handicap hurdle in which the upwardly-mobile Serious Charges attempts to extend his winning sequence to four against a couple of well-fancied rivals who showed up well at the Cheltenham Festival. Serious Charges swerved that meeting and ran at Uttoxeter’s Midlands National meeting instead, making short work of 11 rivals on his handicap debut, a performance which has seen him hiked 13lb in the weights. Winter Fog was a big eye-catcher in the Pertemps Final, running on from well off the pace to finish fourth, while Party Business had a luckless time of it in the Martin Pipe conditionals’ race and finished with running left. Remastered is another interesting runner – and possibly the best bet at the odds – as David Pipe’s gelding returns to hurdling after a wind op on what could be a very lenient mark based on some of his performances over fences earlier in the year.McManus, famous for his tilts at the ring over the years, has owned two Grand National winners to date – Don’t Push It, ridden by AP McCoy to a long-awaited victory in 2010, and Minella Times, on whom Rachael Blackmore became the first woman win the Grand National in 2021. A plaque bearing McManus’s name now hangs on the Hall of Fame wall in McCoy’s Bar – named after the legendary 20-times champion jump jockey, the rider best known for wearing McManus’s unmistakable green-and-gold silks. “I love it, I look forward to it very much. And I hope that my grandkids who are here this year - all of them except my namesake, JP – I hope they want to come every year. It’s lovely to have them here.” 8 Commodore (Other - runs in Grand National)   When you are used to seeing images of the packed grandstands at Cheltenham or Aintree, it is easy to forget that racing over fences is, for the most part, very much a north-west European thing. It’s big in Britain, Ireland and France, but not even on the radar in Australia or the United States, where Flat racing is the only game in town.  But the Grand National cuts through. It has global “reach”, as Rachael Blackmore, last year’s winning jockey, put it this week, while discussing the fan mail she has received from around the world after her history-making victory on Minella Times 12 months ago.  A worldwide television audience of 500 million has been bandied about this week, which can only be a guesstimate but may not be too far off the mark. And William Hill reported a few years ago that they expected to take Grand National bets from 140 countries, another sign of the appetite for steeplechasing’s most famous race in every corner of the globe.   The crazy uncertainty helps. You can come to the National completely cold and have almost as much chance of finding the winner as the form book bores. There is nothing like it, anywhere on Planet Earth, and this afternoon’s winner will join the most storied roll of honour in racing.  This year’s race is as open as any for years, with Minella Times and Blackmore edging to the top of the market at 10-1 overnight, and no fewer than nine other horses shorter than 20-1. When a horse with the proven talent of Samcro, a Grade One winner both over hurdles and fences, is 30th in the list at around 80-1, you can be sure that this is a race where almost anything is possible.   Any one of half a dozen could end up at the top of the market by race time at 5.15pm, however, with Any Second Now, Delta Work and Snow Leopardess all popular at 11-1 and Eclair Surf, who was not guaranteed to run until the final declarations on Thursday morning, is a 14-1 chance. There could also be money for Longhouse Poet as the afternoon goes on, given his trainer Martin Brassil’s remarkable 1-6-3 record with his only three runners in the race to date.   It is a bright, sunny and distinctly chilly day in the north-west, just as it was on Friday, and that persuaded Sulekha Varma, the clerk of the course, to put 5mm of water onto the Grand National course overnight and 3mm onto the hurdle and Mildmay courses, which stage the remainder of today’s seven races.   The action gets underway at 1.45pm, when Blackmore, who was unseated from her first ride of the week over the National fences on Friday, will ride Emitom, her only other mount on the card. A full guide to all the Grand National runners is here, some thoughts on the big race and the rest of the ITV Racing action are here, and you will find all the news, results and much, much more here on the blog as the day unfolds.

Photograph: iStockThe managing director of a Wexford radio station has described as “staggering” a suggestion by Wexford County Council that it agree its presenters would not express personal opinions on air in return for the council taking out advertising on the station.The suggestion is one of a number made by the county secretary, David Minogue, in an email to the managing director of South East Radio, Eamonn Buttle, during discussions over a proposed €40,000-€50,000 spend this year by the council on advertising with the station.In January the Standards in Public Office Commission (Sipo) issued a report in which it criticised Tom Enright, chief executive of Wexford County Council, for putting “unwarranted” pressure on South East Radio during a 2019 row about coverage of the council by the station, and in particular by one of its presenters, local businessman Karl Fitzpatrick.By threatening to withdraw council advertising from the station during the row, Sipo said, Enright had breached the provisions of the Local Government Act and failed to maintain proper standards of integrity.The public ethics body said Enright had wrongly conflated the issue of his dispute with the station over its coverage of the council, and the council’s commercial position as the station’s primary advertiser.The Sipo report was discussed by a special meeting of the council in January, during which councillors criticised the public ethics body before voting to take no action on foot of its report. The councillors then gave the county manager a standing ovation.Taoiseach Micheál Martin said he did not agree, and that others would take note of Sipo’s findings. The findings would have “far-reaching impacts” on the future behaviour of councils.“There cannot be any attempts to influence the content of any local radio discussion, debate or its treatment or coverage of any issue,” he said.“Even if there are advertisements that emanate from the council and so on, that is not correct. It can never be used for that purpose by anybody. I am very clear about that.”Fresh rowHowever, a row centred on exactly the same topic has again developed between Wexford County Council and South East Radio, with the station this time objecting strongly to “criteria” that the county secretary, Minogue, suggested should be agreed by the station as part of a deal over a proposed spend of €40,000-€50,000 on radio advertisements this year.In an email sent to Buttle on March 25th, Minogue said the council “does not consider it appropriate that a South East Radio broadcaster offers personal viewpoints and opinions on South East Radio.“I ask for assurances that South East Radio will take the steps necessary to ensure such personal views and opinions are not offered by your broadcasters in the future.”The council executive also suggested that the station ensure that “raw” material, meaning recorded material not broadcast by the station, be kept for a period of two years.A third criterion suggested by Minogue concerned what would happen when the council sought a right of reply in relation to something that had been broadcast by the station.“I ask that the matter end there, and that the original theme or issue is not raised again on South East Radio, as has happened previously.”In his response on April 1st, Buttle described what was being suggested as “frankly speaking, staggering” and said it was “absolutely necessary” to remind Minogue, and the council, of some very important recent events.“I find it very strange indeed that it is necessary for me to do so, given the gravity of those events. But the content of your email is so utterly devoid of any insight or learning from the Sipo investigation that I feel I must spell out some fundamental facts.”It was remarkable, he said, that Minogue’s email set out to follow the same course as that followed by county manager Enright in 2019.Buttle quoted the comments made in the Dáil by the Taoiseach in February, saying Martin had made his position “abundantly clear in relation to the kind of influence and misuse of power which your email of March 25th seeks to exert”.‘Profound criticism’Despite the “profound criticism” that Sipo had made of Enright, and the fact that a separate complaint by the council about South East Radio to the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland had been “rejected entirely”, the station had received no apology from the county manager or the council, Buttle said.He said he was forced to the conclusion that the criteria the council were seeking to impose were a “form of retaliation for, and a direct result of” the Sipo complaint that had been submitted by Fitzpatrick, and upheld in the Sipo report in January.Buttle said the regulator for radio stations was the Broadcasting Authority, and it was not appropriate for the council to seek to set itself up as a quasi-regulator.Minogue and the council appeared to “fundamentally misunderstand the role of a local authority vis a vis local (or indeed national) media in a democratic society”, Buttle said, before quoting from article 40.6 of the Constitution, which guarantees the right to freedom of expression.The council, Buttle said, was seeking to restrict open debate and public discourse in relation to the activities of the local authority within which South East Radio operates.“In a democratic society, such behaviour cannot and must not be tolerated. South East Radio certainly will not stand for it.”‘Really disappointed’He said the broadcaster was reserving its position in relation to the county secretary’s email.Minogue told The  that he was “really disappointed” by Buttle’s response. He said he felt it was “not appropriate” given the “reasonable” requests that had been made to the station.The county secretary is the council’s Ethics Registrar for the purpose of complaints made about the council under the Local Government Act. He said he was not aware of any fresh complaints having been made against the council in relation to South East Radio.Buttle did not respond to a request for a comment. Following the council meeting in January, when councillors voted to take no action on foot of the Sipo report, Enright issued a statement in which he said “we intend to look to put a service level agreement in place with South East Radio to facilitate an improved relationship in the future.”"},{"url":null,"title":"inside","story":"Decades of progress overshadowed by Putin crackdowns and confrontation with WestRussia\u0026rsquos land of the midnight sun said to have inspired creator of Chanel No. 5Atomic icebreakers and floating power plants to help Kremlin develop Arctic shipping routeMinority nations feel squeeze as Putin\u0026rsquos \u0026lsquopower vertical\u0026rsquo crushes republics\u0026rsquo autonomyHistory of bloodshed and tragedy haunts stunning region shared by Muslims and ChristiansOil wealth and new mosque and churches help keep Tatarstan on Kremlin\u0027s sideOfficials claim West wants to \u0026lsquoGermanise\u0026rsquo and instil special identity in strategic regionNato monitors heavily armed Kaliningrad as locals long for borders to reopenAttack on renowned Memorial rights group deepens opposition anger and international alarmSaint Petersburg Letter: Russia\u0026rsquos old imperial capital celebrates 200 years since birth of Crime and Punishment creatorEnergy giant hopes vast forests will offset carbon costs and ease green transitionCircassian heritage trampled and property rows continue as Winter Olympics city boomsKremlin criticised as most Russians reject vaccination and hospitals face huge strainKremlin changes tack on global warming and looks to vast forests to offset emissionsRussia and Japan co-operate on Sakhalin despite row over nearby Kuril islandsIndustry and struggling communities fear wildlife support could stifle Far East developmentCity with echoes of San Francisco is thrillingly original, yet tarnished by graft and neglectGrowing energy, security and diplomatic links between Moscow and Beijing worry WestDecembrist rebels and their aristocratic wives embraced \u0026lsquoreal Russia\u0026rsquo in Siberian exileFears for permafrost as tusk hunters feed Chinese market starved of elephant ivoryInside Russia: Melting permafrost threatens critical infrastructure and feeds global warmingStalin\u0027s popularity growing as Kremlin focuses on Soviet triumphs, not tragediesInside Russia: Party wonders how far it cane press Putin after years in soft \u0026lsquosystemic opposition\u0026rsquo roleInside Russia: More protests planned as officials reject calls to address e-voting complaintsMoscow Letter: Poet\u0026rsquos statue has been a magnet for generations of Russian dissentersOn the eve of an expected sham election, many of Putin\u0026rsquos political opponents are already jailed or dead"},{"url":null,"title":"young africans","story":"\u0026lsquoEntertainment is such a good way to bring forth change,\u0026rsquo says play\u0026rsquos narratorPhenomenal success of Nigerian artists is bringing both opportunities and criticismAuthors are tackling topics from transgender rights to Islamic extremism, and picking up plenty of awardsTom Saater has a rags to riches story and a unique insight into Nigeria\u0026rsquos biggest cityIn one of the world\u0026rsquos most dangerous places to attend school, teachers lead lessons and the students comeAfrican country\u0026rsquos tech innovators call for international investment and domestic supportYoung Nigerians dance out onto world stage with pride, confidence and high ambitionWomen-led organisation aims to stop atrocities of dictatorship from reoccurringIn the Gambia, a flourishing comedy scene is used to convey serious messagesStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"angela merkel doesnt deserve quiet retirement","story":"She was hailed as the world’s most powerful woman, the de facto leader of Europe and, for a while, of the free world. For 16 years Angela Merkel’s popularity in her native Germany never fell below 50 per cent. For those who put their faith in the EU, she could do no wrong.Then, when Russian tanks rolled into Ukraine, her reputation collapsed. Now her legacy lies in ruins. It is rather difficult to find a Western politician whose status has fallen off a cliff quite like Merkel’s. Ukrainians blame her for appeasing Putin and leaving them at his mercy. They recall the 2008 Bucharest summit, when George W. Bush wanted to offer Ukraine Nato membership but the Germans and French vetoed it.As the full horror of the Russian occupation emerged, Volodymyr Zelensky could not contain his wrath: “I invite Mrs Merkel and Mr Sarkozy to visit Bucha, to see what the policy of 14 years of concessions has led to. The Ukrainian president called on her and the former French president “to see with their own eyes the tortured Ukrainian men and women”.Even now, Angela Merkel apparently has no regrets. Her office issued a terse statement: “Former German Chancellor Dr Angela Merkel stands by her decisions in connection with the 2008 Nato summit in Bucharest.” She refuses to apologise, then, for any of the policies that have led Germany and Europe to catastrophe. Instead, Mrs Merkel is writing her memoirs, convinced that history will somehow vindicate her. Once it was fashionable to compare her with Margaret Thatcher. Yet her approach was the opposite of the Iron Lady’s. Where Mrs Thatcher stood up to tyrants, Mrs Merkel sought to accommodate them, in the naive belief that prosperity would rid Russia and China of their authoritarian regimes. Germans used to call her Mutti (“Mummy”). Not any more. Mrs Merkel is the kind of mother who, when her child is bullied and beaten up at school, refuses to confront the teachers and instead blames the victim.Her admirers used to boast that she enjoyed a uniquely honest relationship with Putin, because she could talk frankly to the Russian dictator in his own language. Yet the truth is that Mrs Merkel, the former East German, feared the former KGB thug – and he smelled her fear. In later years, they spoke only in German, enabling Putin to hold the whip hand.From the outset, there was something sadomasochistic about their relationship. When she was his guest in 2007, Putin brought his pet labrador Connie to one of their meetings, knowing that she was nervous of dogs. Yet she played along with his blatant misogyny and fell into all the geopolitical traps he had laid for her.The biggest of these traps was her decision to allow Germany to become ever more dependent on Russian energy. By the time she left office last year, Germany was importing 55 per cent of its gas, 34 per cent of its oil and 52 per cent of its coal from Russia. Her short-termist, opportunistic exit from nuclear power compounded this. Worst of all was Mrs Merkel’s stubborn support for the deeply sinister Nordstream gas pipeline project, which flew in the face of Anglo-American warnings and desperate pleas from Ukraine. She turned a blind eye to the fact that Nordstream’s chairman – her predecessor as Chancellor, Gerhard Schröder – was being bankrolled by Russian energy. Nordstream had all the hallmarks of political interference, but she insisted that it was purely commercial.Mrs Merkel is no less culpable for her failure to maintain German defences. On her watch, in the words of the Bundeswehr’s most senior general, they were “stripped bare”. She allowed German firms to sell “dual use” military equipment to Russia, but banned arms exports to Ukraine.After Putin annexed Crimea and sent his “little green men” into Ukraine’s Donbas region, the writing was on the wall. Yet Mrs Merkel persisted in “building bridges” to Russia right up to the day she left office last December. Her most senior colleagues, such as the former finance minister Wolfgang Schäuble and the former foreign minister, now President, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, have admitted that it was a fatal mistake to trust the Russian president. “Today I know — I was wrong,” Schäuble says. “We were all wrong.”Not Mrs Merkel, though. She, the chief architect of the European policies that gave Putin the green light to inflict war crimes on Ukraine, has yet to show any hint of contrition. It is high time that Angela Merkel said sorry to Ukraine, Europe and the free world. She owes us all an apology.More from NewsBritish er rescued off coast of Malaysia after three days lost at sea says his son diedCall to arms for gardeners to plant roses, as thorny perceptions leave flower in declineGovernment blames ‘unprepared’ travel industry for Easter getaway chaosBoris Johnson meets Volodymyr Zelensky in KyivWinston Churchill had ‘apparent racist views’, according to Westminster Council statue reviewVolodymyr Zelensky\u0026#39s wife says she and children have not seen president since start of the conflictMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"british museums carbon splurge demeaning nft scheme","story":"The British Museum’s attempt to raise funds by selling digital NFTs has produced enough carbon emissions to power a home for 57 years, analysis suggests.NFTs, or non-fungible tokens, are digital assets stored and traded using the same blockchains that are used for cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin and Ethereum.Launched earlier this year, its NFT project has attracted criticism from the art historian Bendor Grosvenor, presenter of the BBC show Britain’s Lost Masterpieces, who said the museum “demeans itself” by taking part in the trend.The British Museum project uses the blockchain Ethereum, and the carbon footprint comes from the way the transactions take place.Each transaction must be verified, and users compete to do this by solving complex computer puzzles in order to earn cryptocurrency - a process which uses large amounts of electricity.Writing in The Art Newspaper, Mr Grosvenor said: “The Digiconomist website estimates that each transaction uses enough electricity to power the average US home for around nine days, producing 150kg of CO2.“So just for the British Museum’s NFTs already offered for sale, we get a starting carbon cost of 315 tonnes of CO2—enough to power that US home for 57 years.”Last year, the museum’s whole carbon footprint was 5,861 tonnes, its annual report shows.The NFTs sold by the museum include images of art by JMW Turner and 19th century Japanese artist Katsushika Hokusai, famous for Under the Wave off Kanagawa, also known as “The Great Wave”.Ownership of an NFT representing one of these artworks does not give the owner any rights to the actual painting.The museum says it is still examining the carbon emissions of the project and told The  it would be offsetting its environmental impact. The website LaCollection, which hosts the art sales, says it plants a tree for each NFT it makes. One broad-leaf tree absorbs an estimated one tonne of carbon dioxide over a 100-year lifetime.Offsets, often based on paying to plant trees or absorb carbon through restoring other ecosystems such as peatlands, face criticism due to the difficulty of quantifying the carbon absorbed and controversy around “double-counting”, where two businesses both claim the same carbon removal.Dr Catherine Flick, a reader in computing and social responsibility at De Montfort University, said: “It’s kind of like a collectible card game. I think there’s a limit to the sustainability of that, as well.“The initial push for it will be exciting and maybe make a lot of money, but I suspect this whole thing is going to die down quite significantly in a few years’ time, as people realise they are pretty worthless.“Is that worth the hit for the climate that it’s making? Especially completely frivolous stuff like this.”A spokesman for the museum said it would soon be moving to “Ethereum 2.0”, a new version that uses significantly less energy, though this project has been repeatedly delayed.He said: “We are serious about our commitment to sustainability and the environment and have put in place a plan to minimise the impact.“In technical terms, the British Museum’s NFTs are currently on the Ethereum blockchain and we plan to move to Ethereum 2.0 as soon as it is made available this year.“Ethereum 2.0 only requires a tiny fraction of the energy usage compared to Ethereum.“Our NFT partner LaCollection is also currently undertaking an analysis of the environmental impact of the programme and investigating the best possible offset solution – we expect any solution to offset existing energy usage and any future developments.”More from NewsBritish er rescued off coast of Malaysia after three days lost at sea says his son diedCall to arms for gardeners to plant roses, as thorny perceptions leave flower in declineGovernment blames ‘unprepared’ travel industry for Easter getaway chaosBoris Johnson meets Volodymyr Zelensky in KyivWinston Churchill had ‘apparent racist views’, according to Westminster Council statue reviewVolodymyr Zelensky\u0026#39s wife says she and children have not seen president since start of the conflictMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"call arms gardeners plant roses thorny perceptions leave flower","story":"Despite the spring season being upon us it appears it’s not looking so rosy in Britain’s gardens.Sales of home-grown rose plants are estimated to have declined from 65 million a year in the 1960s to just five million last year as young people consider the bloom to be “old-fashioned and twee”.Now, in a desperate bid to revive the rose, a new campaign has been launched to convince the new generation of lockdown gardeners that the flower does not require months of toil but can actually create “instant gardens.”Experts are also eager to debunk the myth that roses need intensive pruning and constant spraying to keep pests at bay.The campaign, which is being championed by TV\u0027s David Domoney, will use the Royal Horticultural Society Chelsea Flower Show in May for a formal “call to arms” for consumers, growers and breeders to champion the beleaguered rose.The message will be that modern hybrids are easy to grow, resistant to disease like black spot and mildew, do not require harmful fungicide sprays and can be planted in hedging, borders, beds, on patios, balconies, as climbers or in a vegetable plot.And while bright reds and pinks have been traditional favourite colours, nowadays glorious apricots, yellows and golds are increasingly popular.Mr Domoney, from ITV’s Love Your Weekend, said: “I’m passionate about roses and there has been a massive love of roses in Britain throughout our history, but roses are vanishing from our public parks and gardens and people are taking roses for granted.“Young people see them as oldfashioned and rather twee and what their grandparents grew.“So it’s time we stood up for the rose and appreciate its versatility - its beauty, use in perfumes, health treatments and even in food.”A social media campaign will showcase roses in all forms and spaces with Mr Domoney offering growing tips.Video footage will also show how he transforms a 20mx20m plot at his home to create a traditional Regency style tea garden with fountain, parterre and pergola.Some 5,000 rose plants have already been sent out to community gardens across the country and images are also to be posted as part of the campaign. The plan is to give away a further 100,000 over the next 10 years.Among the rose varieties being featured in the campaign are the Chandos Beauty, Lady Marmalade, Sweet Syrie, Easy Does It and Raspberry Royale.David White, the managing director of Harkness Roses which is also supporting the campaign, said: “When I was a boy roses were seen in public parks and gardens everywhere, but over the years their reputation has gone down as people think they are too difficult to grow and you have to go on a three-day pruning course to look after them.“But the new varieties are so easy to grow. Young gardeners don’t want to spend months tending their garden, they just want an instant garden that can be an outdoor room to their home and roses are ideal and great value. A typical plant costs £15 that will give 100 flowers a year for 15 years which works out 1p a flower.“We want to galvanise all growers and breeders to revive the rose.”Chris Warner, of Warner’s Roses and Rose Society, added: “For too long roses have been perceived as a problem and this campaign is just what we need to inform people that roses have changed.“Old varieties requiring fungicide sprays gave roses a bad name. Now we need to show off our roses in railway stations, airports, everywhere so people can see the beauty, colour, drama and impact of roses.”More from NewsBritish er rescued off coast of Malaysia after three days lost at sea says his son diedGovernment blames ‘unprepared’ travel industry for Easter getaway chaosBoris Johnson meets Volodymyr Zelensky in KyivWinston Churchill had ‘apparent racist views’, according to Westminster Council statue reviewVolodymyr Zelensky\u0026#39s wife says she and children have not seen president since start of the conflictLondoners swap costly property for boating life as cost-of-living crisis mountsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"government blames unprepared travel industry easter getaway","story":"Ministers have accused the travel industry of failing to prepare for a post-Covid upsurge in demand which has led to continuing delays at airports.Thousands of people heading abroad for the Easter holidays have been warned they face long queues, delays and cancellations.Manchester Airport, along with others, has warned that long waits at security could continue as it struggles with staff shortages, with some passengers facing queues of 60 to 90 minutes over the next few weeks.But ministers on Saturday blamed the travel industry for cutting thousands of jobs during the pandemic without planning properly for a smooth return to higher demand.The aviation industry in general is suffering from difficulties recruiting staff and waiting for security checks to be passed on new employees.Labour has urged ministers to prioritise staff at Manchester and other major airports for Home Office security checks so they can start work as soon as possible.But a Government source said: In part, I think this might be the travel industry trying to blame someone else for their own problems with absences created by Covid and how they treated their staff during the pandemic.Another Government source added: A lot of people were laid off despite furlough so you suddenly have a bow wave of vetting. I\u0027m a bit surprised they have been caught unawares with the volume of passengers because you would expect with all these restrictions going that people having not properly gone abroad for ages would really be in the mood to travel. “But even if you know it\u0027s coming, it doesn\u0027t just mean you can just recreate a workforce. It\u0027s a massive surge in capacity. You\u0027ve got to get them checked before you bring them on.Airport operators hit back, saying they could not recruit while travel restrictions were in place and that a rapid increase in demand from travellers when they were fully lifted last month, along with a backlog in security vetting and competition for labour from other industries, had created a “perfect storm”.It is understood that it can take up to six months for security clearance to be issued to new airport staff by the Cabinet Office, with some of those waiting to get jobs in other sectors.Ken O\u0027Toole, the deputy chief executive of Manchester Airports Group, said the speed the travel industry had recovered had taken Manchester Airport by surprise, leaving it short-staffed.He added that 220 new staff who have been recruited were being trained and would start work over the coming weeks.Karen Dee, chief executive of the Airport Operators Association said: “This late surge in bookings was partly driven by the government removing the final remaining travel restrictions as recently as 18 March.Airports anticipated it would be busy at peak times and have had big recruitment campaigns underway since the beginning of the year when the first travel restrictions were removed. However, with many passengers still having to present Covid-related documents at check-in, people being less familiar with security screening rules, some staff shortages due to tight labour markets as well as Covid-related staff absences, this can increase check-in times and security screening at peak times.Airports are putting all available staff on the front line, including senior leadership and other people who normally work in different parts of the operation. This means that for most passengers, although the journey through the airport may be busy, airports are getting them away on their holidays safely.Airlines have also been hit by Covid-related staff absences, with a total of more than 100 daily flights being cancelled by EasyJet and British Airways. Shadow Transport Secretary Louise Haigh MP said: “Instead of casting around for someone else to blame, Conservative ministers should look in the mirror.“They were warned about staffing shortages, and yet they have comprehensively failed to take action to tackle the security backlog hampering recruitment. It is simply absurd to suggest Easter has taken them by surprise.”“They need to get a grip, do their jobs, and act to ease the disruption by clearing the huge backlogs in security checks so airport staff can safely begin work.”The suspension of P\u0026ampO ferry services and bad weather have also caused delays at Dover.With up to 70 sailings a day still reportedly affected, roads in Kent have seen long tailbacks as lorries queue to get into the port of Dover. A 23-mile (37km) stretch of road into Dover, the M20 Southbound, remains closed, with thousands of lorries trying to reach the port being held.People travelling to France via the Channel Tunnel were advised on Saturday to bring food and drink as lengthy queues continued at the Port of Dover.Toby Howe, tactical lead at the Kent Resilience Forum, advised travellers to France to “allow a lot of extra time”, adding: “Make sure you have got some food and drink because there will be delays.” At the same time, people travelling over the Easter weekend are set to face delays and cancellations due to engineering works on the rail network.No trains will run in or out of Euston, which is likely to disrupt fans travelling to the FA Cup semi-finals. Network Rail is advising Manchester City and Liverpool fans against travelling by train to Wembley Stadium on 16 April as trains from the North West will terminate at Milton Keynes Central, potentially leaving fans stranded.Engineering works on rail and Tube will also have an impact on services to Heathrow, Gatwick and London Stansted from Good Friday to Easter Monday.More from NewsBritish er rescued off coast of Malaysia after three days lost at sea says his son diedCall to arms for gardeners to plant roses, as thorny perceptions leave flower in declineBoris Johnson meets Volodymyr Zelensky in KyivWinston Churchill had ‘apparent racist views’, according to Westminster Council statue reviewVolodymyr Zelensky\u0026#39s wife says she and children have not seen president since start of the conflictLondoners swap costly property for boating life as cost-of-living crisis mountsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"princess anne starts australian tour opening 200th sydney royal","story":"The Princess Royal has commenced her three-day visit of Australia by returning to the Sydney Royal Easter Show, which she first opened with her mother, brother and father in 1970.Princess Anne was the guest of honour at the opening ceremony for the event as it celebrated its 200th anniversary on Saturday.In the same 150-year-old horse-drawn carriage which carried herself, the Queen, the late Duke of Edinburgh and Prince Charles into the show 52 years ago, the princess again made her way into the main arena to officially open the event on Saturday afternoon.Accompanied by her husband, Vice Admiral Sir Timothy Laurence, the royal is visiting the Commonwealth nation on behalf of the Queen in celebration of her Platinum Jubilee.She previously opened the show in 1988.Princess Anne, who is the patron of the Royal Agricultural Society of the Commonwealth, viewed stands and displays ahead of a planned dinner at Sydney Olympic Park.On Sunday, the royal and her husband will meet representatives of the New South Wales Rural Fire Service as well as those affected by the devastating bushfires and more recent floods, which continue to impact Sydney and the Australian east coast.Princess Anne\u0027s Australian trip on behalf of her mother will conclude with a visit to the Royal Australian Corps of Signals and Royal Australian Corps of Transport on Monday before travelling to Papua New Guinea.On Monday and Tuesday the royal and her husband will tour the island nation, visiting Caritas Technical Secondary School, St John Ambulance, the Bomana War Cemetery, the Adventure Park Papua New Guinea and the National Museum and Art Gallery.The princess will also open a Women\u0027s Resource Centre at Vabukori Village and the National Cardiac Diagnostic Centre at Port Moresby General Hospital, respectively, and meet elders and community leaders at Hanuabada Village.Princess Anne will conclude the two-day tour with a dinner with Prime Minister James Marape and representatives from across the charity sector and business groups.More from NewsBritish er rescued off coast of Malaysia after three days lost at sea says his son diedCall to arms for gardeners to plant roses, as thorny perceptions leave flower in declineGovernment blames ‘unprepared’ travel industry for Easter getaway chaosBoris Johnson meets Volodymyr Zelensky in KyivWinston Churchill had ‘apparent racist views’, according to Westminster Council statue reviewVolodymyr Zelensky\u0026#39s wife says she and children have not seen president since start of the conflictMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"eric pickles moans grenfell inquiry","story":"Eric Pickles moans to Grenfell Inquiry he has a busy day then gets death toll wrongTory Lord Pickles complained he had an extremely busy day meeting people and I would urge you to use your time wisely at the probe into the fire that killed  people, years after his war on red tape.

Lord Pickles, who led a crackdown on “red tape” while in charge of the housing department from  to , admitted ministers should have acted more on warnings before the blaze during two days of questioning. But on his second day he snapped to lead counsel to the inquiry Richard Millett QC: By all means sir, feel free to ask me as many questions as you like. “But could I respectfully remind you that you did promise that we would be away this morning and I have changed my schedules to fit this in. I do have an extremely busy day meeting people. But this is more important than anything - but I would urge you to use your time wisely.  Lord Pickles later apologised for “any way I seemed discourteous”, adding: “As soon as I left the room I took the decision to cancel everything. “This is more important than anything I’m doing and I apologise… I fully understand that you’re doing a proper job.” But at the end of his evidence, he tripped up separately - appearing to mistake the death toll for that of Hillsborough, which until recently was . The toll from the  football ground disaster rose to  last year after a coroner’s ruling on the death of fan Andrew Devine. Lord Pickles referred to coroneraposs recommendations after the  Lakanal House fire in south London, which killed six people and injured  more. The first report from the Grenfell Inquiry found lessons from Lakanal fire had not been learned by the time of the Grenfell disaster eight years later.  He said: “It comes down to Michelleand to the nameless  people who were killed in the Grenfell fire. Itaposs them who we should think about when weaposre arguing the toss. Ultimately, as Iaposve said earlier, the dead deserve the dignity of being remembered by name and the dead deserve the dignity of a solution.”Lord Pickles was also chairman of the Conservative Party from  to .He made the mistake at the end of his evidence while answeringthere was anything he would have done dferently. After Lakanal, he said, “maybe I should have put in the letter the simple sentence aposand I accept the coroneraposs recommendationsapos - would that have changed things ”. But he added: “I donapost think it would have made any dference whatsoever.  There was a kind of mindset that existed in parts of the department that just simply ignored what was happening, made a view about what we were and came to it. Askedthe department should have “done more” to take on the lessons from Lakanal he replied: “Oh, definitely”. He added it was a personal failing on his part, “on the basis that I’m responsible for everything. The fact that I didn’t know about it, that no one briefed me… is no reasonable excuse, because ultimately it is always my fault.” But he also slammed firms that used flammable cladding, saying: “The conditions existed that there were people putting things in, into  and the like, that were combustible. “The idea to me is: how would anybody ever want to do that  How would they ever think it was a good idea ” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Eric PicklesConservative PartyPublic inquiryRed tapePolitics\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

That is down by , since the , in the week ending  February . Rail services are battling Covid absences and a funding crisis - as there are still only % as many passengers travelling as pre-pandemic, the data shows. Passenger numbers have risen as fast as a million a week, hitting .million weekly journeys in the most recent figures. But this is down from .million weekly journeys pre-pandemic. And despite fares rising .% last month, services are still being cut to save cash. More cuts are planned in Yorkshire next month - leaving a two-hour, ten-minute gap between the .pm and .pm service from Leeds to Harrogate.  Labour, which obtained the leaked Rail Delivery Group data, blasted the figures just months after Tory ministers vowed to “protect and improve services” in the Integrated Rail Plan.Shadow Transport Secretary Louise Haigh said: “The Conservatives should come clean and admit they are taking the axe to vital rail services across the country. “This is the exact opposite of what the Conservatives promised, and will hit communities hard. “To add insult to injury, last month they clobbered passengers with another brutal fare hike.” The Rail Delivery Group said it was “only sensible” that services reflect the “new world” of passenger numbers that have “changed radically with the pandemic”, “so that the railway doesn’t take more than its fair share from the taxpayer”. Askedservices would ever get back to what they were in early , a spokesperson said: “Nothing is set in stone and we will continually monitor how passengersand look to step up services where there is enough demand from passengers.”  It comes days after local leaders said they were “shafted” by Boris Johnson’s bus funding which went to fewer than half of eligible areas. A Department for Transport spokesperson said: “The railways experienced an unprecedented fall in passenger numbers during the pandemic. “Not adjusting rail services would have been irresponsible and unfair on those taxpayers’ forced to foot the bill – many of whom do not use the railways. “Instead, this Government committed almost £bn to ensure vital services continued to run and key workers were able to keep using them. “Whilst passengers are ing, it is important to ensure service levels reflect demand, which is still % less than in , and we will keep working with operators to do so.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Conservative PartyDepartment for TransportBoris JohnsonRailwaysSave moneyPolitics\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Manager Karen Noble is on a mission to make sure people are getting the support and benefits they need – and this is particularly important for older visitors, who might feel isolated. “It’s not just about organising activities they can get involved with: conversations might come out of that,” says Karen. “People will tell you what they’re struggling with and how you can support them. You might find out that they’ve been given an iPad but have no internet connection, or that they don’t feel safe because some kids have been throwing eggs in the streets. “We have a lot of older people who shouldbe receiving benefits but they’re not. So we want to get that message out to them. They’ll go ‘No, I’m alright’ because there is a bit of pride there – but we want to make sure they get everything they’re entitled to.”Karen is devoted to helping people in the local community because she knows what it’s like to struggle.

Mr Dida was also cleared of assisting an offender.A lack of closure hangs over the family since his death in hospital after being stabbed in the leg in Wisbech, Cambridgeshire, around am on Tuesday, September  in , reports the Echo.Tomaposs mum Sharon canapost bring herself to visit the place her son died or to hang his picture on her wall. She can barely dwell on happy moments with Tom, saying: I just keep thinking of how heaposs in the ground with one leg. Tom was ananimal loverwho once came home with a rescued seagull biting his finger before calling the RSPCA to pick it up.For a while, a chicken lived in a pen at the end of his bed, pecking his feet as he slept. Before he died, he considered moving back to Liverpool and ing to college to pursue his dream of working with animals. He was a prankster too, once filling his sleeping nephewaposs hands and toes with birdseed while the chicken was in the room, and often jumping out of cupboards to scare Ben, his older brother. Tom, who was fiercely proud of his Irish heritage, was the most outgoing person you could ever meet, heaposd do anything for anyone, heaposd talk to anybody, according to his sister Neneh. The -year-old laughed as she recalled his boisterous voice, saying: Youaposd just know straight away, aposOh thataposs Tomapos, youaposd hear him from down the street. Youaposd always know it was him because he wouldnapost be quiet. He was just one of those people, everybody knew him.She wants to remember him as the outgoing, loving person that he was, saying: Heaposs just the best type of person ever. I donapost even know how I could describe him. Youaposd never get another one. They broke the mould when they made him. He was the best brother you could wish for, the best uncle I could choose for my kids, and the best dad. He was just an amazing person.

Benaposs voice broke as he recalled arriving to see his brotheraposs face all squashed up, with tubes going down his throat.He said: Itaposs not the way you want to see someone for the last time, especially not your brother.For two days, Tom was in hospitals undergoing surgery and having his leg amputated.The wait was really traumatic for Neneh, who was preparing herself for Tom not pulling through. Sharon felt sick, like youaposre going to die, as she heard developments. Ben tried to convince himself Tom would survive, saying: Thataposs what I was telling myself, and I was telling everyone he was going to be okay, you know, aposheaposs going to struggle for a while, but heaposs going to be fineapos.  But it became clear Tom wouldnapost make it. His then-one-year-old son, Thomas, lay on his chest when his le support was turned off in Addenbrookeaposs Hospital, Cambridge. Ben held Tomaposs hand, wishing he could take his brotheraposs place as the -year-oldaposs heart stopped on Thursday, September , . Ben said: If it had been the other way around, heaposd have been with me, and I believe that he knew we were there. Neneh is still kind of in denial and angry at the fact that le his le had been taken away. She moved to Wisbech after Tomaposs death to be closer to his son, describing him as a lovely and good kid who Tom would be proud of.Neneh said: Heaposs just like his dad. Heaposs funny, heaposs got the best personality for a two-year-old, heaposs really clever. Heaposs just like his dad in every way. Despite the trace of Tom left in his son, the family is all too aware of the pain Thomas may feel in later le when he learns what happened to his dad. Ben said: [Thomas] has to grow up without a dad. We have to grow up without a brother and a son. Itaposs not right that I have to tell my nephew what his dad was like. I shouldnapost have to do that. Thataposs not something I should have to do.

One Twitter user said: My gran is in at the moment and the food is horrendous.The Queen Elizabeth University Hospital is run by NHS Greater Glasgow  Clyde. A spokesperson said: A two-week rotating menu enables patients to choose from a iety of meals based on their personal preferences and also that of their families and carers, ensuring food served is tailored to their needs. If a patient wishes to provide any feedback or is unhappy with their food, we actively encourage them to raise this with us directly through nursing or catering staff, through our online feedback forms, or, via the ‘Food and Health in Hospital’ form given to them as part of their stay. This ensures that we can act quickly to make appropriate changes when required. Unannounced, regular visits to the wards review the quality of food delivered to the patients, helping ensure patients are happy with their meals.In February The Mirror told how hospitals in England were forcing doctors to become ­“Deliveroo Docs” which was creating an unhealthy workforce.The doctors used fast food delivery apps to help get them through long late shts. Doctors, nurses and support staff working late and at weekends say they have to use Deliveroo, Just Eat and Uber Eats as hospital catering is often based around regular office hours.

Rows of marquees have been set up, guard dogs are patrolling and I bet there’ll be all kinds of posh frocks and fancy food.Our Robert always liked David as the pair were both in Manchester United’s Class of . My late husband Colin enjoyed chatting to his mum and dad - they seem lovely people. For the Beckhams and Brooklyn’s we to be, money is no object so it’s probably normal for them to spend so much money on a wedding. But for me, vows are always the most important thing in a wedding. When you can really feel the couple’s love and pick up a sense of everyone in the room wishing them them a happy le, that’s what makes a cracking wedding - not the size of the ice sculpture or amount of champagne on tap. Weddings always take me back to me and Colin’s big day, when I wore a mini dress with a floppy hat because it was the days of Mary Quant style. Colin wore a brown suit and kipper tie which he insisted was green and I joked he was colourblind. The years would prove that he actually was, and I still have no idea how he was able to play snooker. We had our reception in a room above a pub across the road from my parents’ house. Everyone there knew us since we were knee high and, until the days my two sons were born, it was the happiest day of my le. Our first night as husband and we was spent in my aunt’s flat in Wrexham. But guests had sneaked in before us and as soon as we pulled the bedsheets back, we found long lines of apples all strung together. Attending a wedding feels like a little holiday, when you wear your Sunday best and have a night in a hotel. And there’s always one highlight I always look forward to: the food. I wish the photographs would hurry up so we could get the pate out. I learned over the years to keep a little packet of KP nuts in my handbag at weddings. When I ask everyone at the tablethey’d like some nuts from the bar they always refuse. But when I offer mine around but they never refuse. They’re only small bags so by the time it comes back to me there are about three nuts at the bottom. So here’s wishing Brooklyn Beckham all the best. And to the VIP guests: don’t forget your peanuts. Why Wrexham is greatest placeWrexham is on the shortlist to be named Britain’s city of culture .I can’t understand why. If judges visit now, they’ll find most of the shops boarded up and only pound or charity shops left. It used to be a pretty market town but it’s gone to pot. Yet it doesn’t matter that it might not look the most picturesque place. Becausethe judges care to scratch the surface of Wrexham and really get to know the people here, I’ve no doubt they’ll adore the place as much as I do. No one here can be doing with people who are all fur coat and no knickers. We don’t all come together in a snooty cafe to talk about books - we meet at the football ground each weekend. And everyone here looks out for each other. My friend Rob has called to cut my lawn ever since I lost Colin ten years ago, and this week he brought his we Sonia along so we could chat while he worked.  Not long after they’d gone, Rob rang my doorbell to deliver me a plated up dinner of liver and onions, which I’d mentioned was my favourite. He said: “Sonia noticed you were bad on your legs and have been eating ready meals because you can’t stand at the oven long.” Such kindness made me fill up. And I felt the same when a man rushed out of the GP surgery when they saw me struggle to get out of Janet’s car to offer his arm and say: “Can you manage, darling ” Wrexham is a place where everyone’s welcome, where kids’ bikes can be left unchained outside and everyone says hello and would have a good old chatyou have time. That’s the essence of Wrexham and its people. And that’s why, for me, it’s the best place on earth whether we win city of culture or not. Ender an era for soaps News of June Brown’s death really moved me. Even though I stopped watching EastEnders years ago, I loved Dot Cotton with her fag dangling out the side of her mouth. Brilliant actors like June made soap operas a hit because they created real characters. June and I share a le outlook: there’s no point worrying about tomorrow because we mightn’t be alive, so we might as well enjoy today.  Iaposll give Chris some stick On our Robert’s Radio  Live show, Chris Sutton loves winding him up. Chris assumed Scotland would qualy in World Cup games to play England, even though Wales has just as good a chance. The patriotic side of me came roaring out like a dragon. So I told Rob to tell Chris thathe makes fun of Wales again, I’ll have to shove my walking stick where the sun don’t shine. Will was silly...Iaposd have got to him backstage I am still stunned Will Smith slapped Chris Rock at the Oscars. Demonstrating violence in front of a global audience was utterly wrong. If I’d been in the theatre and someone made a hurtful remark against a member of my family, I’d have waited until I was backstage and said: “Excuse me, what you said was not nice at all.” Then I’d have smacked him.  *******I might be the only person in the world who doesn’t have a smart-arse phone. And I’ve no intention of buying one. I have an old fashioned mobile which can text and make calls and that’s it.The clock still shows an hour behind and I wouldn’t bother altering it evenI knew how. I appreciate anything that makes me feel even a little bit younger. If you’d like to contact Val, email features@mirror or write to Val Savage, PO Box , E DD.

It wasn’t the most exciting place – clearly,dodgy alcopops are my top takeaway from three years as a student there. Still, I was dismayed to hear the city was this week named Britain’s worst night out, rated th out of .So how bad is it really  Returning for one night only, I asked my cabbie, Abdul, where to go for a good time. He reeled off a list of chains – Slug and Lettuce, Turtle Bay, The Botanist before adding most of his fares go to the station for a night in Birmingham. “Haven’t you heard the song ” he said. “Coventry’s a ghost town – especially when the students go home.”  In the town centre I stumble across crowds chanting, “We want answers, we want answers”. Turns out they’re on the Great Middlemarch Mystery Tour – based on George Eliot’s book – in celebration of Coventry’s status as City of Culture. It’s nowhere near so lively in the Slug and Lettuce and friends Emma Logan and Laura Roughton, both , are shocked how dead it is. Emma says: “Coventry used to be so good for going out. The nightle has definitely got worse. “Now, none of the older crowd goes out. Maybe they are too used to drinking at home after Covid ”  Nikita Sharma, , and Millie Quinn, , are unsurprised by Coventry’s ranking. Nikita says: “It’s true there are not many places to go, that’s why we always end up in the Slug and Lettuce!” The study by website Get Licensed gave the city a score of . out of  after looking at the number of venues and the cost of a pint. But just across from the Slug and Lettuce is Coventry’s oldest pub, The Golden Cross. It also features in the Good Pub Guide for its quality ales. Regular Matthew Campbell says: “There are things happening, but you really have to seek them out. “We have The Yard. There is also FarGo village, which is great for live music. Down Corporation Street you will find independent places.  “And we’re in a place of great historical signicance.” Historian Ruth Cherrington has written three books on her home city and says: “Locals don’t like how much of a student city it has become.

Sharlene Bockross, from Leicester, died suddenly just after Christmas, aged , leaving behind her -year-old son Tyler. The mum didnapost have much money or assets, but what little she did was passed down to the family. However, Sharlene has spent more than £ on a Jet summer holiday to the Greek island of Kos.Jet are reportedly demanding the family go through probate - appointing an executor of Sharleneaposs estate at a huge cost -they want the money back, LeicestershireLive reports.  The familyaposs solicitor has advised them that to get the £ back they will have to pay out about £ to go through probate. Thereaposs no set level for when a bereaved family needs to go through probate, but itaposs usually for larger estates involving multiple assets. For Sharleneaposs estate, this would be unnecessary. Sharleneaposs mum, Karen Gaze, said: She died suddenly and unexpectedly on December  from a cardiac arrest. Her brother, Paul, found her and tried to resuscitate her. We are all devastated. We later learned she had a heart condition she wasnapost aware of. She was supposed to be taking Tyler on holiday on June  to celebrate Tyleraposs th birthday. Sharlene was always a forward-thinker and she would pay a bit towards the holiday every month so that she could pay for it all in advance. She had paid about £ of the £, for the two of them. The trip to Kos was for Sharlene, Tyler, Sharleneaposs sister Sammi and Sammiaposs two daughters. Karen said there was nothing in the small print of the payment plan to suggest it would be so hard to get a refund upon Sharleneaposs death. She said: Jet are very sympathetic on the phone and very nice about it, but they are telling me I must have an executor for Shareleneaposs estate, which my solicitor says is just completely unnecessary and will cost about £. The money is for Tyler and we want him to have it but all heaposs going to get is £ once weaposve paid to appoint the executor. Itaposs so annoying because weaposve set up an account for the money Sharlene did have to go into and the banks have let us get the money. But this money is for Sharleneaposs poor son and Jet are digging their heels in. Iaposve sent the death certicate and even her birth certicate to prove that Iaposm her mum. But theyaposll only send the money to the executor of her estate. Itaposs been hard for Tyler - heaposs only  and heaposs got his GCSEs coming up. Heaposs being very strong but itaposs been hard, emotionally, for us all. I just donapost want to be arguing anymore. Explaining that lying would have been easier, she said: Ironically, I could have just phoned pretending to be Sharlene and asked to cancel and they would have given me a full refund. But I decided to be honest instead. Jet confirmed they were not going to make exceptions to the rules for Karen. They said in a statement: “We would like to extend our sincere condolences to Ms Gaze and her family at this dficult time. As the account used to make the original booking has been closed, we cannot refund that account. As such, we have requested for Ms Gaze to provide documentation showing her to be the named executor of her daughter’s estate so that we can refund her directly. As we have not received this proof of authority, we are unfortunately unable to do this. We sincerely hope to be able to complete the refund once this proof of authority is confirmed, and we have been in touch with Ms Gaze to explain this.” The Mirror contacted Jet for a statement.

The devastating crash left her covered in horric injuries, including brain hemorrhages, a cut lung and a snapped shinRabekah Malook, , sustained a brain injury and was left with a broken shin after she was run over when she was ByRyan FaheyNews Reporter:,  Apr |comments A model who sustained le-changing injuries in a horror accident in her teens has gone on to become a fitness instructor after learning how to walk again. Rabekah Malook, , who model s for beauty and fashion labels and also works as a personal trainer at an east London gym, was just  years old when she was rushed to intensive care after a speeding driver ran her down on her way to school.When she arrived at Paddington General Hospital a team of  doctors were waiting to sedate her and get her urgently on le support. They found the impact of the collision had fractured her skull, and sheaposd been left with three brain hemmorhages. Her shin had also been shattered in a clean break and there were cuts on her lungs, as well as a number of teeth knocked out in the crash, she told The Mirror.But with the help of DIY physiotherapy and perseverance with her training - she says she steadily built up her strength so she can now spend hours working out in the gym each day.Recalling the day she was hit, she told The Mirror: I was on my way to school, crossing a road I did every morning, and a driver was speeding while checking his phone or fiddling with the radio, and he crashed into me.”Rabekah, who lived in Golders Green, was left lying in the middle of the street for paramedics to get to the scene. As they arrived, so did her parents after her terried sister found her in the road. She adds: By the time my parents had come out the ambulance had arrived. My mum passed out because she wasn’t allowed in with me. My dad was the first at the scene, so he hopped in - but by that time I had regained consciousness. I was still in shock and started punching out and kicking while laying on the stretcher.  She explained how the trauma of the crash - which had fractured her skull and caused bleeding on the brain - had affected her ability to speak. She said: “I wasn’t able to make words, I was just making sounds. Eventually they got me to a hospital in Paddington where there were a team of  to  doctors waiting for me.” She added: They basically sedated me to do the scans to see what injuries I had. After that I was put on le support in intensive care - hooked up to the machines with tubes coming out of me.After leaving the ICU I was in a comatose state for the next two or three days.” While drting in and out of consciousness, Rabekahaposs terried family had been trying to help her communicate. And the -year-oldaposs answers worried them further after she replied that she just had really bad flu or that sheaposd broken her leg at school sports day, or even told them she was convinced she was a duck. “It’s funny now, but at the time it was terrying for my parents”, she explained.Rabekah said: I had a fractured skull and three brain hemorrhages. And at one point the doctors were thinking of operating on my brain. I was left with a clean break across my shin bone, a cut lung, I’m partly deaf in my right ear, all broken teeth, fractured skull as well as the brain injuries. I also had a very deep cut worryingly close to my jugular that needed stitches. After leaving hospital, Rabekah said the crash also had a devastating impact on her mental health. She explained: I was very withdrawn emotionally. I didn’t really careI lived or died. I wouldn’t eat either for a while so lost a lot of weight from that. As part of her recovery, Rabekah had to undergo specialist therapy for the brain trauma and her hearing issues. She said she also had to learn how to walk again.  With no physiotherapists in her area, her dad took the lead - taking her on long walks to help regain the muscle strength in her shattered leg. Rabekah was turned in to an elderly woman at the age of , she said, adding that she had to use a zimmer frame to get around. It majorly affected my balance, and the brain damage left me dizzy all the time, she said. Even now I can still get really tired and stumble around a lot. My clients at the gym even see me falling over sometimes.I had to learn how to walk and would hobble around with a limp. And I couldn’t walk in a straight line either. Then I was having headaches every day and migraines every other day too.I had to get around in a wheelchair because of my leg injury but also was given a zimmer frame to use.

Internal emails show the head of a medal committee agreeing to follow “lines to take” from “our compensation colleagues” and accepting bogus information about nuclear test veterans.He wrongly linked medals to the issue of whether servicemen were injured - in clear breach of the rules - and went on to refuse gongs for five dferent groups of ex-servicemen. Now there are calls for the committee to be scrapped, and medals to be awarded to all those it has rejected since it was formed four years ago. Plymouth MP Johnny Mercer, who as Veterans Minister repeatedly told Parliament the committee was independent, said it was time for politicians to intervene.He said: “I think ministers should interrogate that committee, and perhaps try to understand why they’re not getting medals. I don’t think there’s evidence I was misled, but I do not think that decision about nuclear veterans was right.” The emails were uncovered after a six-month Freedom of Information battle about the Advisory Military Sub Committee which considers medal claims. It was set up, following a Mirror campaign in , to consider a gong for nuclear veterans. The emails show an unnamed civil servant telling committee chairman Charles Winstanley: “I thought you might be interested to see the lines to take that our compensation colleagues use in response to the nuclear test veterans’ claims.”  It is understood compensation colleagues refers to either government lawyers, or officials in Veterans UK, part of the MoD which administers war pensions. Neither are supposed to have any influence on medal decisions. The email makes  claims about Britain’s nuclear tests, including that no men were used in experiments, they were well-monitored, and there is no “evidence of excess illness or mortality”. The government’s own studies show the opposite is true. Within minutes, Winstanley replies calling this “succinct and relevant”, adding it “may be useful in any response to PQs [parliamentary questions].” He went on to refuse a medal, on the grounds there was insufficient “risk and rigour” to the nuclear tests. In February, the Mirror revealed how the committee was formed of Establishment figures who had been given medals for tasks including running Whitehall budgets, organising the Invictus Games, and reintegrating the Taliban into Afghan society.  Since the committee was formed, it has rejected calls for a medal for nuclear veterans three times. On the latest occasion, in December last year, Dr Winstanley told the British Nuclear Test Veterans Association that it did not even consider half of a -page appeal, because it contained no new information. He added - in a claim directly contradicted by his personal emails - that the issue of health was not linked to the award of medals, and there was no reason to justy any change to that position. Laura Jackson, , of Cheltenham, was born blind in one eye, had a heart attack at , suffered repeated miscarriages, lost her teeth, and had three malignant cancers removed from her face. Read more She only found out her father Ron Owen had taken part in nuclear tests after he and her brother both died young of a heart condition linked to radiation. “Saying these men were only at riskthere is proof they were exposed, is like saying soldiers are only at risk of being shotthey have a bullet wound,” she said. “This committee never spoke to a veteran, never asked one of the men whoaposd served whether they felt there was risk or rigour to it. It was just a front for the lawyers, and has been corrupted by the MoD. It should be scrapped and never allowed to meet again.” Labour MP Rebecca Long-Bailey, who campaigns on behalf of nuclear test veterans, said: “It is undeniable that radiation presents a risk, and regardless of injury, the veterans’ service was of vital importance to this country. “Officials have spent  years denying the truth to these men and their families, and will clearly carry on doing so until the Prime Minister takes charge of the situation, looks these veterans in the eye, and makes amends for this national scandal.” The committee also denied a medal to ground crew who took part in the  Berlin airlt, a star for Bomber Command, and clasps for the British Expeditionary Force sent to France in , and those who gathered intelligence behind the Iron Curtain during the Cold War. A spokesman for the MoD said: “We provide secretariat support to the chairman of the independent Advisory Military Sub Committee so he can effectively fulfil his duties, under the instruction of the Cabinet Office.

Two kind-hearted nine-year-olds had found her card and brought it to her small cul-de-sac home toit to her. Hania Zawadzka and Amelia Maciak had figured out where she lived and they pushed a note through her door and once in the hope of finding the card’s owner.  Once the smart kids had confirmed it was Safrina’s card, they handed it back to her. The next day, the grateful -year-old went to the girl’s house to meet their proud mums Wioleta and Katarzyna.To show her appreciation she gave them a thank you gt which included easter eggs and a cash reward.She said: I went to work on that day and had taken my credit card out along with some other items and started my support worker job. I left the house at .pm and stopped at Morrisons to get petrol and I couldn’t find my credit card. It was a weird moment where you think to yourself I’m pretty sure I took it out with me but I didn’t think much of it, maybe I forgot to take it as I had other items that I brought out as well. I started work around .pm and I got a notication from my door bell from the girls at .pm and that’s when I had realised I had lost it.  The girls were sceptical at first and asked me details on my card which I confirmed and they posted it through my letterbox and I had asked where they lived and stated they lived just across the road from me about  yards away. I told them I would come and see them today or tomorrow when I’m free and thanked them. I had finished my tea calls around pm and wasn’t due out for bed calls until .pm and that’s when I put together the gts and went to their house and presented the gts. The impressed business owner explained why the small act of kindness was so special. The parents especially are happy and proud, I’ve made new friends and taught the girls values and morals of their good deeds. It’s always what I try to do with other kids to teach them right and wrong as kids are our future, she said. She continued:They all gave me a big hug and smiled. I had met the father on the day of giving them gts on the same day but I hadn’t met the mothers yet until yesterday, they were all there and invited me in for a coffee.

Instead of going on a contactless spending spree they both chapped on every single door in my neighbourhood until they found me, not only that, they were both asking me card details to make sure I was the rightful owner.

If we have a chip on our shoulder – possibly both – it’s because southerners don’t appreciate us proper.  We don’t need to ask ourselves “are we northerners ” because we know already. But darn sarf they don’t know, and it’s about time somebody told ‘em. Writer Brian Groom seeks to do just that in Northerners: A History, a definitive new chronicle of the region, the first to appear this century. He starts with the question “Where is the North, and what is a Northerner ” And he ought to know, being a native of Stretford, Greater Manchester, who came back to live in Lancashire after decades of missionary work in London. In his view, the answer is simple: “The North is where people who live there think they are in the North”. And a Northerner is “someone who regards themself as a Northerner.” Really  So it’s not so much a place as a state of mind, an attitude even. And there’s more than enough of that around, say southerners - one of whom cracked the first “north of Watford” joke as long ago as .But being Northern must have started somewhere, sometime, among people. Groom traces our ancestors to a camp of ancient Britons near Scarborough in , BC. It later moved to Filey, but is now closed. The first great Northerner, Caramundia, Queen of the Brigantes, is not as famous as Boudicca, but she was better at doing deals for freedom with the Romans. In those days, England was ided into Britannia Inferior and Britannia Superior. Guess which was the North  Right first time, and nothing much has changed. There was a brief golden age under Bede and the monks of Lindisfarne, and then the Wars of the Roses devastated the North. This was a quarrel between rival branches of the Plantagenet family vying for the throne, not a battle between Lancashire and Yorkshire, argues historian Groom. Cricket fans may dispute his claim. The Industrial Revolution, born here around , confirmed the image of the North as a dirty, hard-working, direct, money-making place.  It was the engine of the nation’s growth, powered by pioneers like textile magnate Richard Arkwright, a barber and wig-maker from Preston, known as King Cotton, who created the factory system that dominated industry for a century. But behind the success story lay the misery of city slums, short, unhappy lives, a reliance on slave-trade cotton, the fruits of imperial expansion and armed trade – dubbed “war capitalism.” And the spectacular Victorian boom didn’t last. By , Britain had been overtaken by the USA. The revolution also gave impetus to the north-south ide. “Northerners saw themselves as independent, straight-talking, knowledgeable and practical,” writes Groom. “Southerners perceived northerners as truculent, lacking social graces, over-competitive and unsophisticated.” Recognise anybody here  It’s like looking in the mirror.Hang on - the great political forces of the age started here: the Independent Labour Party in Bradford and the Trades Union Congress. Northern women made an outstanding contribution. Social reformer Josephine Butler, the Bronte sisters, the militant suffragette movement led by Emmeline Pankhurst and her daughters, and heroines like Grace Darling, -year-old rescuer of shipwrecked survivors in storm-tossed seas. The North created great cities: Liverpool, Manchester, Leeds, Bradford, Sheffield, Hull and Newcastle where municipal socialism provided schools, housing, transport, water, gas and electricity. They were almost a state within a state. But they never achieved the political influence commensurate with their size, a situation that largely still holds true today. Northern -Mayors have the trappings of power, but little real clout, as Manchester’s Andy Burnham found during the pandemic. In the s, northern cities appeared to be “in terminal crisis” says Groom. There were riots in Liverpool, where unemployment soared to %, and Manchester. The North’s economy underperformed during the Cameron and May governments, and still does.Despite all the hot air about “levelling up”, the north-south chasm is still with us, like the poor. Will it ever vanish  “Can we ever be rid of the north-south ide, which casts the North as the back end of the English economy’s pantomime horse ” asks historian Groom. Thatcher claimed to have done so, asserting dogmatically after a trip to the region in : “The north-south ide has gone.” Only, perhaps, in the sense that she tried to abolish the industrial north. “Much as many would love to wish the North-South ide away, this is no time to give up,” says Groom. “If there is to be a revival, it will depend on the talents, energy and enterprise of northerners. “As for closing the cultural gap, does anyone really want to  Britain already has enough clone towns, surely,” he concludes.And enough clone accents, too. Northern students at Oxford were bullied for talking as they did at home, and northerners who migrated to “The Smoke” spent years trying to speak BBC English. That’s changed, but not totally. “Regional accents have become more accepted,” notes Groom, “though the south-east still dominates.” Reet there, son. Northerners was  years in the writing, and even longer in the evolution. Groom, former head of the regional reporting team of the Financial Times, travelled around the North in the fties with his father, the sales manager of a textile firm. He didn’t miss much. What kind of Northerner is he, I asked him. There was a brief, awkward silence, and then he replied “a pan-Northerner”. Translated, an all-and-everywhere Northerner, I suppose. Am I a Northener  My family originated in Bewcastle, on the Scottish borders , and came to Yorkshire at the turn of the th century by way of Allandale and Sunderland. Many more made the same kind of journey, from Ireland, Scotland, Wales and continental Europe, including Poles and Ukranians. Under the leaden skies that so often hang over us, we are all northerners now. Inevitably, it must be asked: Is there a comparable book about Southerners  No, and I think I know why. They don’t have, or seem to want, a similar sense of place and identity. And scraps, by the way, are scrunchy bits of batter left over from the fish frying process. Kids love ‘em, and they’re usually free, but your GP wouldn’t prescribe them. Facts and figuresManchester’s population grew from , in  to , in . In , more than half of England’s adult male industrial jobs were in Lancashire or West Yorkshire. In , the average le span for mechanics, labourers and their families was . Rugby League was created in the George Hotel, Huddersfield, in . In , Lancashire produced two-thirds of the world output of cotton cloth. By , it was only %.

Globalisation and the internet are weakening it, but I’d be astonishedit died out after all these centuries.Would you sooner have been a Southerner  No, the thought has never crossed my mind Are Northerners superior, or inferior, to Southerners  Neither. They are just people. I dislike sweeping generalisations. Both contain wildly ying iniduals, good and bad. Why is there no book about Southerners  Watch this space! Who’s your favourite Northerner, and why  Josephine Butler, the Victorian social reformer who established married women’s legal rights, criminalised child prostitution and human trafficking. If you’re a Northern lad, why leave  I moved to London to work on a national newspaper, but I never intended to stay forever. Is it good to be back in Lancashire  I’m in Saddleworth, in the historic West Riding of Yorkshire but now part of Oldham, Greater Manchester. It’s lovely to be back in the North. Our son and daughter are not far away. We have two grandsons – one Yorkshireman and one Lancastrian, so, even-handed.

Mr Little believes Philip had a lot to do with their engagement. It is misleading to say there was an issue between the two of them, for most of the years they knew each other there was a genuine connection, Mr Little said.If you say something often enough it becomes true but make no mistake - the bond was very strong, he knew the pressure she was feeling and felt for her. He was on her side. Philip became exacerbated with his son and want him to make up his mind about the engagement. It goes some way to shedding light on the theory that Charles was almost forced into the whole thing.  The Duke saw that Diana was battered and bruised by the marriage and was a support to her. Heavily censored letters between the two of them adds weight to the claim they were on good terms when she split with Charles in . The letters showed that Diana affectionally referred to the Duke as her Dearest Pa. In one letter, revealed during an inquest into the deaths of the Princess and Dodi Al Fayad  years after the crash, the Duke said he would do all could to help the couple, with the Princess replying: “You really do care.  But a few years later, it was alleged that Diana had told friends she disliked the Queenaposs husband. Mr Little says while there is some truth in the suggestion that they didnapost see eye-to-eye on matters in the years before the car crash that cost Diana her le, it must not define their relationship.The Duke of Edinburgh allegedly regarded her as a loose cannon following her infamous  BBC Panorama interview with Martin Bashir.But Mr Little says it was her professional relationship with writer Andrew Morton that started to see things deteriorate.  The royal authoraposs biography aposDiana: Her True Storyapos was a New York Times bestseller when it was published in . It was her apparent involvement in the book that first made the Duke change his mind about her, Mr Little said. Mr Little said: Towards the end, they did take a dislike to one another. Philip wasnapost happy with a number of things, especially the Andrew Morton book, her denials of involvement which it was soon discovered were inaccurate. Diana also revisited her opinion of the Duke in the final years of her le, I think that is fair. But to suggest a special bond didnapost exist between them, and they couldnapost stand each other, is just not true.  Another letter from Diana included her telling Philip: I would like you to know how much I admire you for the marvellous way in which you have tried to come to terms with this intensely dficult family problem.” Lord Justice Scott Baker, the coroner at the inquest, said he had read the letters in full and there was nothing “unpleasant, nasty or insulting” in them. However Simone Simmons, Diana’s healer, alleged there were more letters from  or  which featured a dferent tone that made the Princess of Wales furious. Prince Philip went on to deny there was any animosity between him and Diana in a shock statement released in .He claimed there was never “curt or unfeeling” in his letters to Diana and any suggestions he wrote derogatory terms were a “gross misrepresentation” of his relationship with his daughter-in-law.Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Prince Philip, Duke of EdinburghPrincess DianaRoyal Family\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The Duke of Edinburgh passed away at Windsor Castle on the morning of April , with his official cause of death recorded as old age. He was  and just months away from celebrating his th birthday. The past  months have been far from easy for the Monarch, and she entered the th year of her reign a mourning widow. And sheaposs also had a huge amount of family to deal with, with more scandal surrounding her favourite son Prince Andrew and legal case after legal case from Prince Harry and Meghan Markle. To mark the first anniversary of the tragic day, royal expert Ingrid Seward, author of Prince Philip Revealed: A Man of His Century, has reflected on the Queenaposs first year without the Duke of Edinburgh by her side.  She tells The Mirror: On the morning of th April , Prince Philip was being helped to his bathroom when he complained of feeling unwell. He was ed to his bed where he died shortly afterwards. ‘It was assomeone took him by the hand and off he went.’ Sophie Wessex explained afterwards. ‘It was ‘very peaceful’. After  years of marriage the Queen had lost the man she had fallen in love with at the tender age of  when she watched him jump over the tennis nets at Dartmouth Navel College in . The Queen’s reaction to her ‘beloved’ Philip’s death was typically stoic and set in motion what was called ‘Operation London Forth Bridge’. The pandemic was still gripping the country and his funeral at St. George’s Chapel, Windsor was all the more moving for its pared down form. Grief is a strange thing and for the Queen intensely private.The first time she spoke with emotion was in November in a recorded message from Windsor Castle when she praised her ‘dear late husband’ in a recorded message for the climate conference. She commended his work for encouraging people to protect ‘our fragile planet.’ In her Christmas message eight months later, she revealed real emotion. ‘That mischievous, enquiring twinkle was as bright at the end as when I first set eyes on him.’ She said. ‘His sense of service, intellectual curiosity and capacity to squeeze fun out of any situation were all irrepressible.’ He made her laugh. He made her position tenable. When she worried about the family, he consoled her in his matter-of-fact way. She missed his wise council when Prince Andrew’s dramas reached their peak and he looked determined go into court against Virginia Giuffre. She missed it again when Prince Charles’s main charity fundraiser Michael Fawcett was accused of offering honours for substantial donations. Across the ocean Harry and Meghan have been occupied with litigation against the British establishment including her Majesty’s government. It has been a very tough year without him. In October she cancelled a trip to Ireland. Then it was revealed she had spent the night in hospital. Clearly things were not going her way. Doctors advised rest and later her appearances apart from one at Westminster Abbey when she was seen with a walking stick for the first time, remained virtual audiences and zoom chats from Windsor Castle. Her only time away was a weekend at Wood Farm in July when she visited her stud with her racing manager John Warren. In February this year she made her annual pilgrimage to honour the death of her father seventy years on, before catching covid at the end of the month. On Saturday she will be saying a prayer for her ‘irrepressible’ Philip and then will sit in front of the TV and watch the Grand National from Aintree. Whatever happens in her final years some things will always remain the same.

Ever since that day, the Queen has had to navigate royal le without him by her side - and itaposs certainly been a testing  months for Her Majesty...Scaled-back funeralIn the days after Philipaposs death, the royals rallied around the Queen as she prepared for Philipaposs funeral.The service at Windsor Castle was majorly scaled back due to Covid restrictions at the time, meaning only  guests were allowed to attend.Among them were his eight grandchildren, including Prince Harry, who flew in from Calornia to attend.In the days after the funeral, the Queen turned  before ending her official mourning period and ing to royal duties.New arrivalsLove the royals for the Mirroraposs daily newsletter to get all the latest news on the Queen, Charles, Kate, Wills, Meghan, Harry and the rest of The Firm. Click here to sign up . However, there was happy news for Her Majesty at the start of June when her th great-grandchild was born.On June , Harry and Meghan Markle welcomed a daughter - and her name Lilibet was a direct tribute to the Queen.Meanwhile, in September, there was more happy news when Princess Beatrice also gave birth to a daughter called Sienna - a th great-grandchild for the Queen. Prince Andrew saga But despite this happy news, the Queen has also had to contend with some unwelcome headlines for her second son Prince Andrew - without the support of Philip.Last summer, Virginia Giuffre began the process of suing Andrew in a civil case in New York for allegedly sexually assaulting her when she was a teenager. The prince has always denied the allegations and said he has “no recollection” of ever meeting her. As the case began to move towards a trial, the Queen decided to strip her second son of his prestigious honorary military titles and royal patronages. A source close to Andrew described the move at the time as leaving him “shell-shocked”.  However in the following weeks, Andrew reached an out of court settlement, said to be worth £million, with his accuser Ms Giuffre, which means he will no longer face a civil jury trial over allegations. It was thought that Andrew would then step away from public le for good - apart from attending a memorial service to Philip last month.However, that too proved controversial as the Queen entered Westminster Abbey, where the service took place on the arm of her son.And this left heirs Prince Charles and Prince William dismayed at Andrewaposs unnecessary role.Prince Harry security row Another row that the Queen has had to contend with in the last year is her grandson Prince Harryaposs demands over security when he is in the UK. In January, Harry released a statement saying he is unable to bring we Meghan Markle and their two children Archie and Lilibet to the UK due to a lack of security. He is said to be keen to bring Archie and Lilibet to visit his homeland but claims he is unable to do so as Harry and Meghan lost their taxpayer-funded police protection when they stood down as working royals. Megan and Archie have not ed to the UK since the couple walked away from royal le in , while Lilibet has yet to set foot in the country where her dad was born - meaning she has never met the Queen. Archie has also not seen his great-grandmother for over two years.Lawyers acting for the Duke of Sussex say they will seek a judicial reviewcontinued security, which he has offered to pay for, is not provided when he and his family visit. A source said at the time that the battle between the Queenaposs grandson and the government was the last thing she wants to get drawn into. Health worries and Covid battle Although the Queen threw herself back into work following Philipaposs death and attended the G summit in Cornwall in June, her public appearances have been scaled back.And this could be down to the fact she has had health worries of her own.In October, was pictured using a walking stick while attending a service for the Royal British Legion at Westminster Abbey. And later that month, it emerged she had spent the night in hospital following admission for precautionary tests after cancelling a trip to Northern Ireland. The Queen was then ordered to rest and other engagements were cancelled including an appearance at the Cop climate change summit and Remembrance Sunday.Many recent engagements have been carried out in Windsor Castle, where in one in-person audience with military officials, she talked about how she was having trouble moving. The monarch also cancelled a planned appearance at the Commonwealth Day service at Westminster Abbey last month - but was able to make a memorial service for Philip there last week.Meanwhile, to add to her health woes, it was announced in February that the Queen tested positive for Covid.It forced her to cancel several engagements as she battled mild flu-like symptoms - but she now seems to be over the virus.Philip tributesBut despite having to navigate the past  months without Philip, the Queen has seemingly kept him close to her heart.In her Christmas Day broadcast last year, she poignantly reflected on a year of personal grief, saying there was “one familiar laugh missing” as she acknowledged the death of her husband.She gave a personal tribute to her “beloved Philip” and remarked how his “mischievous, enquiring twinkle was as bright at the end as when I first set eyes on him”.The Queen is believed to be at Windsor Castle and it is understood she will mark the first anniversary of the death of her husband privately.Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Prince Philip, Duke of EdinburghRoyal FamilyQueen\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

As Covid iants meet they multiply and evolve by sharing their genome or characteristics, therefore ending up with a recombinant.

Thankfully, health bosses do not believe this iant is more severe than its predecessors with the vaccine holding up the barrier against the virus successfully. According to the World Health Organizationhas said early tests indicated XE is around % more transmissible - but the body has added the findings need more investigation.  The WHO report published last week said: Early-day estimates indicate a community growth rate advantage of % as compared to BA., however this finding requires further confirmation. “XE belongs to the Omicron iant until signicant dferences in transmission and disease characteristics, including severity, may be reported.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON CoronavirusOmicron iant\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily health briefing with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Stacey Gwilliam miraculously survived by clawing her way out of a deathly pit dug by her former partner Keith Hughes who was jailed for le.But the bride-to-be never got over the horror of being entombed and has died aged  of pneumonia. An inquest into her death opened this week. Speaking about her loss for the first time, Staceyaposs heartbroken mum Shan, , said: “I believe Stacey dying so young is linked to what happened to her. “She never got over it and was also worried about the day when Hughes will be released.”  Hughes buried Stacey at a coastal beauty spot near her home in Swansea, South Wales, and later told police: “You’ll never find her.” But brave Stacey managed to use her fingernails to dig her way out of the shallow grave on a clf path. She spent  days in an induced coma and was finally let out of hospital  days after her ordeal in . Stacey had to walk with a stick and was left with dficulty eating and speaking. She suffered breathing dficulties and died at her mother’s home in Townhill, Swansea, on November  last year.  Her mum said health chiefs had launched an investigation to probe why Stacey hadn’t been admitted to hospital. She said: “I still don’t know why - it is too raw I can’t really talk about it. It’s awful. “She died of bronchial pneumonia while I was looking after her here. “She was never able to get on with her le after what happened, she didn’t even like to talk about it.”  The preliminary inquest into her death this week heard Stacey had been suffering with lung problems and experiencing breathing dficulties. On November  she had consulted her GP and the following day her mother had discovered her unresponsive in her home. Paramedics were called and the family was advised to perform CPR. South Wales Police said there were no suspicious circumstances surrounding her death and a full inquest will be held in September. Bodybuilder Hughes, now , throttled Stacey while they were on a seaside walk just days after he proposed. He was convinced his fiancé would never be discovered and was shocked to hear she had been found alive. Stacey later told of her nightmare on Good Morning Britain when she spoke to presenters Piers Morgan and Susanna Reid. She said: “I came round and there were branches and shrubs put on top of me. I could hear my heart beating and I could hear the sound of the sea in the background. It was like everything was in slow motion. I couldn’t breathe, I couldn’t move. It was like I was paralysed. I tried to get up but couldn’t. I had to use my nails to get out of where I was. That was all I could do. I tried to push but I didn’t have the upper strength.” Hughes’s trial at Swansea Crown Court heard it was a “deliberate attempt to end the le of a vulnerable woman in an isolated location”. Judge Paul Thomas branded the painter and decorator a danger to women and jailed him for le with a recommendation he was not considered for parole for eight-and-a-half years.You can call the The National Domestic Abuse Helpline  hours a day on   .

What do you think about Nickaposs theory  Let us know in the comments...In a video on TikTok, Nick said: Surprisingly my hair got a lot healthier, and Iaposve now found that thereaposs an entire movement around it, itaposs called the aposnopoomovementapos. The hashtag #nopoomethod has millions of views on TikTok as more people turn away from using detergents on their hair. Nick says: You might thinkyou stop washing your hair itaposs going to be greasy, and it does do that for about two or three weeks. But after that your natural oils come back, youaposve been stripping them with all the harsh chemicals, and then your hair can be extremely healthy, without having to wash it anymore. The video was watched more than half a million times and people in the comments were curious about the #nopoo trend. One viewer said:  per cent I haven’t washed my hair in two years for the same reason! Couldn’t back this more. Might try this, itaposs not coming out in clumps but my hair is receding at the sides at the top, said a second viewer.

But the landlord shut them down and accused them of having zero concern for him and his  hour days. I barely have time to talk to be family, signing references for you and doing a aposyoung couple with a small rental historyapos any favours or tasks is so God damn low on my list of preferences, he added. Lower your expectations of others and learn how to handle them on your own, he concluded. And for god sake, stop bothering me. The Reddit poster claimed that they even wrote out the complete reference for him because he was too busy, so apparently all he had to do was sign the document.Reddit users were quick to share their thoughts on the post, with many siding with the tenants. If he canapost find time to provide a reference, heaposs definitely not cut out to run a small business, one said, to which the poster responded: He actually asked us to find a new tenant for him aposbecause he was too busyapos when we declared that we would be moving out of the apartment, so he is clearly also not cut out to run an investment property! Another wrote: Jesus Christ, what a jerk. A third added: Maybe he takes  hours a day to do what a competent person could achieve in .What did he need to do for a referral  asked someone . If he just needs to send a text to say youaposre a good tenant and pay on time then he is an a**hole for not doing it.

Revealing that they touched the animal, the user wrote: It was just a lil squishy and soft! The sea hare is actually a marine snail, found in shallow water and occasionally in rockpools on the low shore. They feed on seaweed and it is thought that this is what gives each sea hare its colour. For example, green sea hares like eating green seaweeds like sea lettuce whilst the reddish-maroon sea hares usually eat red seaweeds. Sea hares have an internal shell, which is around four centimetres long and transparent. Like sea slugs, the sea hare is a hermaphrodite and they sometimes mate in chains, with an inidual acting as both male and female.They lay eggs in long pink threads, which are deposited on seaweed and look a bit like pink spaghetti, according to Wildletrusts.org.

Korynne @korynnecbegan feeling uncomfortable when she woke up from a nap on the beach, only to see a man sunbathing a close distance to her, leading her to worry he was stalking her. Convinced he was up to something sinister, the TikToker decided to get her own back at the man, by running past him and kicking sand in his face as she did so, the Daily Star reports. In a video she posted on TikTok, she said: When an old man parks himself -feet in front of your towel on a completely empty beach while you were napping and you know what needs to be done. Korynne filmed the beach to show the vast space with absolutely no visitors other than the man, before putting her phone down, turning on the selfie camera and running towards the sea. As she runs past the man, who is lying on his beach towel facing downwards, she purposely kicks the sand to the manaposs back.

After posting the video, the TikToker has been met with mixed responses from viewers. While some praised her braveness, others pointed out that the man didnapost appear to be doing anything other than sunbathing. He was literally minding his own business tanning till she ran right by him and kick sand in his face, one commented, while another added: Didnapost know you own the whole beach  However, others disagreed, with another commenting: He sat right in front of her and you can see him looking at her.

It will be her first trip outside the US since the couple quit the royal familyMeghan Markle and Prince Harry at the Invictus Games in  Image: XByRussell MyersRoyal Editor:,  Apr Updated:,  Apr |commentsMeghan Markle will travel with Prince Harry to the Invictus Games in Holland next week, on her first trip outside of the US since the couple quit the royal family. The Mirror can reveal Harry and Meghan will be followed by a Netflix documentary crew throughout the Games, which start next Saturday.The couple’s decision to attend the event in The Hague has been blasted by palace insiders after Harry claimed it was “too dangerous” to travel to the UK.He is locked in a legal battle with the UK government over a decision to downgrade his security, and did not show up at a memorial service for his grandfather, Prince Philip, last week. Ken Wharfe, an ex-Met officer who once protected Harry, said: “I’m baffled about why Harry thinks he would be safer in the Netherlands than the UK. “He would have travelled to his grandfather’s memorial service with his brother or father and received protection from the Met. It’s not like he would have been turning up at Westminster Abbey on a bike. “It is more of a risk to go to Holland to support a charity with a military link than coming to London last week.” A spokesman for Harry and Meghan reportedly said: “We take measures based on the security threat level.”  Since ditching their royal roles to seek “financial independence”, Meghan, , and Harry, , have signed deals with Netflix and Spoty worth more than £million. The couple, who now live in Calornia with children Archie, two, and -month-old Lilibet, are expected to arrive in Holland on Friday. Harry’s father Prince Charles is understood to have offered an olive branch to smooth relations, offering the Duke of Sussex and his family the opportunity to stay with him and we Camilla at Highgrove. But sources close to Charles suggest the invitation “remains unanswered”.  Meghan may join Harry on stage at the Games opening ceremony, insiders promising “a big surprise to launch the event”. A source said: “Meghan is excited to travel with Harry for the event, which is certainly close to his heart.” The couple’s Archewell Productions last April announced its first major docu-series for Netflix would be titled Heart of Invictus, and follow athletes and organisers from across the world on the road to the Games.

He has now been placed in pre-trial detention in notorious Lefortovo Prison, suggesting he will face major charges for intelligence failings, it is claimed. The move will be seen as a warning to other senior Putin aides who are expected to take the blame for the huge Russian death toll in Ukraine.  Besedaaposs case is being investigated by the Military Investigative Department of the Investigative Committee, said Russian intelligence expert Andrei Soldatov, who revealed the Lefortovo move. The official who was in charge of FSB intelligence and political subversion in the ex-USSR, had been on a trip to Ukraine shortly before he was detained. Putin is said to fear that moles leaked invasion plans to the West, and Beseda was detained along with his deputy Anatoly Bolyukh, but had been held under house arrest until now. The current status of Bolyukh is unclear.  The Russian leader had been convinced by secret services briefings that his troops would be welcomed by many Ukrainians, and achieve a speedy victory. In reality they have faced implacable opposition. Lefortovo jail notoriously held political prisoners in the Soviet era and is routinely used to incarcerate suspected traitors. Last month Putin also fired the deputy head of the Russian national guard. Beseda had been a longtime trusted Putin secret services official, and was in his role as head of the th service of the FSB since .  Russia has not confirmed his arrest or detention in Lefortovo. Last month The Mirror told how Alexander Bortnikov, director of the Federal Security Serviceand confidant of Putinaposs, could be the favoured replacement for Vladimir Putin.Ukrainian intelligence officials claimed a plot to remove the President from the office had allegedly started after Western sanctions crippled the Russian economy. Sources then claimed Alexander Bortnikov, director of the Federal Security Serviceand confidant of Putinaposs, could be the favoured replacement. He was said to be one of the few figures to belong to Putinaposs powerful inner circle and shares his anti-Western world view, after previously serving alongside the Russian President in the KGB.But he recently fell out of favour with the Kremlin following Russiaaposs sustained military losses in Ukraine and botched invasion.He met Putin while they both served as KGB officers in Leningrad in the s and plays a key role in ensuring the President maintains power. Putin left as a lieutenant colonel in , while Bortnikov rose steadily up the ranks. The pair have been seen hiking previously, and are said to share a love of nature.

Liu, who comes from the district of Xinzhou, in the city of Wuhan, China, married in  and became pregnant each year, but always had miscarriages in the early stages of pregnancy Doctors diagnosed her with an autoimmune disease called systemic lupus erythematosusin . She was told by medics this was probably the reason for her miscarriages as the disease attacks every system in the human body.  SLE is an autoimmune disease in which the immune system attacks its own tissues, causing widespread inflammation and tissue damage in the affected organs.Although the doctors advised her to stop trying to have a child, she chose not to obey and continued her continuous cycle of pregnancy and miscarriage.After  miscarriages in  years, doctors noticed her body had been weakened and she started suffering from hypothyroidism.

In her fth month of pregnancy, Liu went to hospital - worried about suffering another miscarriage - after suffering bleeding, abdominal pain and other discomforts.  The doctors treated her with miscarriage protection and anti-infection procedure and a delicate foetal protection treatment plan was prepared for her. After her determined efforts to give birth Liu was finally blessed with a child gave birth via caesarian section to a premature baby. She was released from hospital three days later on March . According to Dr Guo Juanjuan, one of he experts she dealt with while trying to give birth, SLE is prone to causing miscarriages.  But it is possible for pregnancies to be seen to term safely, but only with the proper medical care.In January, The Mirror told about another woman who had given up on her dreamsgetting pregnant again.Emma White, , had given after her daughter Molly Rose was born  years ago.She had  miscarriages in  years, but shared her joy at giving birth to two miracle babies after a rollercoaster pregnancy.

One especially tragic situation saw a blind bear, called Nelson, housed in a dirty cage, with no exercise room for three decades, with rotting teeth and poor eyesight, which could be salvaged with surgery.

An Armenian goat constantly charges the bars of its ramshackle pen. An animal welfare bill, which would see the zoo closed down, is currently being debated. The UK-based International Animal Rescuehas been trying to save Nelson the bear, but the owner Armen Tadevosyan, , refuses to hand him over.  He claims his animals are well looked after at the zoo in Armavir, which is a small town  miles west of Armenia’s capital, Yerevan. IAR president, Alan Knight OBE, said: The conditions these poor animals are living in are nothing short of hell on earth. The cages are small, filthy and dilapidated to say the least, and the animals have no choice but to stand in the squalor with nothing to break their boredom and frustration.  The idea that members of the public would choose to pay money to see these captive animals suffering behind bars is just laughable. We’ve been trying to rescue the bear, who we called Nelson, for months now with no success, but clearly all the animals in so-called Salvation Park are in urgent need of proper care and attention. As an animal welfare organisation, we are ready and willing to help ensure they get it. IAR has a bear rescue centre in Armenia and has so far saved  animals.  Alan Knight added: It’s a stain on the international reputation of Armenia that it allows sentient creatures to suffer such cruelty and neglect. I urge the government to step in right away and force the closure of the park so that the animals can be given proper food and care for the first time in years. There is no excuse for such cruelty and neglect and I know there will be a public outcry when people read about it.Hopefully public pressure will persuade the government to close the park and start the animals on the road to a better, happierle.That is the only humane and compassionate course of action.

Kramatorsk train station,  miles east of us , was hit by missiles - one marked “For What Has Been Done To The Children,” killing at least , including five children, and injuring up to . President Volodymyr Zelensky accused the Russians of “…lacking the strength and courage to face us on the battlefield and cynically destroying the civilian population.” Todayaposs depraved Kramatorsk shelling was matched by the horrors locals were revealing in communities north of Kyiv. In the blitzed village of Andriivka, north of Kyjv city, father-of-three Piotr Kachenko, , was sitting by the side of the road, amid the devastation. This quietly-spoken elderly man told us: “They ran into the basements of private homes, spraying them with bullets. It is unbelievable.“They came here and killed a lot of people , mostly young men, burning their faces when they were dead, after pouring petrol on them. “They had their hands tied and then they were taken into the fields and shot dead - then burned so that they cannot be recognised.” It seems everybody here knows someone who has disappeared in this field, where at least  young men were executed, their faces mutilated with petrol. Today his friend and neighbour Anton, , was buried, according to Piotr but he is confused and exhausted by the nightmare that descended upon his village. The Russians have gone now, retreating hastily north to Belarus or east to be re-deployed in the contested Donbas region, where Moscow is preparing a massive offensive.  But they have left behind a legacy of murder and depravity that is etched on the bullet-pock marked walls, blackened ruins of Ukraine’s communities and the faces of everyone we meet. A middle-aged lady called Tania, approaches us next to Piotr, crying that her house was marked “children” but that did not stop the Russians. Still shaking with fear she tells us: “There were nine of us hiding in the basement and we were trying to be quiet as the Russians came into my yard. “They opened the door of the cellar and a soldier sprayed downwards with bullets, one of which hit my daughter’s back pack and scratched her smart phone. “It was a miracle we all survived but it was truly terrying. “But we had the word ‘children’ painted on the gate so clearly they either do not care or they just want to kill everybody, who knows ” One man, aged , is recovering in Kyiv hospital from a bad bullet wound in his arm from the basement attack and he was the only person hit.  She refused to be photographed since she is terried the Russians, who left more than a week ago, willto kill her. In her back garden she shows us a ft deep pit she heard the Russians digging, which they were shouting was to “bury dead bodies.” There is no way of knowingthis was true as it could equally have been to hide once of their tanks, even though the area was totally secluded. Houses in Andriivka are riddled with bullets, shell holes and huge blast marks and holes, unexploded shells lying discarded on the ground, at the side of the road. Ten miles away the mostly destroyed town of Borodyanka looks like a monster has trampled through it breathing fire onto everything in its path. Entire apartment blocks are smashed in half, reduced to rubble by wave after wave of airstrikes and then tank shells and small arms. As marauding Russians came into town at the beginning of the now six weeks-long war they sprayed almost every home with bullets, leaving as many as  people below the rubble.  Today we watched as rescue teams sted and dug through several mini “ground zeros,” having found  corpses the previous day. Some wounded survivors have been found but hope is now fading for those who fled underground and were unfortunate to be crushed to death or buried alive. In Borodoyanka Eugene Yenin, Kyiv’s First Deputy to the Minister of the Interior, was meeting devastated locals to discuss their future. Afterwards he told us: “What you see here and where in Ukraine is a lot of tears and horror. “We are here to reassure and support the locals that we are here to help with the infrastructure and their future, water, power.” And then he made an astonishing claim, that Russian soldiers marked murdered civilian’s homes with a Soviet-era code for “dead bodies.”  He said the troops marked the number “” on the gates of houses to denote that “dead bodies” were inside. It is a throwback to Soviet era Afghanistan when the  mark meant a dead body or bodies were nearby. Askedhe meant “civilian bodies” he replied: “Yes - civilians. “This is to say the Russians are telling other troops ‘we have already visited here.” He added: “This is a remote village or town, where people are not well-to-do and they need help as you can see.  “Around  bodies were found yesterday and another six in a dferent apartment block. “We are discovering in some places where the Russians have been booby-trapped washing machines, with a grenade inside. “There are the bodies of people who have been shot randomly. “It is a terrible situation but there will be a future here.”  Today Kramatorsk’s hospitals were struggling with the numbers of wounded as Ukraine officials said no military personnel were nearby at the time of the attack. The governor of Ukraineaposs eastern Donetsk accused Russian forces of firing cluster munitions at the station, where thousands were at the time. Governor Pavlo Kyrylenko said: If at the beginning they exclusively ... targeted railway tracks, then now itaposs not only tracks, but also firing a missile containing cluster munitions which are meant for people.“This is absolute confirmation that thiswas intended against civilians.  British Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said Russia may have committed another war crime and vowed to do everything to ensure Vladimir Putin fails in Ukraine and predicted the war would backfire for the Russian president. Mr Wallace, visiting Romania for talks, said: The striking of civilians and critical infrastructure is a war crime.“These were precision missiles aimed at people trying to seek humanitarian shelter.Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Ben WallaceBoris JohnsonVladimir PutinHospitalsSoldiersWar crimesCrimePoliticsRussia Ukraine warDaily Mirror\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

They work well in a sunny or partially shaded area in fertile well-drained soil.Climbing jasmine can be highly scented, with ieties that flower in summer and winter. All produce pretty flowers and are fairly easy to grow against walls or up trellis.There are some fun options for kids to plant such as sunflowers, snapdragons and the four o#clock flower.If you look at a sunflower, you can’t help but smile. Not only does it remind us of the sun, but its head will track the sun through the sky.Snapdragons are great because they come in a iety of colours and sizes, and you can pinch the blossoms so they open and shut just like a dragon’s mouth.Snapdragon flowers are specically designed for bumblebees, which are just the right weight to trip the opening mechanism of the lower lip of the flower to gain access to the nectar.The four o#clock flower, also known as the marvel of Peru, is a bushy plant with trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of pink, yellow or white.The fragrant flowers don’t open until late afternoon, around four o’clock # so they are good for telling the time.If you are growing your own vegetables, now is a good time to start sowing tomatoes, so you can enjoy them throughout the summer.You will need rich, fertile soil or peat-free potting compost, and a good sunny, sheltered spot. Water regularly and feed regularly once the plants start to flower.Tomatoes are split into two main growing types # bush and cordon. Bush types are usually planted in containers and their stems trail around the edge. Cordon types are trained to grow tall, supported by a cane or stake and will require pinching out.Growing tomatoes from seed is best done under cover, into seed trays, then when the seedlings get to -cm tall transplant to small cm pots. Keep potting on as they grow in size.They can be planted outside with cane supports once the last frosts have gone, so around May time.For best results, choose trusted ieties like Gardener#s Delight, Money Maker or Sweet Olive.As usual, April really kick-starts the gardening season.According to the Royal Horticultural Society, spring is finally in evidence as daffodils and flowering trees start to bloom. Expect the inevitable April showers but with sunny days too, when you can turn your attention to the lawn.It#s an exciting month, with indoor-sown seeds well into growth, and it#s also time to start sowing outdoors. Just watch out for frosts.Top three jobs this month:"},{"url":null,"title":"mozart to jazz trio ecossaise delight ardrishaig","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Subscribe NowMid Argyll Arts Associationwas delighted to welcome Trio Ecossaise as guest performers at Ardrishaig Public Hall for the fourth concert of the season.The impact of Covid has meant that many planned concerts had to be cancelled or dates changed so it was wonderful to have Trio Ecossaise perform on March .The concert opened with the Kegelstatt Trio by Mozart. Much of the chamber music that Mozart composed was music for friends to perform and this trio is just one of these.Originally composed for clarinet, viola and piano, the viola part can be performed on cello as Harriet ably demonstrated. Very typically Mozart # easy to listen to and thoroughly enjoyable.On to the Craftsbury Trio, written by the American Gwyneth Walker. This trio has four movements, each depicting the small town of Craftsbury, Vermont.Up Country Toccata, The Lark in the Morning, You Can Buy It at the General Store, to the final movement Craftsbury Common depicting the green with a white picket fence.The movements are as descriptive as their titles and show many dferent skills on all instruments # fluttering sounds, jazz harmonies, numerous glissandos, syncopation, decorations and finishing with gentle rhythmic tapping.There is even a hint of Rhapsody in Blue in the third movement. If you only listen to one piece again this is the one and should be seen live,possible, and not just listened to.Rachmaninov’s Prelude in B minor for solo piano was Claire’s choice for the programme.This prelude, The Bell was Rachmaninov’s own favourite and was the one that he would often perform. The audience was delighted to be introduced to it by Claire.Brahms composed four chamber works which featured the clarinet later in le after a period when he wasn’t writing anything at all.This was the third trio of the evening and was again very dferent in style allowing Jenner , Harrietand Claireto demonstrate their considerable skills as a trio to a very appreciative audience.An arrangement of Consolation No. by Liszt for Trio Ecossaise was their encore.This was the second visit by Trio, and it is only a matter of time before they are welcomed back.There are two MAAA concerts planned for April # The Willow Trioand the Ugly Bug Ragtime Three.

Play was more scrappy in the second period but Kilmory managed to close out the match.The club thanks Crinan Construction for sponsoring the match and all the supporters who came out to watch.In the same ision, Inveraray and Bute juniors drew - at the Winterton.Bute started the match strongly, using their pace and youth to advantage.

Opposite is St Johns’ church. Cross over with care.After visiting the church take the lane on the north side of Killean burn towards the sea # gate climbing may ensuelocked.

The proposal would lead to sporadic development in the countryside and other material considerations do not outweigh the conflict with the Local Development Plan and the harm that would result.”In support of the application, a report from Galashiels-based Ferguson Planning, agents for the applicants, says: “The applicants intend to permanently relocate to the Borders from Cornwall, where Mr Stephens runs his own joinery business and Mrs Stephens is a registered nurse, closing the mammoth distance between grandparents and the rest of the family.“The barn remains in active use, although at a very low level.

Family’.As a result of this, Angus has the whole Children’s Hour to himself next Thursday, April  one episode is from both ‘Tiger Mountain’ and ‘Stubby’ and will be repeated in request week.We understand that a second programme in the series, ‘I’m proud of my father’, will be broadcast on Sunday May  when the subject will be Captain David Barkley MBE, who is in charge of the BEA ambulance flight at Renfrew.It will be remembered that this series got off to a fine start last January when May Newlands and her father both made an appearance at the microphone.Of this broadcast, the New Statesman and Nation said: ‘The Children’s Hour programme on the work of the Scottish leboat Coxswain Duncan Newlands, by his young daughter, was admirable.‘Vivid, unpretentious and charmingly told, it would surely have given pleasure to an adult audience.’"},{"url":null,"title":"leader april 1 2022","story":"Living in a coastal town, we must all be aware how dangerous and unforgiving the sea can

If you look at a sunflower, you can’t help but smile. Not only does it remind us of the sun, but its head will track the sun through the sky and wherever the light is a sunflower will find it.Snapdragons are great because they come in a iety of colours and sizes, and you can pinch the blossoms so they open and shut just like a dragon’s mouth.Snapdragon flowers are specically designed for bumblebees, which are just the right weight to trip the opening mechanism of the lower lip of the flower to gain access to the nectar.The four o’clock flower, also known as the marvel of Peru, is a bushy plant with trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of pink, yellow or white.The fragrant flowers don’t open until late afternoon, around four o’clock – so they are good for telling the time.If you are growing your own vegetables, now is a good time to start sowing tomatoes, so you can enjoy them throughout the summer.To grow tomatoes successfully, you need rich, fertile soil or peat-free potting compost, and a good sunny, sheltered spot.Water regularly and feed regularly once the plants start to flower.Tomatoes are split into two main growing types – bush and cordon.Bush types are usually planted in containers and their stems trail around the edge. Cordon types are trained to grow tall and are supported by a cane or stake and will require pinching out.Growing tomatoes from seed is best done under cover, into seed trays, then when the seedlings get to -cm tall, transplant to small cm pots. Keep potting on as they grow in size.They can be planted outside with cane supports once the last frosts have gone, so around May time.For best results, choose trusted ieties like Gardener#s Delight, Money Maker or Sweet Olive.As usual, April really kick-starts the gardening season.As the Royal Horticultural Society says, spring is finally in evidence as daffodils and flowering trees start to bloom.#Expect the inevitable April showers this month but with sunny days too, when you can turn your attention to the lawn,# said a spokesperson.#It#s an exciting month, with indoor-sown seeds well into growth, and it#s also time to start sowing outdoors.

Since God is eternal and therefore stands outside of time, it may be that every moment in time is always present with him.And yet, the Bible often speaks of God not remembering something – people’s sins.One example is Jeremiah chapter  verse : ‘For I will forgive their wickedness and will remember their sins no more.’It is not that God forgets in the way that I forget where I have left my wallet or car keys.In the Bible, ‘to remember’ is another way of talking about keeping a promise. We use ‘to remember’ in that way too.‘Don’t forget to phone me when you arrive home,’ shouts Morag, as her daughter heads home after visiting her.‘Don’t worry, Mum. I’ll remember.’Sure enough, Morag’s phone rings later, and the voice at the other ends says: ‘It’s me. I’m home.’God does not forget our sins in the sense of pretending they never happened or ignoring our failure and refusal to do what he wants.Instead, he remembers his promise to forgive the sins of anyone who asks him to do so.He is able to do this because Jesus has died on the cross to deal effectively with sin’s penalty.So, when you trust in Jesus, God refuses to hold your sin against you, but treats you in the way you do not deserve.

more.With the popular show now entering its th series, weve looked back to past seasons to see which products have gained the most success.Some of these items have become so popular that you might have forgotten their humble beginnings and the pitches behind them. This spicy BBQ sauce was pitched by now household name Levi Roots and was invested by Peter Jones and Richard Farleigh. Currently, the Reggae Reggae company is worth £ million and has become a staple in supermarkets across the country. Roots have not just stopped at sauces, with and an album, BBC cooking show, cookbooks, Caribbean-inspired food festival, and plans to launch a chain of restaurants, the entrepreneur has found the most success from the Den.The much-loved product can be found in a number of stores including Morrisons, Asda, Tesco, and many more. Created by Peter Moule, the Chocbox is an aplastic cable device that allows you to store electrical wires safely. Pitched back in , dragons Duncan

ChocBox can be brought from Screwfix, toolstation, Wickes, and other retailers. With an original investment of £, from Deborah Meaden and Theo Paphitis, this portable whiteboard roll became a smash hit. The Magic Whiteboard was created by husband and we Neil and Laura Westwood and has since become the two Dragons most successful investment.Since the show, the pair have seen a lot of success and

to see which Aldi products are genuinely worth buying and whether the more luxurious, grand designs were good value.I must place a disclaimer here, I am a big fan of simple eggs made with tasty, good quality chocolate.For me, it isnt about novelty designs, chocolate shards spiking out and the price tags to match.So when I took a look at Aldis Easter selection, I decided my mission was to find an egg that looks great but tastes even better.One product that really intrigued me was Dairyfines chocolate ice cream egg- a blonde chocolate and wafer cone topped with a milk chocolate scoop, finished with mini eggs and biscuit crumb, as well as a popping candy cone base.Resembling the popular Cornetto ice cream, I was genuinely amazed by the attention to detail when I reached the end of the cone and discovered chocolate-covered popping candy and milk chocolate.It was a real treat to eat and I think Id have been bouncing off the walls in joy I received this as a kid.The one thing that really struck me about Aldis Easter egg offering was the effective use of recyclable materials, leaving you guilt-free when it comes to packaging. Not even the ice cream egg was covered in excess single-use plastic.The cone tasted almost like Caramac -thats a sweet up your street, this is the egg for you. The dferent combinations of chocolate and salty biscuit crumbs sprinkled on top left my sweet tooth feeling more than satisfied.  With the chocolate ice cream egg, you really have a bit of everything and I think its a worthwhile purchase.There is one major theme in Aldis Easter egg and chocolate collection for : salted caramel. Some of Aldis salted caramel options, pictured. I recruited a salted caramel expert, otherwise known as my boyfriend, to help review the full salted caramel selection. I thought salted caramel was something that didnt really y in quality - yet some of these eggs really stood out as the best. In my humble opinion, one of the best chocolate eggs from Aldi is the Moser Roth salted caramel egg  with hidden truffles, part of the Free From range.Despite not containing milk, egg, wheat and gluten, it gives out little bursts of salted caramel flavours with every bite and it wasnt overly rich. It would have been easy to eat the whole egg in one sitting, not to mention the tempting truffles hiding inside the box. For serious salted caramel fans, the ChocoChanger salted caramel eggis the choice to go for.From the moment you open the box, a strong aroma of caramel jumps out while the chocolate pops with creamy, salty sweetness.One of the more surprising salted caramel items was the rich, vegan, dark Belgian chocolate office bunnies- you couldnt have too many but one every so often would really hit the spot.Moser Roths luxury egg box from Aldi. If salted caramel is your idea of heaven, Id definitely recommend heading to Aldi for a browse. One of the most delicious chocolate treats from Aldi was the indulgent assortment of hand decorated chocolate eggs  with dferent types of fillings.From dark chocolate orange and speculoos to pistachio and macadamia, these chocolates are definitely ones youll struggle not to eat in one go. The flavours really worked well together - an ideal choice for people who love dferent types of chocolate and something visually appealing. One tasted like sticky toffee pudding while the raspberry chocolate had such delicate berry hints - absolutely perfect.Hazelnut filled eggs and hazelnut chocolate rabbits from Aldi. Now Im not the biggest hazelnut fan but Aldi has played an absolute blinder with this flavour in .Moser Roths hazelnut chocolate bunny  leaves you with no words, just \"Mmmm\". Adorned with a cute green bow and bunny charm, the bunny looked great and tasted even better than you could expect.The smooth chocolate melts in your mouth while the hazelnut really hits the spot. If you love Ferrero Rocher, you need to try Aldis mouthwatering crispy hazelnut luxury filled eggs .A mix between Nutella and Ferrero Rocher, these chocolate eggs have a biscuity yet smooth texture with a gorgeous nutty aftertaste. Meanwhile, the Moser Roth Belgian milk and dark chocolate almond eggwas something unique, featuring salted almond butter.The combination of sweet yet salty almond butter with two types of chocolate was well balanced - though it did have a strong aftertaste, meaning its not one for those who can take or leave almond.There was just one Easter egg which left me wanting a little bit more than I got: the Dairyfine Chunky Egg Fruit and Nut .This chocolate egg is described as a thick Belgian milk chocolate egg packed with fruit and nut pieces - a combination Ive been known to enjoy.The chocolate didnt taste as special while the nuts were rather small and didnt have the crunch I yearned for. Saying that, it might be down to personal choice and you could completely disagree.From the selection I tried, there are three clear winners: Moser Roths hazelnut chocolate bunny, Moser Roths Free From salted caramel egg with hidden truffles and the Dairyfine chocolate ice cream egg.You can browse the full Easter egg collection from Aldi via the website here.The Aldi website has even more eggs on offer - featuring cookies and cream, Eton mess and chocolate orange flavours."},{"url":null,"title":"galaxy-smarties-see-easter-eggs-least-sugar","story":"Expressdentist was intrigued to find out which Easter eggs could be the best and worst for your teeth, based on sugar content, so it investigated to see what the worst for sugar content is, so you don’t need to avoid all sweet treats this Easter.Coming in the joint top spot for the Easter eggs worst for your teeth are Galaxy Ripple and Galaxy Minstrels Easter Eggs with g of sugar per g.Although two Mars Galaxy products take the top spot, the other two Mars Galaxy productsrank respectively th and nd.: I tried Aldis new Easter egg range - but which ones are worth buying In second place is the Smarties Easter Egg with .g of sugar per g.

He opened the film surrounded by some of Mrs T’s handbags, reminding viewers what it meant for a Cabinet Minister to be “handbagged” by her. Ronald Reagan did not have quite that fate, though she was not afraid to let him know when she was disappointed, as she was with America’s declared neutrality in the run-up to the Falklands conflict.Moore worked his contacts from his books and landed a few big fish as talking heads, some of them better known at the time than now, but offering valuable insights all the same. There was the personal touch, too, as he reminisced with Cynthia Crawford, “Crawfie”, Mrs Thatcher’s indispensable PA.Cruise missiles, Greenham Common, the Cold War, how long ago it all seemed, particularly with the news as it is now. The film suffered as a result, but there were a few nuggets worth sharing, and the insights into Reagan, adored his strong mother, alcoholic father, made a lot of sense.A busy time on the domestic front with a couple of shows ing and a newbie on the block. Anyone would think it was spring cleaning season.The idea is seductive – an organised le is the key to a happier, less stressful existence –not exactly deep. I can’t see home organising becoming one of the great religions of the world, but it is a harmless enough pastime. Do pop some ear plugs in before viewing: contains lots of girly screaming, especially from the blokes, when they see the wonders home editors Clea and Joanna make happen.By my reckoning, The Great Home Transformationis the st show of its kind, or at least it feels that way. Presented by Nick Grimshaw and Emma Willis, its USP was its ordinariness.Tech was used to show the rooms most used by a family, and the house rearranged and decluttered accordingly.No walls were knocked through or otherwise harmed in the making of this programme. Are you taking note Kirstie There was so much product from a certain Swedish superstore it came as no surprise to find they were the show’s sponsors.At the end of the hour, asked what the tidy up would do for the family, mum said: “I can just imagine people smiling more.” Ill take that.It should have been a safe space for informed debate, somewhere for readers to discuss issues around the biggest stories of the day, but all too often the below the line comments on most websites have become bogged down by off-topic discussions and abuse. heraldscotland is tackling this problem by allowing only subscribers to comment.We are doing this to improve the experience for our loyal readers and we believe it will reduce the ability of trolls and troublemakers, who occasionally find their way onto our site, to abuse our journalists and readers.

However, Holyrood and local authorities lack the powers to do this and Anas Sarwar wouldn’t even sign a joint-party letter demanding the devolution of these powers. Also, Labour voted against doubling the Scottish Child Payment to help hard-pressed families.Other than high energy costs, Brexit is the biggest cause of UK austerity and falling exports is causing real problems for our businesses, yet Sir Keir Starmer told LBC on Wednesday that “theres no case for rejoining the EU” and is in favour of the most expensive nuclear energy option which will add hundreds on to household bills for years to come. Scotland can’t afford UK Labour in power.As a leading energy-exporting country Scotland does not need nuclear power stations and should be focusing on the production of hydrogen fuel cells, the clean energy future for gas boilers, cars and ferries.Fraser Grant, Edinburgh.* GROWING up in the s, we were informed that Scotland led the world with nuclear power. It was a nonsense of course. Scotland had and has no nuclear industry: we do not design, build or export our nuclear expertise.Nuclear power remains hugely expensive and dficult to build, needs guaranteed access to coolant at a time of increasingly serious climate events requires costly state intervention with subsidies, insurance and security. There is no long-term solution to waste. Scotland should utilise its share of funding to build expertise and an export industry around tidal power and green hydrogen.I actually heard a trade union rep complain that without nuclear power Scotland, as part of the UK grid, would partly rely on England’s gas-powered electricity generator. Was he really unaware that much of that gas originates in Scotland GR Weir, Ochiltree.* I HAVE been following the reaction to the UK Government’s decision to go nuclear and maintain its restrictions on onshore turbines.I wonder thoughyet again Westminster is missing yet another cheaper option.Why are we not placing bladeless turbines up and down our motorways and trunk roads  The turbines, while not quite as efficient as their bladed cousins, are cheaper to manufacture, install and maintain. Further, placing them along the roadways both avoids many planning constraints and provides another source of generation as well as the wind, ie passing vehicles. Just think, all those lampposts powered for free and the excess used to power service stations and homes nearby. Maybe even electric cars no, that would be an imaginative step too far.Perhaps before the A dialling finishes and any other major road project Holyrood might want to take the lead and plan for a bladeless contribution to our power needs.John Davidson, Carnoustie.TORIES RANCID PHILOSOPHYDR RM Morrishits the nail on the head when he characterises the Johnson Government as \"supremely competent\" in pursuing its own narrow interests rather than the interests of all its citizens. Thus the wealthy, oligarchic backers and Brexit-loving xenophobes are appeased by policies and promises that are entirely self-centred and devoid of empathy where the less well-off are concerned.This particular nail would have been obvious to many for some considerable time, but clearly not enough, as the results of the last election show us. Voters should ponder long and hard whether they wish to continue to collude with such a rancid philosophy.Dr Angus Macmillan, Dumfries.WE MUST CHANGE THE TAX LAWSAS wein the press re the UK Chancellor’s we avoiding tax , I wonder when we are going to tackle the real issue.The social group that benefits from the current tax laws is the same group that made the tax laws and the business laws that – while intended initially to encourage investment – now just protect business people from the very market forces they are always banging on about. Ditto the same group that made the company laws that saw Sir Philip Green get away with asset-stripping British Home Stores and running up huge pension deficits while buying multi-million-pound yachts for his own pleasure.It was legal. Everyone knows it was wrong but the law protected him.Those same laws mean that those who benefit from government subsidy, post-privatisation of almost everything, are de facto living off massive social handouts – the very sort which is derided when givento poor people.Pinpointing the vile iniduals who have accumulated so much of the world’s wealth while people starve and suffer the effects of climate devastationis no longer a thing.The real thing is, laws need to be updated and made fit for purpose to reflect what actually happens in the st century.Amanda Baker, Edinburgh.WHATS FAIR IS FAIRAMID all the huffing and puffing about Rishi Sunaks Budget and wealth I spotted this on Twitter: \"This fair society thing. I know exactly what it is. Everyone richer than me can pay more in taxes. Preferably a windfall tax too for being richer than me. Everyone whose property is worth more than mine should pay punitive inheritance tax on their death. Everyone who owns a car bigger than mine should pay a much higher road tax. Then my taxes could be lowered and benefits through public services that I personally would use could be raised. That seems fair to me.\"Allan Sutherland, Stonehaven.TV TREATS US LIKE CHILDRENI REMEMBER the Vietnam War but have no recollection of TV news reports from the time being prefaced with warnings about distressing content. I’m also pretty sure that in  the BBC didn’t preface Richard Dimbleby’s dispatches from Bergen-Bn with such advisories.Now, however, in the excellent coverage of the Ukraine war, we are endlessly told, as for example in Channel  News on Thursday, five times in  minutes, that \"this report contains distressing images\".We know that these images will be distressing, it’s war, we understand this, we do not need broadcasters treating us like children. For those who don’t want to see reality, they know where the \"off\" switch is.Stuart Neville, Clydebank.WE CANT DECIDE ON PEACENEIL Mackay describes reports of atrocities in Ukraine with Russia as the likely culprit . He writes that evenRussia withdraws from Ukraine \"there can be no peace until both Putin and his regime are destroyed\".So far Ukraine is the only country at war with Russia, not the UK. Commentators from our country cannot decide whether peace terms are acceptable to the countries at war.Allan Mackenzie, Cumbernauld.THE OTHER WH SMITHIAN McConnells article was not just interesting from a business perspective, but also from an educational one. Narrating the le and legacy of John Menzies and the business he founded was very informative.The mention of the takeover by WH Smith in the s reminded me of another WH Smith who has largely been forgotten by history. William Smith opened a foundry in Whitchurch, Shropshire, in  with three men  years later it had grown to a company which employed more than . His \"vision\" was to be able to \"make anything my neighbour might want\".I am not sure when the business closed, but I do know that there are still manholes and drains in Shropshire which bear his name and one of the easiest to find is in the village of Ironbridge near Telford. Behind the village store a drain cover is emblazoned with it.If any of your readers are in the vicinity of Ironbridge, they should go looking for it and be impressed by a piece of social history.I do realise, of course, that I am a bit of a saddo, butits a good enough hobby for Jeremy Corbyn then its good enough for me.Gordon Fisher, Stewarton.LITTER SOLUTION IN OUR OWN HANDSTHE letterfrom George Moore requesting an apology from Glasgow City Council for \"the filthy state of Glasgows litter-strewn pavements\" typies much of what is wrong with todays society. I was reminded of an occasion, years ago, waiting for a train on Queen Street Stations low level . A fellow passenger castigated a railway employee who emerged from an office that the litter-strewn  was a disgrace to which the employee replied : \"I didnt drop the litter there, madam.\"I am sure it is not Glasgow City Council which drops all the litter. A litter-free city, indeed country, lies in our own hands.Bob Byiers, Bearsden.AN OWN GOAL FROM SCOTRAILI AM going to Hampden Park on Tuesday evening to watch the Scotland Women’s National Team play Spain. On checking the train times from Mount Florida after the match, I discover that it is an hourly service. I shall therefore drive to the game, as I am sure many others will do. I think the new owners of ScotRail are missing the twin goals of promoting the women’s game and encouraging the use of public transport.Scott Simpson, Glasgow.It should have been a safe space for informed debate, somewhere for readers to discuss issues around the biggest stories of the day, but all too often the below the line comments on most websites have become bogged down by off-topic discussions and abuse. heraldscotland is tackling this problem by allowing only subscribers to comment.We are doing this to improve the experience for our loyal readers and we believe it will reduce the ability of trolls and troublemakers, who occasionally find their way onto our site, to abuse our journalists and readers.

People are also being advised to take a test prior to visiting someone who is vulnerable.If you develop symptoms, you should continue to get a PCR test.On vaccination, the First Minister said: “The advice to everyone, of course, remains as important as ever – please do take the opportunity to get vaccinated as soon as you are able and make sure you get all doses of vaccine that you are eligible for.

The identity of a person could undoubtedly be forged by the place of their birth and the community of that place, particularly at a time in the past when populations were less mobile.The traits of a person’s parents manest in their physical appearance their spirit, likes and dislikes, and sometimes even interests or inclinations might appear hereditary – not just from mother and father but perhaps from an ancestor remembered only by name and special characteristic, like poesy or craft skill..The failure by clan chiefs and other landed gentry to recognise this customary right held by the people since time immemorial underpins the Clearances, while demands for its recognition echo through much of the collective action undertaken against this violence, trauma, and dispossession. as far back in history as I can.The world and society these people lived in was so dferent to ours today, making context crucial to understanding the words being used and the philosophy from which they derive.Aside from the multitude which are in still in use today, there are published proverb collections as well as countless sound recordings, many digitized and made easily accessible by Tobar an Dualchais.By their nature proverbs cut across boundaries of class and gender, their survival relying upon oral transmission, on being commonly known in a community and thus reflecting its values.

It is now surely a matter of huge regret for our communities that so many small-scale care providers # despite their good reputation and obvious appeal in rural parts of the country – have been allowed to wither on the vine and disappear. on standards which followed the Covid outbreak in April and May .Budhmor’s owners are not a shadowy offshore conglomerate trying to put profit before care – but CrossReach, the social arm of the Church of Scotland. Despite their benevolent roots, the modern pressures facing the sector, they say, simply make it too dficult to keep their Portree home open.The building needs too much work and they don’t have the money to pay for it.The only option, families were told, is closure – with the suggestion that the  residents could all be accommodated nearby in a refurbished and expanded Home Farm.It is not dficult to understand why families are so aggrieved at this proposal.Things may well have improved at Home Farm since the horrors of Covid, but have all the lessons been learned The blanket national policy of shting patients from hospitals to care homes in the frantic weeks of early  was a huge factor in the devastating Covid death toll that followed.Yet now, with the pandemic still not behind us, families in Skye are being told they should accept the transfer en masse of their elderly relatives to the very home so ravaged by coronavirus when it was proven to be over capacity and understaffed.At Budhmor, they managed to keep the home safe from the worst of Covid-. Relatives of residents will tell you that was no fluke – but down to good standards, diligent management and conscientious staff.There will be some truth in the financial and staffing pressures that CrossReach cite in their reasons for closure. But two years on from the outset of Covid, should the sector not be doing all it can to preserve and build on the success of an institution which proved such a good example during the pandemic, rather than bowing to the bottom line and accepting its loss.There is also the matter of an options appraisal on health and care needs in the north of Skye, currently being prepared by NHS Highland.Closure must at the very least be halted until this review is complete – andthis requires support for CrossReach, our Government should find it.In the longer term what we really need are alternative models to those that are currently governed by economies of scale than on inidual or community needs. An agenda of rationalisation and centralisation has taken hold of far too many of our public services and is ultimately driving decisions like the closure of small care facilities offering a homely, personalised environment in favour of a vast, but possibly distant one many miles from an inidual’s home community.No-where has this been more obvious, or dangerous, than in the west Highland health and care sector.We should start the fightback by backing Budhmor care home, and keeping it open."},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_4008432.jpg--_the_people_you_are_visiting_may_be_particularly_vulnerable_.jpg?1629440923000\n","title":"wwwballymenaguardiancouknews20220407newsthe people you are visiting may be particularly vulnerable","story":"The public has been urged to keep wearing face coverings when visiting hospitals, care homes and other health and care settings.

The strike comes after members of the union overwhelmingly voted for industrial action after rejecting the latest Translink management pay offer. Unite general secretary Sharon Graham expressed her support for the striking bus workers. She said, “These bus workers are frontline workers – they deserve respect and a pay increase. Translink needs to grasp that there’s a cost of living crisis destroying the value of wages andwith a more acceptable offer. “Unite’s members have my full support and that of their union in taking this strike action for fairer pay.” Unite deputy Regional Secretary Davy Thompson is lead officer for Translink, Northern Ireland’s bus and rail public transport provider.

When we clapped every Thursday night, we said the essential workers would not be forgotten or left behind. But during this cost of living crisis, Translink is forgetting their own workers. “The dispute, which affects bus drivers, cleaners and shunters will close the entire bus network within Northern Ireland. It will be a complete shutdown.” A Translink spokesperson said they were disappointed that the unions hadvoted to take industrial action. “Following extensive negotiations, including with the Labour Relations Agency, we made a pay offer of % plus an enhanced package of conditions that included a % increase in weekend and overtime rates along with  extra days holiday, they said. “We believe this was a fair and reasonable offer and have at all times been open to discussions.

That means there is much for visitors to explore, from ancient to modern history.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up Read MoreBallycastle is Northern Ireland’s best place to live in : Proud locals are in full agreement as Co Antrim town edges out Derry and Helen’s Bay‘There’s no place like home’: Derry Girls writer Lisa McGee reacts to city being named among top places to live in NIYou have the completely intact -year-old Derry Walls which is a real selling point for tourists.Other historic landmarks include the Guildhall — where it now stands was once the middle of the River Foyle where ships moored. It was mostly destroyed by fire in  and after extensive rebuilding was opened in .Because it is relatively small in size, Derry is an easy place to navigate for visitors.A key piece of infrastructure built in recent times was the Peace Bridge.Nowadays it is hard to imagine the city without it, and it’s an area of recreation popular with walkers and joggers.That area is arguably the best feature of the city, expanding the city centre, linking to Ebrington, St Columb’s Park and the renovated railway station.The Peace Bridge connects the Cityside and Waterside it was a masterstroke both in practical terms and as an act of symbolism by reconnecting the largely Catholic Cityside to the traditionally unionist Waterside. Derry is also a city of culture — made official in  — with musicians, poets, painters and actors famous the world over.Danny Boy is one of the most famous songs in the world, and has been covered by Elvis Presley, Johnny Cash and Eva Cassidy. Phil Coulter, The Undertones, Dana, Cara Dillon, Johnny McDaid of Snow Patrol fame, Red Organ Serpent Sound, Fighting with Wire, SOAK and Wood Burning Savages show the range of musicians Derry has produced.It is also a city with proud sporting traditions in GAA and football and has produced Olympic medallists and world champions who first learned their trade on Derry’s pitches, roads and rivers.Nowhere does a festival like Derry, but there should be more added to the calendar.You have Glasgowbury in Draperstown, the City of Derry Jazz and Big Band Festival, the legendary Halloween festival and, in recent times, the Foyle Maritime Festival, which have all proven popular.When considering Derry, you also have to factor in the location. A short drive across the border and you’re in some of the world’s nicest beaches including Dunree and Tullagh Bay.To Derry’s advantage in the Sunday Times survey was an average house price of £,.“Reaping the rewards of years of investment and with a fine cultural reputation, this much-improved city stands out as somewhere cool, credible and cheap, with a bright future,” The Sunday Times states.But most people in the city would disagree with that statement, as multiple-deprivation measures, unemployment rates and analysis of investment show the second city has not received a great deal of inward investment.For example, since Invest NI was formed in  until   it has assisted , new jobs in Belfast whereas Foyle got , and East Londonderry ,.In that time it invested £.bn in Belfast and £.bn between Foyle and East Londonderry.Most ReadMaking waves: £.m coastal property in Portstewart is one in a millionBelfast-based auction house to sell off drug-smuggling super yachtAnger as Doug Beattie ‘noose’ poster is left ahead of Lurgan anti-NI Protocol rallyProtestant worker who claimed ‘intimidation’ when colleagues played ‘anti-British’ songs has claim rejectedRegeneration plan to be developed for ‘frightening’ Shaftesbury Square in BelfastTop VideosPlayAnti-protocol rally in Lurgan pleads for #Unionist unity# with #noose# posters of Doug BeattiePlayRoy Reynolds just hours before his death videoed with Michael Campbell the man accused of his murderPlayRaymond O#Neill found guilty of murdering west Belfast mother Jenner DornanLatest Northern IrelandJeffrey Donaldson ‘horried’ by appearance of noose poster at anti-protocol rallyUUP leader Doug Beattie hits back after he is branded ‘Lundy’ and ‘Traitor’ at anti-protocol rallyBeattie slams ‘mindless idiots’ who placed noose on election posterWe’ll shock Linfield and take title to the wire, insists Cltonville boss Paddy McLaughlin ahead of Saturday’s Solitude showdownJohn Cooney: I’ll give my all to help Ulster halt Antoine Dupont and Toulouse in crunch European clashLatestJeffrey Donaldson ‘horried’ by appearance of noose poster at anti-protocol rallyLeaving cert oral exams postponed for  pupilsToulouse v Ulster: Province trail by six at half-time despite hosts having Mallia sent off earlyExtinction Rebellion stage sit-down protest in central LondonHolohan will not take up secondment post at Trinity,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The site is now home to the Castle Court shopping centre.The train station formerly known as Belfast Central, which is located on Bridge Street in the Laganside area of the city, was renamed Lanyon Place four years ago. Most ReadMaking waves: £.m coastal property in Portstewart is one in a millionBelfast-based auction house to sell off drug-smuggling super yachtAnger as Doug Beattie ‘noose’ poster is left ahead of Lurgan anti-NI Protocol rallyProtestant worker who claimed ‘intimidation’ when colleagues played ‘anti-British’ songs has claim rejectedRegeneration plan to be developed for ‘frightening’ Shaftesbury Square in BelfastTop VideosPlayAnti-protocol rally in Lurgan pleads for #Unionist unity# with #noose# posters of Doug BeattiePlayRoy Reynolds just hours before his death videoed with Michael Campbell the man accused of his murderPlayRaymond O#Neill found guilty of murdering west Belfast mother Jenner DornanLatest Northern IrelandJeffrey Donaldson ‘horried’ by appearance of noose poster at anti-protocol rallyUUP leader Doug Beattie hits back after he is branded ‘Lundy’ and ‘Traitor’ at anti-protocol rallyBeattie slams ‘mindless idiots’ who placed noose on election posterWe’ll shock Linfield and take title to the wire, insists Cltonville boss Paddy McLaughlin ahead of Saturday’s Solitude showdownJohn Cooney: I’ll give my all to help Ulster halt Antoine Dupont and Toulouse in crunch European clashLatestJeffrey Donaldson ‘horried’ by appearance of noose poster at anti-protocol rallyLeaving cert oral exams postponed for  pupilsToulouse v Ulster: Province trail by six at half-time despite hosts having Mallia sent off earlyExtinction Rebellion stage sit-down protest in central LondonHolohan will not take up secondment post at Trinity,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Credit: Claire SugdenNiamh CampbellTwitterEmailApril   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailAssembly candidate Claire Sugden has revealed how she has been working into the wee small hours creating her own election posters, leaflets and social media imagery.Despite having no formal graphics training, the former East Londonderry MLA designs and writes all of her own election material — something she has been doing since she first stood for Stormont six years ago.“It saves me a considerable amount of money and it’s something I enjoy,” explained the independent unionist and former justice minister. “Whenever I was at the age when I was deciding what it was I wanted to do with my le, it was either politics or art. I ended up going down the political route, so it’s kind of nice that when it comes to election times, I can exercise that other side of things.“I have an A-level in art and that’s it. It’s all self-taught. My husband is a computer games artist, so I take a lot of advice from him, but a lot of it is Googling how to do things and, I think, having a bit of an eye for design anyway. None of it is perfect, I’m sure someone who is qualied and experienced in this field would be able to pull up something quicker and a lot more eye-catching, but I’m pleased with the way it turns out.”The Coleraine woman said she spent a few days last week “going round the constituency getting some photographs just to get nice fresh images for the literature”, but overall she’s kept to the same colour scheme and theme for her election content since she first stood in .“It can take a while, but sitting down I can get into a bit of a zone with it. You can find me maybe starting it at pm and still sitting until am in the morning because I’m on a bit of a roll with it. There’s other days when I get a bit of a block and that’s usually the days where you’re under pressure and trying to make deadlines for printers.”She joked: “If the election doesn’t go my way, maybe I have another career!”Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up Related topicsClaire SugdenMore On Claire Sugden PremiumSam McBrideOpinionA third of our MLAs weren’t put there by the voters... and it may get even worseUkraine crisis: Stormont urged to ‘step up’ and pressure Home Office into waiving visa requirement for refugeesSugden’s anger as Stormont crisis endangers mental health court planStaffing crisis in agri-food industry is down to immigration rules, Poots toldIndependent unionist Claire Sugden ‘less likely’ to join UUP following Doug Beattie tweet stormMost ReadMaking waves: £.m coastal property in Portstewart is one in a millionAnger as Doug Beattie ‘noose’ poster is left ahead of Lurgan anti-NI Protocol rallyBelfast-based auction house to sell off drug-smuggling super yachtProtestant worker who claimed ‘intimidation’ when colleagues played ‘anti-British’ songs has claim rejectedLarge crowds gather in Lurgan for anti-Northern Ireland Protocol rally, with organisers expecting , attendeesTop VideosPlayAnti-protocol rally in Lurgan pleads for #Unionist unity# with #noose# posters of Doug BeattiePlayRoy Reynolds just hours before his death videoed with Michael Campbell the man accused of his murderPlayRaymond O#Neill found guilty of murdering west Belfast mother Jenner DornanLatest Northern Ireland Assembly election SDLP’s Cara Hunter latest politician to have election posters stolen from constituency areaNorthern Ireland Assembly elections candidates in full: Who is standing in your area UUP Peer Empey claims ‘credible rumours’ emerging in Westminster Article  will be triggered after Stormont electionNorthern Ireland Assembly election : People ‘have a choice’ to attend polling stationCovid positive, Electoral Office confirmsDUP protest over NI Protocol ‘futile’, says Sinn Fein’s Conor MurphyLatestPolice renew appeal after latest arson attack on Belfast Multi-Cultural Association buildingCredit rating downgrade indicates Russia heading for historic defaultUK first as hidden camera captures wild white-tailed eagle egg hatchingJeffrey Donaldson ‘horried’ by appearance of noose poster at anti-protocol rallyRalf Rangnick: Man Utd don’t deserve Champions League football on current form,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Credit: Graham Baalham-CurryApril   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailYou can’t drink your morning coffee without an audience and as you walk down the road you are watched from all angles, both geometrically and politically.That’s right — election season is upon us and as a result, the faces of your local politicians on poster after poster are becoming more familiar than the heartthrobs we had on our walls as teenagers.It is one staple of election campaigns that has been around for decades,not centuries, and while there’s some sport initially in comparing the tenets of graphic design, colour schemes and haircutsof our political representatives, when you sit and think about it, is this something that’s really needed in this day and age As a journalist, I’m probablymore familiar with Northern Ireland’s politicians than the average person, given my job involves thinking, talking and writing about them on a daily basis. As such, I don’t often need a reminder of who there is to vote for in my constituency or what parties they stand for. I’ll admit that an election poster is certainly an easy way to raise awareness of, on a basic level, exactly who represents or wants to represent you.But after seeing the same person staring at me five times before I had crossed a single bridge in Coleraine where I live the other day, I started to wonder do posters influence how people vote — or are posters just a habit, one which may not serve the most purpose but indicates you have a dog in the fight Read MoreIndependent candidate Claire Sugden using her artistic flair for election materialThe ironic thing is that maybe posters mean much more to the smaller parties and independents with comparably smaller budgets to the more prominent frontrunners. For them, it’s more of a stretch to measure up the level of postering and the legwork it takes displayed by other parties but who worry they won’t get as much attentionthey don’t appear to have parity in terms of faces on streets.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up Often described as CorriBoard posters, many of those massive signs you see on our streets and roads are made from one of the dirtiest words of our time — plastic. While the materials can sometimes be upcycled, it is suggested they will take hundreds of years to degrade, long after the politicians whose faces on which they featured and possibly even the parties they represented have departed this fine earth.It’s true that they do have benefits. They are immune to hackers which have plagued recent international elections . Not everyone has top class internet access so it does keep demographics informed. There’s no question that they send a message to voters and a reminder that an election is taking place — andyour local MLA hasn’t fixed that pothole on your road, you will know just the face to ask when they come a-canvassing.Green Party NI politician Mal O’Hara has joined some of his international colleagues in favouring a system seen in Europe where paper posters are erected in certain spaces only, instead of being festooned on every available surface. But this approach isn’t favoured by some larger parties who are able to spread their resources more widely and want to be able to show that. And so, without any wider consensus, the great poster parade marches on even in  when the word on all of our lips is the environment and many of us are kept awake at night wondering what sort of a world it is we’re leaving behind for the next generation and the one after that.What is the alternative  Some may argue it’s already here, and it’s called social media, where most views are shared and heard and your popularity isn’t always just down to what party backs you, but how well you use your voice. There’s also mainstream media via the television, news sites and newspapers as well as the radio. And for those who have access to neither, there’s canvassing — and feel free to reject those shiny leaflets which usually take a short trip to the bin in favour of a chat instead.Or why not make use of the screens in Belfast city centre or in shopping centres to instead display candidates posters on a revolving basis, on the proviso that these screens and devices would have to be made more widely available in our towns and villages Some may disregard these suggestions but surely there must be another way, instead of risking damage to the environment and obscuring our beautul landscape on this island with these massive posters cropping up at regular intervals.Whatever your thoughts on posters, the discourse around them doesn’t end after the election unfortunately. And while you might find the face of a local politician peaking out from behind a hedge or unlucky enough to be placed atop a bonfire, you will also be treated to the crowdsourcing operation that is your local politician asking you to make them aware of any forlorn final poster still lingering on our streets. Or at the very least, a photo of them with clippers in hand, telling all they are out and about removing their posters, sent to the rubbish heap, after election season comes to an end.Related topicsGreen PartyMore On Green PartyRocking the ballot box: Brian Smyth, Sian O’Neill and Paul Doherty entered politics through music activismClimate Change Bill was ‘not everything’ Green Party leader Clare Bailey hoped for PremiumSam McBrideOpinionA third of our MLAs weren’t put there by the voters... and it may get even worse PremiumSDLP MP Claire Hanna’s ‘shock’ over proposal by Sinn Fein to abolish her South Belfast seatLucidTalk opinion poll: Sinn Fein’s Michelle O’Neill nudges closer to top Stormont post as DUP lags behindMost ReadMaking waves: £.m coastal property in Portstewart is one in a millionBelfast-based auction house to sell off drug-smuggling super yachtAnger as Doug Beattie ‘noose’ poster is left ahead of Lurgan anti-NI Protocol rallyProtestant worker who claimed ‘intimidation’ when colleagues played ‘anti-British’ songs has claim rejectedRegeneration plan to be developed for ‘frightening’ Shaftesbury Square in BelfastTop VideosPlayAnti-protocol rally in Lurgan pleads for #Unionist unity# with #noose# posters of Doug BeattiePlayRoy Reynolds just hours before his death videoed with Michael Campbell the man accused of his murderPlayRaymond O#Neill found guilty of murdering west Belfast mother Jenner DornanLatest Northern Ireland Assembly election SDLP’s Cara Hunter latest politician to have election posters stolen from constituency areaNorthern Ireland Assembly elections candidates in full: Who is standing in your area UUP Peer Empey claims ‘credible rumours’ emerging in Westminster Article  will be triggered after Stormont electionNorthern Ireland Assembly election : People ‘have a choice’ to attend polling stationCovid positive, Electoral Office confirmsDUP protest over NI Protocol ‘futile’, says Sinn Fein’s Conor MurphyLatestJeffrey Donaldson ‘horried’ by appearance of noose poster at anti-protocol rallyLeaving cert oral exams postponed for  pupilsToulouse v Ulster: Province trail by six at half-time despite hosts having Mallia sent off earlyExtinction Rebellion stage sit-down protest in central LondonHolohan will not take up secondment post at Trinity,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

currency exchange screen displays exchange rates in Moscow in February By Frank Bajak, Associated PressApril   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailThe credit ratings agency Standard  Poor’s has downgraded its assessment of Russia’s ability to repay foreign debt, signalling rising prospects that Moscow will soon default on external loans for the first time in more than a century.SP Global Ratings issued the downgrade to “selective default” late Friday, after Russia arranged to make foreign bond payments in roubles on Monday when they were due in dollars.It said it did not expect Russia to be able to convert the roubles into dollars within the -day grace period allowed.SP said in a statement that its decision was based partly on its opinion that sanctions on Russia over its invasion of Ukraine “are likely to be further increased in the coming weeks, hampering Russia’s willingness and technical abilities to honour the terms and conditions of its obligations to foreign debtholders”.While Russia has signalled that it remains willing to pay its debts, the Kremlin has also warned that it would do so in roublesits overseas accounts in foreign currencies remain frozen.Tightened sanctions placed on Russia this week after evidence of alleged war crimes – the killing of civilians in the town of Bucha during Russian military occupation – barred it from using any foreign reserves held in US banks for debt payments.Russia’s finance ministry said on Wednesday that it tried to make a  million dollarpayment toward two bonds to an unnamed US bank, previously reported as JPMorgan Chase, but that the tightened sanctions prevented the payment from being accepted, so it paid in roubles.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and

By working in partnership with Ards and North Down and Newry, Mourne and Down councils, we have an opportunity to develop a sustainable, international walking route, which has the potential to attract visitors, both from home and abroad, to explore our outstanding countryside and learn about our incredible Christian Heritage.Cllr Enright believes that developing a trail of this scale will also encourage walkers to visit existing tourist attractions such as the Livingston Centre at Killinchy Parish Church and stop off on the way in restaurants and stay in local accommodation which in turn will bring much needed income and business to the local economy.Hinch Distillery owner, Dr Terry Cross mdash who set up the David Cross Foundation in memory of his son mdash said he was very impressed with the application for funding from Friends of Columbanus Bangor.ldquoThis project has the ability to bring people from all walks of le to meet and greet one another, regardless of their community background, he enthused.ldquoBuilding relationships, peace and reconciliation across Europe is now more important than ever given the critical situation that has erupted in Ukraine.

However, at the weekend they were determined to not give Armagh a head start and to be as competitive as possible from the first whistle.During a frantic first  minutes the Down girls did not disappoint, fighting for every ball and matching Armagh in every position around the pitch.At the first water-break Down led - to Armagh - in a very even game with Clodagh Simpson scoring a great goal and the lively Orla Owens scoring two points.During the second  minute period of the first half, the Down girls raised their own standard again and pushed Armagh back into their own half.Although Down scored a further - during this period they could have had more, and it was the Armagh team and management who were the happier team to hear the half-time whistle.Scorers in this period were Annie McEvoy with - and Orla Owens again with another point. The half-time score of Down - to Armagh - did certainly not flatter Down as their performance up to then was excellent.Into the second half and Armagh tightened up a lot and restricted Down to less clearer opportunities to score.At the other end Armagh took their own chances and scored a couple of quick goals which gave them the lead for the first time in the match. A point for Owens was the only score for Down during this period.At the second water-break the score was - to - to Armagh.Into the final  minutes and Down made changes to get fresh legs on the pitch. Another Owens point, her fth of the day, levelled up the score at Down - to Armagh - with ten minutes left.Armagh scored two points take the lead for the second time and with time running out, Down went for the goal to win the game.With the ball seemingly stuck in Downrsquos attacking third they just couldnrsquot break down the Armagh defence. With time up Armagh broke up field and scored a goal with the final play to win the match.Full time: Down - Armagh -.The Down girls were disappointed with the result but the management team were delighted with their overall performance. All of the  girls used for Down played their bit.Scorers for Down were Annie McEvoy , Clodagh Simpsonand the top scorer was Orla Owens .Best performers for Down v Armagh were Lily Magee in nets, Eloise Austin, Therese Cowan, Ava McArdle, Zara Kelly, Isa McCarron, Aoe Wolfe, Anna McArdle and captain Maia Murdock but it was Orla Owens who took the player of the match award with her five points.With the Platinum All-Ireland series still to be played in the coming weeks, and the way these girls continue to improve week by week, who knows how far they can go.The management and girls would like to thank everyone for all the messages prior to the final and for all the support on the day.Down: L Magee E Austin, F M Morgan, T Cowan A McArdle, M Murdock, Z Kelly A Wolfe, I McCarron A McArdle, H Donnelly, A McEvoy O Owens, C Simpson, E McKee.Subs: D OrsquoShea, E OrsquoKane, H McGeough, R Horisk, E Farrell, C McDermott, C McGrath, G Kelly, G McMullan, E McHugh, A McKay, H Cassin, C Lundy, T Ryan, L Elmore..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C  April 8%2C 1992  ","story":"NEWCASTLE mdash The RNLI has unveiled plans for a major new pound, leboat station for Newcastle.The station, which is at the planning permission stage, will house the new Mersey class leboat which is due to arrive at the seaside town towards the end of November.If the station plans get Department of the Environment approval, the new complex will be constructed to the north of the harbour beside Newcastle Yacht Clubrsquos car park.The RNLIrsquos tractor house and the old Coastguard station will be demolished to make way for the building and a  metre-long slipway will be constructed to just beyond the high water mark.The new station will replace the existing boathouse which was built in  and, apart from some superficial work, has never been updated. The leboat crew and the shore team have to wash at a stand-pipe and the only toilets are an old Victoria public lavatory adjacent to the boathouse.In addition to a modern launching facility, which is clear of the problem-bedevilled harbour, the new station will provide the leboatmen with a crew room, equipped with toilets and showers, a kitchen, training room, lookout area and souvenir outlet.Work on the new complex is likely to take up to six months to complete and,planning permission is granted, is expected to start in June.The longest part of the work will be the construction of the slipway

containing a mixture of acid and caustic soda, fell from a lorry on the Old Grand Jury Road at around am on Friday morning, initiating a full-scale emergency response from the Fire Brigade.Appliances from Ballynahinch and Downpatrick were sent to the scene and a specialist equipment carrying emergency tender unit was also despatched from Belfast.The incident occurred as the articulated lorry was

as a ldquotriumph of common sense.The comment comes from the Strangford Lough Nature Conservation Associationrsquos chairman, Mr Sam Davis, who is urging all lough users to unite in supporting the new administrators.Mr Davisrsquo confidence-boosting commendation of the new body comes a matter of weeks before its inaugural meeting.SLNCA was born out of the conflict felt around the Lough by controversial DoE management proposals put forward a few years ago.The recommendation to support the new administrators on the eve of their activity will be seen as a wholehearted effort by people who are anxious to make the new management structure work.Mr Davis and the Associationrsquos joint council declared after last weekrsquos meeting that the new structure represents what the loughside

addressed the councilrsquos monthly meeting in Dundonald on Thursday afternoon.Friends spokesman, Mr Damian Smyth, told the meeting that the renovation figures which were produced by the Down and Lisburn Unit of Management, are completely dferent from early figures produced by the Eastern Health Boardrsquos building control officer.The officerrsquos report said Mourne House was in good repair, was free fro structural faults, and had a lespan of  years, explained Mr Smyth.He added that a more recent set of figures, produced by the unit of management on April , indicate that only minor works are needed at the home.ldquoThese latest figures say it would cost pound, to raise the standard at the home, including pound, which would have to be spent on fire safety, said Mr Smyth.ldquoThis patently does not square with the unitrsquos first report, which was used to initiate the consultation process, that it will cost a total of pound, to bring the home up to standard, said Mr Smyth. ldquoThis figure includes pound, for fire safety, pound, for a new roof, pound, for a new electrical system and pound, for a new kitchen.ldquoThese figures are bald figures produced by the unit of management with no specications and without the benefit of a quantity surveyorrsquos report, he added.PORTAFERRY mdash Portaferry has become the first town in Northern Ireland to benefit from a pioneering emergency response scheme which will save the lives of heart attack victims.The British Heart Foundation this week handed over a le-saving defibrillator which will enable doctors to provide a first response to cardiac emergencies pending the arrival of an ambulance.The presentation was made on Monday to Portaferry GPs Dr Desmond Compton and Dr David Peacock by Mr Peter Welsh, the Foundationrsquos regional organiser.The doctors believe the equipment could provide a le-saving service for , people in Portaferry and lower Ards Peninsula.It takes around  minutes from an ambulance based in Newtownards to reach the lower Ards.Even so, it would be virtually impossible to put a permanent ambulance in the area because it would be seldom used, according to the Eastern Health

In the case of Jim Fitzsimons, you can take a man out of Downpatrick, but you canrsquot take Downpatrick out of a man.Jim Fitzsimons was born and reared in Downpatrick. He left the town as a young man, having graduated from Queenrsquos University, and spent the next  years or so in England where he had a successful career in further and higher education and in management training.Jim ed to Northern Ireland  years ago and for eight years lived in a cottage at Inch. Now , he and his we, Anne, live in Hillsborough where they enjoy regular visits from their three sons and seven grandchildren.But the lure of Downpatrick remains strong. When the coronavirus struck in March  and the world went into lockdown, Jim decided that the time was ripe for him to write about the town of his upbringing.The result is My Downpatrick: Reflections of  years ago, an affectionate account of happy times. For local people of a certain age, it will be a joyous trip down memory lane packed with names and places comfortingly familiar even with the passing of the years. For those who have no connection with Downpatrick, it is a story which is both educational and entertaining.Jim says he is pleased with the outcome of his efforts. ldquoI am very pleased with the book and I certainly enjoyed writing it. Growing up in Downpatrick we were modestly off, but we had all the things that we needed. It was a good place to live.Jim was born in March , six months before the start of the Second World War, the eldest of three children of William Henry Fitzsimons, a bread server, and his we, Marion. He and his younger brother and sister were reared in Saul Street in the warmth of a loving family and surrounded by many friends.He was educated at Fountain Street School and the Southwell School for Boys, where he and his schoolmates trembled in front a ldquosadistic master who ruled with the cane, before enrolling in Down High School in .Outside of school, there were plenty of opportunities to play sport, as well as trips to the cinema, church socials, the Boysrsquo Brigade and dancing. There were holidays at Tyrella, the annual BB camp, Sunday school excursions to Newcastle and trips to Coney Island, Belfast, Warrenpoint and Dundalk, among other places.It was a time when there were no supermarkets and there was an abundance of bread servers. Like his father, Jimrsquos grandfather was also a bread server, as were some of his other relatives. It was a time when bread servers they didnrsquot just serve bread. Butchers and grocers used them for deliveries. They also carried letters and parcels from the countryside to be posted in Downpatrick and also delivered a sizeable quantity of Down Recorders each week. In short, they were something of a social service.Jim writes about helping his father on his bread cart and also his paper round, which ended when he started in high school, collecting scrap metal during the Korean War and then ersying into collecting waste paper before getting a summer job in the County Surveyors Office in Downpatrick before starting university.He also writes about Downpatrick when it was a market town with a monthly fair and a weekly Saturday market. As the county town it had had many government offices and institutions, as well as hospitals and large factories offering plenty of employment, the county courthouse and two grammar schools.The factories have gone and the hospitals are much diminished since Jimrsquos childhood, but the town has grown considerably mdash its postwar population of around , is now over ,.Of Downpatrick then and now, Jim writes: ldquoDownpatrick was small enough to have a village feel about it. I donrsquot think this is still the case. People donrsquot know each other as they did in the past they live less in town centre terraced houses and more in detached houses in the outskirts.ldquoIn the past many men would go to the pub every evening, not to get drunk, but for perhaps a single drink while catching up with all the local news with friends. Going out to public houses is less common now and the public house and other entertainments is not solely for males. Women in the s and s ands were largely unseen, now they are much freer to do and go as they please. In  it was unheard of for a woman to go into a pub.He goes on: ldquoAlthough there is much to regret about the passing of the Downpatrick that I knew, it is a much better place in which to live. The slum houses that I remember are no more there are modern schools, an imposing new technical college with a nearby state-of-the-art fitness centre, a much expanded campus at St Patrickrsquos Grammar School and advanced plans for a new building for Down High School.ldquoDownpatrick has a range of educational, cultural and sporting opportunities for all ages, for those who wish to take advantage of them. All these opportunities define the quality of a town.My Downpatrick: Reflections of  years ago costs pound and is available at the Saint Patrick Centre and the Grove Post Office in Downpatrick..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Minister waste treatment refusal is blow for Arc 21  ","story":"THE decision by Stormont Minister Nichola Mallon to refuse permission for a large scale waste treatment facility at the site of a former quarry in Newtownabbey has ramications for Newry, Mourne and Down Council.The local authority is a member of Arc which was seeking permission for the multi-million pound plant which could thermally treat , tonnes of municipal waste each year.Ms Mallon said the incinerator plant, which drew over , objections, could discourage recycling, with her decision due to be discussed at the next meeting of the local councilrsquos Neighbourhood Services Committee.Currently, black bin waste collected across the district is transported by sea for incineration in Europe, with council officials keen for the districtrsquos ratepayers to continue focusing their efforts on recycling their waste.There is currently a particular emphasis on ensuring that all food waste is not dumped in black household bins, but in brown bins whose contents is treated and turned into compost.Arc mdash which is considering the decision to refuse permission for the proposed incineration plant mdash is an umbrella waste management group representing six councils on the eastern coast.It was established in  and formally incorporated in  following a process of increasing co-operation amongst its constituent councils.The organisation works on behalf of its partner councils to guide, support and help them deliver their statutory waste management obligations, drive forward innovative waste management programmes, including developing infrastructure and address greater circularity of resources.In addition to Newry, Mourne and Down, the other councils which are members of Arc include Antrim and Newtownabbey, Belfast City, Ards and North Down, Lisburn and Castlereagh and Mid and East Antrim.Ms Mallon said: ldquoI am not persuaded that there is a need for this specic facility.

While I understand that work is underway to recruit new staff, many will be disappointed the museum is closed as it is one of the many jewels in the districtrsquos tourism crown, he said.ldquoTourism is something we do very well in our district, but not opening what is a county museum at this time of year is frustrating and very disappointing.He added: ldquoWe need a fully ing museum in the heart of the county town. The Down County Museum is one of the districtrsquos main attractions and the visitors it draws spend time in Downpatrick and support other businesses, especially those in the hospitality sector which boosts our economy.ldquoGiven tourism is a prime driver for our economy, I am very disappointed that our museum will be shut to visitors over the Easter period and know this view will be shared by many.Alliance councillor Patrick Brown has also criticised the councilrsquos decision to keep the museum closed over Easter.He also called for staff to be moved from Newry to alleviate what he described as ldquostaffing pressures.He said: ldquoI am frustrated to see yet another blow to the Down Museum. Our county museum is so important to the area, and leading into the summer months it should be able to play its essential part in our local tourism industry.ldquoThis is particularly important this year, as we try to bounce back from the pandemic. We have already seen huge controversy over councilrsquos downgrading of the museum, and the news that the museum will remain closed over Easter is very unwelcome.ldquoI, along with other councillors, have secured a full review of museum services across the district as a whole, which is due to start this month. I look forward to seeing the results of this so that we can begin to make changes. Council urgently needs to resolve these staffing pressures, reflect on how the downgrading of the museum has contributed to them and seek the urgent reopening of the Down Museum.He added: ldquoI am disappointed that the Down Museum has become another example of how services are being moved from Downpatrick to Newry. I see all the potential Downpatrick has to be a thriving city, but time and again our services are being redirected to Newry.ldquoI want to see Downpatrick on the map as a destination town for the whole of Northern Ireland, andelected to the Assembly in May, I will fight to bring an end to the lack of delivery for Downpatrick that we have seen from the political establishment in the area for so long.A Newry, Mourne and Down Council spokesman confirmed that the organisation is currently operating with a reduced team of staff to deliver the services at the Downpatrick museum.He said: ldquoIt is therefore with regret that the museum opening times over the Easter holiday period will be Wednesday to Friday between am and pm..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Portaferry man Peter hoping to lose 50lbs in 50 weeks during fundraiser for Air Ambulance NI  ","story":"PORTAFERRY man Peter McGrattan set himself a target of raising vital funds to Air Ambulance NI by losing lbs in  weeks before his th birthday.He started last October and has already lost  pounds, with just  pounds to go before his birthday on September .Peter is a driver for Coach Connections and coaches the Down U- hurling team in his spare time.He explained why he wanted to get involved in such a public way of losing weight.lsquoMy father Kevin was involved in a road traffic collision in Portaferry in , sustaining a traumatic head injury, said Peter.ldquoThankfully Air Ambulance NI were there on the day to treat him and swtly transferred him to Royal Victoria Hospital in Belfast.

The team will be announced in due course.Aaron McGrady was in the Peak District along with  other runners for the annual Chicken Run which is a fell race approximately . miles distance and includes , feet of climbing.He had a strong run and placed second overall in a time of .. Aaron was more than happy to be runner-up to the winner Steve Vernon, who is a triple British cross country and mountain running champion ndash He also set the Chicken Run course record in .Steve and Aaron were the only two to break  minutes for the testing course and only nine runners made it home in under the hour so it was a creditable performance from Aaron from all angles.Sunday saw the rescheduled Titanic K. This race was due to take place in  but was called off due to Covid-.At the time a large number of runners deferred their entry to a new date in  but this also fell foul of restrictions at that time so for some runners this was a two year-old ticket.With the ers bolstered by new entrants there were  excited participants in the Harbour Estate ready for action.Paul Lloyd was delighted to finally take to the roads in a race as he has been hampered by a long term injury and has only managed a modicum of training.He last raced in June  so it was a long time coming.He finished in . which placed him th overall. This is a good marker for further improvement as he s to previous form and he commented on how good it felt to be back at a mass participation event. Hopefully he will now feel ready to enter more races in the near future.Manchester MarathonAs anyone who has done a marathon will know, the preparation required is gruelling. Most runners start months in advance and gradually increase their mileage so that they have the stamina to cope comfortably with . miles.They also need to include speed workthey want to set a good time so it is a juggling process.Gordy Graham, coached by Ryan Maxwell, had followed his schedule to the letter and had many promising race results in his build up so it was a hammer blow when he developed a knee injury with only three weeks to go.He eased off the miles in the hope that it would settle and right up to the morning of the marathon, he was debating whether racing was in his best interests.This head versus heart is not a new thing to runners. With the hours spent training for that day, sitting it out would have been too much to bear.In the end he set off with equal amounts of hope and caution and for the first hour or so maintained the pace that he needed to match his . personal best set in Belfast last year.He was in a group banging out miles at an incredible . minutes per mile pace and he felt pretty good until mile .At this point the niggle became enough to disrupt his natural rhythm and as a result his pace wavered. However, true to form he persisted to the line recording .. as he passed the tape.This result is one that would cause celebration for most and it is, in fact, his second fastest marathon but for Gordy there is still a time out there that he wants to achieve and we know that when he has assessed and treated his injury, he will be back pushing for his goal.We wish him luck in his recovery and future endeavours.Hannah Somani was also out chasing specic targets firstly to better her time of . which she set in London Marathon last October and secondly to come home in under three hours. This sub-three barrier is regarded as a holy grail for many and for Hannah being so close on in London was enough to convince her to give it another shot.She continued consistent training throughout the autumn and into the winter with multiple sessions per week as well as long runs at weekends.On her recent trip to Downpatrick she was so committed to the plan that she ran -odd miles on the morning of Jimmyrsquos Ten before heading to the start line.She then went on to run quick enough in the K to lead with two other high performing EDAC ladiestoclinch victory in the team competition.All this must have stood her in good stead as she absolutely nailed it on Sunday. She arrived at the start with quiet resolve and executed her race with precision pacing.Her time of .. was well deserved after her hard work and she was naturally over the moon. Super work, Hannah.Steph Graham was equally determined in her approach. A small matter of a wedding and a baby in the last  months might seem reason to hold back from committing to race targets but when your husband is also your coach then the lines become blurred.Gordy has had prior mention above for his own race but Steph would be quick to acknowledge his part in her achievements. She entered Manchester due largely to his encouragement as she had doubts as to whether she would be ready in time.She had been hacking chunks off her marathon times in the last few years and in Berlin  she ran . so sub . was her aim. This was a big ask as training with a young baby is never easy but she pulled it off with style.Gordy was brimming over with pride when she finished in ... Steph deserves kudos for this performance but even more so for the fact that she had to resort to the treadmill for daily miles.Despite the tedium of running miles looking at a wall, she never missed a session and her hard graft has paid off. What a team.Same distance but dferent city ndash Dee Murray had decided that Paris in the spring would provide the incentive to train over the winter months and he had racked up his miles motivated by excitement of a European marathon.The day dawned bright but chilly and it took a bit of effort to get warm enough to shed the layers before the start.Fortunately once they were lined up on the famous Champs Elyseacutees, the sun came out in fulland the , runners had perfect racing conditions for the rest of the day.Dee ran with his usual metronomic rhythm ticking off the miles and the iconic landmarks as he ran the winding route.Apart from a bit of cramp in the last couple of miles, he felt comfortable and was delighted to get a sub three hour finish in .. shaving a few seconds off his previous best which had held since .Dee is known as lsquoMr Consistentrsquo and running as quickly as he did five years ago endorses that nickname no end. It is also worth a mention that he placed a commendable , out of ,. A good job well done.With the racing season in full flow, EDAC club members were quick to get signed up on the recent membership night so that they can keep training and also avail of the club discount when entering races.They might also have been encouraged by the raffle which was held at the sign-up. Congratulations to the lucky winners who snagged bottles of wine and Easter eggs.Patrick Smith even won a free entry to Comber K.

I don’t believe that Drumcree is linked to the tragedy of the Quinn children —it was then republicans should take the blame.I’m a member of the Orange Order and I voted for the Good Friday Agreementbecause I accepted the assurances given to David Trimble by London, Dublin and SDLP, assurances which proved to be worthless. How many unionists would’ve voted for the GFAthey had known of the secret deals made between London, Dublin and SF which gave a de facto amnesty to the Provos only  Ever since the GFA was signed all that SF have needed to say, to get their endless demands met, is to say that the GFA is in danger .

We then had a storm at sea which meant that a lot of the ferries couldn’t cross overnight.“We had a few problems with the customs process, etc.“We then had some snow. We then had a train in the tunnels, so all of these things had added up to culminate in the problems that we have got for poor Kent at the moment.”He said there had also been an IT issue with processing documents. vw,vw,px, px\"Cars wait to check in at the Port of Dover in Kent Mr Howe said: “Luckily things have been put in place now so that isn’t a delay but that was something that contributed to those initial delays.“So last weekend Dover really suffered because of all of that congestion.“But we have put traffic management plans in place now so that things can flow through Dover and Dover can stillas a town, and Eurotunnel and the Port of Dover are able to operate as they need to.”.removeHe added: “Make sure you have got some food and drink because there will be delays.“A lot of the minor roads therefore are chock-a-block.”Mr Howe advised travellers to look into the traffic on dferent routes before making their journeys.He said that summer, when traffic is likely to get busier, was a “worry”.Updated Easter Travel Information for Passengers 👇https:t.co ZGuHOmFf pic MdFPUZVJ— Port of DoverApril , Mr Howe added: “What we need are plans in place moving forward because every getaway, Kent could suffer.“So we need plans in place so that we can actually restrict that traffic coming in.“Hopefully, when the ferries are back from PO that will assist as well.“But there will always be some problems as we continue with this sort of thing.”He added that it should not be Kent that “suffers” every time there are travel issues..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: Travellers to France advised to bring food and drink for long queues in Kent article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log Share s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  CommentsComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

Each autumn, Jays, a colourful member of the crow family, can often be seen flying back and forth finding and hiding acorns to help see them through the winter. These are then hidden in the cracks and crevices of trees, but also in leaf litter on the ground. An inidual jay can store around , acorns each year and many remain buried to grow into oak trees.RSPB Big Garden Birdwatch. Mother and her daughter counting birds in their garden, Bedford, UK, January The RSPB’s Chief Executive, Beccy Speight said “We don’t know the reasons for the sudden increase in Jay sightings this year. It may be down to food availability as we have reports that last year was poor for acorns, but whatever the reason a sighting of this stunning bird is enough to raise one’s spirits any day of the year let alone on a gloomy January weekend.“It’s been brilliant to see so many people taking part again this year, taking time out to watch and reconnect with birds and then generously submit their sightings to help RSPB scientists gain some insights into how our garden birds are faring.”Big Garden Birdwatch results also found a small increase in Greenfinch compared to . This gives scientists a glimmer of hope that this might be the first signs of a popuation recovery, but only time will tell. In recent years the Greenfinch has suffered a population crashcaused by a severe outbreak of the disease trichomonosis and as a consequence the species was added to the UK Red list last year. This infection is spread through contaminated food and drinking water, or by birds feeding one another with regurgitated food during the breeding season. Garden owners can help slow transmission rates by temporarily stopping the provision of foodill birds are seen and making sure that garden bird feeders are cleaned regularly.The House Sparrow remained at the top of the Big Garden Birdwatch rankings as the most commonly seen garden bird with more than . million recorded sightings throughout the weekend. Blue Tit and Starling remained in the number two and three positions respectively.RSPB Big Garden Birdwatch. Family filling up a bird feeder in their garden, Potton, Bedfordshire, UK, January Over its four decades, Big Garden Birdwatch has highlighted the winners and losers in the garden bird world. It was first to alert the RSPB to the decline in song thrush numbers, which are still down % compared to the first Big Garden Birdwatch in . This species was a firm fixture in the top  in .

Do something instead‘Don’t worry!’ How often have we heard that and how often do we say it to others  I suspect it’s being said quite often at the present time, when there seems to be so much to be worried about, writes Rev. Ron Elsdon.By The NewsroomSunday, rd April , : am  \"       \"  There’s the state of the Health Service, the never-ending fallout from Brexit, the war in Ukraine, and the spiralling cost of living which is already inflicting so much hardship on so many. ‘Don’t worry!’ But the problem is that it’s far easier said than done. So when you come across it in the bible as well, you could be excused for writing it off as unrealistic. Please stay with me for a few moments, however, while I try to explain.        \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"     \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily NorthernIrelandWorld Today newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

It points you to something rather more than that. I offer you two examples where it offers you responses that are practical – strategies,you like.Ron ElsdonFirstly, Paul directs people to pray instead, and to pepper their prayers with thanksgiving . The trouble is that we’re so good at finding things to complain about, often trivialities, that finding things to give thanks for doesn’t come easily, even to people who pray regularly, but why not switch course and actually do it, then keep on doing it  Then, says Paul, the protecting peace of God is there to be discovered, even in the midst of stressful situations. Secondly, Jesus talks about worry in the Sermon on the Mount . When it consumes us, he says, what we need is a new set of ambitions which point us beyond ourselves “Seek first God’s kingdom and God’s righteousness” is His command to His followers. As I write, I’m thinking about a local politician, one I shan’t be voting for. I know he spends Christmas Day at a place for the homeless, helping to serve up hot meals for that I admire him greatly. As I write, hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians are fleeing the army of a tyrant from the east, many with nowhere to go in freezing weather. In neighbouring countries, churches and other organisations are swinging into action to help support these folk in their hour of desperate need. So, in their dferent ways, Jesus’ and Paul’s words in the bible are saying to us all, ‘Don’t worry! Do something instead.’Read: Covid travel requirement set to change"},{"url":null,"title":"pastors pen god is with us all the way ","story":"Man was ‘too drunk’ to pay for botte of vodka, court told    pictures from Lurgan anti-protocol parade and rallyNewsCoronavirusTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsHealthBusinessEducationPeopleEnvironmentRead ThisUkraine CrisisFootballIrish League FootballSportMotorcyclingIce HockeyOther SportWhats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyleFood and DrinkTravelHomes and GardensCars FamilyYour NIRetroOpinionAdvertise My Businesscanonical_urlCANONICAL_URLhostnameCANONICAL_HOSTNAMElocationCANONICAL_URLreferrerEXTERNAL_REFERRERpage_view_id_PAGE_VIEW_ID_scroll_SCROLL_HEIGHTgeo__INJECT_GEO__cid_ga:CLIENT_ID,comScore:CLIENT_ID,compass_uid:CLIENT_IDversionsha-wJFtySqNnAxBmRbBZGkmXyZeJTYkxlpMdJsFNIrrGVlru-DcIEIZ\" class\"i-amphtml-layout-container\" i-amphtml-layout\"container\"Loading...NewsPASTOR’S PEN: God is with us all the way‘For I know the plans I have for you’, declares the Lord, ‘plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future.” Jeremiah :.By The NewsroomSaturday, th April , : am  \"       \"  In this troublesome world, followers of Jesus are to show His amazing love to all and give hope to those are without hope for the future, writes Alan MIllar.

Even without the gloom and doom of the news, we could escape the fallout of what is going on in the world around us.Alan MIllarWe watched Covid- advance across Europe until it reached our shores in March , and we hoped it would all pass by Christmas, but our hope was dashed on the rocks of reality, as the disease seemed to get worse, and the lockdown continued. The stress increased and the mental health of many people, young and old alike, continued to deteriorate.Their condition was compounded by what we saw on the TV - medical staff in hospitalsm battling day and night, non-stop, to save those who had fallen seriously ill.“We saw the toll it took on their emotional and mental health some were in tears, having just lost another patient. It wasn’t uncommon to hear someone say, “Where is God in all of this ” The truth is, God was right in the middle of the battle. He had foreknowledge of what was to come . Our hope was restored when a vaccine was discovered to combat the virus.God had guided the scientists to find the cure. It was a miracle. I wonder how many thanked God  However, no sooner did we begin to emerge from the pandemic, when we saw the Russian invasion of Ukraine, causing thousands of mothers with children and elderly women, with all their belongings in a bag,to flee for their lives. Thousands didn’t get away and many have died. The fear, stress and strain on their faces spoke volumes. And people asked, “Where is God in all of this ”. God was with them all the way. .Finally they reached Poland and other eastern European countries and it was the arms of God that welcomed them in the form of Polish people who showed God’s amazing love and compassion, welcoming them with food, clothes and shelter.People all over Europe and the UK sent thousands upon thousands of tons of food and clothing for their comfort.They found food and rest for their weary souls. .
