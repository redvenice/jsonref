The stark reality is that today this virulent new strain of the virus is very much on the rise and we need to act now to prevent a crisis that will unleash even more pain and anguish.\u0027A spokeswoman for the Department of Health said the Government would \u0027not hesitate to take actions necessary to protect local communities\u0027.England is edging closer towards a blanket shutdown after government efforts to reopen schools were thrown into disarray by Left-wing councils and teaching unions. Gavin Williamson confirmed on Friday that all London primary schools will remain shut to most pupils next week - rather than just those in certain boroughs as set out earlier in the week - but teaching unions say all schools should close for the next two weeks.Last night, the Department for Education said remote learning was \u0027a last resort\u0027 and classrooms should reopen \u0027wherever possible\u0027 with appropriate safety measures to help mitigate the risk of transmission.\u0027As we\u0027ve said, we will move to remote education as a last resort, with involvement of public health officials, in areas where infection and pressures on the NHS are highest,\u0027 the spokesperson said.Hundreds of new vaccination sites are due to be up and running this week as the NHS ramps up its immunisation programme with the newly approved Oxford University and AstraZeneca jab. Some 530,000 doses of the vaccine will be available for rollout across the UK from Monday and more than a million patients have already had their first dose of the PfizerBioNTech vaccine which was the first to be approved by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency. But Ofsted chief inspector Amanda Spielman said children\u0027s education cannot be \u0027furloughed\u0027 for months while vaccinations are rolled out and time absent from the classroom should be kept to an \u0027absolute minimum\u0027, the Sunday Telegraph reported.Children\u0027s Commissioner Anne Longfield told the newspaper that schools should be the last to close and first to open, when safe to do so, adding: \u0027I hope, for children and parents\u0027 sake, that is measured in days not weeks and I would be particularly keen for primaries to stay open if at all possible.\u0027 Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the vaccine roll-out was \u0027our great hope\u0027, adding: \u0027I want the Government to throw everything it can at this, harnessing the extraordinary talents of our NHS so we can be vaccinating at least two million Brits a week by the end of the month.\u0027  But, writing in the Sunday Mirror, he criticised \u0027a chaotic last minute U-turn on schools\u0027, adding: \u0027Confusion reigns among parents, teachers and pupils over who will be back in school tomorrow and who won\u0027t.\u0027General secretary of the National Education Union (NEU), Mary Bousted, said schools should stay closed for two weeks to \u0027break the chain\u0027 of transmission and prevent the NHS becoming overwhelmed.\u0027The union, which represents the majority of teachers, has advised its members it is not safe to return to classrooms on Monday.NAHT general secretary Paul Whiteman said the union had started preliminary steps in legal proceedings against the Department for Education, asking it to share its scientific data about safety and transmission rates.Unions have also called for the reopening of schools in Wales next week to be delayed with Laura Doel, director of school leaders\u0027 union NAHT Cymru, saying \u0027the latest data shows that in large parts of Wales, control of infection has been lost\u0027.From January 4, all London primary schools will be required to provide remote learning for two weeks to all children except vulnerable children and those of key workers, who will be allowed to attend.Mr Williamson said the January 1 decision to expand closures to the nine remaining London boroughs and the City of London was a \u0027last resort\u0027.Under the Government\u0027s initial plan, secondary schools and colleges were set to be closed to most pupils for the first two weeks of January, while primary schools within 50 local authorities in the south of England, including 23 London boroughs, were also told to keep their doors shut until January 18.Green Party-led Brighton and Hove City Council has advised primary schools in the Tier 4 area not to return in person, except for vulnerable children and those of key workers, until January 18 despite the Government\u0027s plan for most schools to open in person. Linda Bauld, a professor in public health at the University of Edinburgh, said transmission among primary school pupils was \u0027still very limited\u0027 while secondary school pupils, particularly older teenagers, can pass on the virus in the same way as adults.But health professionals have warned of growing pressure on services with Professor Andrew Goddard, president of the Royal College of Physicians, telling the BBC current case figures are \u0027fairly mild\u0027 compared to what is expected in a week\u0027s time."},{"url":null,"title":"Headteacher Berkshire tells parents not send children school amid soaring Covid cases","story":"Share this articleMarish Academy Trust executive head teacher tells parents they can keep their children at home -

There were obvious winners the Zoom app thrived another app called Houseparty was the biggest thing for all of two weeks before it was never heard of again. Amid all these crazes, however, a quietly unassuming communication tool also flourished – the small but mighty “voice note”.First introduced by WhatsApp in 2013, and later adopted by iMessage, Facebook and Instagram, the voice note – a short recorded message – became an instant success among millennials. Initially its rise was spoken of as a passing fad, but time has shown it has in fact become a major communicative asset. Seen by many as the perfect medium between phone calls, texts and unwanted voicemails, the voice note fits seamlessly into the modern world in a way that its cousins the phone call and voicemail do not. At some point in the past five years, “let me voice note you” has become one of my most-used phrases, as I try to explain something in detail and depth.Communication fatigue last year manifested itself like never before. The pandemic proved a challenging time for most, burnout was real, angst was high, and being “Zoomed out” became a very real thing. When at home (which for many of us was almost all the time), the desire to hear people but not necessarily see them grew how many of you were reminded that your Zoom camera was not on, after intentionally switching it off?The voice note proved itself to be the perfect pandemic companion. As people’s homes became their offices, the need for communication that respected boundaries became all the more important. Herein lies the genius of the voice note – it maintains intimacy, being able to hear that friendly voice, while not being intrusive.In an era of pressured fast replies, voice notes gave people their technological agency back and in lockdown, one of the most pressured periods in the modern age, this was essential. We have all been there: someone sends us a voice message and we simply don’t have the energy to play it. Thankfully voice note etiquette does not demand that people reply straight away the power lies with the recipient, who can play the voice note and reply to it in their own time. And unlike with voicemails, there’s no plodding automated procedure to go through to get to the messages. And you can keep them as long as you like, and go back to them in an instant. The joys of communicative flexibility! There is of course voice note etiquette that not all abide by, and I admit I have left a message or two longer than the one-minute mark.Technological connectivity naturally increased during lockdown, but this has not necessarily meant people have felt more connected – in fact, there has been a growth in the “loneliness epidemic”. According to the Mental Health Foundation, the lockdown left millions of people across Britain feeling increasingly isolated. Of course, no one is claiming that voice notes are complete remedies for loneliness, but one cannot deny the value of their uninhibited nature. The ability to convey tone, nuance, emotion and idiosyncrasies – to hear the shriek in a friend’s laugh, or the gasp of shock in a family member’s voice – these are things that any number of texts, even with emojis and gifs, cannot convey. The voice note, unlike written messages, leaves little room for misinterpretation what you hear is what you get. The unedited flow of a voice note permits a means of communication that feels more genuine to both participants.The pandemic also transformed the world of dating the app Bumble added a new feature, and the popularity of “voice-note dating” has risen. In a time of lockdown and social distancing, this seems to be a natural evolution in communicating romantically.Interestingly, this reliance on audio comfort and communication has fed into the success of the new audio app Clubhouse, which in many ways is the development of the voice note.As most of the country has entered the new year in tier 3 or tier 4, the lack of social activity looks set to continue for months. So if you’re not already using voice notes, the chances are that in 2021 they’ll be impossible to avoid."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/34f5e9b940b5faf2691d8cccfef00e87e25f6e69/0_0_3543_2124/master/3543.jpg?width=685\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4f8dcb1340e27d554c126a6141508d17 685w","title":"teachers in england how you are preparing for covid testing in your schools","story":"We would like to hear from teachers about the preparations being made in their schools, and from parents about the possibility of more homeschoolingAmid the debate about whether or not English schools should re-open in January after scientific advisors urged a delay to the start of the new term, it was announced that members of the armed forces will be deployed to support coronavirus testing operations for thousands of school and college students in England.We want to hear from teachers in England about how they are getting ready for testing in schools.

They said the argument for reopening amid high infection rates “does not stack up”.Education bosses in Newcastle, Gateshead and Manchester also said they would support primary schools that decide not to fully reopen. Some primary schools in Slough have confirmed they will not reopen this week  and Brighton and Hove city council has advised primary schools not to return in person, except for vulnerable or key workers’ children.The moves came as Labour called for a national lockdown within 24 hours, warning the virus was “out of control”. While stopping short of calling for all schools to close, the party’s leader Keir Starmer, said it was “inevitable” more would need to do so.His comments came after Johnson warned lockdown rules were “about to get tougher” and acknowledged that school closures could be part of measures to quell infections, as official figures showed another 54,990 laboratory-confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK and a further 454 deaths.But the prime minister also urged parents to send their children to primary schools this week: “I understand people’s anxieties but there is no doubt in my mind that schools are safe and that education is a priority.”Primary schoolchildren were due to return to classrooms starting on Monday in all but 60 high-infection “contingency” areas, which include all of London and large areas of Essex and Kent, as well as parts of East Sussex, Buckinghamshire and Hertfordshire.Secondary schools are due to stay closed this week to all but vulnerable children and those with parents who are key workers. They will only reopen next week for pupils in years 11 and 13 facing GCSE and A-level exams. They are expected to reopen more fully from 18 January.However, Gavin Williamson, the education secretary, said on Sunday that reopenings would only happen “in areas where we have not had to apply the contingency framework”, opening the door for secondary schools in more hard-hit areas to remain shut to the majority of pupils into the second half of January.The Department for Education is making preparations for more remote learning and said it expects to deliver more than 50,000 laptops and tablets to schools on Monday and more than 100,000 in total during the first week of term.A DfE spokesperson said: “Children’s education has consistently been a national priority, which is why we want classrooms to reopen wherever possible in the new term. Schools will continue to implement appropriate safety measures to help mitigate the risk of transmission. As we’ve said, we will move to remote education as a last resort, with involvement of public health officials, in areas where infection and pressures on the NHS are highest.”The government was criticised for failing to deliver on a promise to deliver laptops to disadvantaged children in the first lockdown.Councillor Garry Bridges, in charge of education at Manchester city council, stressed “the best place for children is to be in school” but said the current strategy of closing schools only in the south showed “a London-centred focus”.“We are not giving blanket advice to schools to remain closed currently but will work with inidual schools to make the right decision for their circumstances and support them in any way we can,” he said.Andy Burnham, the mayor of Greater Manchester, urged the government to allow “local flexibility” in deciding which schools to open to most pupils and to “let headteachers come to a balanced judgment based on what’s happening”.Ian Ward, the leader of Birmingham council, and Jayne Francis, the council member for education, told Williamson in a letter: “The new strain of the virus and the rising case levels in the city mean we are deeply concerned about the return of children to primary schools, special schools and alternative provision next week.”But the government pushed back on Sunday by refusing to allow Cumbria to keep its primary schools closed. Covid infections are doubling every four to five days in parts of the county and the council asked for approval to keep its primary schools closed for a fortnight.“This is disappointing news and I feel that this is the wrong decision for Cumbria and for our families and communities,” said Stewart Young, the council leader.The TUC criticised the government’s “last-minute” approach to schools reopening, and called on employers to offer furlough to all parents affected by closures. The organisation said it was concerned that not all bosses were aware that caring responsibilities were an acceptable reason to furlough, so many would have no choice but to take unpaid time off work to look after children, or leave jobs altogether.The uncertainty over school openings has been fuelled by starkly competing interests. The Children’s Commissioner for England, Anne Longfield, on Sunday issued a warning about children’s mental health and said new school closures marked “a serious moment for children”. She said any closures must be for “the absolute minimum of time” and called for teachers to be vaccinated “as a priority”.All four of England’s main teaching unions, including the National Education Union (NEU), the Association of School and College Leaders and the National Association of Head Teachers, have called for schools to remain closed to all but eligible pupils. The move is also backed by Unison and GMB, representing the majority of other school staff.“It is not good enough to always be behind the curve, playing catch up with new strains of Covid, seeing hospital admissions rise and cases numbers spiral out of control,” said Kevin Courtney, the joint general secretary of the NEU.The government has also been called upon to urgently rethink its approach to exams. Speaking on Sunday, Johnson suggested for the first time that A-levels and GCSEs may not take place in England this summer, telling Marr: “We’ve got to be realistic about the pace of which this new variant has spread … and we’ve got to be humble in the face of this virus.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a47dffb7396a2a1dca2680ec28fc18ff521256b2/0_19_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=31732a09b98b7a2c7100e10361139510","title":"animals ecology reclaim scotland abandoned landscapes a photo essay","story":"From a former airfield to a disused explosives factory, many of the country’s forgotten places are teeming with life as nature reinhabits abandoned manmade structuresby  Bella Bathurst photographs by  Murdo MacLeodSince the idea of rewilding took hold, it has generally been seen as a rural pursuit involving withdrawal from farmland so that animals and vegetation can restore their own ecology.At its most herbivorous, it includes allowing hedgerows or scrub to flourish unchecked. At its most primal, it involves deliberately releasing animals such as beavers or wolves in the belief that the re-entry of a single alpha species brings with it a cascade of ecological benefits.Either way, rewilding has come to be associated with big acreages, whether that be at Knepp Park in Sussex or at the 18,000-acre Glenfeshie estate in the Cairngorms. The perception is that it is expensive, far away and often inaccessible. It certainly isn’t something that just anyone can do.But what if the wildest places of all were right under our feet? In the forgotten spaces in our cities, rewilding has always happened naturally, , land falling under stone and resurging again, concrete lids flipped off before submerging once more. In the margins and the demilitarised zones, the abandoned embankments, the bits we don’t want or the lands already contaminated beyond human tolerance, ecology is thriving.In some places – such as the land around the abandoned Chernobyl nuclear plant in Ukraine – plant and insect life has adapted to the extreme conditions: boars have moved in, there is a new radiation-munching fungus and, in the thin strip of no-man’s land between the borders of North and South Korea, leopards and Asiatic black bears have been spotted. In the past century, Greenham Common in Berkshire has transformed from open heathland grazing to the home of US Trident missiles to an SSSI nature reserve with a weedy runway.In Scotland, the 40-mile strip between Glasgow and Edinburgh has always been mined, for not just coal, but stone, gravel, lead and even gold. After centuries of hard pickings, parts of Lanarkshire and Ayrshire have an upended appearance. What was underground is now on top and what was above has gone below, with buildings and bridges slumped over old drift mines and razor-lined spoil heaps terraced by extraction tracks. Wildfowl nest on lochs made from old coal holes and an orchid called Young’s helleborine, discovered in 1975, favours only the best iron ore.The Ardeer peninsula in Ayrshire is home to the unusually bracing combination of a nudist beach and an explosives factory once owned and operated by the Alfred Nobel Company. Parts of the site are still in use, but most of the 330-acre site was long ago abandoned. Along the cracks in the old pipelines and through the decaying buildings, it would be quicker to list the native plants that are no longer there than those that are.In theory, industry and mining companies are supposed to follow restoration plans for abandoned sites, but in practice they often plead poverty. Besides, ecologists sometimes find themselves ensnared in a paradox. Public feeling is that big business should be obliged to make good what it has taken, but human attempts to restore land are often amateurish. Planting a few conifers and flinging around a mix of wildflowers may be a quick fix, but sometimes it appears that the best thing to do is nothing.The M74 motorway runs up the front of Scotland past new windfarms and second world war PoW camps. Not far from Broken Cross, Europe’s largest opencast coal mine, there’s Castle Dangerous. In 1913 the 13th Earl of Home tried to lift local unemployment at Douglas by allowing mining nearby. The mining unseated the castle, it was demolished, and the flooded workings (known locally as the Black Hole) are now so patterned with commuting birdlife that it resembles an avian Heathrow.Further up the motorway, near Port Glasgow, the old timber ponds attract birds of a seaborne kind. The ponds are shallow estuarine mudflats ided by ancient wooden stakes (or stabs) and were once used to grade and store logs for shipbuilding. It is an atmospheric place, the stabs shrouded in black weed like cartoon ghouls while beyond them the lights of Dunbarton shine over the water. Poking around in the mud and sunken tyres I hear a curlew for the first time this year, its song for an instant rhyming with an ambulance siren.On the other side of the Clyde, between the Erskine Bridge and the old John Brown shipyard, lies what used to be the Beardmore naval construction works in Dalmuir. In the early 20th century it produced munitions, planes, submarines and warships before being converted into a fuel-supply depot and then being gradually abandoned.Now a cycle path runs through it, but otherwise there is nothing new here except nature: golden leaves of birch springing from the concrete jetty, hawkweed drifting Ophelia-like in the drowned oil storage tanks, wrens nesting in the rusted embankments, mallards cackling from the blackthorn scrub. “Have you seen the deer?” asks a dog walker. There are two, apparently – one red, one roe, both favouring the grazing just beneath the giant electricity pylon.Dalmuir is beautiful, dangerous – and almost certainly contaminated. Like many of the other sites, it has always been used by more than just squirrels and crows. Since industry retreated it has been a flytip, a heroin shooting gallery and probably a place to dispose of worse things than just old mattresses.Halflands like these can be among the most joyous and optimistic places on earth, but they can also carry with them a polluting sense of menace. Finding them means that you may end up meandering across an indeterminate line between a walk in the park and full-scale urban exploration you explore at your own risk. Some places encourage public interest and others, despite Scotland’s differing access laws, discourage it.They also have a habit of vanishing. Brownfield sites tend to be classified as wasteland, and with the pressure on housing, they are first in line for redevelopment. Ardeer is intended for “regeneration” and Dalmuir will shortly be dug up to make way for the Scottish Marine Technology Park, a deepwater ship hoist and a new small-vessel fabrication yard. Malin Group, which owns the site, says it will create 600 short-term jobs and give a multimillion-pound boost to the local economy, which it claims is “sure to bring back to life this area of the river”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d7627e3ed5564a3ced07b961ac5cf4144cc4e109/0_207_4956_2973/master/4956.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=0a102cd1a9001183e1bf23672a6b0582","title":"frank lampard chelsea manchester city","story":"Frank Lampard insisted he does not feel his job is under threat after an insipid performance in a 3-1 home defeat by Manchester City left him under mounting pressure with Chelsea in eighth place.Pep Guardiola’s side scored thrice before half-time without reply and will move to within a point of the leaders, Liverpool, if they win their game in hand. But Chelsea are way adrift in the title race after a fourth defeat in six matches, despite spending more than £200m in the summer.“I expected periods of difficulties this year because it doesn’t come that easily,” Lampard said. “Whether that puts pressure on me is regardless because a month ago everyone was asking whether I will be signing a new contract. In quick succession over a tight and busy period we have lost four games of football so the pressure remains constant in this job. My job is to try and lift the players so they can match the levels that Manchester City showed today.”Roman Abramovich, the Chelsea owner, has been swift to sack managers in the past, not least when he feels Champions League qualification may be in danger. The club are three points off fourth place but have played at least a game more than all but one of the sides above them.Chelsea went unbeaten for 14 matches earlier in the season but Lampard said his team were a work in progress compared with Guardiola’s.“When City turned up the heat in the first half, our players didn’t react for the goal,” he said. “I think that is a confidence issue but this is the level we want to get to.“We’re in a tough period at the moment – I played here for a long time so I understand that the minute you lose a few games in a short period of time, then everyone asks questions. The expectations are different this year because we spent a lot of money but this club has to take some pain to get where we want to get to … I’ll always feel heat. I felt heat when we were on our good run, because I know that round the corner can be a negative.”City face Manchester United in a Carabao Cup semi-final on Wednesday and Guardiola is delighted with their recent resurgence. “The way we won leagues and titles and other things is the way we played today,” he said. “The tempo we have missed in the past, today we recovered it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5ffcff6cb0e454ec3b1d191ae71d1a05704f1a79/0_0_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d86699972f9efd19d3642ce87c7e0847","title":"jurgen klopp premier league liverpool title race","story":"Jürgen Klopp has acknowledged this season’s title race is too close to call and seems likely to go to the wire.“This season is a tough one for the supporters,” said Liverpool’s manager as he prepared to take his defending champions to Southampton on Monday night. “If you are a neutral you will love it. Our season so far is good but I’m not surprised it is this close. This year is tough.Liverpool lead Manchester United on goal difference before the match against Southampton, and a host of clubs are within touching distance of the top.Thiago Alcântara, following a highly encouraging cameo performance after stepping off the bench in the 0-0 draw at Newcastle last Wednesday, is in contention to begin influencing Liverpool’s fortunes for the better by potentially starting at Southampton.The Spain creative midfielder has made only three Premier League appearances for Liverpool since arriving from Bayern Munich, with a positive Covid-19 test, followed by a knee injury, limiting his availability.With Virgil van Dijk likely to miss the majority of the second half of the season – if not all of it – after anterior cruciate ligament surgery in October, Joe Gomez likely to be sidelined until late spring by the after-effects of another knee operation and Joël Matip expected to miss Liverpool’s next four games with groin trouble, Klopp is desperately short of central defensive options.At Newcastle he fielded the versatile, but out-of-position, Fabinho and the inexperienced Nathaniel Phillips at the heart of his back four but Klopp – who also has the 19-year-old centre-back Rhys Williams in his squad – indicated he was unlikely to sign cover during the current transfer window and preferred to promote from within.Southampton will be without goalkeeper Alex McCarthy for the visit of Liverpool after he tested positive for Covid-19. The 31-year-old is self-isolating."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4b7f095ffa3aa71daf13dc7dafee8921d94a21fa/0_70_3000_1801/master/3000.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=27e852d771cf4c36313155863195b046","title":"today in focus revisited a cure for insomnia podcast","story":"Like a growing number of people, Simon Parkin suffered from insomnia for years.

So, I say, bring in those restrictions now, national restrictions, within the next 24 hours. That has to be the first step to controlling the virus.”On Sunday, the UK recorded 454 Covid deaths that had taken place within 28 days of a positive test, bringing the official coronavirus death toll over 75,000. Government figures also showed there were a further 54,990 Covid infections – the sixth day in a row the number was above 50,000.Earlier, Johnson said he was “fully reconciled” to potentially having to “do things in the next few weeks that will be tougher”, and that coronavirus curbs were “probably about to get tougher”.Nearly eight in 10 people in England are already under tier 4 “stay at home” measures, which include the closure of non-essential shops and strict one-to-one outdoor meeting limits between households, but Johnson suggested stricter restrictions could be introduced.Asked whether it may be necessary to introduce tougher, “tier 5” restrictions in the near future, Johnson told BBC One’s The Andrew Marr Show: “It may be that we need to do things in the next few weeks that will be tougher in … many parts of the country … I’m fully, fully reconciled to that. And I bet the people of this country are reconciled to that.”Speaking later on Sunday, Starmer said there should be no delay. “We can’t allow the prime minister to use up the next two or three weeks and then bring in the national lockdown that is inevitable. Do it now. That’s the necessary first step to get the virus back under control.”Despite warning of stricter measures on the horizon, and in the face of pressure from education unions, the prime minister separately urged parents to send their children into primary schools on Monday in areas of the country where they were still set to open. The prospect of vaccines being rolled out in their “tens of millions” should keep people going through a “bumpy” period, Johnson added.Starmer said: “Everybody wants children back in schools. Nobody would argue with that. Of course that’s what we all want.“I don’t want to call for the closure of schools tomorrow morning and add to the chaos, but we do need to recognise that it’s inevitable that more schools will close, and we need a plan in place to deal with that. But it can only be part of a wider strategy that has a national lockdown in place in the next 24 hours. The prime minister is hinting at it, but he’s not doing it. And we can’t afford that delay again.”Starmer said he was not calling for all schools to close, explaining that should be the “last resort, not the first resort”. In an apparent reference to tier 3 areas where non-essential shops were still allowed to open, he added: “We can’t have retail open in some places and schools closed.” Sir Mark Walport, who sits on the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) and was formerly the UK government’s chief scientific adviser, said it was “pretty clear” that more restrictions would be needed to reduce transmission of the virus. It is understood that Labour wants the government to consider March-style lockdown measures, including a clearer stay-at-home message, as well as a re-evaluation regarding non-essential services that are open.Responding to Starmer’s intervention, a No 10 source said: “The prime minister has been consistently clear that we are driven by the need to protect the NHS and save lives – unlike Labour who have spent the last 10 months playing party politics. We have moved more areas into tier 4 to bear down on the new variant and escalated other areas into tier 3. This targeted approach is the right one, and is kept under review based on the latest data.”Leaders in Liverpool, which is in tier 3, have also called on Downing Street to impose a national lockdown. The acting mayor, Wendy Simon, and the city council’s cabinet say action is needed to address rising Covid cases, which have reached “alarming levels”.“So yes, everybody in the NHS is really very clear that we need to have appropriate restrictions in place.”Scotland’s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, said her cabinet would meet on Monday morning to discuss “further action” to prevent the spread of Covid before she sets out decisions to a recalled Holyrood."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c9ce28a810617a758e7e98ab04e82f36184919ca/1605_0_1795_1079/master/1795.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4bb3d583b5f4c6f0d090add1aedd0526","title":"uk carmakers have three years to source local electric car batteries","story":"UK carmakers face a three-year scramble to source electric car batteries locally or from the EU to avoid tariffs on exports following the Brexit free trade deal, according to industry analysts.The Christmas Eve deal means that all UK-EU trade in cars and parts will continue to be free of tariffs or quotas after the the Brexit transition period ended on Friday, as long as they contain enough content from either UK or EU factories. The deal came as a major relief to the embattled car industry.The rules mean it will be vital for UK carmakers to secure a battery supply from the the EU or the UK, said Mike Hawes, the SMMT’s chief executive. The deal makes it “imperative that the UK secures at pace investment in battery gigafactories and electrified supply chains”, he said.Ian Henry, whose AutoAnalysis consultancy works with a number of major carmakers, said one key issue in preserving the UK car industry was creating an entire supply chain, including manufacturing important and chemically complicated parts such as the cathodes crucial to lithium-ion batteries.“By the mid-2020s, the UK has got to be doing a lot more than just assembling bits from a kit,” said Henry. “Several core processes in battery manufacturing will have to take place here in order for the UK to have a viable electric vehicle industry.”The vast majority of batteries used in UK and EU electric cars are sourced from east Asian companies such as China’s CATL, Korea’s LG Chem or Japan’s Panasonic. However, European carmakers and governments are pouring billions of euros into new battery plants, with at least 10 credible efforts under way from companies including Sweden’s Northvolt and the French oil major Total, according to data company LMC Automotive.The UK is lagging behind, with no fully funded plans to begin battery production in Britain, despite the promise of government funding and industry support for British “gigafactories” capable of large-scale battery production. The government-backed Faraday Institution this year said a failure to build a UK battery supply chain could cost more than 100,000 jobs by 2040.The Brexit deal was welcomed by the startup Britishvolt, which is the only company with public plans to build a gigafactory in the UK. Britishvolt last month bought rights to a site in Blyth, Northumberland, where it plans to build a factory, subject to fundraising.The Brexit deal’s provisions fit perfectly with Britishvolt’s ambitious plans to start battery production at scale by the end of 2023. It hopes to start building the plant in the summer. A spokesman said the deal would allow it to serve both the UK’s domestic automotive industry and carmakers in Europe."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/352ee47384e9443776e7037f652a24a64119866c/4_754_1653_992/master/1653.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=b4729548f0b64e31ab56cc7bb0df00c5","title":"bullied back into the office why managers need to avoid putting pressure on staff to return","story":"It can be counterproductive for businesses to add to their employees’ anxieties during the Covid pandemic. Here’s how companies can put their employees’ mental health firstJill was on her way back from a funeral in September, when the message from her line manager arrived in her inbox. It explained that the insurance company she works for had decided that staff needed to begin returning to the office to help keep the business functioning.“It was very uncomfortable as I have two children with underlying health conditions,” she says. “If they got sick, it could be deadly, but my manager was adamant that I needed to return.”With the Covid-19 pandemic set to stretch into 2021, managers can perhaps be forgiven for growing impatient with the disruption posed by remote working. In a bid to get back to a sense of normality, it can be all too easy to unwittingly pressure staff to return to the office, regardless of government advice for people to work from home where possible.Well-meaning encouragement can be misinterpreted by anxious employees as overt pressure. And that pressure can spread through different departments and teams, quickly evolving into a new kind of workplace bullying. There have been a spate of incidents in the UK in which bosses have been accused of bullying staff to return to the office.This highlights the importance of properly supporting employees’ psychological safety as well as their physical safety. “Employers should take on any Covid related queries and try to support their employees as much as possible,” says psychiatrist Sarmila Sinha. “Don’t play down the risk of the Covid pandemic, and make the safety of the employee a priority.”Still, well-meaning actions can be felt as pressure, intimidation, and shaming. While management emails may say no one should feel under pressure to return to the office, this message is effectively contradicted by remarks made during video call meetings – or by managers’ social media posts that applaud those who “bravely” come into HQ. Managers may even reward those who come into the office with one-to-one lunches or meetings that basically function as career discussions, while neglecting to hold video-call equivalents for those working remotely.Mental health professionals point out that this subtle bullying can be counterproductive from a business perspective, as well as being a failure of corporate responsibility. Many workers are already struggling under the economic pressures of the pandemic, so when managers trigger even more anxiety, remote employees can find it harder to focus – thus undermining the practice of remote working and setting off a vicious cycle. Research has long shown there are strong business reasons for employers to take the mental wellbeing of their staff into account, given that healthy employees are more engaged, more productive, and have much lower rates of sickness absence.Employers need to have a healthy dialogue with their staff about working practices in the short to medium term, taking into account each employee’s home circumstances. Some might be living with people in at-risk groups. Others may be struggling with isolation and may actually welcome the opportunity to return to the office.“As an employer, it’s important not to make assumptions about how staff feel about working remotely or returning to their workplace, and remember everyone’s situation is different,” says Faye McGuinness, head of workplace wellbeing programmes at the mental health charity, Mind. “Offer phased returns, or the option of working from home more regularly. You may have to consider options that make journeys into work safer, such as adjustments to working hours. Regularly surveying staff and asking for anonymous feedback is a great way to identify themes and concerns.”McGuinness says it is crucial for employers to make sure staff feel that their voices are being heard regarding any plans to reopen the workspace. Instead of directly asking them whether they want to be in the office or not, a more empathetic approach is to task questions such as: “Do you feel like you need to stay at home in order to be safe right now?” or “Do you feel like you are getting what you need from us in order to do your job?”Software company ServiceNow offers a Safe Workplace Suite of applications to help companies plan a safe return to the office. This includes an Employee Readiness Survey, which helps gauge which staff are ready to go back to their workplace by taking account of their views and assessing their physical and mental health.But holding responsible conversations around workplace location is just one aspect of helping employees with their emotional and psychological wellbeing, particularly as new lockdown mandates are put into place.As a guide for both business leaders and employees, Mind recommends these five ways to wellbeing – connect, be active, take notice, keep learning, and give. Each encompasses evidence-based ways for thinking about mental health both inside and outside of work.Over the past seven months, ServiceNow has implemented similar mental wellness strategies in a remote working environment. “We feel that attending to our employee wellbeing and mental health is more important now than ever,” says Laurent Briant, director of government programmes for ServiceNow’s NextGen programme. “This is a marathon and not a sprint.” Briant says that ServiceNow pays particular attention to the risk of employee burnout, using automated reminders to encourage employees to take regular breaks during the working day and emphasising the need for employees to use their annual leave and prioritise self-care.Sinha agrees on the importance of work-life balance when working from home. “Often employees working remotely feel obliged to work without taking their annual leave or asking for a day off,” she says. “Senior managers and supervisors can offer support to address burnout by reviewing employees’ working hours and ensuring staff are taking breaks while remotely working.”ServiceNow has rolled out a range of programmes aimed at promoting good mental health, including virtual socials to help people feel connected to online workshops offering practical guidance for parents. Central to all this is an understanding that every person’s working environment is different, and that flexibility – both in working hours and when employees are able to be available – is crucial to avoiding burnout and managing the stresses of daily life.One last, critical key to successfully address mental health issues in the workplace is to identify and take responsibility for the source of the problem. “The biggest problem we have regarding mental health issues in the workplace is our tendency to think of these conditions as something to do with the inidual,” says James Wallace, an academic at Swansea University who researches mental health in the workplace. “Rather than thinking about why they might have these experiences, for example because they’re overworked or they have a poor relationship with their boss.”While offering counselling services to employees is a start, Wallace encourages business leaders to look more deeply within the company culture to identify the root cause. “Unless employers are willing to accept that they have a responsibility for the working conditions of employees and make efforts to try to improve these conditions where necessary,” Wallace says, “then we are likely to continue to see employee burnout increase.”The ServiceNow Safe Workplace Suite offers tools for organisations to deliver the right digital experience for each phase of reopening. Including engaging with employees in advance, automating steps for returning, and providing a safe, employee‑ready working environment.

Men I dare not name. The first man I ever had sex with. A man I loved for three months in 1988. That hilarious friend I spent a mad week with in Glasgow. All of them dead, now. And they all died of Aids.But I can’t say their names because their families said they died of cancer or pneumonia. And they maintain that story to this day. Even now, I’ve had to change a few details in those opening sentences, just in case. The stigma and fear of Aids was so great that a family could go through the funeral, the wake and then decades of mourning without saying what really happened.A virus had jumped species, probably from chimpanzees. But we couldn’t have known that, back in the 1980s. So as the decade unfolded and HIV proliferated, we had to cope with terror and anger but also, more insidiously, sheer disbelief. An illness? Which attacks gay men only? A gay plague?! Impossible! (And yes, I know, it can infect anyone, but forgive me a middle-aged gay man’s perspective. At the time, if felt like it was targeted at us.)The hysteria quickly caught fire, because fake news, false facts and conspiracy theories weren’t invented in 2020. They ran riot with Aids in the 1980s. If you think the internet is to blame for misinformation, I can guarantee the problem existed long before I even had an electric typewriter.It’s hard to look back and reconstruct how information was spread in those early days, ’81, ’82, before the tabloids got hold of the story. Rumours. Mutterings. Whispers from America. Chat in the dark corners of pubs. A few brave activists photocopying what little information they had the photocopied sheets you ignore when out clubbing. I can remember the exact moment I took it seriously for the first time. June 1983, I was a student in Oxford. I went to buy milk, 20 Bensons, and my proud passport into adult life, the monthly copy of Him magazine. Except I wasn’t that proud and shuffled it under a copy of the Mirror. I didn’t actually look at it until I was walking home. And I stopped. Right there. On Juxon Street. Blazing sunshine. I stared at the headline. “Aids Gay Death-Plot Panic.” The words emblazoned across a brilliant and erotic drawing of naked men boiling to death in a test tube, drawn by the artist Oliver Frey.Oh, I thought, it’s real. That story. It’s true.I wonder if that magazine saved my life.Even then, the truth was surrounded by nonsense. That headline called it a plot, because that’s what everyone said – the virus was created by the Russians, the Chinese, the Americans, it had escaped from some villainous hi-tech secret laboratories (sound familiar?), it was sent by God to strike down the sinners. It was said, impossibly, that it affected only homosexuals, Haitians and haemophiliacs, like it only went for people beginning with the letter H. Ridiculous! Surely? How could that be true?It’s said that ignorance kills. But sometimes we die because we’re so bloody smart.Then the tabloids took control, and the screaming started. In 1983, the Sun declared: “US Gay Blood Plague Kills Three in Britain.” This had escalated by 1986 into: “I’d Shoot My Son if He Had Aids, Says Vicar.” (For the record, that’s the Rev Robert Simpson of Barmston, Humberside. Although in fairness, his son, “Bewildered Chris”, did add: “Sometimes I think he would like to shoot me whether I had Aids or not.”) Then showbiz added a ghastly glitter. Rock Hudson was declared to be dying from Aids, and the whole country, me included, engaged in an awful, vicious, gleeful game, staring at Dynasty to see if he kissed Linda Evans, hoping for a string of saliva to condemn him. And when Liberace died in 1987 – the result of a watermelon diet, said his staff – a helicopter chased and filmed his coffin being taken to the autopsy.Far away from the glamour, men were sacked and bullied and hated. And the jokes began. I can remember seeing a joke I won’t repeat about dead gay men on a noticeboard at work, in an advert for the Christmas charity raffle. And no one complained.I certainly didn’t. I just keep my head down and let it happen around me. History is written by the activists – I look with awe at the fury which drove Larry Kramer. In 1983, he wrote an article for the New York Native, “1,112 and Counting”, which radicalised the entire debate, and then in 1985 he wrote that astonishing howl of pain, The Normal Heart (to be revived at the National Theatre later this year).But me? I looked away. Oh, I went on marches and gave a bit of money and said how sad it was, but really, I couldn’t quite look at it. This impossible thing. There are boys whose funerals I didn’t attend. Letters I didn’t write. Parents I didn’t see. Late last year, I bumped into the father of a good friend who’d died in 1992. We chatted, politely, hopelessly, and I flailed around, wondering how to apologise after all this time for not going to the funeral. But then I realised it hardly mattered. No one went. The shame had been so great that they only had 25 people for a lovely, lively lad, dead by 28.They were comparatively lucky to have had a funeral at all. Back then, there were undertakers who refused to handle the bodies. Crematoriums that turned people away in case their staff were contaminated. Some lonely funerals happened at night, so no one could see.I kept typing, just doing my job, while the situation escalated, both in Parliament and on the streets. The government released its infamous Aids advert, all tombstones and icebergs, with John Hurt gravely intoning the warning: “It is a deadly disease and there is no known cure.” As a result, Margaret Thatcher made a whole generation of gay men scared of sex, which was probably a bonus for her. And up north, the chief constable of Greater Manchester, James Anderton, announced that homosexuals were “swirling around in a cesspool of their own making”. (He also advocated the return of corporal punishment, saying “I’d thrash some criminals myself, most surely”, which is perhaps revealing a little too much. And just like the Rev Robert Simpson, he was upstaged by his own child when his daughter came out as a lesbian.)While the Andertons of this world shouted out loud, the haemophilia scandal was happening in silence. Around 5,000 patients with bleeding disorders were infected by contaminated clotting factors. The horror is still being unearthed to this day, with the public inquiry initiated by Theresa May in 2017 still ongoing.But back in the 80s, amazing work was being done by unsung and unfunded crusaders. In 1985, a man with Aids was actually imprisoned within a British hospital, the Monsall in Crumpsall. At the request of the man’s consultant, a court order was granted to lock the door and refuse him the right to leave. The case became one of the first activist uprisings. Gay groups organised and campaigned. Ten days later, the order was withdrawn. The fightback was just beginning.I stayed busy, looking away, but I suppose I also looked down. At the keyboard. And stories began to emerge in my work. Rising up. Bleeding through the page. In 1994, I created a 15-year-old HIV+ teenager for Children’s Ward at Granada Television. Then, after I’d invented a raft of gay characters for various soaps – a lesbian vicar, schoolboy lovers, a gay barman in 1920 – I came to invent Queer As Folk in 1999. Britain’s first gay drama. And the words HIV and Aids were said… not once.That was quite a press launch. The rage, the shouting! Two hundred journalists in full pomp. The straight press were as hostile as you’d expect, but the gay press were especially furious because we had no condoms, no warnings, no messages on screen. Well, yes, tough. Because by that stage, in 1999, I refused to let our lives be defined by disease. So I excluded it on purpose. The omission of Aids was a statement in itself, and it was the right thing to do.In truth, the virus does tick away in the background of QAF. There are charity nights, a fleeting mention of a dead friend, and in one episode, a character has a one-night stand which results in his death. It’s caused by an overdose, but the man he hooks up with is called Harvey. I said to the producer, Nicola Shindler, “Harvey? D’you get it? Har-vee, like HIV.” She said, “Don’t be so pretentious. Never tell anyone that.”The subject crept closer to the surface. In 2015, I wrote a series called Cucumber, in which Vincent Franklin gives a brilliant, brutal performance as Henry, a middle-aged man just beginning to work out why he’s so scared of intimacy, of love, of sex. Of himself. “Those bloody icebergs,” he mutters in episode five, giving away more than he realises.Finally, I came to write a show with Aids centre stage. I think I had to wait till now, to find what I wanted to say. Over the years, I’d admired many magnificent pieces on the subject: Angels in America, Pose, Pride, Holding the Man, 120 Beats Per Minute  and it was a privilege to leave a West End theatre with the audience heartily sobbing, after Matthew Lopez’s The Inheritance. But I needed to slalom my way around this stuff, to find my own path.I talked to experts and consultants and charities, but mainly, I went back home. To my friend Jill. We’ve known each other since we were 14, daft camp kids belonging to a wonderful youth theatre in West Glamorgan which was accidentally, brilliantly, the safest gay space imaginable. As we grew up, I went to university, got a job, started to write, but Jill lived a bigger, better life. She went to London. Became an actor. She moved into a flat which she called the Pink Palace, and it felt like an endless party, the rooms filled with gay men and drag queens and show tunes. Jill met the crisis head on. She stood at the heart of the storm. She went to the hospitals and the funerals and the marches. She held the hands of so many men. She lost them, and remembered them, and somehow kept going.So I’ve written a drama with a woman called Jill living in a Pink Palace. And my Jill now plays the fictional Jill’s mother. Like it was meant to be.I sifted through her thousand stories – a strange thing to do with an old friend, to say “Tell me your life.” The things I never knew! But slowly, the drama took shape, inspired by one story she’d first told me way back in the 90s. A story which had haunted me for decades. A man I knew, too. With a horror story at the heart of it a man whose parents didn’t know anything until they turned up at the hospital to discover he was gay, he had Aids, he was dying, all in one moment.And he’s another man whose name I can’t say. I asked Jill about his family. “Still angry,” she said. After all these years.I hope we’ve done him justice. That beautiful boy.But the fight goes on. The stigma still exists. Today, I’m honoured to be patron of the George House Trust in Manchester, and the staff tell stories every day of the same old ignorance and fear. Just last month, a friend of mine was attempting to adopt a child and had his HIV status mentioned in court, for no good reason, three times. And in 2019, the rugby star Gareth Thomas was forced to reveal that he’s HIV+ after a tabloid reporter doorstepped his parents and told them his status.And yet, at the same time, the world turns and life moves on. The growing success of antiretroviral medication means that, perhaps, an end is in sight. A deadly disease is becoming a manageable condition. There’s now an ambitious United Nations campaign dedicated to ending HIV transmission by 2030.Strange to think. That it might come and go within my lifetime. That a virus can be a moment in history and no more. I wonder. It’s possible that one day, HIV and Aids might just be a memory. A story. Like some old drama that was once on TV.It’s a Sin starts on Channel 4 in late January"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dee121bbf5fead938c6c3e33e0c4b9aa9ab81f53/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=92a7df600535086df7ffa5014fde3c52","title":"staged bbc anna lundberg georgia tennant david michael sheen scenes with all four of us usually involved alcohol","story":"The hit BBC sitcom Staged started when actors and friends David Tennant and Michael Sheen began messing about on Zoom. On the eve of series two, we talk to their scene-stealing partnersNot many primetime TV hits are filmed by the show’s stars inside their own homes. However, 2020 wasn’t your average year. During the pandemic, productions were shut down and workarounds had to be found – otherwise the terrestrial schedules would have begun to look worryingly empty. Staged was the surprise comedy hit of the summer.This playfully meta short-form sitcom, airing in snack-sized 15-minute episodes, found A-list actors Michael Sheen and David Tennant playing an exaggerated version of themselves, bickering and bantering as they tried to perfect a performance of Luigi Pirandello’s Six Characters in Search of an Author over Zoom.Having bonded while co-starring in Good Omens, Amazon’s TV adaptation of Neil Gaiman and Terry Pratchett’s novel, Sheen, 51, and Tennant, 49, became best buddies in real life. In Staged, though, they’re comedically reframed as frenemies – warm, matey and collaborative, but with a cut-throat competitiveness lurking just below the surface. As they grew ever more hirsute and slobbish in lockdown, their virtual relationship became increasingly fraught.It was soapily addictive and hilariously thespy, while giving a voyeuristic glimpse of their interior decor and domestic lives – with all the action viewed through their webcams.Yet it was the supporting cast who lifted Staged to greatness,Their director Simon Evans, forced to dance around the pair’s fragile egos and piggy-in-the-middle of their feuds. Steely producer Jo, played by Nina Sosanya, forever breaking off from calls to bellow at her poor, put-upon PA. And especially the leading men’s long-suffering partners, both actors in real life, Georgia Tennant and Anna Lundberg.Georgia Tennant comes from showbiz stock, as the child of Peter Davison and Sandra Dickinson. At 36 she is an experienced actor and producer, who made her TV debut in Peak Practice aged 15. She met David on Doctor Who 2008, when she played the Timelord’s cloned daughter Jenny. Meanwhile, the Swedish Lundberg, 26, is at the start of her career. She left drama school in New York two years ago and Staged is her first big on-screen role.Married for nine years, the Tennants have five children and live in west London. The Lundberg-Sheens have been together two years, have a baby daughter, Lyra, and live outside Port Talbot in south Wales. On screen and in real life, the women have become firm friends and frequent scene-stealers.Staged proved so successful that it’s now back for a second series. We set up a video call with Tennant and Lundberg to discuss lockdown life, wine consumption, home schooling (those two may be related) and the blurry line between fact and fiction…Was doing Staged a big decision, because it’s so personal and set in your homes?Georgia Tennant: We’d always been a very private couple. Staged was everything we’d never normally say yes to. Suddenly, our entire house is on TV and so is a version of the relationship we’d always kept private. But that’s the way to do it, I guess. Go to the other extreme. Just rip off the Band-Aid.Anna Lundberg: Michael decided pretty quickly that we weren’t going to move around the house at all. All you see is the fireplace in our kitchen.GT: We have five children, so it was just about which room was available. AL: But it’s not the real us. It’s not a documentary.GT: Although some people think it is.Which fictional parts of the show do people mistake for reality?GT: People think I’m really a novelist because “Georgia” writes a novel in Staged. They’ve asked where they can buy my book. I should probably just write one now because I’ve done the marketing already.AL: People worry about our elderly neighbour, who gets hospitalised in the show. She doesn’t actually exist in real life but people have approached Michael in Tesco’s, asking if she’s OK.Michael and David squabble about who’s billed first in Staged. Does that reflect real life?AL: With Good Omens, Michael’s name was first for the US market and David’s was first for the British market. So those scenes riffed on that.Should we call you Georgia and Anna, or Anna and Georgia?GT: Either. We’re super-laidback about these things.How well did you know each other before Staged?GT: We barely knew each other. We’ve now forged a friendship by working on the show together.AL: We’d met once, for about 20 minutes. We were both pregnant at the time – we had babies a month apart – so that was pretty much all we talked about.Did you tidy up before filming?AL: We just had to keep one corner relatively tidy.GT: I’m quite a tidy person, but I didn’t want to be one of those annoying Instagram people with perfect lives. So strangely, I had to add a bit of mess… dot a few toys around in the background. I didn’t want to be one of those insufferable people – even though, inherently, I am one of those people.Was there much photobombing by children or pets?AL: In the first series, Lyra was still at an age where we could put her in a baby bouncer. Now that’s not working at all. She’s just everywhere. Me and Michael don’t have many scenes together in series two, because one of us is usually Lyra-wrangling.GT: Our children aren’t remotely interested. They’re so unimpressed by us. There’s one scene where Doris, our five-year-old, comes in to fetch her iPad. She doesn’t even bother to glance at what we’re doing.How was lockdown for you both?AL: I feel bad saying it, but it was actually good for us. We were lucky enough to be in a big house with a garden. For the first time since we met, we were in one place. We could just focus on Lyra . To see her grow over six months was incredible. She helped us keep a steady routine, too.GT: Ours was similar. We never spend huge chunks of time together, so it was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. At least until David’s career goes to shit and he’s just sat at home. The flipside was the bleakness. Being in London, there were harrowing days when everything was silent but you’d just hear sirens going past, as a reminder that something awful was going on. So I veered between “This is wonderful” and “This is the worst thing that ever happened.”And then there was home schooling…GT: Which was genuinely the worst thing that ever happened.You’ve spent a lot of time on video calls, clearly. What are your top Zooming tips?GT: Raise your camera to eye level by balancing your laptop on a stack of books. And invest in a ring light.AL: That’s why you look so much better. We just have our sad kitchen light overhead, which makes us look like one massive shiny forehead.There’s a running gag in series one about the copious empties in Michael’s recycling. Did you lean into lockdown boozing in real life?AL: Not really. We eased off when I was pregnant and after Lyra was born. We’d just have a glass of wine with dinner.GT: Yes, definitely. I often reach for a glass of red in the show, which was basically just an excuse to continue drinking while we were filming: “I think my character would have wine and cake in this scene.” The time we started drinking would creep slightly earlier. “We’ve finished home schooling, it’s only 4pm, but hey…” We’ve scaled it back to just weekends now.How did you go about creating your characters with the writer Simon Evans?AL: He based the dynamic between David and Michael on a podcast they did together. Our characters evolved as we went along.GT: I was really kind and understanding in the first draft. I was like “I don’t want to play this, it’s no fun.” From the first few tweaks I made, Simon caught onto the vibe, took that and ran with it.Did you struggle to keep a straight face at times?AL: Yes, especially the scenes with all four of us, when David and Michael start improvising.GT: I was just drunk, so I have no recollection.AL: Scenes with all four of us were normally filmed in the evening, because that’s when we could be child-free. Usually there was alcohol involved, which is a lot more fun.GT: There’s a long scene in series two where we’re having a drink. During each take, we had to finish the glass. By the end, we were all properly gone. I was rewatching it yesterday and I was so pissed.What else can you tell us about series two?GT: Everyone’s in limbo. Just as we think things are getting back to normal, we have to take three steps back again. Everyone’s dealing with that differently, shall we say.AL: In series one, we were all in the same situation. By series two, we’re at different stages and in different emotional places.GT: Hollywood comes calling, but things are never as simple as they seem.There were some surprise big-name cameos in series one, with Samuel L Jackson and Dame Judi Dench suddenly Zooming in. Who can we expect this time around?AL: We can’t name names, but they’re very exciting.GT: Because series one did so well, and there’s such goodwill towards the show, we’ve managed to get some extraordinary people involved. This show came from playing around just to pass the time in lockdown. It felt like a GCSE end-of-term project. So suddenly, when someone says: “Samuel L Jackson’s in”, it’s like: “What the fuck’s just happened?”AL: It took things to the next level, which was a bit scary.GT: It suddenly felt like: “Some people might actually watch this.”How are David and Michael’s hair and beard situations this time?AL: We were in a toyshop the other day and Lyra walked up to these Harry Potter figurines, pointed at Hagrid and said: “Daddy!” So that explains where we’re at. After eight months of lockdown, it was quite full-on.GT: David had a bob at one point. Turns out he’s got annoyingly excellent hair. Quite jealous. He’s also grown a slightly unpleasant moustache.Is David still wearing his stinky hoodie?GT: I bought him that as a gift. It’s actually Paul Smith loungewear. In lockdown, he was living in it. It’s pretty classy, but he does manage to make it look quite shit.Staged returns to BBC One on Monday 4 January at 9.45pm"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/617d65bc914184da1e891cd82b0b67cc04d35446/0_93_2768_1661/master/2768.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctcmV2aWV3LTQucG5n\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=8cfde1c83cb8feef84f90733c27bdb06","title":"uk supermarket workers share your experiences during the second wave of coronavirus","story":"We’d like to speak to supermarket workers about how they’re coping with the second wave of coronavirus, and how it compares to the firstAs much of the UK comes under ever-increasing restrictions due to the second wave of coronavirus, we’d like to find out how workers in essential shops, such as supermarkets or chemists, are coping.How are you finding the second wave, how does it compare to the first?

Here those young people reflect on an extraordinary year and share their hopes and fears for the future.The son of a care support worker and a Congolese-Rwandan refugee, Dylan Kawende is from north-west London and is studying at St Edmund’s College, Cambridge“I’ve just finished my first term at Cambridge and have really enjoyed it, despite all the restrictions.“I’ve found constitutional law particularly fascinating because it’s so relevant to what we’re going through at the moment in this country. I’ve realised there wasn’t sufficient scrutiny of the government’s use of Covid powers, for example. They didn’t have the power to tell people to stay at home in March – and that’s just one instance of how they’ve abused the law to mishandle the pandemic.“The government has abused its position and its coercive powers, which were never intended to empower it to act as it has done. I’ve realised that this is a pattern with this government: they suspended parliament for five weeks back in August over Brexit. That was unlawful, too.“Covid has also exposed a lot of injustices and inequalities, from the way the NHS is run to economic injustices. It’s made me very invested in being able to advocate on behalf of those who have been victimised by the government and its routine lack of sensitivity to the intricacies of iniduals who suffer the most when it comes to health crises.“The pandemic has also made me much more aware of the erosion of people’s basic, human rights that can take place if we’re not vigilant. It took a law degree for me to realise that the government had acted illegally when ordering people to stay at home in March and that lack of awareness is worrying: if the government thinks it can order us to do whatever it wants because we’re not aware of our rights, it’s a slippery slope.“Covid has politicised the young indirectly as well as directly. Because we’ve all had to stay at home, we’ve been less distracted. I’m sure that’s why the Black Lives Matter message were heard by so many. This is a good thing. It’s an opportunity for us all to observe and appreciate the state of the world.“I have a huge family and usually we all come together in one household over Christmas. But I don’t mind the change this year because my first priority now is to have long, introspective conversations with my family about how they’re feeling about the situation we’re all in. We have just assumed we’re all just getting on OK but that’s not an assumption I want to make.“The vaccine is a source of hope and optimism for me but the number of conspiracy theories going round about it is alarming. It speaks to the mistrust that people have in the government and the proliferation of misinformation over social media.“The consequences of this are dire: if enough people mistrust the government and don’t observe what they have to say – in circumstances where they’re saying it legitimately – it impacts on society at large.“Covid has created more pockets where that paranoia can flourish.”Aadam Patel lives in Dewsbury, West Yorkshire, with his parents, Musa and Zubeda, and his brother and two sisters“I managed to get myself a real, graduate-level job, at an international law firm in November. I count myself as hugely fortunate: loads of my graduate friends haven’t been as lucky. It’s really devastating for them to spend all these years studying and then face constant rejections.“I also feel really sorry for my younger brother and sister because they’re just stuck at home, studying. The government isn’t doing anything like enough to protect them from the harm that’s doing: they’re missing out on all the experiences that make you into a rounded adult, not just the really important social experiences but also the ones that make you employable: it’s the little jobs that I had at 17 that developed my skills and work ethic – the things that your first employers want to see.“My brother and sister aren’t getting any of that and their opportunities in life will be affected as a result. But this government has not done anywhere near enough to deal with it. Provisions have been made for other generations during this pandemic: lockdown was because of the older generation, after all. But it’s our generation that’s going to have to pay for the pandemic for the rest of our lives through taxes, a shrunken economy and fewer life chances.“One of the positives of the pandemic has been spending so much time with my family this year. I’m usually constantly on the go but spending so much at home and in the local community has almost felt like a throwback to being young again. It’s been refreshing and good for the soul.“It’s given me time to get to know myself too. I’ve got a deeper idea of what I am, my goals and aspirations over the last nine months. I now have a much better idea of where I want to be when there’s a fresh start in summer 2021.“Another thing I’ve realised is the value of human touch and human meetings. My community is at the heart of one of the worst-hit areas in the country for Covid and it’s hard on us. We’re such a close-knit community: we genuinely have an open-door policy. But we’ve not given up we’ve really fought for each other. If someone tests positive, food and supplies are dropped on their doorsteps.“I’m angry but I’m also disappointed because the impact of their incompetence and corruption will be felt in the short-term by constant anger towards government and in the long term by an absolute erosion in trust in government.“We grew up being told and believing that Britain was one of the most powerful countries in the world but, after this, I don’t think we are and I don’t think anyone else does either, at home or internationally. The word is embarrassing. That sums it up. It’s sad and disappointing – and embarrassing.”Holly Ronicle lives with her younger brother, Noah, between the homes of her father, James, and mother, Emma, in York“School hasn’t been too bad this term because I still get to play with my friends. But my best friend is in a different bubble to me, so we have to socially distance ourselves from her in the playground. We walk around and talk instead of playing, making sure we’re the right distance away from each other. Six months ago, we would be touching and jumping around on her but now we can’t go anywhere near her now.“There are other friends in different bubbles who I’ve lost contact with because we can’t play together and they’re not part of my class friendship group. That’s sad but I’ve got closer to the other children in my class instead, which is nice.“The world feels lonelier to me because I don’t see as many people around as we used to and can’t go anywhere. But, then again, I have got used to it. Empty streets just seem normal.“Covid has changed me in a way that I deal with my worries better now. I used to be quite worried sometimes but lockdown has taught me not to worry. I’m not really sure how it’s taught me that. I think I have grown up a bit.“I’m not sure the vaccine will help as much as people say. Everyone thought the pandemic would be over by Christmas and they were wrong, so they could be wrong again. I have become more unsure about what people in authority say.“I have seen the world in a different way since Covid. I have realised how many people there really are in the world. I don’t know how that makes me feel but I think it’s an important thing to have realised.”Nairn McDonald lives in North Ayrshire with his mother, Lindsay, and two younger brothers“It’s been such a difficult year there’s just been bad news after bad news. It’s been overwhelming but then there was the news of a vaccine. I watched the first woman getting the vaccine and I cried with relief. I know, now, that there’s an end in sight. This nightmare is finally coming to an end.“The thought that I’ll be able to hug my grandfather and take him out for a drive is really emotional. I haven’t touched him or seen him properly for nine months.“I have a lot of anger towards the mistakes by this government during the pandemic. The whole thing could have been handled better, especially what happened in care homes and the way the government put people’s lives at risk because of profit and the economy. I look at other countries and see them almost back to normality while our politicians are just bumbling along.“I worry that we have to trust them with the vaccine rollout: I don’t have a lot of faith in them. At the same time, I have an overwhelming sense that we need a last pull together to get the vaccine rolled out. Once that’s done, then we can have the postmortem.“The loosening of the five days at Christmas terrified me: all it takes is for one of my grandfathers’ carers to catch it and it will kill him. It could be indirectly – one of the carer’s daughter’s friends could have it and pass it on.“And it’s not just my grandfather, of course: there’s a care home near us that hadn’t had a single case of Covid. Then someone hugged their granny and she caught Covid and died – then five other people at the care home died too. I’m dreading all the bad news that January will bring.“Christmas has always been very big in our family. It didn’t feel happy or joyous at all this year. We didn’t spend Christmas with grandfather because the risks are too great. He will spend Christmas on his own. We did a doorstep visit in the morning and dropped some food off. If I’m honest, I’ve struggled with Christmas this year. It’s bringing me down. But I’m trying to stay positive and think about next Christmas, when we’ll have an extra-special celebration.“Jobwise things are not good. I’ve been applying for a charity job but the job market is saturated: so many charities have had to close or reduce their staff that I don’t stand a chance competing for the same jobs.“I’m keeping myself as busy as much as I can but as far as paid work goes, I don’t know when it’s going to even be a possibility. Without paid work I’m not contributing to society and it’s difficult to put into words the sense of worthlessness that creates.”Bethan has eight siblings and moves between the homes of her mother, Serena, and her father, Dylan, in Llanarmon-yn-lâl, north Wales“I’ve just started my new job and I’m really happy about it. I’m a charity support assistant, mainly caring for the elderly when they come out of hospital. I can’t be furloughed and there’s a constant need for our services as time goes on, so I’m confident that I’ve got secure employment, which is an amazing feeling.“The PPE requirements are really strong. We’re entirely covered up and have to santise constantly – at least five times during each visit, including sanitising the visor.“We’re not tested unless we have symptoms but I think that’s right: it would be a waste of money to test us constantly when we’re using PPE so much. I feel like everyone is a risk at this point but it’s being able to minimise that risk as much as possible. These people would be at risk in normal times too: even a common cold could be fatal for them.“It sounds odd but I’m looking after all these people but I’ve got no idea what tier we’re in at the moment. It’s so complicated and changes so often, that I’ve given up keeping an eye on it. I just do what I’m told at work behave in a way that I think is sensible outside it.“The vaccine issue is a source of anxiety for me but also a source of hope. They’ve already found it’s no good for people with allergies and I’ve got asthma, so they might go on to discover it’s not good for me either.“We don’t know the impact of the vaccine 10 years from now and I’m only 19. I don’t want to find I’ve taken something that was developed too quickly and does something terrible to me in my 20s. I want the vaccine but I also want to wait as long as possible before I have it.”“I am bored with the pandemic now. I’m moving in with my boyfriend in January and I want to be able to start everything fresh. I want the pandemic to be over. I want to move on.”Oliwia Charowska lives with her younger brother, Marcel, and her parents, Joanna and Adrian, in Bromley, south-east London“My childhood years are coming to an end at a time when I can’t enjoy them. I don’t leave the house without thinking, ‘Do I have my mask, my gloves, my hand sanitiser?’ When I meet up with friends, I’m always thinking ‘Am I far enough apart from them?’ I can’t just live in the moment. I’ve had to grow up quickly. I have realised the world is more complicated than I was told.“It makes me feel that our last bit of childhood is being squandered. My friends and I are missing out on creating the memories our ancestors did at this stage of their lives. We can’t be spontaneous, independent and adventurous, and because of that, we’re missing experiences and life lessons.“In November, my entire family had Covid. I was tested on the 20 November but was negative. I got symptoms a week later but the NHS wouldn’t give me another test. Then I went in for a routine operation on 9 December (that was later cancelled because of the pandemic) and was tested beforehand. That test came back positive. I was confused: I had my symptoms 11 days before that but apparently Covid stays in your system for 90 days.“Dad and I reported the positive result to the NHS Covid-19 centre helpline and the school contacted the Department for Education to ask for advice. And then the calls began coming. Over two days, mum and I received about 30 phone calls from different public services – and the crazy thing was that they all told us different things.“One so-called expert rang to say that because of when I had my symptom, I didn’t have to self-isolate at all. Then someone else said had to isolate until 12 December – and someone else said I had to isolate until 14 December.“Everyone who calls tells me something different and it’s really confusing because surely they’re all using the same guidance, so should be giving me the same advice?“During a crisis, we need clarity. Matt Hancock keeps using the word ‘robust’ but what’s robust about a £22bn system that gives completely inconsistent advice? The responsibility lies with the government: they drew up the guidelines and they created the systems. There have been too many U-turns.“A lot of the nation has lost its trust and faith in the government because of the confusing messages and lack of clarity. There are too many unanswered questions.“My generation is becoming much more involved in politics. We’re beginning to ask ourselves if they really know what they’re talking about. A lot of people have realised that they can’t depend on anything they’re being told.“I’ve taken up a fourth A-level in politics because of what I’ve experienced during the pandemic. It’s amazing sitting in a room with other Gen Z kids we’re young, enthusiastic and full of ideas about how to change the world. We bounce ideas off each other about how we should be doing things differently. We’re optimistic, enthusiastic and inspired.“If there’s one positive thing to come out of the pandemic, it is that people have changed. There has been a huge awakening for us. It’s a tsunami. This pandemic has shown us that government makes mistakes and doesn’t know the answers. My generation have realised that we live in this one world together and we have to create the changes that we want to see for ourselves.”Aryan Nair lives with his parents, Rakesh and Swetha, and younger brother in south London“I’m in India at the moment and it’s so wonderful that I can hardly believe it’s true. I haven’t seen my grandparents for two years: we were going to see them in the summer but then there was the pandemic.“It’s different here: little kids have to wear masks – which is bad because it’s really hot and hard to breathe in them – but no one really socially distances. We call my mum the Sanitiser Lady because she won’t let us touch anything and is always making us sanitise our hands.“When we first arrived at my grandparents, she told me we had to shower before hugging our grandparents but my grandparents said they couldn’t wait and hugged us without waiting. Everyone was jumping around. We were so excited.“It was a bit tense at the airport because my parents had to take tests, then we had to wear shields in the airport and there were empty seats between us in the aeroplane. It felt odd that we couldn’t see the air stewards: they were so covered up you could barely recognise them.“It feels like I’ve been in a little room for years and am now on a big farm. My grandparents’ house isn’t a farm at all but I just feel freer here there’s more space and they don’t have as many rules. The whole Covid thing feels a long way away, apart from the masks.“We don’t celebrate Christmas but we had to have Diwali at home, which was sad. We had a party, with disco lights and just my family. We watched friends’ parties online but I missed going to their houses. I preferred it last year because it was more fun and the food was yummy.”Jack Payne is from Sea Mills in Bristol, where he lived with his mother, Tracey, and brother and sister. He now lives in a student hall in Clerkenwell, London“It has been a strange first term at university: it wasn’t the traditional freshers experience – most societies had their events online and offline, everyone wears their masks all the time but I think, because of all the changes and confusions, a lot of students break the rules, even though they’re heavily enforced by the wardens.“Students are quite confused about the rule changes and have pretty much given up. Lots just rely on their own common sense instead. The feeling is that the government hasn’t been being objective because the rules have changed too often. The rules, to be honest, have become a bit of a joke among students.“Having said that, the second lockdown changed the atmosphere on campus completely: no one hung around after the face-to-face tutorials – which we do sitting far away from each other and wearing masks, which makes debating with each other really hard – the library was empty and so was the rest of the campus. I feel a great disconnect between myself and the campus.“It’s interesting to think about what university will be like in the future. I can see lectures moving online forever but it’ll be a great shame: the experience of university is much more than a series of online lectures. It’s about face-to-face contact with lecturers, about building academic contacts and making friends. This isn’t the experience I’m getting. I’m just sat at a computer screen all day, every day. There’s a great feeling of loneliness.“I had my two Covid tests before I left to go back home for Christmas. Now I’m at home, I still can’t see my grandfather and uncle, because they’re shielding. Christmas without them was sad but I’m just telling myself that this year is an exception and next year things will be back to normal.”Sanjana Parashar lives with her parents, Prasanjit and Shally, in Beckenham, Greater London, and one younger sister“I don’t think it was the best decision of the government to let everyone come together for Christmas. I don’t get the feeling that they’re listening to the scientists, who are saying that it will make everything worse and lead to another lockdown.“I understand that the government is trying to keep us safe but it’s not working. The numbers show that. I understand that they’re trying to keep the economy up but it should not be their main focus: the UK is a strong economy and will arise again, so the government should focus on the people.“We usually spend Christmas with friends and travel beforehand – last year we went to Malta. Neither of those things happened this year and I’m not used to spending all winter at home. It’s not what I call fun.“I’m worried about my family in India. Lots of them have had Covid and although they’re all OK, I still worry. If Dad has to go over to help, he’ll have to stay in a hotel to quarantine and that’s expensive.“I’m also concerned about my GCSEs. What if they keep changing things, and the teachers don’t know the best way to teach it? If they make the exams easier though, then that’s OK with me.“My relationship with my six-year-old sister has changed during the pandemic. We’re closer because we’ve spent so much time together but we fight too. It’s kind of sad but we’ve developed an argumentative relationship, which we didn’t have before. It really irritates my mum.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d7e010a78437ee114c176b0521d4698f27096e31/0_114_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c152302e5ce257cbb80122159b67c954","title":"how oxford coronavirus vaccine being deployed england uk","story":"With jab to be administered to public for first time, we look at key questions about its rollout The biggest vaccination programme in the UK’s history will receive a major boost on Monday, with the first use of the OxfordAstraZeneca Covid vaccine. Here we look at some key questions about how it will be deployed in England.Probably not. Any new vaccine use will begin cautiously, however loud the fanfare around the arrival of the OxfordAstraZeneca jab. The importance of this vaccine cannot be overestimated, because it is stored at normal fridge temperature and can be taken out and transported to care homes and wherever else it is needed very easily. But the first doses will be given at just a few hospitals “for surveillance purposes”, NHS England has said. That is just in case of any glitches, such as the allergy issue that arose when the NHS started using the PfizerBioNTech vaccine. That has now been resolved, incidentally, with guidance that people with allergy histories are fine, unless they are specifically allergic to any of the ingredients in either of the vaccines.The photo opportunities on Monday are likely to take place in Oxford hospitals, because the university invented the vaccine. But the Royal Free hospital NHS foundation trust in London, Guy’s and St Thomas’, University Hospitals of Morecambe Bay, Brighton and Sussex and the George Eliot hospital NHS trust will all start using the jab on Monday. Then later in the week, GP-led vaccination centres around the country will be sent supplies. There are 700 of these in England at the moment another 180, plus 100 more hospitals, will start deploying the vaccine this week, says NHS England.Care home residents and the staff looking after them are at the top of the list, as has been the case. But this has been difficult to do so far because the Pfizer vaccine is not easy to store and transport, because of a requirement to keep it at -70C in the longer term. This time, this group can be the main focus. GPs are being offered £10 for every care home resident they can vaccinate by the end of January.Official figures from NHS England – as opposed to politicians’ pronouncements – show that about 750,000 people have been vaccinated in England in the first three weeks since the Pfizer vaccine came online, of whom 524,439 were over 80. The over-80s and NHS staff are the second priority group. Ministers say about 1 million people have received a vaccine.Hopefully, yes, because at a rate of a quarter of a million people being vaccinated each week in England, it will take all year to get through the most vulnerable – basically everyone over 50 and people with underlying health issues. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, says he is aiming for 2 million a week in the UK soon and rising. There may still be hold-ups. There is enough of the OxfordAstraZeneca vaccine for 4 million people, but most of it is not yet in vials in its finished form and nor has it all been batch-certified, as required under the temporary emergency approval given by the UK regulator. Only 530,000 doses are ready to go into people’s arms across the UK on Monday."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b072245352a4ece84474e1ed7e2950fcff97e7f1/0_132_3968_2380/master/3968.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=76e436f8be37d41f2e172e9850b71eae","title":"indias approval of twin vaccines triggers mass immunisation drive","story":"Green light for Oxford vaccine alongside domestic Covaxin hailed as ‘decisive turning point’ by PMIndia has granted emergency approval to both the OxfordAstraZeneca coronavirus vaccine and the domestically developed Covaxin, signalling the start of one of the largest Covid-19 immunisation drives in the world.At a press conference on Sunday, the drugs controller general of India said the decision to approve both the Oxford vaccine and Covaxin, which is produced by the Indian company Bharat Biotech and was part-funded by the government, had come after “careful examination” of the data.It makes India the second country to approve emergency use of the OxfordAstraZeneca vaccine, known as Covishield in India, after the UK gave it the green light on Wednesday.The approval comes at a crucial time. India, a country of more than 1.3 billion people, has registered more than 10.3m cases of Covid-19, the second highest in the world, and 149,000 deaths. On Sunday, the prime minister, Narendra Modi, called the approval “a decisive turning point”.India plans to vaccinate 300 million people in its first stage of vaccinations, with priority given to 30 million frontline healthcare workers, police and members of the armed forces. The vaccine will then be given to those above the age of 50 and people suffering from co-morbidity illnesses. The vaccine will be given free of charge.However, the approval of Covaxin was met with some concern as the vaccine is still undergoing phase 3 clinical trials and the full results of the vaccine’s efficacy have not been published.All India Drug Action Network, a public health group, said it was “baffled” by the decision to approve a vaccine still in trials. The government had previously promised that Covaxin, which was produced in conjunction with a government-run body, the Indian Council of Medical Research, would be ready for distribution by August 2020.The senior opposition leader Shashi Tharoor tweeted his concerns about Covaxin. “The Covaxin has not yet had phase 3 trials. Approval was premature and could be dangerous,” he wrote.Adar Poonawalla, the CEO of the Serum Institute, on Sunday said it will not allow the export of the vaccine for several months, meaning poorer countries may have to wait before beginning their vaccination programmes. With rich nations reserving most of the vaccines that will be made this year, Serum Institute — the world’s largest vaccine manufacturer — is likely to make most of the inoculations for developing countries.However, India faces huge challenges in distributing the vaccine across the vast country. Healthcare is uneven, lacking resources and power, and access is often difficult in rural areas. The government has begun training about 20,000 health workers to administer the vaccine and last week conducted trial runs in four states, using placebo vaccines administered by trained professionals.Covishield and Covaxin only need to be stored at temperatures of 2-8C, far more manageable than the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines that have been rolled out in Europe and the US.However, there are concerns that India’s cold chain – the refrigerated resources that enable the vaccine to be safely transported and stored – is not yet up to capacity to cope with vaccines for 1.3 billion people. The government has brought in the aviation and transport ministries to draw up plans for how the vaccine can be delivered across the country.The government said it intended to draw on its highly successful polio eradication programme and infant immunisation programme, which inoculates about 27 million children annually."},{"url":null,"title":"climate","story":"The first test is for governments to stop subsidising fossil fuel industry which knowingly contributed to global over-heatingEvery 0.1 degree matters as the world attempts to keep within 1.5-degree rise\u0026lsquo2020 is on course to be the 10th consecutive year of above-normal temperatures\u0026rsquo"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4449320.1609701094!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"health system coping with covid 19 surge for now","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tAn almost deserted Leeson Street in Dublin on Sunday afternoon. Photograph: Stephen CollinsCollins PhotosNew Year periods are always busy in the Irish health service, but this one is different from any other.The combination of winter, flu and the Christmas holidays usually sees trolleys lined up in the corridors of hospitals in early January. This time last year, about 750 patients were hospitalised with flu and in the first week of January a new record for trolleys was set, with 760 patients left waiting for admission.This year, there is, strangely, no flu, far fewer trolleys and the number of respiratory patients in hospital is in line with that seen in a bad flu season. But not for long, given the steep upward graph of Covid-19 infections of recent days.By Sunday morning, there were 673 coronavirus patients in hospital, up 100 in a single day, and by 2pm that number had further increased to 685.Health Service Executive chief executive Paul Reid says the growth rate of the disease is now 15 per cent, up from 11 per cent before Christmas.While expressing concern about these increases, Reid says the system is not overwhelmed “at this stage” and describes the situation in intensive care as “not too bad”, despite a recent rise in the number of very sick patients.There were 643 free general beds and 43 in ICU on Sunday. The HSE has yet to make use of its surge capacity in either area and could call on private capacity in extremis.However, as infections rise the ability of the service to respond lessens as more staff are forced to go off work due to being a case or a contact. As a result, more than 400 beds are currently out of commission.The number of hospital patients could reach 1,300 and those in ICU 300 by the end of the month, HSE chief clinical officer Dr Colm Henry forecast on Sunday – and that’s assuming complete adherence to Level 5 restrictions.In the community, GPs are seeing about 10 times the number of likely Covid-19 cases they were a month ago, according to Dublin family doctor Shane McKeogh. Since March, McKeogh has been surveying GPs daily to track the progress of the virus, thereby providing an early warning system for what might lie ahead.The tracker system, run with GPBuddy, TCD and the Irish College of General Practitioners, shows the sharp rise in cases started in the week before Christmas and has continued.On average, GPs were seeing one likely virus case a day in their surgeries in the first week of December, he says. Before Christmas, that jumped to three to four, and by December 29th it was up to nine. Though the trend was national, the tracker showed up particularly big surges in specific areas, such as the steep rise in cases in Wexford that has been linked in part to funerals.It is difficult to compile reliable figures over the ChristmasNew Year holiday season and the most recent data from the tracker is from December 31st, but McKeogh says out-of-hours services were “incredibly busy” over the weekend.“We would expect the numbers to continue rising at this level until, eventually, the lockdown breaks the chains of transmission,” he says.‘Difficult few weeks’Dr Catherine Motherway, immediate past-president of the Intensive Care Society of Ireland, predicts a “difficult few weeks” ahead.“If people do what has been asked of them, we’ll be able to stop transmission of the virus and the rise in pressure on the health service,” she says.A failure to bring the disease will place hospitals and the wider health service under “tremendous pressure”, the Limerick-based consultant added.Compared with the first wave, patients coming into hospital in this surge tend to be slightly older and sicker, she says, and so mortality rates may rise.Motherway says the reason infections have taken off since before Christmas is simply because “we mixed too much” and are now paying the price.Hospitals still have capacity at present but those without single rooms for patients may be the first to see services affected by the need to control infections and protect patients.She remains sanguine about our ability to turn the tide.“The Irish public have done this really well on two occasions they’re just going to have to do it again now,” she says.“The best way of not dying of Covid is not to get it in the first place.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4449237.1609693865!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit truckers arrive fresh and well fed after first rosslare dunkirk sailing","story":"A new ferry service linking Rosslare Europort in Co Wexford to Dunkirk in northern France completed its first crossing on Sunday.

Photograph: Sharon Gaffney. With his lorry decked out with Irish, French and EU flags, truck driver John Carroll was among the first to alight from the maiden DFDS direct sailing from Rosslare Europort in Co Wexford to Dunkirk in northern France. The service, which is to run six times a week with each crossing taking about 24 hours, was introduced after Brexit took effect. This makes it a longer journey for hauliers but it means they do not have to make customs declarations or face additional checks and inspections crossing from Britain to the UK. It is seen by truckers as a means of avoiding ‘red tape’ issues on the UK landbridge such as the lengthy delays seen for many vehicles seeking to board ferries going England into the EU.“It was great,” said Carroll, who works for DG McArdle International, of his overnight journey. “It may have taken a bit longer, but I’ll be at my delivery point in Germany by 9pm tonight...We’re feeling well-rested and ready for the drive ahead.”Tom Bermingham was another of the 65 truckers who made the trip on the Danish shipping company’s vessel.“We’re fresh and well-fed, it was a great service,” he said. “We were wrecked before Christmas after being stuck in the chaos at Dover. We’ve avoided all the hassle of driving through the UK.”The head of the company that operates Irish Ferries, Eamon Rothwell, has insisted that businesses will continue to rely on the landbridge, which he maintains is cheaper, faster and less prone to cancellations caused by bad weather.‘Awful mess’But Eoin Gavin, who runs a transport company based in Bunratty, said he had “three trucks stranded all last week” because Irish Ferries’ services into Cherbourg were fully booked. “We’d have been in an awful mess if it hadn’t been for the direct sailings into Dunkirk.”Gavin said that in order to use the landbridge he would need to navigate six different IT systems. “Would you do all that, without taking into account Covid tests and potential delays, or just drive down to Rosslare and hop onto a direct sailing to France?” he asked. Gavin says his clients have insisted that their goods should not be transported via the landbridge. “They’re questioning why they should bother with all the extra paperwork involved. If clients refuse to provide us with the necessary invoices and declarations we have no choice but to avoid the UK.”This point is reinforced by Aidan Coffey, managing director of DFDS Seaways Ireland. “It’s not just hauliers who decide which routes the trucks should take. It’s also the manufacturers and producers who are telling drivers not to travel through the UK,” he says. “By using the landbridge, some of them risk being subject to veterinary checks, or even having their products contaminated if the trailers are opened and checked.”Added bonusAn added bonus, he says is that “direct sailings also allow drivers to take their rest periods during the 24-hour crossing, rather than when they land in France.”Daniel Deschodt, chief executive of Dunkirk Port, said the new route put Irish drivers “straight into the ‘blue banana’ as we call it in France, straight into Northern Europe”. “That compares to trucks arriving into Cherbourg, which is a six-hour drive from here. Dunkirk is just 20 minutes from the Belgian border,” he says. Seamus McKeegan, director of Co Antrim firm McKeegan International, says he is “avoiding Calais like the plague” following the backlog that faced drivers transiting from Dover in the run-up to Christmas. He says the direct sailings appear to be the best option for hauliers, but would continue to monitor the situation to see how it evolves. Signage has been installed at Dunkirk port wishing drivers ‘a céad míle fáilte’, but there was also a local man on hand to welcome the ship. Herve Tembuyser (49) was, despite the cold, decked out in just jeans, a leprechaun hat and an Irish rugby jersey. “I’m French but I feel a little bit Irish,” he said. “I spent a week in Dublin once and I’m engaged to an Irish woman...I hope they launch a passenger service to Rosslare soon.

Photograph: Paul EllisAFP via Getty ImagesDelays linked to post-Brexit border controls are expected this week as freight traffic arriving from Britain increases, new technology is tested and traffic systems set up for a surge in checks, Tánaiste Leo Varadkar has said.Monday will be the first day back for many after the Christmas break, and greater volumes of roll-on, roll-off lorry traffic will follow after the traditionally quiet new year period for freight traffic.Stena Line and Irish Ferries will operate full ferry services from Holyhead to Dublin, the busiest Irish Sea crossing for trade between the State and Britain, from Monday, with each company having a ferry arrive at roughly the same time in four waves over the course of the day.Traffic volumes were light last Friday, the first day of post-Brexit border controls on lorries arriving from Britain, and over the weekend.Turned backSome lorries were turned back and prevented from boarding ferries at Holyhead because they did not have the correct paperwork or did not input customs data correctly into the systems.Most lorries arriving on the first ferries in the hours after Brexit came into effect last Thursday did not know whether or not their goods had to be checked by customs, leading State agencies to call on hauliers to check on Revenue\u0027s website 30 minutes before docking.Mr Varadkar said that his own department and the departments of Agriculture and Health, along with Revenue, were monitoring traffic flows through the ports on a daily basis.He told the This Week programme that there were “small issues coming up” as a result of the new trading arrangements with Britain.Food importers have raised concerns about delays being caused by the requirement to give the Department of Agriculture 24 hours’ notice of food products of animal and plant origin arriving at Dublin Port to undergo strict sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) checks at inspection facilities.Food Drink Ireland, part of business lobby group Ibec, has called on the EU and the UK to introduce “facilitation and easement measures” under the chapter covering SPS processes in their post-Brexit trade deal that allows them to review border clearance processes to facilitate trade.‘Priority issue’“We think this should be a priority issue to reflect the reality on the ground of highly integrated Ireland-Great Britain supply chains and the friction and costs now being faced as a result of Brexit,” its director Paul Kelly said.Aidan Flynn, general manager of Freight Transport Association Ireland, said that the changes mean supply chains have to be “re-engineered” to ensure goods continued to flow freely.“This lengthens the supply chain where we might have been able to put requests for goods at 6pm on the evening and have them arriving into Dublin at 6am the next morning,” he said.“That is going to have to be extended by at least 12 hours.”Minister for Transport Eamon Ryan said the low volumes of transport and trucks in recent days has meant State agencies “have been able to tease out” problems but he does not expect major traffic or travel disruption.“It will be a pain in the neck for the companies because there is a huge amount of background bureaucratic forms, procedures to be filled out, but once we get used to that I don’t believe it will be disruptive to our own everyday life,” he told Newstalk’s On the Record programme.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Photograph: Tom Honan The owners of Dublin’s Phibsborough shopping centre are seeking to redevelop the 1960s complex, long regarded as an eyesore, as a “co-living” scheme rather than the student accommodation for which they have planning permission.The company was granted permission for a €50 million redevelopment of the northside site about two years ago, with accommodation for 341 students in blocks up to seven storeys tall, as well as a three-fold increase in the amount of retail space.A dispute with the centre’s anchor tenant, Tesco, then arose over access issues which meant the work never got underway. It is understood the new application, which involves alterations to entrances, would address these issues.The majority of the co-living rooms would be 18sq m, spread over six floors with up to four kitchen and living areas for each floor. There would also be 18 smaller “cluster” rooms that would see three, four and six bedrooms sharing kitchen and living spaces, as well as 16 wheelchair-accessible bedrooms.The rooms would be built in two blocks of six floors on top of the existing one-storey shopping centre facing on to Phibsborough Road. The development would not see the demolition of the 1967 office tower as MM Capital does not own the unit occupied by Tesco directly under the tower. It would instead be clad in a metal mesh, as permitted under the earlier application.Planners representing the developer have argued to the planning board that as the site has already been deemed suitable for student accommodation, co-living would also be “wholly appropriate”.A civic space linking Phibsborough Road to the North Circular Road with access to Dalymount Park football stadium would also be created as part of the development. Dublin City Council, which owns Dalymount, plans a €20 million upgrade to convert it to a 10,000-seater stadium.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4449081.1609618033!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"rosslare ferry service offering solution to brexit sets sail","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t Truck drivers Pedro Ferreira and John Carroll at Rosslare Europort for the first departure of the DFDS service from  Rosslare Europort to Dunkirk. Photograph: Patrick BrowneA new ferry service direct from Rosslare to Dunkirk set sail for the first time on Saturday afternoon.For Pedro Ferreira it was a relief.Having enduring long waits on the UK landbridge in recent weeks, the Spanish haulier welcomed the new direct route to the continent.Danish shipping line DFDS launched the route to Dunkirk in northern France with Brexit in mind, allowing hauliers to avoid congestion and paperwork on the landbridge from Saturday. The first ship was carrying almost 100 trucks and trailers to Dunkirk, and the service will operate six days a week. A second DFDS ferry was set to leave Rosslare later on Saturday.Ferreira was carrying a “mix of everything” for Mooney Transport, while, beside him, John Carroll was bringing pharmaceuticals on board for DG McArdle. Both had their lorries draped in Irish, French and EU flags and would often have used Dublin Port prior to now.Carroll, who was on his way to Holland after Dunkirk, was exasperated at the conditions drivers faced when going through the UK in recent times: “You’d come off the boat on a Tuesday evening and all you could see was miles and miles of traffic. And no facilities of any description.”“Anything’s better than sitting in a queue,” agreed Ray Johnson. The Belfast man was coming from Dublin and said early promises to cater for drivers fell away, meaning they now need direct routes to the continent. “I was caught sitting for up to three days before. We were the frontline workers for a day or two but they just didn’t care after that.”Less hassleIt was Tom Birmingham’s first time using Rosslare Europort, with the Dubliner having always used the port in the capital. “This is less hassle really for the driver. I’m heading to Germany and then Holland and, and this will leave us with more driving hours when we get off. It’s going to be good.”DFDS opened the route out of a belief that the landbridge would be “clogged” once the Brexit deadline passed. Brexit “accelerated” plans for the route, said Darren Mooney, commercial director for DFDS, who was beaming to see trucks queueing up for the first ship.“There’s been a whole year’s work put into this and it’s brilliant to see it all manifest here in Rosslare,” he said.The company believes the route will be popular as it will allow direct access to northern and central Europe.“It’s massively exciting to see this,” said Glenn Carr, manager of Rosslare Europort. “All in all today, we will move more freight on this day alone through the port of Rosslare to mainland Europe than we did for the whole of week one in 2020.”With Stena Line also adding a ship to its current service, one leaving on Saturday, it means there will be 15 crossings to the continent every week, plus 15 return journeys. Carr said it represented a near-tripling of routes for drivers.“It demonstrates the shift happening away from the landbridge. The three services going out today is a testament to the interest and capacity that’s there. All three are fully booked.”Strong demandUS company Amazon had sought to book the whole ship but were turned down to accommodate others. They were granted more than 10 per cent space in the end. DFDS declined to comment.Declan Cleary, sales manager for the company, said there had been strong demand for the route, demonstrated by DFDS starting with three ships.His pitch to transport companies had been to give them “for the first time a solution to Brexit”, he says.“There’s now a port to focus on outside of Dublin. This distance to drive down to Rosslare is well worth their time because they avoid the extra costs and time delays they’d experience going through the UK.”The small management team burst into applause after the departing ship sounded its horn.It was a case of history repeating itself for Cleary, who stood in much the same spot watching the first freight ship set sail from Rosslare to Cherbourg. “I think I still have a picture of trucks heading onto the ferry from that day somewhere in my attic.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

And it will take time because people will have to repay what they owe.”Events on the mainland eventually affect the Aran Islands. But in the startling year that was 2020, there was one striking distinction between the two, since the islands managed to remain almost entirely free of Covid-19.Just one household was affected there. During the first lockdown, islanders fretted over whether they should open ferry and plane routes to summer visitors once national restrictions lifted. In the early summer, a vote was held to gauge local feelings. The vast majority of residents – some 80 per cent – wanted to keep their area closed.“We ended up having a vote through phone messaging. I was very against that because I knew it would be isive – and it was. We all got very angry and we all took sides,” Molloy says.Tourism is crucial for many Aran islanders. But the water between them and the mainland offered a natural fortress against the virus. To many, it seemed foolhardy to invite strangers to walk among them. This led to a tense time in what is usually an easygoing society.“For me, I don’t think anyone has the right to deprive anyone else of an income. The difference here was that if the country was allowed to be opened up, then why weren’t we? We are part of Ireland.“That is how we came to be open in the end. I understand the element of fear that people had. Not everyone here is dependent on tourism. Quite a lot are, but not everyone.”A grim yearInis Mór, the main island, is definitely big enough for one ex-hermit and, it turns out, several Kiwis. Dave Cotter’s great-great-grandfather left Ulster in the 1860s to seek his fortune in the New Zealand gold rush.Now, Cotter is one of four New Zealanders living on Inis Mór. With his wife Jenny O’Halloran, Cotter runs a seaweed-harvesting business that was started by his father-in-law, Máirtin Concannon, in 2000. The pandemic hit them like a lightning bolt.“We are really lucky that we have a erse pantry of things we can harvest and because we only have myself and my wife employed at the time, we didn’t have to let anyone go.”Usually upbeat, Cotter frets about the year ahead and what it will bring.Once the decision was taken to reopen the islands and visitors began to reappear in July, there was no acrimony. Some B\u0026ampBs stayed closed. So, too, did the American Bar on Inis Mór’s quayside. Only Joe Watty’s Bar and the Aran Hotel served hot meals.Unspoiled experienceTourism on the Aran Islands is decades-established. Its profile is changing, with the wifi signal now enviable. Glamping is now available, too, yet the Aran experience has somehow remained unspoiled.If anything, visiting feels like an escape, an opportunity to step back. This year, a strange thing happened. With international tourism obliterated, Irish visitors returned to the Aran Islands in volumes not seen since the late 1970s.“The facilities aren’t really here for that. But I think people were surprised by how much they enjoyed the experience here. I personally think there is a spirit here you can kind of feel. It is a good place with good people.”O’Malley owns and runs Joe Watty’s, located five minutes’ walk from the Inis Mór pier, with her husband, PJ Flaherty. High season meant 13-hour days and seven-day weeks. The bar is now closed, amid the latest coronavirus restrictions.With 19 staff, she was nervous of the virus. However, demand from visitors was constant. On long fine evenings, holiday-makers stood in line outside for hours waiting for a table. A fortune could have been made ferrying out drinks, but they stuck religiously to the Covid-19 rules.Leaving people waiting so long went against O’Malley’s hospitality instincts, but everyone got fed. Every venue lacked live music, too, an abnormality on the island. But sticking by the rules kept the virus at bay, she believes.“For bed and breakfast owners, generally speaking, this was their home they were opening up, which must have been very difficult. But I think they were just scrupulous about the rules,” she says.“The gardaí were in frequently to us. We got one phone call one time saying that someone who ate on the deck one Sunday tested positive later. That was it.”By 4pm the winter light is dipping and the Christmas lights twinkle. What comes in 2021 is an unwritten book, but O’Malley believes the pandemic, no matter when it ends, has permanently changed lives.“I feel it will never be the same again in my working life . . . We used to do a lot of groups from America, France, Australia. That will be slow to return,” she says.“This has turned the whole world on its head. The Irish we had this year were wonderful. If that is sustained, it would be great. If we can return to music sessions, even better. But I haven’t a clue how it will pan out.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"state","story":"Northern Ireland secretary could detract from Blair statement of regret, officials feared-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":null,"title":"ancient animal tracks discovered terracotta tiles used cover","story":"The uninformed observer might wonder how even a cat, let alone a dog or deer, could clamber to the top reaches of the 370-foot dome of Florence\u0027s most famous church.Yet when workmen began restoration work on the city\u0027s Santa Maria del Fiore cathedral, they discovered intriguing sets of paw and hoof prints on its ancient terracotta tiles.Experts who have analysed them say they were left not by modern day four-legged visitors, but by animals who traipsed across the clay tiles as they were laid out to dry in the sun before being laid on the dome centuries ago.The prints were discovered during winter maintenance by a team of specialised masons, restorers and technicians who corded up to repair and replace damaged tiles on the south cupola of Santa Maria del Fiore cathedral.While harnessed high atop the famous Renaissance church, they found tiles showing paw prints of dogs and cats, and tracks identified as belonging to fox, marten and deer. There were also many species of birds and raptors.  The imprints were likely made on the tiles as they lay drying in the sun before being kiln fired in Impruneta, a small Tuscan town between Florence and Greve in Chianti. The town has been famed since the 11th century for terracotta and is still producing it today.“I was amazed when the technicians showed me their photos,” said Ambra Nepi, spokesperson for the institute that manages the cathedral. “It is a marvellous hidden world up there, that from down below in the square you do not see.”Not just animals left a trace. Some tiles were branded with a unique cross, while others showed dates and the names of artisans, said architect Samuele Caciagli, a director of the restoration project.Upon lifting off the cap of the south cupola, the team found a Lira coin dated 1956. It either fell from a worker’s pocket or was left purposefully to mark the year the area was last systematically restored.“We have known there are these traces of man and animal there, “ Mr Caciagli told the . “But every time we do this continual maintenance and restoration, we discover another life lived, another page from our history book, like crumbs left by Hansel and Gretel allowing us to retrace the monument’s past.”Completed in 1436, the monumental cupola project by Filippo Brunelleschi remains the largest brick dome ever constructed, its curved engineering a testament to the genius of man regarded as one of the first modern engineers.Historians describe Brunelleschi as obsessively hands-on, personally choosing stone and marble from local quarries and carefully overseeing tile and brick production. “Brunelleschi was a very intelligent man who was very careful about choosing his materials – a master in quality control  – and this is one of the great secrets of the cupola’s achievement,” explained Mr Caciagli.The original terracotta tiles date back to 1419, but the animal tracks have not yet been precisely dated.  “Certainly, there are ancient animal tracks on some of the original tiles, but there are traces from all periods, because the terracotta drying process is still basically the same today as it was 600 years ago,” said Mr Caciagli.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"boris must bold go history pm lost union","story":"Boris Johnson does not want to be remembered as the man who won back British sovereignty from Brussels, only to lose the British nation itself. Yet this is the fate he risks unless he takes a bold approach to saving the Union. Just over six years ago, Scotland came close to voting for separation. Since then, our leaders might have asked searching questions about our constitution and the cultural, institutional and political reasons for the growing estrangement between Scotland and the rest of the UK. Instead, in a state of panic, they offered more devolved powers, and then ignored the problem altogether.Now the consequences of this inattention are becoming clearer. In the Holyrood elections in May, the Scottish National Party will almost certainly win a majority of seats, and perhaps a majority of the vote. Polls show that most Scots favour secession, and nationalism is most popular among younger voters. The future, Nicola Sturgeon believes, is hers.But all is not yet lost. Nationalists know that support for separation might yet recede. Brexit – held as a reason why Scotland might want to go its own way – in fact makes secession more complex. The old questions for the Nationalists – not least about the currency and border – are still unanswered. And while Scottish voters will not take kindly to the PM refusing to hold another referendum, as he did yesterday, neither will they appreciate an unseemly Nationalist rush for a second vote during a pandemic. Behind the scenes in Whitehall, work is underway as ministers ponder what they can do for Scotland. MPs from across the political spectrum are anxiously discussing what can be done to save the Union. There is talk of yet more devolution, and even a constitutional convention. Still unclear, however, is what the Government actually thinks.The Prime Minister was criticised for his comment that Scottish devolution had been “a disaster”, but he was quite correct. Devolution has misaligned power and accountability, allowing Scottish ministers to claim the credit for successes while escaping scrutiny for their failures. This helps to explain what one Scottish writer calls the “Sturgeon paradox”: the worse she does, especially on education and health, the more popular she becomes. Devolution has allowed the Nationalists to use the Scottish state to attack the Union. The school curriculum, for example, has been manipulated grotesquely to indoctrinate voters of the future. As Gordon Brown, the politician behind Scottish devolution in 1998, has admitted, “It was naive not to anticipate that devolution could create a megaphone for intensifying resentment.”But it was also naive to think that devolution would not cause a dangerous constitutional imbalance. The famous West Lothian Question – which asks why Scottish MPs should have a say on English matters when English MPs have no say over such matters in Scotland – remains unanswered because it is unanswerable. English votes on English laws, the fix provided by the Cameron government, fails to answer the question and creates new problems. By saying legislation applying only to England must have a majority among English MPs as well as the Commons overall, EVEL, as it is known, creates two classes of MP, and makes it harder, perhaps impossible, for an MP from a Scottish constituency to become Chancellor or Prime Minister. It also sets up an inevitable future constitutional crisis: a government elected with a UK majority but no English majority would be unable to govern England and would, for many voters, lack the legitimacy to do so too.So devolution is a disaster for all these reasons and one more: the powers it grants to the Scottish government are clearly insufficient for most Scottish voters. But what can be done? First, the Government must break the cycle of devolving in a panic. Ministers must be clear that they want to reform the constitution because they understand the urgent need to do so, not because they are appeasing nationalists out of fear. And second, their approach must be guided by principle: decentralisation, not devolution, and equality, not disparity, between the four nations.This means moving quickly to a fully-fledged federal model, with a government and parliament for each of the four nations, and a federal government and parliament residing in Westminster. Core functions – foreign policy, defence, international trade and aid, national security, immigration and border control, citizenship, extradition, monetary policy, the constitution and the maintenance of the UK single market – would rest with the federal government. Everything else, including almost all tax policies, would be the responsibility of the four national governments and parliaments.There will be many arguments against this course of action. Constitutional reform is always treated as an inconvenient distraction, but as Brexit shows, where power resides matters. Some worry that England is too big for a federal structure, but if that logic were true, it would be too big for the Union itself. A federal system could anyway still weight constituencies to give a stronger voice to the smaller nations, and would make it more likely than now that a Scottish politician can become Prime Minister.Nobody should be under any illusions of the radicalism of this kind of change. It would require new constitutional laws, and a new role for the Supreme Court. It would almost certainly herald further constitutional change, with the House of Lords replaced at last. But it would bring power closer to the people. It would put right the dangerous imbalances in the way we are governed. It would avoid the kind of constitutional crises that are heading our way. And instead of yet more piecemeal and self-defeating devolution, it would be a self-confident and comprehensive offer to the people of Scotland. For that is what is now necessary. The PM should recall the wise conservative insight that if we value something and want to keep it, we must be prepared to change it. If he values the Union, and wants to avoid the wrong place in history, the change must be great.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"british citizens left stranded airlines post brexit eu residency","story":"Britons living in EU countries have been barred from returning to them after Christmas in a post-Brexit row over residency.The problems spiralled when airlines also started refusing to fly resident Britons back to Spain or Italy without the new post-Brexit foreign identity card.

The risk to young people is really very, very small indeed, as the scientists continually attest, the risk to staff is very small and of course the benefits of education are so huge.Primary schools in some parts of the country are set to defy the Government amid the rise in cases and stay closed on January 4. Mr Johnson insisted that schools are safe and said councils should abide by advice to reopen in most places other than areas identified as Covid hotspots. Education Secretary Gavin Williamson held an emergency Cabinet Office meeting on January 1 after eight local authorities sent a letter pointing out that areas with higher transmission rates were missing from a list of 50 education authorities told to close schools.Four national teaching unions have called for the delay to apply to all schools in England amid concerns the new strain of Covid-19 poses a threat to teachers, but Ofsted\u0027s chief inspector Amanda Spielman said children\u0027s time out of the classroom should be kept to the absolute minimum.Anne Longfield, the Children\u0027s Commissioner for England, echoed Mrs Spielman\u0027s sentiments and called for teachers to be vaccinated as a priority.Some councils have taken matters into their own hands, such as Brighton and Hove City Council, which advised its primary schools to reopen remotely despite government advice.The Prime Minister said: My message to such councils is that they should be guided by the public health advice, which at the moment is that schools are safe in those areas where we\u0027re not being driven by the new variant to close them.Senior government sources have admitted some schools could stay shut until mid-February if Tier 4 restrictions fail.Asked if he would close primary schools if the restrictions could not contain the virus, Mr Johnson said: We\u0027ve got to keep things under constant review but we will be driven not by any political considerations but entirely by the public health question.Ministers will review school closures on January 18.The overwhelming majority of primary schools are opening as planned on January 4, Gavin Williamson said, but in a small number of Tier 4 areas where infection rates are highest, only vulnerable pupils and the children of key workers will attend primary schools in person.  Every school has been instructed to draw up plans to ensure children continue to receive an education even if they have to stay at home.Keeping schools open as long as possible is uppermost in all of our plans, Mr Williamson told the Commons.The evidence about the new Covid variant and rising infection rates have required some immediate adjustment to our plans for the new term.Read more on the tier system: In the following areas, primary schools will only open for vulnerable children and children of key workers on January 4:Pupils will return to secondary schools on a staggered basis during the first full three weeks of January. This is to allow for mass Covid testing, in which pupils in Year 11 and Year 13 will be prioritised because of GCSE and A-Level studies.This means most secondary school pupils will stay at home until at least Jan 18, when secondary schools and colleges will reopen fully after two weeks of mass testing - two weeks after term was supposed to start.Because the Covid infection rate is particularly high among this age group, we are going to allow more time so that every school and college is able to roll-out testing for all of its pupils and staff, Mr Williamson said.This kind of mass testing will benefit everyone in the community. It will break those chains of transmission.When schools reopened in September the Government published 25,000 words of guidance explaining how school children and staff should be kept safe.Older children will be encouraged to avoid close contact with one another, in part because risks increase with age. Teachers are not restricted to a single bubble, but are urged to stay at the front of any classroom to reduce contact. In class, pupils must sit spaced out side-by-side and facing forward.The use of the staff room by teachers is also meant to be “minimised”. Schools must contact local health protection teams immediately so those in close contact with the child can be traced. Currently, pupils in a bubble, year group and very rarely the entire school could be asked to self-isolate. A mobile testing unit could be sent to a campus. Schools will be offered serial testing of close contacts of staff and pupils who test positive to negate the need for entire year groups to self-isolate at home.Teachers who help a child with symptoms do not have to self-isolate unless they develop symptoms themselves. However, they should thoroughly wash their hands and wear PPE while with the child. The area where someone suspected of having Covid-19 has been must then be intensively cleaned.If a parent insists a child with symptoms should attend school, the headteacher can refuse to take the pupil if they believe there is a threat to others.Staff will also supply and promote the use of tissues as part of the “catch it, bin it, kill it” technique to control germs.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"snobbish macrons pathetic posturing has turned brexiteer","story":"In the end, he couldn’t help himself. Emmanuel Macron just had to mention Brexit in his traditional television New Year address to the nation. It was “born of many lies and false promises”, he said. Yes, Britons would remain “our neighbours, friends and allies”, but France’s sovereignty lay “in Europe”. In 2020, we had “protected our interests, our industries, our fishermen and our European unity”.Macron faces an uphill re-election campaign a year from now. The youngest president of the French Republic ever, the first to wave as many blue-and-gold EU flags as tricolours during his victorious 2017 campaign, he got the top job because he looked different from all the tired political warhorses from either side. But Macron has now lost his mojo: to gilets jaunes protests, pensions reform unrest and, finally, to Covid.Each time, he was, with some reason, accused of being elitist, out of touch, contemptuous of the common people. He believes even more European integration will save both France and his bacon (he doesn’t really see a difference). And increasingly, both his technocratic inclination and political calculations push him to Britain-bashing. Hence his vindictiveness in the last days before Boris Johnson’s Christmas deal, including the closure of the border. At the last minute, EU Commission president Ursula von der Leyen had to take over the brunt of the negotiation, to prevent the no-deal the French professed to “prefer to a bad deal”. This outlook is largely due to the smug anti-British sentiment that has prevailed since the 2016 referendum among the French chattering classes, Macron’s natural habitat.I remember, barely a week after the Leave victory, attending a public conference of Paris Europlace, the body representing the bulk of French financial institutions, most of which are headed and peopled by the exact type of technocrat embodied by Macron. “We shall feast on the carcass of the City of London,” the Europlace then-president announced, to near-universal glee in the audience. The general attitude was “kick the Brits out, don’t yield an inch, they never were Europeans at heart”.Over the past four and a half years, I have taken part in scores of French television debates, and the tone never varied. The notion of a choice motivated by a desire for political sovereignty was always pooh-poohed. Brexit was only ever a trick perpetrated to satisfy Boris’s naked ambition a cruel joke played by an Eton-educated cynic and his cohorts. As it happens, I’ve always seen Brexit as a bit of an own goal. It seemed to me that when you’re the second or third-largest economy in the bloc, you can push things your way from the inside. I also saw the benefit of having a truly free-trading country, which also happened to be France’s only serious military partner, in the EU mix. But for the first time since this all started I’ve become so angry with the EU (and with my own country ’s leaders ) that my heart now supports the Brexiteers. After one too many TV debates when, just because I tried to explain the Leavers’ motivations, I got talked down by assorted representatives of the European establishment, each more dismissive and self-satisfied than the other, the current omnishambles of the EU’s health policy power grab was the last straw. Health remains broadly outside the purview of the EU – or at least it does for now. The collective purchasing of vaccines by the 27 was intended to show how much more efficient the EU would be than inidual nations. But, as was superbly uncovered by the German news magazine Der Spiegel, this was one case of mission creep too far. While Britain started to vaccinate in droves, the EU’s vaccination campaign was delayed for weeks because they chose to buy from six suppliers equal amounts of doses even though three of those – national champions like France’s Sanofi – are years away from producing a vaccine.Germany’s excellent health minister, Jens Spahn, eventually forced his government to buy separately tens of millions of Pfizer vaccine doses. I’m afraid we French went the opposite way. Our Vaccination Czar was wheeled out to say that it was an excellent thing that the process was so slow – just as back in March we were told that we didn’t need masks because we had none available – because the logistics chain for the Pfizer vaccine was not fit for purpose.In both cases, we have needed the EU like a fish needs a bicycle.

It is thinking about breaking essentially every possible route of transmission we possibly can. Those are the things that are absolutely necessary and it is pretty clear we\u0027re going to need more.We have a much more transmissible variant and I’m afraid this is the natural evolution of viruses - the ones that can transmit the most effectively have an advantage over other variants.It is important to note that it doesn’t seem to cause worse disease or that it is going to be more resistant to the effects of the vaccine, but it is going to be hard to keep it under control without much tighter social distancing measures.When asked if he thought that schools also would need to close as part of these measures, he said: We know transmission happens within schools, we know that a person between 12 and 16 is seven times more likely than others in a household to bring an infection into a household.Sizeable chunks of the Midlands, the North East and parts of the North West are now living under Tier 4 restrictions.Andrew Hayward, professor of infectious diseases epidemiology at University College London, and a member of the Government\u0027s New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (Nervtag) , told BBC Radio 4\u0027s Today programme on Dec 29: I think we are entering a very dangerous new phase of the pandemic and we\u0027re going to need decisive, early, national action to prevent a catastrophe in January and February.A 50 per cent increase in transmissibility means that the previous levels of restrictions that worked before won\u0027t work now, and so Tier 4 restrictions are likely to be necessary or even higher than that.I think we\u0027re really looking at a situation where we\u0027re moving into near lockdown, but we\u0027ve got to learn the lessons from the first lockdown.Rules in Tier 4 are similar to those of the last national lockdown:Pressure has been mounting on ministers to expand Tier 4 restrictions in the face of increasing strain on hospitals in England, where the number of patients has surpassed the April peak of the first wave.On Dec 29, the NHS England chief executive Sir Simon Stevens warned that doctors and nurses are back in the eye of the storm.Speaking on the Marr show on Jan 3, the Prime Minister said: It is bumpy and it\u0027s going to be bumpy.On Jan 2, the UK recorded  57,725 new cases of Covid-19, with cases topping 50,000 for five days running. An additional 445 deaths within 28 days of positive test were also recorded. This took the country\u0027s total to 74,570.Healthcare workers have pleaded with people to take the restrictions seriously, as hospitals report huge difficulties with capacity and staffing. Saffron Cordery, the deputy chief executive of NHS Providers, said some trusts were reporting up to three times the number of Covid patients as at the peak of the first wave.This means hospitals and also ambulance services in Tier 4 areas and beyond are incredibly busy, compounded by increasing staff absences due to illness and the need to self-isolate, she said.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"should kids go school today","story":"NewsShould my kids go to school today  Full list of areas where primaries are staying shutHundreds of primary schools will stay shut today as children should have ed from the Christmas holidays - the Government has advised that those in London and parts of the South East do not openmirrorShareCommentsByEmma BowdenJeremy CulleyAssistant Editor:,  JAN NewsExperts fear the new iant is more transmissible among children \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get US and UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

The shocking revelation came as the NHS ramped up its immunisation programme following the approval of the Oxford AstraZeneca jab. The first doses are set to be given tomorrow.However more than  constituencies have been left without hubs for the vaccine - despite neighbouring areas having some of the most in England, analysis by the Sunday Times revealed. Do you live in an area without a vaccine hub  Let us know in the comments section below.People living in North West Durham have no hospital hubs or local vaccination services, however a short leap away in Bishop Auckland there are three. Just east of North West Durham in Stockton North, residents have access to four hubs - making it one of the areas with the most in England. Other areas including Gainsborough, Newark and Sherwood also have no access to vaccine hubs. Their closest hubs are located miles away in the likes of Leeds Central and Corby, who have a combined seven centres. Along the eastern coast, places including Suffolk Central, North Norfolk, Braintree and Cambridge sit in a dry spot where neighbouring towns have a maximum of two centres. North Warwickshire and Meriden are both home to more than three hubs - however surrounding areas including Nuneaton, Coventry South and Bromsgrove have zero. The Oxford AstraZeneca jab approval came almost a month after rollout of the vaccine developed by Pfizer and BioNTech began, with more than one million people having now received their first dose. This works out at around , vaccines per week but two million Brits need to get the jab every week for le toto some form of normality by Easter, experts have said.  But NHS England data analysed by the Sunday Times shows that million of Englandaposs million population live in areas with no vaccine centre.  vaccine centres have so far been set up in hospitals, GP practices and community buildings across England.

The couple had no idea about the impending pandemic and say the purpose of their stay on the  acre rocky chunk of land was simply to take  months out to enjoy a slower pace of le. While taking scenic walks, going fishing and tending to homegrown crops, Luke, , and Sarah, , have easily managed to remain isolated and keep themselves clear of Covid-. Luke, a joiner by trade, said: Itaposs been really weird and strange hearing about everything thataposs happening while being isolated on this little island. As you can imagine, we havenapost had to worry about social distancing. He added: The experience as a whole has been incredible. The pace of le is so slow but itaposs lovely, we spend our days out walking with the dogs, growing our own food and learning new skills.Itaposs not for everyone but we have loved it. Owey Island is a small patch of land off the coast of Donegal containing a handful of properties with no schools or shops and only two narrow roads going through it. Luke and Sarah are living in a small cottage using coal fires to keep warm, a tank to collect rainwater, gas bottles to cook and solar  to charge their electrical items.They use the collected water as well as water from a well to wash themselves and clean their clothes while growing their own food for sustenance, raising hens for eggs and even braving the seas for fish. Luke said he started as a rubbish fisherman and that he isnapost much better now but added he has been able to learn how to catch pollock, the most common type of fish in the area. Due to their living conditions he also learned the old fashioned preparation technique of salting his catch so that it can be stored and remain edible for months on end.The coupleaposs only way off the island is via dinghy around three quarters of a mile to another island, which is connected to the mainland by a bridge. While there are some houses on Owey they are only inhabited in the summer months and, according to local history books, the last time anyone spent the winter there was . Luke and Sarah are originally from Leeds, West Yorks., but were enjoying le living in the Scottish Highlands when the chance to move to Ireland presented itself.They noticed an advert online offering the opportunity to become the tenants of a small cottage there and decided the chance was too good to pass up so decided to take a year off from work. According to Luke, the homeowner wanted to prove itaposs possible to spend an entire winter season on Owey in a bid to encourage others to do the same in the future. Luke said other residents started arriving on the island as summer  approached and that many helped them by teaching them about how to survive the conditions.  He added: Over the summer the community feeling here is great. But as soon as autumn started coming in everyone left and we were left on our own, luckily we were well prepared to cope thanks to the help of other people. Luke said him and we Sarah pass the time in Owey by tending to the property, reading and playing with their two rescue dogs, both staffies, which they took with them. Luckily, thanks to nearby shipping lanes, the couple are able to get good signal on their phones, which means they can speak to their families back in Leeds and keep up to date with the news.

Liverpoolaposs leaders spoke out this weekend urging for action to be taken to prevent a aposcatastropheapos. The cityaposs acting mayor, councillor Wendy Simon, and the Labour-run city councilaposs cabinet say the speed of the rise in coronavirus cases, driven by the virulent new strain, have reached alarming levels. They added that urgent action is now required to save lives and the NHS. The new strain of Covid- transmits faster and is most prevalent in London and the South East, where hospitals have become stretched. Do you think there should be a third national lockdown  Let us know in the comments section below. It is believed the strain is spreading from south to north, leading to increasing pressure on the NHS. Cases in Liverpool have almost trebled in the past two weeks to  per ,, despite the city successfully leading on the national pilot for community testing which led to it being the first city to be taken out of Tier  and into Tier . The call for a new lockdown was made in a statement from the city council, from Cllr Wendy Simon and Cabinet Member for Public Health, Cllr Paul Brant. The statement said: It is clear that the country is now at a crossroads with Covid-. The stark reality is that today this virulent new strain of the virus is very much on the rise and we need to act now to prevent a crisis that will unleash even more pain and anguish. We need the government to listen to those at the frontline, both in our hospitals and frontline services.  We as a nation can cope with a lockdown. We have before and we can again. The quicker we move into one now, the more lives will be saved and the quicker a recovery will be. Yes, there will be pain for our retail and hospitality sectors, but they want long term security and a strong recovery and a lockdown provides both. An additional package of welfare and economic support will also be needed, especially to protect the most vulnerable. The councillors said it was self-evident the tier system is not working to curb the virus. They added: Londonaposs rates are a huge cause for concern and we will soon see those rates here and across the rest of the country.  Letaposs get ahead of the curve and act now. We all know too well the dire consequences and costswe donapost, particularly to the most vulnerable in our communities. Millions of Britons have made many sacrices these past  months and none of us want to see those efforts go to waste. Much progress has been made to limit the virus, but we can only do so much as iniduals.

The executive head teacher of the top-performing primary school told parents she would keep her own children at home.Marish Academy Trust head Gill Denham warned that she cannot guarantee pupils will not be exposed to the virus, reports Berkshire Live.The trust runs Marish and Willow primary schools in Slough made the comments on the eve of schools reopening tomorrow.Slough has one of the highest coronavirus infection rates in the country.The Government is under increasing pressure to keep them closed to curb the spread of Covid-. Slough Borough Council and teaching union representatives have been lobbying the Department for Education since Wednesday over their dismay at education secretary Gavin Williamsonaposs announcement that schools in the area would be reopening on Monday. Yet those warnings of the potential risks to teachers and pupils in an area where the infection rate is . cases per , people - and akin to London boroughs - has so far not been heeded. The Government has been accused of creating chaos with the National Education Union- telling teachers it was not safe for them toto the classroom. In a letter to parents, Mrs Denham wrote: Like many of you the leadership of Marish Academy Trust are surprised that Slough schools have not been included within the contingency plan which mandates the closure.  Neither I, or any other school leader in Slough can guarantee that pupils or staff will not be exposed to the virus in school or on the way to or from school, when our experience has already shown us that Covid- can easily spread through a community, she wrote.  It is a question of how long before we have multiple cases and bubble and whole school closure, rather than whether we will get any. Already we have had to make dficult choices on a weekly basis about children and staff who are clinically extremely vulnerable.The trust had to shut down both schools a week earlier than planned for the  Christmas  holidays as a surge in cases left so many staff members absent meaning it was no longer safe to operate.And with pupils due totomorrow there is growing confusion and concern among school leaders as to whether they will be able to reopen, with Mrs Denham giving parents the green light to keep their children off school,they felt it was necessary, and switch to online learning.  As a parent and grandparent myself,I feel that the risk of my child or someone  in my family contracting Covid- is too high,they attend school from Monday, I would keep them at home, she wrote. It may be that this is the decision some of you come to for your own families. Rest assured, online learning will be provided for all those pupils who do not attend in person. Marish and Willow schools will remain open for the children of key workers, those with vulnerabilities or any pupils whose parents want them to attend. Ordinarily, Marish Academy Trust prides itself on having high pupil attendance, but in these extraordinary circumstances, we will not be recommending fines or any action is taken against any parent who does not send their child into school during January . In a tweet to his constituents and , followers, Slough MP Tan Dhesi said many parents had contacted him with concerns about schools reopening. He said it was a Government decision but he had discussed the issue with Slough Council leadership, which was consulting with local schools on their views. Slough Council have reached out to schools to ascertain views and we’ll take steps accordingly. Boris Johnson  has so far refused to yield to growing pressure saying he has no doubt that schools are safe and parents should send primary-age kids back to the classroom."},{"url":null,"title":"kevin maguire happy new year","story":"NewsopinionKevin Maguire: Happy New Year  More like same old misery thanks to Boris JohnsonThe Mirrors man in Westminster wrings his hands as a new years potential for change and progress is thwarted by the presence of our blundering buffoon of a Prime MinistermirrorShareCommentsByKevin MaguireAssociate editor:,  JAN Updated:,  JAN NewsopinionNew year, same old Boris Johnson \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

It’s the same old incompetent Boris Johnson in Downing Street. The bumbling ­ditherer seems unable to grasp that ­immediate tighter virus restrictions are required to save lives. Boasting that many schools will reopen today while simultaneously conceding that they will need to shut in a few weeks is unforgivably reckless vacillation that will cost hundreds, maybe thousands, of lives. With pupils spreading Covid-, a strong PM would act with urgency. But Johnson is weak, indecisive, confused, bullied by Tory critics and obsessed with popularity. Decisive leaders accept flak as part of the job.  Labour head Keir Starmer is guilty of hedging his bets on schools but Major Foresight’s latest demand is highly likely to be followed again by a Private Hindsight eventually falling into line. Dawdling Johnson’s refusal to follow the logic of his own arguments until it’s too late is Einstein’s definition of insanity: doing the same thing over and over again and somehow expecting a dferent result. The Premier is a terrible part of the problem when delaying tougher controls in March, October and December piled countless bodies on a funeral pyre topping ,. The NHS struggling to treat an explosion in cases between Christmas and the New Year underlines the idiocy of his intention to create a Santa super-spreader. Given his terrible record of ­ineptitude, turning a drama into a crisis and a crisis into a catastrophe, Johnson is still capable of blowing the vaccination programme.

The newspaper also reports that a further announcement on school closures could come as soon as this week After Prime Minister Boris Johnson signalled tougher restrictions would be brought in within weeks, pressure mounted on the Government to act far more swtly as Labour demanded a lockdown within hours.Opposition leader Sir Keir Starmer accused the Prime Minister of presiding over a chaotic response to the coronavirus pandemic as he insisted on new restrictions immediately to try to regain control of the situation. Sir Keir told reporters the Prime Minister should not hint at new restrictions within weeks but, instead, act now. The Labour leader said: The virus is clearly out of control. We canapost allow the Prime Minister to use up the next two or three weeks and then bring in a national lockdown which is inevitable. Do it now. Thataposs the necessary first step to get the virus back under control. Speaking on Sunday as controversy raged over whether more schools should be shut, Sir Keir said further closures of classrooms were inevitable. Sir Keir insisted new moves must be part of a wider strategy that has a national lockdown in place in the next  hours.  He added: The Prime Minister is hinting at it, but heaposs not doing it. We canapost afford that delay again. Letaposs not have the Prime Minister saying aposIaposm going to do it, but not yetapos, thataposs the problem he has made so many times. In response to the comments, a Number  source said: The Prime Minister has been consistently clear that we are driven by the need to protect the NHS and save lives - unlike Labour who have spent the last ten months playing party politics. We have moved more areas into Tier  to bear down on the new iant and escalated other areas into Tier . This targeted approach is the right one, and is kept under review based on the latest data.

Boris Johnson has hinted the UK could plunged into another lockdown as new iants of the virus rip through the population, and more patients die alone without their loved ones by their sides. But the Prime Minister has refused to bow to pressure to shut schools to curb the spread of the virus during one of Britainaposs worst weeks of the pandemic. A further  people died with coronavirus in the  hours to Sunday, bringing the UKaposs pandemic death toll to ,. And today marked the sixth day in a row of , daily cases, after , infections were recorded. As reported exclusively by the Mirror, surging admissions have left Dr Katie Sandersonaposs colleagues fearing for their lives due to aposinadequateapos PPE. Now Dr Sanderson, who works in acute medicine at a central London hospital, has shared her experience on the frontline with Mirror readers. In her own words, here is her account in full: We’re so much better at managing Covid than we were at the beginning of the pandemic, and the challenges of today are dferent to wave one, when we didn’t know how to manage the illness and hospitals weren’t set up for it.   This time the sheer volume of seriously ill patients turning up at the doors of AE, and the challenge of caring for them with finite staff, means that many hospitals in London and the south east are in dficulty. In the end the limiting factor is staff, and ultimately more patients means less time for us as doctors to spend with each one. Our nurses are stretched ever thinner, to a point where people just can’t be looked after as we would want them to be.  The capacity of Intensive Therapy Unitsis important, but most patients aren’t looked after in ITU – we are looking after very sick patients on medical wards, where I work - wards which usually wouldn’t see patients nearly this unwell. Even with normal levels of staffing this would be a challenge, but staff absence is approaching % in some areas. Staff are scared, because the PPE mandated for healthcare workers in the UK is woefully inadequate. What do you think  Share your views in the comments below... But staff in ITUs are better protected, and have lower levels of infection, illness and death rates, than those on medical wards, who are are exposed to high levels of the virus in a thin plastic apron, gloves, an ill- fitting fluid-resistant surgical mask, and some eye protection. As I put on and take off for the hundredth time, I think to myself ‘well it’s better than nothing’, and wonder how on earth it has come to this, nine months in.  Time enough to create a human le, but not to provide hundreds of thousands of workers with the basic wherewithal to protect theirs. Things are incredibly dficult now. Hospitals are doing everything they can to expand ITU and ward capacities, with all hands on deck, even flying patients out to other parts of the country. We want to give everyone who gets Covid the best possible chance of survival. But every new, preventable infection compromises this. What is essential now is that people do everything they can not to get the virus, because in ten days a proportion will become severely ill, and hospitals will be under even more pressure than they are today. This week I sat with a dying man, across the bed from his we. She said to me, ‘How did this happen  We have been so careful ’  The answer is that this new strain is incredibly infectious. We need to go back to the absolute basics, and everyone needs to pull together and do everything they can to ensure that fewer people die. Don’t have any social contact you don’t need to have, wear a mask, wash your hands and socially distance. Isolateyou have symptoms, and isolateyou have come into contact with somebody with coronavirus. Don’t make up your own rules. And don’t think this is a disease that only affects other people. We have people in their twenties in the ITU with no medical history. Every day we see very sick patients who, when askedthey have medical problems, say no. So many of the people referred to as having pre-existíng conditions lead rich, active lives that would have continued for decades had they not been cut short by Covid. We want all these people to have a fighting chance, and that chance is comprised by every new infection. Every new infection is a potential hospital admission. What is hardest for me, working with patients who are dying, is not having the time to give them the best end possible. Good communication takes time – and I believe that looking after people who won’t make it is every bit as important as manning an ITU.

Sir John Bell, said the South Africa iant is more concerning than the Kent strain by some margin because of how quickly it can spread. The professor believes the South Africa strain is already in the UK at very low levels, he told Times Radio today. The South Africa strain of Covid was discovered before Christmas and is named .V. Experts have stressed thereaposs no evidence this new strain is more deadly, but it did see the number of people testing positive for Covid more than treble in three weeks in South Africa. Two cases of the South Africa iant were discovered in the UK on December . Sir John added that a new vaccine could be made in four to six weeksthe current ones do not work on new iants.He stressed that thereaposs no definitive answer yet as to whether the Pfizer and Oxford vaccines would work on the South Africa coronavirus iant or not.The professor did say, however, that thereaposs no data that suggests the South Africa iant is more dangerous than the Kent one, only that it is more infectious. When asked which iant he was more concerned about, Sir John said: The South African by some margin. They both have multiple dferent mutations in them. The mutations in the South African form are pretty substantial changes. When askedthe South Africa strain is more dangerous, Sir John replied: No thereaposs no data. Itaposs more infectious for sure. The South Africans are clearly struggling with it although they canapost give us any data at the moment.  The question many will be wanting an answer to is whether the current Covid vaccines will work against the South Africa strain of the virus. Sir John said the team in Oxford are right now looking at how the vaccine could tackle dferent iants. He said: Thereaposs still the research to be done, butyou want my gut feeling, I think the vaccine will be effective against the Kent strain and I donapost know about the South African strain. I think thereaposs a big question mark above that. Weaposve got a bit of head room with the vaccines because I think they work much better than a lot of us thought they were going to work. They essentially completely prevent severe disease so we do have some room to manoeuvre.He added: Itaposs unlikely these mutations will turn off the effect of vaccines entirely. I think youaposll still have a residual effect so itaposs a question over whether we can make it work. If we canapost itaposs perfectly possible to make new vaccines and that will not take a year. Weaposre now in a game of cat and mouse because these arenapost the only two iants weaposre going to see. Thereaposs going to be lots of iants. Keen to reassure listeners, he added: Everybody should stay calm itaposs going to be fine. On December  Health Secretary Matt Hancock ordered anyone who had been in South Africa in the past two weeks - and their contacts - to isolate immediately. Scientists at Porton Down laboratories are carrying out urgent studies on the new strain - which South African authorities say appears to have a larger impact on young people. South Africa recorded more than , excess deaths in . In the UK, the Kent iant of Covid is believed to have begun in one person.

Dr Katie Sanderson, , told how surging admissions at her London trust are driving exhausted staff to breaking point as case numbers run out of control. In a frightening interview, she tells of :Woefully inadequate levels of PPE that are leaving struggling staff “scared”. Bewildered young patients with no medical history arriving seriously ill with the virus – leaving one dead. Intensive care units so swamped victims who would normally be sent there are being cared for on wards.Dr Sanderson, who works in acute medicine at a central London hospital we are not naming, also said soaring admissions combined with staff shortages were depriving patients of the care they deserved.  She told of the deepening NHS nightmare as experts warned the iant is spreading so fast hospitals nationwide could be overrun in weeks. Pressure has been so great on hospitals in London and the South East some patients have been moved out of the area to Yorkshire. Now the capital’s weekly rate of cases is  per , people – double the UK average. “Things are incredibly dficult now,” said a shattered Dr Sanderson. “Hospitals are doing everything they can – with all hands on deck, even flying patients out to other parts. SCROLL DOWN TO READ DR SANDERSONaposS VIEW IN HER OWN WORDS “We want to give everyone who gets Covid the best possible chance of survival. But every new preventable infection compromises this. “In the end the limiting factor is staff, and ultimately more patients means less time for us as doctors to spend with each one. “Our nurses are stretched ever thinner, to a point where people can’t be looked after how we’d want them to be. The capacity of intensive care units is important, but most patients aren’t looked after in ITU. “We are caring for very sick people on wards that usually wouldn’t see patients this unwell.” And Dr Sanderson says proper protection for our NHS heroes remains an issue. “Staff here are scared, because the PPE mandated for healthcare workers in the UK is woefully inadequate,” she said. Staff in ITUs are better protected, and have lower levels of infection, illness and death rates – but those on the wards are exposed to high levels of the virus in a thin plastic apron, gloves, an ill-fitting fluid-resistant surgical mask, and some eye protection. Dr Sanderson said: “As I put on and take off PPE, I think to myself ‘well it’s better than nothing’, and wonder how on Earth it has come to this, nine months in. Time enough to create a human le, but not to provide hundreds of thousands of workers with the wherewithal to protect theirs.” She has witnessed a rise in intensive care patients in their s with no medical history. She said: “This week I sat with a dying man, across the bed from his we. She said to me, ‘How did this happen  We have been so careful ’ The answer is this new strain is incredibly infectious.” The UK saw a record , confirmed cases on Saturday. A further  deaths were also recorded within  days of a positive test.  But health experts fear this week’s figures will be “mild” compared to coming weeks, which could see Nightingale hospitals on standby. An Imperial College London study has found the new iant is hugely more infectious, causing Covid transmissions to rocket even during the November lockdown. Royal College of Physicians president Prof Andrew Goddard said: “Christmas will have a big impact, the new iant is also going to have a big impact. I think the large numbers we’re seeing in the South East, in London, in south Wales, will be reflected over the next month or two in the rest of the country.” He said fellow doctors were “really worried”. Prof Goddard added: “Be under no illusion about the unprecedented pressures we are facing. Numbers testing positive are rising in what is traditionally the busiest time of year for the NHS.  “We have hope around the corner as the vaccination programme kicks in but everyone has a responsibility to play their part.” Doctors’ fears worsened after intensive care units at three London hospitals were declared full this week.

Anne waited two years to thank dental student Sean Haycock for helping her to beat leukaemia for the second time. When they finally got to hug in , Sean revealed he was about to donate more cells to cure another woman with blood cancer, just as he had saved Anne. Anne, , said: “Sean gave me the ultimate gt, he saved my le. He’s my hero. I was so excited to meet him for the first time. It made Christmas so special. “I couldn’t believe it when he told me he was going to donate again. I felt very emotional, because I knew how much it would mean to that person. I hope all three of us can meet up one day.”  Sean said: “I was nervous about meeting Anne but when she walked in, it felt like I had known her for years.” Anne was first diagnosed with chronic myeloid leukaemia in . She dismissed her symptoms – night sweats, fatigue and pain in her side – as the menopause, until a blood test revealed she had high levels of defective white blood cells. She had to take chemotherapy tablets and attend check-ups every three months, and the cancer went into remission. But  years later a blood test revealed that Anne, who has a daughter Lynsey, had developed a dferent kind of leukaemia. The seamstress, from Shipley in West Yorkshire, said: “They told me it was very rare to have two types of leukaemia. I’d been looking a bit pale and feeling tired. I went to pieces. It felt so unfair.” This time, Anne could not manage the disease with drugs. She needed a stem cell transplant but none of her family matched her rare blood tissue group. Her only hope was to find a stranger on the donor register. Luckily Sean, , was a match and Anne said: “It was such a relief.” Anne spent three months having chemotherapy to blast the cancer and prepare her body for a transplant, wiping out her own immune system so it would not try to fight Sean’s transplanted cells. Anne said: “I was so weak I couldn’t get up to have a shower. I began to wondermy body was going to get better but my family and friends kept me going.”  Blood cancer charity Anthony Nolan arranged for Sean, who studied in New-castle, to travel to the Royal Hallamshire Hospital in Sheffield to donate his cells. Strict protocols to protect the donor and recipient’s identities meant Anne could only write to Sean after  days to thank him but could not include any information that might identy her. The pair became penpals and Sean said: “Those letters made it hit home what I had done. It convinced a lot of my friends to join the stem cell register.” After two years the pair were allowed to meet and Anne and her family travelled to Sean’s home in County Durham, where his parents laid on a festive spread.

Matthew Pottinger, who is President Donald Trump’s respected Deputy National Security Adviser, told politicians from around the world that even China’s leaders now openly admit their previous claims that the virus originated in a Wuhan market are . Mr Pottinger said that the latest intelligence points to the virus leaking from the top-secret Wuhan Institute of Virology,  miles from the market, saying: There is a growing body of evidence that the lab is likely the most credible source of the virus. He claimed the pathogen may have escaped through a ‘leak or an accident’, adding: Even establishment figures in Beijing have openly dismissed the wet market story.The comments, which were made during a Zoom conference with MPs on China last week, come as a team of experts from the World Health Organisation prepare to fly to Wuhan to investigate how the pandemic began. Iain Duncan Smith, the former Tory Party leader who attended the meeting, said Mr Pottinger’s comments represented a ‘stfening’ of the US position on the theory that the virus came from a leak at the laboratory, amid reports that the Americans are talking to a whistleblower from the Wuhan institute.  I was told the US have an ex-scientist from the laboratory in America at the moment, he said. That was what I heard a few weeks ago. I was led to believe this is how they have been able to stfen up their position on how this outbreak originated. He added that Beijing’s refusal to allow journalists to visit the laboratory only served to increase suspicion that it was ‘ground zero’ for the pandemic. Claims the virus leaked from a lab in Wuhan have been dismissed by Beijing as conspiracy theory. Early in the pandemic, China denied the allegation.

The blunder resulted in viewers seeing only the lower part of Putinaposs face during the broadcast by a news channel in Kaliningrad, the countryaposs most westerly region. The -year-old appeared with his eyes and forehead cut out as he spoke to Russians against a backdrop of the Kremlin. The embarrassing scandal by the channel in the region was blamed on a technical glitch rather than political protests. Kaskad TV fell short of apologising to the President but said in a statement those responsible would be punished. The President’s annual address is traditionally broadcast a few minutes before midnight in each of Russia’s  time zones, and has a status akin to the Queen’s Christmas Day message in Britain and the Commonwealth. A video of the blunder was recorded by a shocked viewer in Kaliningrad, and the incident sparked quickfire social media comments on his beheading.  “Were the guilty shot yet ” asked one commenter. “He is a KGB man after all, no-one should see his full face,” posted another. “Everyone knows that there is only botox up there,” said one more. Another viewer observed that this was “quite a brave channel”, while a further post predicted: “Kaput to Kaskad TV.  Editors at the TV station realised the error and aborted the broadcast on both television and the internet, replacing it with music. “Problems with the image during the broadcast of Vladimir Putin’s New Year address were caused by a technical glitch in the broadcasting room,” said red-faced bosses at the channel. “An investigation of the incident is ongoing. “Those who are guilty will be punished.  “Kaskas Media Group offers sincere apologies to the viewers.”  A few minutes earlier, a broadcast of New Year message by the regional governor Anton Alikhanov was screened without mishap. Due to its location on the Baltic Sea, Kaliningrad is the last Russian region to hear Putin’s address, an hour after Moscow. Putin used the broadcast to lament about the dficulties caused by Covid-, but also to urge Russians to have faith in themselves.He noted that “not all of us are at the New Year table right now” due to deaths and illness caused by the coronavirus, but praised the work of doctors and the emergency services."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/syndicatenews/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/10/19983080_36603864-e1602413271428-620x372.jpg ","title":"dundee in 2020 qa george cran on expectations the spfl vote and charlie adams goals","story":"This past year has been one like no other, not just for Scottish football but the entire world as the worst pandemic in a century struck.The unprecedented crisis brought unprecedented responses and restrictions to daily le.And our game was far from immune to it and Dundee Football Club ended up front and centre of a summer full of infighting, struggle and politics.On the pitch, a record across  of  points from  league games,  wins, seven draws and seven defeats in all competitions doesn’t tell the whole story.George Cran takes a look at what does…That’s a tricky one. At the start of  there wasn’t any expectation Dundee – or anyone  – could catch Dundee United at the top of the Championship table.The play-offs were then abolished when the pandemic struck and the Dark Blues’ route back to the top flight disappeared.It was a mad-cap summer with votes, politicking and arguments aplenty – I’m sure there’s at least a couple of clubs out there who’d say Dundee fell short of their expectations through all!On the pitch, though, when the ball came back out in October there’s no doubt the Dark Blues are well short of where they should be with the squad available to them.The expectation was they’d be up with Hearts and Dunfermline, setting out a claim for the title and promotion – they’ve been nowhere near the Jambos since the opening day of the season.Hopes of hauling back the gap to Robbie Neilson’s men are all but extinguished going into . That leaves the play-offs.The talent in the Dark Blues squad makes promotion through that route possible – they absolutely need to find some consistency in their defending before then, though.This is Dundee we’re talking about – it’s nearly all crazy!It has to be the SPFL vote getting stuck in the governing body’s spam folder. It’s classic Scottish football.I remember the Friday night of the vote and laughing because it looked like one club had gamed the system and waited to see what everyone  had voted for.At that point Dundee told us they’d sent in their ‘no’ vote and were wondering who still hadn’t voted. So our paper was ready to go before the Friday night deadline.Then it emerged the PDF of the voting slip with John Nelms’ signature on hadn’t arrived and the Dark Blues were holding all the cards on whether to end the season and give out much-needed prize money or start again with a dferent plan.Dundee’s actions were within the rules, however there was an element of Machiavellianism from Mr Nelms in trying to force league reconstruction.There have been a few in  for Dundee. Some results: the - hiding dished out by Hearts, letting a three-goal lead slip against Dunfermline as well as another collapse at Hibs.However, the departure of Kane Hemmings was a real sore one for the club and supporters alike.The manner of the striker leaving, too, left a bad taste in the mouth.It#s a Dundee Derby goal from Kane Hemmings, complete with trademark celebration and his old number ⃣⃣ jersey! 😎#SPFLChristmas | @DundeeFC pic wfIcXmdash SPFLDecember , The backdrop to it all was the huge financial worry that had engulfed the club, budgets were slashed, coaches and staff were made redundant while players and coaches were asked to take wage cuts.Most of them agreed – Josh Meekings left at the end of his contract before Hemmings went back on his original agreement.He departed for boyhood club Burton Albion leaving Dees to rue what might have been had the striker stuck around.There are two to choose from. You’ve probably already guessed who they were both scored by – Charlie Adam.The first one on his league debut at Tynecastle. It was a forgettable evening for the Dark Blues but Adam’s first goal for his boyhood club should never be forgotten.A mazy dribble to beat four men before smashing the ball beyond one of the country’s top goalkeepers Craig Gordon and into the top corner. Top class stuff.But Adam managed to top that just a short time ago with an absolute raker against Dunfermline.mdash Premier Lig TurkiyeDecember , Striding forward from halfway, the midfielder unleashed a -yard thunderbolt that flew into the top corner.It was a majestic strike amid an incredible performance made more impressive by the sad news that followed of his mother’s terminal illness.With there being so few matches in  compared with every other year, there haven’t been many stand-outs against the Dark Blues.Kevin Nisbet, first for Dunfermline in scoring a wonderful goal against Dundee last season, and then for Hibs this term is a distinct possibility.However, this accolade will have to go to Mr Adam once more from me.The beauty of it for Dundee fans is I don’t think we’ve seen anything like the best of the midfielder yet at Dens Park.His performance against Dunfermline a couple of weeks ago was superb. It feels like that sort of level wasn’t a one-off for the former Scotland man, though.Possibly. We’ve not seen too much fallout from it, to be honest. Just some pettiness while up at Inverness last month.The fact there haven’t been any fans in the stands has taken away a large part of the anger we’d normally see during games.The purpose of changing votes was to bring about league reconstruction to improve our game as a whole. That was John Nelms’ aim.It may have been a naïve one, considering how Scottish football usually conducts itself – self-interest trumps all.Plans to re-jig the leagues were put on hold somewhat until next summer so we’ll have to wait and see whether the U-turn has changed anything going forward.Personally, I hope it has. In terms of regrets from Dundee, I don’t think they’ll have any, whichever way it goes.FULL QA: Dundee managing director John Nelms lts the lid on his SPFL vote U-turn\" title\"#FULL QA: Dundee managing director John Nelms lts the lid on his SPFL vote U-turn# # Evening \" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp dundee-fc-john-nelms-lts-lid-spfl-vote-u-turn embed # secretRgFiMDzjS\" data-secret\"RgFiMDzjS\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"Catching Hearts is almost gone, particularlyDundee don’t get a win against the Jambos on Saturday night.The key for manager James McPake is patching up the leaks in his defence.Too often they’ve let themselves down this term by conceding weak goals.

","title":"tightening level four restrictions what changes could the first minister announce in mondays covid 19 statement","story":"First Minister Nicola Sturgeon will announce further measures to tackle a #rapid increase# in Covid- cases to parliament on Monday.In a statement released on Sunday, Ms Sturgeon said the country must take #all steps# to slow the spread of coronavirus cases while vaccination of the population progresses.The SNP leader warned just before Christmas that the country was facing a virus that spreads #much faster# than it did in March.She added that the government was considering whether the current level four restrictions covering mainland Scotland, which were #not as stringent as the March lockdown#, would be #sufficient# to tackle the spread of the new, faster-spreading iant of the virus.Under level four restrictions, which were intended to be in place for three weeks from Boxing Day, non-essential shops have had to shut while bars, cafes and restaurants are only allowed to provide takeaway services.We take a look back at some of the measures introduced during the March lockdown, and statements made by the Scottish Government in recent days, to assess what further action could be announced on Monday.Under the current regulations, people must keep journeys within their own local authority area to an #absolute minimum#.The stay at home advice is currently guidance but speaking just before Christmas, the first minister said this could be backed up by law in a move similar to spring time.In March, stringent limits were put in place which meant people could only leave their homes to shop for #permissable reasons#.These included:Under the level four regulations, people must, by law, remain within their local authority area unless they have a reasonable excuse to travel to another.This includes for work purposes, for school or for healthcare.In a statement released on Sunday, the first minister urged the public to stay at home #as much as possible# and to #avoid non-essential interactions with other households#.Schools were due toto face-to-face learning on January  but Ms Sturgeon said last week that this was under review.Deputy First Minister John Swinney said the government#s education recovery group will meet on Monday morning in advance of cabinet to consider the current advice in relation to schools and learning.It is expected that tomorrow#s announcement will almost certainly mean a further delay to theof schools into February.Speaking on Wednesday, the first minister said she wanted to osee schoolsnormally on January  as planned but would be assessing the #up to date situation# over the next few days.She added thatthere were any changes these would be set out #as early as possible# to give parents and teachers #as much notice as possible#.From Boxing Day, all of mainland Scotland was placed into level four restrictions, with the islands moving to level three.Shetland, which remains in level three currently, was facing a potential move to level four restrictions after a recent wave of Covid- infections.One of the options which remains available to ministers is to introduce a nationwide lockdown, similar to March, in which every part of country is under the same stringent measures.No one in Scotland is permitted to visit other households indoors but there are exemptions for those who have formed extended households, to support informal childcare arrangements and for couples who do not live together.Under current restrictions, a maximum of six people from two separate households can meet outdoors in a private garden or in a park.During the first lockdown in March, it was not permitted to meet up with other households even outdoors.Shielding was initially put in place in March to protect those at greatest risk of severe complications from coronavirus from contracting the virus.The national advice to shield has ended and those who were in that category should follow the same advice as everyone  in their local council area#s protection level.Even in level four areas, there are no restrictions on socially distancing from people in the same household and it is possible to do unlimited amounts of exercise.The Scottish Government has said in its guidance that #small changes# to the infection rate will not affect this advice.However, they said people within this category may be asked to take #extra steps# to stay safethere is #an increase in infection rates that gives us concern#.Should this happen, the Scottish Government will inform iniduals of this via a letter and through the text messaging service.Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest blaize_sub_data

and has been able to begin furnishing homes once more.“As is often the case in challenging times Aberdeen didn’t let us down,” he said.“While we had to temporarily say goodbye to some of our volunteers, we were very fortunate to gain a number of new volunteers who joined to help us run the foodbank.“Our finance concerns were somewhat overturned with the access to grants set up to help charities through Covid-, these vital grants allowed us to continue to operate and serve.“We were overwhelmed with generous support from the supermarkets and many local businesses who gave us their surplus food stocks to redistribute and we were supported by generous donations from Social Bite which allowed to us to also distribute lunch bags.“In addition to distributing inidual and family food parcels, we also provided daily trays of foods to Aberdeen hostels and regularly dropped off food trays to care homes and key workers, for them to enjoy during their challenging shts.“We were regularly gted large quantities of flowers from the local supermarket which our volunteers delivered to key workers, people in isolation and foodbank clients.“These flowers had a signicant impact, and we were told repeatedly that they had lted the recipient’s spirits in the challenging days.”Danielle Flecher-Horn founded AberNecessities in  to help underprivileged families provide for their children.The organisation provides support to those who are financially vulnerable, as well as women and children who are escaping domestic abuse.Since March, the charity has experienced an increase of % in applications for essential items like formula milk and nappies.However, Danielle described the response from the public and the charity’s sponsors as “phenomenal”.# has been an extremely challenging year for everybody but for some, it has been even harder than we could even imagine,” she said.“Thankfully, we have seen the most phenomenal response and generous support from the Aberdeen community, local businesses, corporate sponsors and charitable trusts and foundations, for which we’re truly grateful.“Thanks to the selflessness and kindness of so many we have been able to provide much need support for children and families experiencing hardship.#Both charities are aiming to continue supporting those most in need as le continues to move towards the end of the pandemic.And Brian says making sure the vulnerable are cared for has never been more important.“These are hugely exciting times for Somebody Cares and our goal remains to make sure that no one in this part of Scotland goes without,” he said.“We will continue to provide everything that is needed to furnish a home, feed, and clothe your family, provide equipment for your new baby and toys for your children at every stage of their childhood.

Hopefully there’s more to come as the first game in our World Cup group is away to Italy in March.“If I’m playing well for the club the manager might pick me for that match.“It would be a dream to play against some of the top players in the world.”Kennedy realises the foundation stones in building his Italy dream come in the hard miles of domestic football.That begins today in the traditional New Year, New Firm derby.He said: “I would be buzzing to play against Italy.“There is also a lot to play for at Aberdeen in the league and Scottish Cup, but we just have to take it as it comes starting with a win against United.”As Kennedy saw out  with the bells at Hogmanay, there was relief to see the back of a year where coronavirus wreaked havoc on Scottish football.The game was shut down from March  until August  due to the pandemic, with the - season eventually called prematurely.Bar  season ticket holders at a Pittodrie test event in September, Aberdeen have played to empty stadiums all season.Kennedy was only six weeks into his Dons career following a transfer from St Johnstone when football was shut down.When it finally ed in the summer, he was ruled out for six weeks with an ankle issue.He said: “It has been dficult as the team was doing well in the league and in the Scottish Cup semi-final before the first lockdown.“That was just a few weeks after I joined, so it was a bad time for me and the club that the season ended at that point.“Then coming back from injury during lockdown, then the Covid situation, wasn’t great, but I feel good now.“I feel I’m playing well in most games now and the team are picking up results, so everything is positive.“It’s been a good month for us in terms of results in a busy December, but we just need to take each game as it comes.”There has been no respite during a hectic festive period for the Dons with today’s match the fth in two weeks.Dons boss Derek McInnes had the squad in for a training session on Christmas day before the - defeat of St Johnstone on Boxing Day.Kennedy said: “It is dficult as there are a lot of games, so you don’t get much time for recovery but it’s the same for everybody.“You just have to be professional working day-by-day to keep yourself right for every game, while dealing with the Covid situation as well.“Obviously I didn’t get to see my family back down the road, which was dficult, but there are a lot of people in the same position.”For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. blaize_sub_data  ,\"evening-express-web-and-epaper-annual-january-sale\":This offer will auto-renew annually at the price of  ua.. n\",\"free_trial\":,\"evening-express-web-pack--month\":This offer will auto-renew monthly at the price of  ua., you can cancel at any time. n\",\"free_trial\":,\"plan_ids\":[\"cancelation-offer-evening-express-web-epaper\",\"evening-express-web-and-epaper-annual-january-sale\",\"evening-express-web-pack--month\"],\"subscribe\": ua. per month  u recurring subscription n\",\"label\":\"\",\"highlight\":,\"recurring\":\"\",\"has_multi\":,\"editions\":true,\"durations\":true,\"free_trial\":,\"benefits\":[\"Unlimited access to all articles on the Evening Express website.

Dundee United failed to capitalise on the resultant free-kick  yards out.In the st minute, Hayes crossed deep into the box from the left flank.The delivery found McCrorie  yards out, but his powerful header flashed just wide.In the th minute, Nicky Clark fired in a -yard volley, but Joe Lewis got down quickly to save.In the th minute, Shankland fired in a powerful drive across goal that Lewis ed to tip wide.ABERDEEN: Joe Lewis, Tommie Hoban, Andy Considine, Curtis Main, Niall McGinn, Ryan Hedges, Ash Taylor, Jonny Hayes, Lewis Ferguson, Matty Kennedy, Ross McCrorie.Subs: Scott Wright , Sam Cosgrove ,  Dean Campbell , Ryan Edmondson .Subs not used: Gary Woods, Shay Logan, Funso-King Ojo, Kieran Ngwenya, Ryan Duncan.DUNDEE UNITED: Benjamin Siegrist, Liam Smith, Mark Connolly, Mark Reynolds, Peter Pawlett, Nicky Clark, Lewis Neilson, Jamie Robson, Ian Harkes, Lawrence Shankland, Louis Appere.Subs: Dillon Powers .Subs not used: Deniz Mehmet, Adrian Sporle, Paul McMullan, Luke Bolton, Kai Fotheringham, Jake Davidson, Kerr Smith.Referee: Kevin ClancyFor as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. blaize_sub_data  ,\"evening-express-web-and-epaper-annual-january-sale\":This offer will auto-renew annually at the price of  ua.. n\",\"free_trial\":,\"evening-express-web-pack--month\":This offer will auto-renew monthly at the price of  ua., you can cancel at any time. n\",\"free_trial\":,\"plan_ids\":[\"cancelation-offer-evening-express-web-epaper\",\"evening-express-web-and-epaper-annual-january-sale\",\"evening-express-web-pack--month\"],\"subscribe\": ua. per month  u recurring subscription n\",\"label\":\"\",\"highlight\":,\"recurring\":\"\",\"has_multi\":,\"editions\":true,\"durations\":true,\"free_trial\":,\"benefits\":[\"Unlimited access to all articles on the Evening Express website.

She has travelled and trekked throughout the world but now lives in Argyll amongst the scenery she loves. www.heatheryheightsDuring wintry weather and shorter days it can be tricky fitting in longer walks and time for exploring the outdoors.What is fantastic about Knapdale and Kintyre is that we only have to go a short distance to gain truly spectacular views. The three walks in this edition y from relatively short, using tracks and paths to the lovely viewpoint of Castle Dounie, to challenging, where the terrain is tough underfoot and good route finding skills are required. All three start at Crinan harbour before climbing up through oak and birch woods to gain open vistas with views to Jura, Scarba and Mull. The convoluted ridge walks are rugged and wild, the steep sides sweeping down to the Sound of Jura where tides race and swirl. If you are lucky you may see pods of dolphins or even whales.. At the car park a signboard shows the Crinan Trail. This is the shorter of the routes but all three start and finish together. Leave the car park and turn left. Keeping to the road by the shore you will see a trail marker post ahead leading you briefly along the shore before the path heads into oak woods. After m the path bends sharply left. To the right a faint trail heads west towards the Sailor’s Grave but your route starts its steep muddy ascent to the forestry road above.. On reaching the road turn right, after m you will reach a bench and the first junction to your left. Here you have a choice either come back from the track ahead or to your left. All routes can be undertaken in either direction. I suggest for the longer routes you go straight on and for the Crinan Trail you go left.. For the Crinan Trail follow the waymark posts and arrows. After .km the route turns right onto a path and winds up and down with glimpses of views to come. Turn left at a sign for a viewpoint. This will take you up to the knoll atop which the remains of Castle Dounie, a prehistoric dun, command spectacular views over the sound towards the Gulf of Corryvreckan. There it is said the Cailleach Bheur, a giant witch, once washed her plaid in its whirlpools. Enjoy the vista before ing down to the junction and turn left. The path now meanders down to the forestry road. Turn right and head north round the coast above Adnoe Point and back to your path down to Crinan harbour.. For the longer walks, go straight ahead at the bench . Follow the track for nearly km, which leads you round a couple of hairpin bends and above Adnoe Point, before turning south. Keep your eyes open for the waymark posts and turn left onto a path. Head uphill for m. At the viewpoint sign turn right up to Castle Dounie and enjoy. To your south is the ridge that leads to Creag Mhor.. Immediately after dropping from Castle Dounie you will see a broken down wall on your right. Follow this for a short distance until you can start to work your way up onto the ridge to your right, by a couple of birch trees with coners on the skyline above. The ridge walk is convoluted, airy, rough and summits numerous lumps and bumps with fantastic views. Keep to the crest or east side as the drop-offs to the west are impressive but not to be dallied with. The highest rocky bump of Creag Mhor is parallel to the north end of the rocks offshore.. After  minutes of knobbly and exposed ridge walking #you do not fancy tackling navigation along walls in woods # this is now the time to keep an eye out for an obvious wide firebreakin the trees, below to your left. This leads you at a ° angle straight to a forestry track in the valley below. To check you have the right point look across from the firebreak and you should see a wall continue the line on the other side. Head down the firebreak to the track and turn left. This will take you back to the junction by the bench where you can turn right on the forest road then left todown the path to Crinan harbour.. If you wish to adventure on* and are confident with your route finding then continue south on the ridge # crossing over an old wall not on the map # to where it suddenly drops to a tiny col with forest directly ahead. Ahead is a steep little rise with walls on it. One drops to the right but it is the one going southwest into the forest you need to follow, for the next m. Keeping the wall directly on your right, circumnavigating the odd boulder and ducking the odd branch, you will see that the deer have created quite a path and that the way is often clear. Eventually it drops you very steeply down to a stream with another wall directly ahead. Turn left, southeast, up the stream with the wall on your right # it is boggy # until you reach a quaint waterfall on your left. A small break in the wall to your right allows you to escape the trees that have fallen across the wall higher up. Continue with it on your left across a tree harvested area and up the bump ahead. You will pop out onto a track end.. Follow this short track down to the forest road below. Turn right and almost immediately turn left onto a grassy track that crosses a stream and heads east up into the forest. After m you will come to a sharp left-hand bend. Directly in front of you a wall goes steeply up into the trees. This is your route up to Bealach na Moine. It leads up slippery, mossy rock for m, over a barbed wired fence , up a very rough and eroded track for nearly m, past a spring hidden with fallen trees, then over more pleasant grass and moss to the col. This last section makes you realise why it is worth the effort as views open up east and west. Turn right over a couple of steep little hillocks on the ridge. Suddenly ahead you will see your goal, the trig point and the summit of Cnoc Reamhar, also known as Gallachoille Hill and a Marilyn to boot. It really is a fantastic view.. Toeither descend the way you came or drop down from one of the breaks in the ridge to the north end of the small lochan on the west side of the summit, and follow the faint Landover track north to the spring. Re-join your ascent route, taking care on the way down. Turn rightat the forest road it is now an easy km back to the junction with the bench. Turn right then left after m, following the path back to Crinan harbour.*You can also drop down the firebreak and turn right on the track to join the route up to Cnoc Reamhar,continuing along the ridge does not appeal.The described routes and accompanying information are there to be used as a guide and do not replace the use of map and compass and the skills required to use them.

The sector in Scotland accounts for around  per cent of UK production and is worth about £ million annually.One fth of these exports go to the EU, amounting to more than , tonnes a year.This is clearly a disastrous Brexit outcome for Scottish farmers and like all other aspects of Brexit, foisted on Scotland against its will.A terrible negotiating failure on the part of the Tory government, and a devastating blow to an extremely valuable part of Scotland’s farming industry, I am sure it will not be the first damaging impact to be highlighted once the deal is fully analysed.Alex Orr, EdinburghSir,The report on the Piers and Harbours Asset Management Plan and Fees and Charges –  , submitted to the Argyll and Bute Council Harbour Board meeting of December ,  makes interesting reading.At a time when budgets are tight and councils have had to make hard decisions about where to cut services, it is dficult to understand why the council budget should be used to supplement the funding of dedicated ferry infrastructure for which CMAL should be responsible.The asset management plan allocates £,, for planned marine infrastructure works for the year  , of which only £, , is devoted to multi-use facilities. The remainder, £,,, is mostly allocated to single-use ferry facilities, and a huge proportion of that is to provide overnight parking for CalMac ferriesreaders will have to make up their own minds about the merits of spending £,, for an overnight berth at Fionnphort, and £, on a feasibility study for a breakwater at Lismore.CMAL pay back around half of the £,, to the council through harbour dues for the use of council-owned piers, however, that still leaves a whopping £ million gap in the required funding.If past experience of other CMAL projects is anything to go by, the planned eight per cent increase in council harbour fees and charges up to   is not going to cover it.Fergus Gillanders, KilmelfordSir,Last year, , was challenging and, although many people like to give generously to charity at Christmas time, it may have been dficult to make a donation this festive season.It#s not too late # you can still help support the Royal National Institute of Blind Peopleby collecting and donating used stamps from cards and parcels you may have received.Your stamps will be recycled and turned into vital funds that will help RNIB support children with vision impairment.

Food and drink is a staple in households across Scotland for Hogmanay, and it is certainly something that can remain the same, even with these uncertain times.A pot of soup to bring in the bells never goes amiss, and youd be forgiven for thinking that a slow-cooked stew is something of legend at this time of year.But while many families would plan to head out for a New Years Day meal, this will not be going ahead this year.Alternatives could include trying out some new recipes at home, and having a New Years meal at home. Bake some goodies to bring in the bells with, such as traditional Scots tablet or shortbread.Zoom have lted their -minute time limit across the New Year period, so set the camera at the bottom of your table and invite however many guests youd like!First footingA tradition throughout Scotland on Hogmanay, the normal act of first footing will certainly be missed this year, but there may be a way to salvage it.Traditionally, first footing involves the first person who enters the house after midnight bringing gts. It has been adapted through the years, and some now visit neighbours with a tipple and a song before moving on to the next house.While were not allowed in other peoples houses this year, we can certainly adapt the tradition.Ask one of your household to draw the short straw and brave the cold just after midnight and emulate a first footing with your immediate bubble. Or, have a virtual first footing, and make sure to call your loved ones and wish them a Happy New Year.TelevisionAs always, there will be a raft of content available to watch on TV on Hogmanay. Therersquoll likely be old favourites including the likes of Still Game.As ever, there will be several Hogmanay specials to help us bring in the bells from the comfort of our own home. Over on BBC One, Susan Calman will be getting ready for Hogmanay  with ldquoa studio of stars.Live eventsThe events that Scotlandrsquos festive season is famed for wonrsquot be going ahead in person this year. However, many are embracing a digital approach for the first time, making it easier for us to enjoy the festivities from our homes.Edinburghrsquos Hogmanay, which usually takes the form of an incredible street party with live performances and festivities, will instead be heading online.

Naturally, this would not be the last time an IndyRef would be brought up this year.On January , the UK confirmed its first two cases of Covid-.FebruaryBy February , the forthcoming coronavirus pandemic seemed a million miles away ndash with only three cases confirmed by this point.Attention instead was on Storm Ciara ndash a powerful and long-lived cyclone which battered parts of the country with gusts of up to mph.Flooding and heavy wind caused damage to buildings and train services, and on February , a -year-old man died after falling on icy surfaces and banging his head during the storm.Another major news story to unfold in the last year was surrounding former finance secretary Derek Mackay MSP.Once tipped to become the next First Minister, the Scottish Sun revealed the now shamed politician had been pestering a -year-old schoolboy on social media.The paper reported the -year-old MSP had contacted the boy out of the blue without knowing his age the previous August, then sent him  messages over six months.MarchThen came March ndash a month that can only be described as the month coronavirus pandemic really hit home in Scotland.On March , Scotland had its first confirmed case of the virus in the NHS Tayside, followed soon after by its first death on March .By March ,  cases had been confirmed in the country, with the virus clearly beginning to spread into other health boards.The inevitable news then came ndash with all pubs, cafes and restaurants being forced to close on March , before a nationwide lockdown on March .On the same day, Alex Salmond was cleared of sexually assaulting nine woman while he was the First Minister.As the BBC reports, a jury found the former SNP leader not guilty on  of the sexual assault charges facing him, while another was found not proven.A further charge of sexually assaulting a th woman had previously been dropped by prosecutors. Throughout the trial, Mr Salmond said he was innocent of all charges.On March , Clap For Carers was launched - coined up as a way to show appreciation for those on the NHS and other frontline services during the pandemic.The event saw people taking to their doorsteps and windows at pm every Thursday to clap, cheer, ring bells and play bagpipes to show their support.The last formal clap took place on May , followed by an extea Clap for NHS on July  marking the nd anniversary of its establishment.AprilOn April , the Queen made a rare broadcast to the UK and wider Commonwealth, in which she thanked people for following social distancing rules and said the UK ldquowill succeed in its fight against the coronavirus.Echoing the words of Vera Lynnrsquos wartime song, she added ldquoWe will meet again.On the same day, Scotlandrsquos Chief Medical Officer Dt Catherine Calderwood resigned after facing intense criticism for breaking lockdown rules twice to visit her second home during the pandemic.Dr Calderwood concluded with the First Minister that her position was untenable given the need for consistent and trustworthy public health messaging.Sticking with the pandemic, all eyes were on -year-old war veteran Tom Moore on April , who raised millions of pounds for NHS charities for walking more than  laps of his garden.In less joyful news, just four days later on April , Scotlandrsquos new temporary coronavirus hospital the NHS Louisa Jordan opened to receive Covid patients.MayOn May , Boris Johnsonrsquos senior advisor Dominic Cummings faced calls to resign after an investigation alleged he travelled  miles from London to his parentrsquos home in Durham while displaying coronavirus symptoms during lockdown.On May , Cummings held a press conference in the Downing Street Rose Garden, in which he said: ldquoI donrsquot regret what I did. The following day, Tory MP for Moray Douglas Ross, resigned as a Scotland Office minister over his views on the alleged breach.JuneOn June , a man with a kne stabbed six people, including a police officer and hotel staff, in the Park Inn Hotel in Glasgow.The attacker, Badreddin Abadlla Adam, was shot dead by a police officer on the scene.Police said the incident was not being treated as terrorism.JulyAfter a tough few months, beer gardens were allowed to reopen from July  ndash taking advantage of some warm weather that was about to come.Following weeks of guidance, Scotland made it officially law to make it compulsory to wear a face covering in shops across Scotland on July .AugustPupils in Scotland finally began ing to classrooms on August , without the need to socially distance ndash with pupils initially not having to wear face coverings. This was later changed on August , requiring the need for masks in corridors, canteens and other communal areas.The following day, on August , three people died after a passenger train derailed in Aberdeenshire.The . ScotRail service from Aberdeen to Glasgow Queen Street hit a landslide near to Stonehaven following heavy rain and thunderstorms.The victims were named as driver Brett McCullough, , conductor Donald Dinnie, , and passenger Christopher Stuchbury, .SeptemberOn September , the NHS Protect Scotland app was released to the public on iOS and Android devices, providing anonymous and Bluetooth-enabled contact tracing for those who download it in Scotland.On September , Nicola Sturgeon announced a ban on meeting in households as she came down hard following a rise in cases across the country.A pm curfew on pubs, similar to that already in place in England, was also confirmed.OctoberOn October , Margaret Ferrier, MP for Rutherglen and Hamilton West, was suspended by the SNP and referred herself to the police after it became known she had travelled from Scotland to Westminster the previous weekend, despite awaiting the outcome of a Covid test.She then chose to travel home again by train, despite being notied of the positive result.And on October , James Bond actor Sir Sean Connery died at the age of .The Scottish actor, best known for his portrayal of the  spy, died in his sleep in the Bahamas ldquohaving been unwell for some time, his son said.NovemberA new five level, or ldquotier, system of lockdown was introduced in Scotland on November , bringing in new targeted restrictions to dferent parts of the country.And after an agonising two-decade long wait, Scotlandrsquos menrsquos team finally reached the finals of a major football tournament after beating Serbia on penalties.A masterclass penalty save from keeper David Marshall sent Scotland through, with subsequent celebrations leading to the rise of now Tartan Army-favourite Yes Sir, I Can Boogie, to the top of the charts.DecemberWhat could only be described as a potential light at the end of the tunnel, the first coronavirus vaccinations were administered in Scotland on December .Thousands of people have so far been given their first dose of the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine, which after two doses is thought to be % effective against Covid-.However, the good news didnrsquot last long, and following an outbreak of a new strain of Covid in the UK, the co-ordinated plan for Christmas across the UK was cancelled on December .Nicola Sturgeon announced a travel ban to other parts of the UK during the festive period, with people within Scotland only allowed to ease the rules on Christmas Day ndash not between December  and  as previously planned.On Boxing Day, Scotlandrsquos toughest levels of lockdown came into effect across all mainland areas, with schools now no longer resuming in the classroom until at least January .The tough new rules mean non-essential shops, pubs, restaurants and gums will close for at least four weeks."},{"url":null,"title":"steak-pie-scottish-new-years-day-tradition","story":"SCOTS love a steak pie to celebrate the New Year and cannot get enough of them, according to an industry expert.But therersquos a surprising reason as to why itrsquos become an annual tradition across the country.Bruce McColl, the member services manager for the Scottish Craft Butchers Association, was able to provide some insight into our January  delight.He said: ldquoOne theory holds that steak pie became the national dish at New Years because January  wasnrsquot generally taken as a holiday so families were too busy to cook, said Mr McColl.ldquoThey would buy steak pies to feed their families instead, this continues to this day as people want a delicious meal after the previous nightrsquos celebrations.ldquoSo it was essentially one of the first ready meals.Steak pie then could be the nationrsquos hangover cure on what is often the roughest morning of the year for many, after a night of celebratory drinking.Mr McColl added: ldquoThe other train of thought is that people would have it as their main meal on Hogmanay before they started to drink.ldquoItrsquos a good meal to be made in advance so a lot of people have it as their main meal before the bells.ldquoAnother theory is that because it is a big meal you can keep warm and serve to visitors throughout the day, as people come to the house.Steak pie, it seems, fits Scotlandrsquos New Years celebrations perfectly -

Thorne Security says it could have a system in operation for £,, less than half the amount the  previously thought it would cost.The system would include four cameras to cover Main Street, Longrow, Burnside Square and the area around Hall Street and the cross.Four special television screens at Campbeltown Police Station would allow the police to watch the pictures from the cameras. The images would be recorded on an industrial-quality video recorder at the station. The pictures could alert the police to trouble or help them trace offenders.The team from Thorne Security will be visiting Campbeltown at the end of January to demonstrate the equipment.The secretary of the , Sergeant Douglas Reid of Campbeltown police, has already contacted the Scottish Office for more details about the funding package. Sergeant Reid said: ‘The  is fully committed, following the tremendous public response, to go in as far as possible along this road.’The  is already planning to apply to other local and national bodies for contributions towards the cost of the system.The Scottish Office’s challenge competition will make funds available for groups representing local communities to bid for money to fund CCTV systems.Applicants from dferent areas will bid in competition with each other for a share of the government cash.The first town centre security camera system in Scotland was set up in Airdrie three years ago. New research shows that in the first two years after the system was set up, the crime rate plunged by  per cent.The Scottish Office says there is no evidence that crime was simply being shted to areas outwith the reach of the cameras. Instead the total amount of recorded crime actually fell.FIFTY YEARS AGOMcCartney again!Mr Paul McCartney, ex-bass guitarist with the Beatles, has recently purchased from Mr A Revie, Loch Ranachan Farm, which comprises  acres and adjoins his other farm, High Park.Mr McCartney has been spending a few days on the farm with his we and family over the festive season.One happy Rangers fanMr Crawford Morans of  Albyn Avenue, who is employed with the Ministry of Social Security, has had a good ending to the old year.

On the date in question, the accused conveyed a cargo from Glasgow to Tobermory via the Crinan Canal.As soon as he had left Crinan, he was in contravention of the regulations, having entered the more hazardous waters off the west coast.On behalf of the accused, an agent stated that he had traded with the Bloodhound for nearly  years. During the war, the ship had been requisitioned by the Ministry of Shipping, and under the orders of that department had been sent outside the limits of the smooth water area.The accused had naturally thought that what he had been doing during the war, when he traded to ports on Islay and the Ayrshire coast, he was free to do now.Sherf Macmaster Campbell imposed a penalty of £."},{"url":null,"title":"leader january 1 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Food and drink is a staple in households across Scotland for Hogmanay, and it is certainly something that can remain the same, even with these uncertain times.A pot of soup to bring in the bells never goes a miss, and youd be forgiven for thinking that a slow-cooked stew is something of legend at this time of year.But while many families would plan to head out for a New Years Day meal, this will not be going ahead this year.Alternatives could include trying out some new recipes at home, and having a New Years meal at home. Bake some goodies to bring in the bells with, such as traditional Scots tablet or shortbread.Zoom have lted their -minute time limit across the New Year period, so set the camera at the bottom of your table and invite however many guests youd like!A tradition throughout Scotland on Hogmanay, the normal act of first footing will certainly be missed this year, but there may be a way to salvage it.Traditionally, first footing involves the first person who enters the house after midnight bringing gts. It has been adapted through the years, and some now visit neighbours with a tipple and a song before moving on to the next house.While were not allowed in other peoples houses this year, we can certainly adapt the tradition.Ask one of your household to draw the short straw and brave the cold just after midnight and emulate a first footing with your immediate bubble. Or, have a virtual first footing, and make sure to call your loved ones and wish them a Happy New Year.As always, there will be a raft of content available to watch on TV on Hogmanay. The official TV guide has not yet been released, but therersquoll likely be old favourites including the likes of Still Game.As ever, there will be several Hogmanay specials to help us bring in the bells from the comfort of our own home. Over on BBC One, Susan Calman will be getting ready for Hogmanay  with ldquoa studio of stars.The events that Scotlandrsquos festive season are famed for wonrsquot be going ahead in person this year.

UK citizens will be allowed to stay in the EU for  days in any -day period without a visa, and the same will apply for EU citizens in the UK.The European Commission says the choice to end free movement ldquoinevitably means that business travel between the EU and the UK will no longer be as easy as it currently is.People heading from the UK for business have been told by the Government to check the requirements of the country they are travelling to.British passport holders will no longer be able to use the EU passport queue at airports and other borders.From , you will have to purchase a pound visa-waiver for holidays and short stays.UK nationals will not need a visa for short trips to EU countries theyre just going on holiday.But they will have to pay for a visa-waiver ndash this will cost euroand will be issued under the European Travel Information and Authorisation System.From  onwards you may need extra documents to work or study, or for trips longer than  days.Details of this have yet to be confirmed and it will likely depend on what you are doing and where you are going.But those going to work or study abroad, plus those just going on business trips, might be affected from January , , onwards.No, your current passport is still eligible.Pre-Brexit, you could travel to EU countries on your passport right up to the point it expires ndash and that is continued to be the case this year, and will be until the end of the transition period on December .However, next year, the rules are changing.These changes were announced prior to the trade deal and arent expected to be affected by it.Under the new rules, fromJanuary , , when you visit most EU countries and Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland, your passport will need to have at least six months left on it until expiry and be less than ten years old on the day you travel.The UK will lose access to a iety of key EU databases which the police use which cover things such as criminal records, fingerprints and wanted persons.However, the UK will still have access to other systems which include cross-checks fingerprints across Europe.

There was heavy traffic and, needless to say, Irsquod never driven a bus before and hadnrsquot expected to at this moment either.ldquoYou mean drive the bus  I foolishly asked.ldquoThatrsquos why you are here, isnrsquot it  he replied.I was on the bus with two other learners, as well as the instructor. We had been given some rudimentary instructions by him as hersquod driven the bus into the busy city centre, but I hadnrsquot realised we would actually have to drive the bus through busy streets.That was the first time I had driven a bus. It was, of course, an assessment of my capabilities. I negotiated as best I could and quickly learned what a tail swing was, as I nearly shaved off the nose of a woman who was standing on the edge of a pavement waiting to cross the road!The gearstick felt like it had been cemented to the vehicle, making changing gears a Herculean effort, with the engine roaring as I struggled to crunch it into gear. I drove slowly and cars began honking their horns in frustration.There was a big L on the rear of the bus, but I think when people see a bus in the city centre they assume the person driving actually knows how to drive a bus!It was a stressful  minutes and, when I finally pulled over, the instructor looked at his notes shaking his head. I cannot repeat what he said, but it was a generally negative assessment with lots of adjectives.Yet I wasnrsquot written off and was told I needed six full days of lessons as a minimum before sitting my test. Against everyonersquos expectations, including mine, I passed first time.I had done it and realised one of my lersquos dreams.There was a specic reason I needed a bus driving licence: I wanted to be a driver guide and take people around Scotland on tour. My le had undergone some dramatic changes and my le ambitions had changed as a result.It wasnrsquot, of course, about money or climbing a career ladder, but about the hopeful expectation it would make me rich in experiences and give me a new angle on le.My head and heart were full of Scotlandrsquos stories, and this seemed a perfect way to use my love of history and folklore, and share my passion for the landscape that held so many personal memories for me. I felt my le was about to be transformed and indeed it was.So that day I passed my bus driving test was a day of utter joy. Although over  years ago now, I can still feel the elation.I worked for dferent tour companies at dferent times in my le over the following  years. It was something I couldto whenever I needed it. During the last period of my time as a driver guide, a transport manager called Ronnie worked miracles as he juggled my rota to fit round my very complicated childcare arrangements. I will be forever grateful to him for his understanding.Were my expectations of the job realised or did I have an over-romanticised image of it  Irsquod say a bit of both. I tried my best to showcase Scotland, but I quickly understood people travel for dferent reasons with dferent interests.But it opened a window on the world for me. I met so many people from dferent walks of le and dferent countries and cultures. It taught me so much about the way humans behave towards each other and how we handle and respond to experiences in dfering ways.We were all on mini le journeys together, usually three days, sometimes five. In this brief fleck of time, a small group of people would be together amidst the splendour, and sometimes challenging conditions, of Scotland. When connections were made, it was because of shared values, regardless of cultural dferences.I began to see the tours as a metaphor for the way we live our lives, not just in observing others but myself as well. I had never thought the job would be a lesson on the philosophy of le, but that is partly what it became for me.It revealed to me that happiness, enjoyment and appreciation is a default within us, not something to be found, bought or acquired, or even weather dependent!That now seems so obvious but it took years for me to truly understand how we can become so easily trapped in the hedonic treadmill. I know thatrsquos a fancy term, but its meaning is simple: that as we go through le, we quickly take things for granted and so seek new and higher levels of satisfaction which we believe will give us happiness. While we can get a rush of pleasure and satisfaction in new things or experiences, we soon then take those for granted as well. So the cycle continues. We become like dogs chasing our tails in pursuit of what we think will make us happy or give us a more fulfilled le.The tours taught me that appreciation is the key to this. You donrsquot have to be a tour guide to learn this lesson, of course, as we all have our lersquos experiences that teach us. But that treadmill is so easy to fall into, even when you know it offers a  dawn. It can take a conscious effort to climb out of it.That is when we need what is called a hedonic reset: another fancy term for stopping that chase of our tail and taking time to appreciate what we have. This can be done by temporarily depriving ourselves of things we take for granted and so regaining our appreciation of them.A simple example could be when we go camping. I love it, but when I get home I appreciate my bed, my shower and central heating in ways I didnrsquot before we left on our camping trip!The virus has forced a reset on all of us it has taken away many things we took for granted: travel, staying with friends, family meals, a coffee and blether with a friend, hugging loved ones, being with loved ones, browsing in a bookshop. We will all have our list.It has been heartbreaking, with devastating consequences for so many peoplersquos livelihoods and emotional wellbeing, as well as a tragic loss of le.Itrsquos an unwanted, brutal and forced reset, but the le lesson I learnt on the tours has helped me understand that appreciation is the key to resilience and getting through this as best as we can.When times relax, as they hopefully will soon, I know how much I will appreciate hugging my daughter I havenrsquot been able to hug for  months, being able to tell stories to a live audience and have a coffee with a friend in a real cafe. And travel to the places I love within my own country.Perhapsthere is any positive out of this, I hope it will be that I will never again fall into that treadmill of taking things I have for granted.So I say Happy New Year to you, and I mean it in a heartfelt way I never meant before."},{"url":null,"title":"vet-column-consider-welcoming-new-pet","story":"ONCE your new puppy or kitten has settled into your household, there are several things to consider, ensuring your new pet is kept fit and healthy.Register with your veterinary surgeon. This gives immediate reassurancea problem does arise with your pet.At Dunedin Vets, we offer free puppy and kitten checks and for all new pets as soon as you acquire them this may be carried out by telephone during these Covid- times. Lots of advice is given by vets, qualied veterinary nurses and reception staff.Everyone is thinking about vaccination against coronavirus for humans just now. Vaccination has been the major controller of lethal diseases since the process was developed by Edward Jenner centuries ago.We must vaccinate our pets to prevent several fatal conditions. Pups can be vaccinated from six weeks of age. However, vaccinating at  and  weeks of age is the new normal during this Covid- pandemic, when most vaccinations are given.Pups should be kept isolated until two weeks after the first vaccination, then limited contact with other dogs until after the second vaccine. Boosters are given annually against parvovirus, distemper, hepatitis leptospirosis and kennel cough.It is advisable to vaccinate your kitten against cat flu, feline enteritis and feline leukaemia. Two vaccines are usually given three weeks apart from nine weeks of age. Kittens should be kept isolated until one week after the second vaccine. Boosters are given annually against cat flu, feline enteritis and feline leukaemia.Rabbits can be vaccinated against myxomatosis and rabbit haemorrhagic disease , of which there are two strains. One vaccine against the two agents can be given from six weeks of age. Boosters are given annually.Everyone loves a new puppy or kitten, but please be aware of unscrupulous dealers who take advantage of the kind and loving nature of the majority of people.Recently, Kimberly Mackie visited Dunedin Vetsrsquo Tranent surgery with her new puppy Poppy. Poppy is a Jack Russell cross Chihuahua, so is a very small pup. However, Poppy arrived with diarrhoea and very dehydrated, weighing only a few hundred grams.Poppy was examined by vet Chris Monk, who immediately saw how ill little Poppy was.Mum had bought her in all good faith from a family home. It was soon discovered that Poppy had been microchipped and had a vaccination in Eire. Poppy was an import from Eire, a victim of the illegal puppy farming trade.It is so dficult for new owners to know the origin of their pup, especially when the sellers can seem so plausible. Ask to see the parents or at least the mother and other pups in the litter, although they find many ways to circumvent these questions. It is also so dficult toa puppy or kitten once you have cuddled them and instantly fallen in love.The good news is that Poppy, after fluid therapy and medications, and lots of loving care from Dunedin Vets staff and, of course, his forever mum, has made a full recovery and is developing her own special character.We must also consider other preventable conditions which our pets may be susceptible to.Most puppies and kittens are born with a roundworm infestation. Worms are passed to them before birth by their mothers and through motherrsquos milk. This is obviously not very pleasant and potentially these worms pose a risk for humans, especially children.Tapeworms are rarely a problem in puppies and kittens, although one type is actually transmitted by fleas.We recommend worming puppies and kittens at eight,  and  weeks of age with a quality wormer in tablet or liquid form, which will kill most worms.Remember, there may be no obvious signs of worm infestation.Worming should be carried out every three months for the rest of your petrsquos le.Many puppies and kittens arrive at their new home with a population of external parasites. These include fleas and mites.Fleas are passed from one animal to another. Although there are dferent types of dog and cat fleas, they donrsquot mind what they jump onto to feed!Fleas are two to three millimetres long and move quickly through the coat. Flea droppings are black and gritty, and turn reddamp cotton wool is applied to them.Fleas can transmit several diseases, cause allergies and general irritation. Fleas live on your pet, and in the house.You must use a suitable insecticide spray to destroy flea larvae, which can survive for months in the environment. Your veterinary staff can advise what is best for your pet and your home.The rabbit flea is unusual in that it doesnrsquot move very fast. They are often found along the edge of catsrsquo ears and are dficult to remove, so are called lsquostick tightrsquo fleas. Cats pick them up when hunting wild rabbits.Walking dandruff mitesare very common in puppies, kittens and bunnies. They are too small to see but occasionally skin scurf appears to move, which is actually the mites, hence the name.Mange mitesare minute parasites which bury into the skin. Some are passed from mother to young and some spread from pet to pet. Some cause intense scratching, some cause hair loss. Some can be very dficult to treat, requiring specialised anti-parasitic washes or spot on treatment.Ear mites live in the ear canals, causing irritation, lots of wax production and a smell.At Dunedin Vets, we strongly recommend taking out insurance for your pet at a young age. Many breeders will provide initial insurance cover, and many vets will offer free insurance with certain companies for a few weeks. This gives peace of mind whilst you are considering which insurance to purchase. We suggest you look for a lsquolelong coverrsquo policy so your pet will always be covered.Consider a pet health club for your new arrival. Many veterinary practices, including Dunedin Vets, offer this type of scheme. Basically, you spread the cost of your petrsquos preventative healthcare over the year rather than being faced with large bills at booster time, so allowing you to budget monthly for this.Dunedin Vetsrsquo pet health club offers many other benefits and discounts. During these dficult times, many people are finding this a great way to ensure the best care for their pets without burdening themselves financially.Puppies, kittens and bunnies bring so much love to a family and help so much in your wellbeing ndash choose wisely, and look after them well, and you will have a friend and companion for le."},{"url":null,"title":"east-lothian-peeps-past-december-29-31-1995-1970-1920","story":"lsquoPLEASE drink up... the pub is on firersquo was a headline in the East Lothian Courier on December , .Time was called early at the Auld Hoose pub in North Berwick last Wednesday after a fire broke out in the public bar.Customers spotted smoke coming from the floor near a fireplace about pm and the local fire brigade was alerted.The premises were evacuated ndash including an upstairs flat occupied by Jean Borthwick and her Labrador dog, Freeway ndash as landlord Ian McMinn tried to tackle the blaze with a fire extinguisher containing powder.But help was soon at hand in the shape of his brother Hugh, a local fireman, and the rest of the retained crew who began fighting the dense smoke and flames.Sub-officer McMinn explained that cracks in the old hearth at the pubrsquos real fire had caused joists and beams on the floor to burn.AN EAST Lothian pupil became the first from his high school to be accepted to study at the University of Cambridge, reported The Haddingtonshire Courier of December , .Ian Graham, son of Sergeant and Mrs Graham, Tranent, has been accepted for entry into Emmanuel College, Cambridge, in October .Ian is at present in his sixth year at the Ross High School.He was Dux of the School in his fth year and is at present Head Boy.He is a young man of high intellectual ability but at the same time he is an accomplished games player, playing in the School XV and also in the Badminton Club.He is an office-bearer in the Literary and Debating Society and last summer was a gold medallist in athletics at the Scottish Schools Athletics Championships.A MAN was fined pound after being caught stealing a bird from a train station, as reported in The Haddingtonshire Courier of December , .In the Burgh Court, on Friday, before Bailie Main, James Kelly, railway porter, Church Street, Haddington, pleaded guilty to having, on Tuesday, st, stolen a cockerel from a hamper lying in the booking-hall of the station.The Fiscal stated that, about eight orsquoclock on the night in question, a booking-clerk heard a person entering the booking-hall on tip-toe.On going out, he found Kelly alongside the hamper.He made the excuse that the label had been torn off the hamper, and that he was putting it on.The label was afterwards found lying on the floor, but it was discovered that the hamper had been opened and the cockerel removed."},{"url":null,"title":"7am-wait-worth-mum-bonnie-babies-champion-2020-harris-tait","story":"Harris Tait, who celebrated his first birthday on December , was announced as the winner in last weekrsquos Courier.He lives on East Lintonrsquos Longstone Avenue with mum Kirsty, , and dad Andrew, , a maintenance team leader at Torness Power Station.Kirsty described Harris as a ldquofunny and cheeky little boy with ldquosuch a little personality.She added: ldquoHe knows what he wants and is a determined little guy, which I think he takes from me and Andrew.Kirsty, who has been on maternity leave this year but is ing to work on Monday as a customer trade manager at Asda in Livingston, said Harrisrsquo win had been a boost to the family after what has been a tumultuous year.She said: ldquoItrsquos not really been the greatest year and hersquos not been able to interact with other kids and I thought, lsquoWhat have we got to lose rsquo so decided to enter him.ldquoYou never think that you are going to win competitions like these.When the results were announced in last weekrsquos Courier, Kirsty said she was ldquobuzzing and ldquoa bit emotional.

Lying to the east of the main Cairngorms mass, this m ft Munro tends to benefit from the bigger hillsrsquo rain shadow and on days when the western Cairngorms are being drenched with rain itrsquos surprising how often Bynack More remains relatively dry.On windy days it pays to be a little more circumspect. Theoretically yoursquod assume that the powerful bulk of Cairn Gorm itself would protect its smaller neighbour but theory, however sound it may be, doesnrsquot always work in the mountains, as we were to discover.With the Feshie hills and Braeriach swathed in a dark, ominous layer of cloud, my brother-in-law and I drove theof Glen More and parked the car near Glenmore Lodge. We began walking, through the lovely Pass of Ryvoan, in dry and bright conditions and it wasnrsquot until we reached the River Nethy that we noticed the wind.The track we were on followed the course of one of the Cairngorm lsquomounth roadsrsquo or passes, the Lairig an Laoigh, which runs from Abernethy in the north to Braemar in the south. Both this pass and its parallel neighbour, the Lairig Ghru, were once droving routes resounding to the movement of cattle. Indeed Lairig an Laoigh can be translated as lsquopass of the stirks, or calvesrsquo. It must have been a long haul for the cattle as they climbed from the comparatively fertile basin of the River Nethy to the scree-girt high ground which forms the skirt of Bynack More itself.This grand hill stands apart from its loftier, more popular neighbours, as though keen to emphasise its iniduality and gritty character, despite its inferior height and mass. Bynack Morersquos finest features tend to be more subtle, less glaringly elephantine, than its immediate neighbours, and it exhibits its finest face to the north above the Forest of Abernethy. From here it appears as a fine conical peak, steep slopes rising smoothly to a narrow crest, a direct contrast to the tor-studded whaleback of distant Ben Avon and the leviathan mass of Cairn Gorm itself. Bynack More is ided by a large, high level grassy depression into two distinct rocky summits. On its western shoulder lies a subsidiary top known as Bynack Beg. The main summit was at one time known as Ben Bynack but the late Rev. W Forsyth of Abernethy, al ocal historian, suggests this is wrong and Bynack derives from Ben-Eag, the hill of the cleft, a nick between the summit rocks, which you can see from Strath Nethy. Other Gaelic scholars suggest the word comes from lsquobeinneagrsquo, little mountainor even from Am Beidhneag, a chimneypot or roof-ridge. It didnrsquot take us long to realise we were in for a battle. Despite a couple of light showers the cloud level remained above the summits but it was the wind that was to prove challenging. As we approached the main ridge a couple of violent gusts almost stopped us in our tracks and by the time we climbed up the rocky ridge it was apparent that we would have to take great care simply to remain rooted to the ground.The wind was coming from the south-west, so, just as Cairn Gorm protects Bynack More from the worst of the westerly gales we reckoned we could use the summit ridge of Bynack More to protect us. It worked! We traversed across the slopes above Coire Odhar in relative calm and it was only when we dared pop our heads over the ridge that we felt the full demonic fury of the wind.The summit cairn was, of course, fully exposed to the gales and was no place to linger, so we retreated back into the shelter of our eastern slopes and stopped for lunch. There was a slight disappointment that we had toby our outward route rather than continuing over ArsquoChoinneach to The Saddle from where we could have climbed Cairn Gorm itself. The Saddle, above the foot of Loch Avon, confronts one of the wildest views in Scotland, with steep granite slab slopes dropping down to cradle the grey waters of Loch Avon. At the head of the loch rises the improbably square-cut face of The Sticil, like a massive tomb stone set amongst the high plateaux that surround it.A traversing path climbs the steep slopes from The Saddle at the head of Strath Nethy to Ciste Mearaid and from there itrsquos an easy descent either by Cairn Gormrsquos north ridge to Ryvoan, or by way of the Sron an Aonaich ridge and the Allt Mor footpath back to Glenmore.Cameron McNeishROUTE PLANNERMap: OS :, Landranger sheet Harveys :, British Mountain Map, The Cairngorms and Lochnagar.Distance:  miles km.Time: - hours.Start Finish: Glenmore Lodge .Public transport: Hourly bus no  from Aviemore to Glen More.

Its right now, its happening, andwe dont sort out how we deal with the planet, were in big trouble.Do you have a favourite scene from A Perfect Planet \"I have to say, that flamingo sequence is one of the most memorable sequences Ive seen on television. Shot under extraordinarily dficult circumstances... its impossible not to identy with these poor little chicks who have to make it from the middle of this appalling lake to the edge to get away from their nest in the centre.\"Can we expect more ground-breaking cinematography \"It has been filmed so beautully, the use of drones, that is to say cameras which can take you up into the sky, and see whatever you want to see, its so skilful. And the pictures are so indelibly planted on the mind, thats what I think about actually on the whole series. My goodness, its extraordinary.\"Does climate change remain the biggest threat to the planet \"If we warm the earth to such a degree that the Arctic melts, every city in the world - every big city in the world, very nearly, will be underwater. A high proportion of the important cities in the world are built around the coast because of their ports andthe ice -the northern Arctic melts, the seas are going to rise and flood those cities.\"Thats not imagination, thats not H.G.Wells, its not science-fiction, its going to happen and we have still got a chance to stop it happening. What we have to do to persuade people thats the case... You have to say theres a very strong element in the United States that does not believe it - including the past president.\"What small change can people make that will have a big impact \"Not waste. Thats what they can do - and thats what theyll be forced to do, really. I mean, it is extraordinary how much we do waste at Christmas, simply on wrapping paper - Im as guilty as anybody. The chap who collects the refuse from this house would, Im sure, say, the amount of paper he throws away is awful - and thats true. But the sort of lush extravagance of Christmas, perhaps, is out of place at this particular moment.\"Do you feel a responsibility to educate people using the  youve created \"I sort of mistrust too much personality. Im embarrassed by my own, every time Im referred to. And Im sure that Greta [Thunberg] would actually say the same. But, its the way of things, there have to be people that speak.\"We understand why it is that a personal statement is more powerful than one thats an abstract statement or one thats not backed up... Gretas very good on this - Greta says all the time, its not me, it is the science, it is the science we must listen to and the scientists, and I absolutely agree.\"Is it frustrating to see people in power ignoring your warnings \"Rome wasnt built in a day and the whole world hasnt suddenly changed overnight, but I think in fact people are more aware internationally of the natural world as a consequence of what weve been going through than the reverse. I think thats the case.\"How did you handled lockdown restrictions \"Im very lucky. I dont have a huge garden, I dont want you to think I live on an estate. Ive got a reasonable garden and it has a pond. Since Ive lived here - which is  years, something like that, I cant remember taking three walks a day in my garden, as I did almost every day this spring.\"Did it make you more aware of the nature around you \"I was more aware this spring of flowers opening, buds forming, birds arriving, than Ive ever been, because Ive been busy - and most are.

It really was just locals coming in, wanting to escape the four walls of their houses or their children!ldquoOne of the hotelrsquos main attractions is the spa itself and we were lucky enough to be able to continue to keep parts of that open.: Gleneagles golf resort to open luxury Edinburgh townhouseldquoEven with all the restrictions, some of the guest feedback we have had is that it still feels like an enjoyable experience and I think thatrsquos so important.

We also had a couple who got engagedand a couple who got married on December .While many couples opted to cancel their weddings after the first national lockdown, the hotel manager said bookings had actually picked up towards the end of the year.ldquoWhat we noticed in November and December is that some couples just wanted to get married this year, not in the sense of getting it over it with but to ensure they end this year on a high.ldquoWe have our sixth wedding taking place tomorrow, so despite being closed they can have their ceremony here.ldquoWe had a couple who got married on December  and it was their third attempt at getting married.

It is a fully seated affair, everyone apart from the bride and groom has to wear face coverings but we are allowed to serve alcohol.ldquoI think a lot of wedding couples forget that it is their big day and they might not necessarily take it all in.ldquoMaybe itrsquos put the focus back onto what a wedding is all about.: Covid comment: Its going to a long, bleak winter for licensed trade says SLTA bossThe hotel manager said it was ldquounfortunate that there had been some redundancies earlier this year and does not disclose how many, saying only: ldquoIt was extremely bad that it had to happen but itrsquos in the past now.In terms of future plans, she said there will be more of a focus more on the promotion of the spa, capitalising on the growth of the lsquowellnessrsquo industry through the pandemic with some newer therapies added in.The Blythswood was the first in the UK to launch Cannabidiolinfused therapeutic treatments while the Hebridean spa range Ishga was inspired by the hotelrsquos creation of a seaweed bath.She said: ldquoMidweek bookings are quieter but we are still looking at -% occupancy at weekends.ldquoItrsquos unrealistic to be putting a timeframe on it ndash but we are just looking forward to a more successful ."},{"url":null,"title":"dna-affects-partners","story":"Researchers at Edinburgh University also found that the female partnerrsquos genes in a couple will hold more sway over her partnerrsquos behaviour than the other way round.The findings, published in the journal Nature Human Behaviour, are based on a phenomenon known as indirect genetic effects .This is when the genotype - or genetic profile - of one person affects the observable characteristics of another inidual with whom they share an environment.Evidence of IGEs have previously been demonstrated for so-called vertical relationships, such as those between a parent and their child.: Stunning DNA study reveals how genes make Covid le-threatening for some - and harmless for othersFor example, a motherrsquos genes can affect her babyrsquos birthweight and parentsrsquo genetic make-up has been linked their offspringrsquos cognitive ability and educational attainment, even though these are not directly inheritable traits.There has been less research on lsquohorizontalrsquo IGEs, such as those between long-term romantic couples, but some studies have previously found evidence of the pattern with groups of school friends in relation to educational attainment.Professor Albert Tenesa, the lead author of the study and chair of quantitative genetics at the Roslin Institute, said the phenomenon was underpinned by how peoplersquos own genetic predispositions - such as concentration - affect their behaviour, and in turn the risks or benefits that those around them would experience as a result.He said: ldquoI might not smoke, butall my family around me are smokers and that part of their smoking behaviour is determined by genes, those genes affect how much smoke there is in the household, and that affects my risk of lung cancer.ldquoAlso,your class is a good class where children behave well, theyrsquore relatively clever, then the chances are the someone has a good environment to make their genes perform better, thereby affecting the educational attainment of the group.ldquoItrsquos been shown in animals too. If you put a very aggressive animal in a pen, that changes the whole dynamics of the behaviour of the rest.\"That aggressiveness is partly due to the animalrsquos genes, but that affects who eats first, how they behave, how they communicate with each other, and that happens also in humans.ldquoIf someone is depressed at home, that will change the whole dynamics.: Deaths from self-harm and assault up % during first six months of pandemic in ScotlandProf Tenesa and colleagues sought out to determine how much one personrsquos genotype can affect the traits and behaviours of their partner.They analysed DNA samples from , heterosexual couples of European ancestry stored at the UK biobank, and compared these against self-completed health and lestyle questionnaires covering everything from diet and mood swings, to how many hours they slept each night and smoking habits.This enabled the scientists to gather data in relation to  complex traits.On average they found that one partnerrsquos genotype explained .% of the iance among  observable traits, although this was higher for certain characteristics such as mental health, dietary traits and educational attainment.Of these , they found ldquoconsistent evidence of a link for  traits: body fat percentage, ease of skin tanning, dried fruit intake, oily fish intake frequency, beef intake frequency, lamb mutton intake frequency, time spent watching television, smoking status, number of siblings, self-reported astigmatism, educational attainment, mood swings and fed-up feelings.They note that they the ldquofemale to male effect was signicantly larger than male to female for six traits mainly related to diet and obesity, such as cereal intake, beef intake frequency, or waist-to-hip ratio.The researchers added that the ldquobiggest challenge is to disentangle how much traits within a couple are caused specically by genes, and how much they are due to ldquoassortative mating - in other words, that like attracts like.ldquoThere is a tendency for people to choose someone who is more alike to them, said Prof Tenesa.ldquoThe challenge of this paper is to explain whether the genetics - on top of that effect - explain more than you would expect, and we showed that it did.ldquoWe showed that this effect couldnrsquot just be explained by assortative mating - something  is going on.ldquoA lot of them are related to food intake, which means thatone half of the couple likes something the other member of the couple is more likely to eat that.\"That makes sense because in families food tends to be shared. So whoever is in charge of preparing the food determines quite a lot of what the rest of the family eat.ldquoWe have shown in the past that there are genetic predispositions to whether you like meat or fish or vegetables and so on.\"To some extent that then forms part of the environment of someone .: From a Chinese whistleblower to Scotlands care homes tragedy, the Year in CovidProf Tenesa added: ldquoI think the most important thing to take from this study is that what we call the environmental risk factors, like smoking, part of them are determined by others. We really knew very little about that.ldquoWe just assumed that it was a personal choice. And while some of it is a personal choice, some of it is really not, and I find that quite interesting.ldquoAnother thing is that the environmental and the risk factors are very dficult to measure, but the genotypes are something we can measure very accurately from birth. They donrsquot change.ldquoThere will be a point when we know each part of the genome and what behaviour they affect, so that could actually be a more consistent way of measuring the environment of others."},{"url":null,"title":"TV REVIEW  Hogmanay favourite Only an Excuse says cheerio  What did you think ","story":"BBC Scotland iPlayer ***SIR Kenny Dalglish, Graeme Souness, Kirsty Wark - you could judge the importance of Only an Excuse in Scottish le by the great and the good who turned out to wave it cheerio.Alas, you could also see why this was the last ever outing for the BBC Scotland show, a Hogmanay TV regular since . If a week is a long time in politics it is an aeon on television. The programme that originally replaced Scotch and Wry was as ready for the Fran and Anna Retirement Home as Still Game had been before it.What we came for, what we always came for in good years and bad, were Watsonrsquos impressions of the big names, of King Kenny, Sir Alex, and the first grade wallopers, led by Frank ldquoWherersquos the burdz  McAvennie. All, with the absence of Fergie, came to praise Watson for getting them just right, from McAvenniersquos child-like gleeto Sounessrsquos rather more tight-lipped testimonial There was a minibus full of well-kent BBC faces, from Cosgrove and Cowan to a new double act of Muriel Gray and Kirsty Wark , both of whom attested to Only An Excusersquos legendary ability to attract women viewers who did not give a free kick about football.As Sir Kenny said, ldquoEverybody took it in good nature. It was just fun. If you cannae laugh at yourself yoursquove got a problem, havenrsquot you Only an Excuse was indeed Scotland laughing at itself for the good stuff - the fitba craziness, the sentimentality, the inextinguishable dreams of greatness regained.Here and there, it had bravely broached the ugly stuff as well, sectarianism chief among them. The spoof of the Cadbury ad featuring a gorilla, Phil Collinsrsquo In the Air Tonight, and ldquoSons of Larkhall drum, repeated last night, still took the breath away with its daring. This was genuinely courageous comedy, the kind of material that fearful types stayed away from lest it resulted in hassle in the street . Only an Excuse got away with it because it gave both Celtic and Rangers pelters with equal gusto.If there had been more of this edgier material the show might have lasted longer. But this is the age of Frankie Boyle and Charlie Brooker, the take no prisoners era. Satire should not be greeted warmly by the world it lampoons. You would never catch David Steel, for instance, praising the depiction of himself in Spitting Image as a little squirt in David Owenrsquos jacket pocket, or Norman Tebbit loving his ldquoskinhead look.For the most part, Only an Excuse was happy to be a pal to football and Scottish society in general. The same auld face that came round every Hogmanay was proof that while nothing stood still - he died, she moved away, the grand weans came along - some things would always remain the same.At the centre of it all was Watson, Scottish comedyrsquos strongest man, the performer who carried the show almost single handedly for more than a quarter of a century. Like some mad chef he reduced footballrsquos famous faces to their essence and watched as we dunked in our bread and soaked it up. It is time he moved on.Time, too, for Only an Excuse to come to a close. As we were reminded in the last episode, the new face of Scottish sport is more likely to be young and female rather than middle-aged and male. Scotland needs fresh comedy, material that reflects a changing nation, although for heavenrsquos sake let us always retain the ability to laugh at ourselves.By hourrsquos end it was time to get the collective coat and head off towards the bells. What better way to do so than with a montage to Yes Sir, I Can Boogie, the new, unofficial Scotland anthem. Dear Only an Excuse, at your best you could dance like Travolta, and for that we bid you a fond, very fond, farewell."},{"url":null,"title":"scotsman-owner-jpi-snapped-10-2m-deal","story":"National World has said it expects the takeover of JPI, which publishes The Yorkshire Post, The Scotsman and dozens of other titles, to complete on Saturday January .It said the JPI acquisition will provide a  for National World to ldquoimplement its strategy of creating a sustainable local online news publishing model.JPI is estimated to have posted pound million in revenues and pound million in earnings for the past year.The regional newspaper group, which was previously called Johnston Press, has been seeking a buyer since  and sold The i newspaper to Daily Mail owner DMGT last year for almost pound million.Mr Montgomery, who was previously chief executive of the Mirror Group, has targeted a deal for JPI since National World was launched with a stock market float last year.National World said it has funded the deal from its cash resources and by issuing pound. million in loan notes.It added it plans to issue further loan notes during January.Mr Montgomery, who is chairman of National World, said: ldquoJPIrsquos historic publishing brands represent the best in journalism and have reliably served their communities and supported local businesses, in some cases for centuries, and never more than in the last year.ldquoNational World will uphold this tradition and implement modern technology to grow the business across a wider footprint based on high quality, unique content.ldquoI am pleased with the appointment of Mark Hollinshead as chief commercial officer and welcome Daniel Cammiade to the board.ldquoWe have a very experienced board with extensive knowledge in digital and print publishing to deliver our transformational strategy for growth."},{"url":null,"title":"snp-told-turn-climate-pledges-action-amid-carbon-capture-funding","story":"The appeal comes as a Scottish project has been handed a share of pound million of funding to help cut carbon emissions.Scotland has promised to become a carbon neutral country by , five years before the UK Government commitment - and to cut carbon emissions by  per cent of  levels by .

The FM is fully aware of just how dficult it is to win an absolute majority in a proportional parliament.But she will probably secure the support of the Greens at Holyrood for a referendum.So what happens then  Joanna Cherry MP, one of the stars of the anti-Brexit court actions, hopes that she will take on the Westminster Government in the Supreme Court,Boris refuses to accept the Scottish Governmentrsquos ldquomandate for a referendum.It is clear, under the UK constitution, that Holyrood has no power to hold a legally binding referendum on independence, but that doesnrsquot mean it canrsquot hold a consultative or advisory ballot asking the Scottish people what they want.There is a chance that the courts would agree that Holyrood has the power to hold a nationwide opinion poll.But would that make any dference  The Scottish Conservative leader, Douglas Ross, is promising to boycott any such advisory referendum and is calling on Unionists not to participate in it. Even some supporters of independence might think that now is just the wrong time to be holding a isive referendum. It could lead to a repeat of the Catalan situation in  when their referendum was condemned as unrepresentative because unionist voters refused to vote.Nationalists might say: a votersquos a vote andpeople donrsquot take the opportunity of expressing a view they canrsquot complain about the result.But it is not Holyrood they need to convince but Westminster. Boris Johnson would use a half-baked referendum result to rule out a referendum even more emphatically than before, and Keir Starmer would back him.We are in a strange limbo, therefore. There is no obvious reason to expect a Scottish referendum in the near future and yet almost everyone does. There is no politically plausible route. However, politics is very fluid right now. We live in turbulent times.Support is clearly rising and it may be that a mass movement of Scottish opinion exerts moral pressure on the Westminster establishment to change its mind. But in the meantime, itrsquos business as usual. Scotland will just have to fake it till she makes it."},{"url":null,"title":"david-pratt-world-vaccine-haves-another-have-nots","story":"This is not the international story I wanted to be writing about at the beginning of . Likewise, Irsquom sure some of you wish you werenrsquot reading about it. For so many of us worn down by endless rounds of lockdown and faced with a worrying uptick in transmission of Covid-, the dawn of a new year in our mindrsquos eye was somehow meant to deliver respite from the virus.Yet in the midst of the latest challenges it is worth remembering that only a few months ago there was still no vaccine ready to roll out.Now, however, all that has changed with news last week that by ldquolate spring a substantial number of people will have been offered a coronavirus vaccination in the UK. Elsewhere on the vaccine front too the news is encouraging.ldquoWe are starting to turn the page on a dficult year was how Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, summed it up, adding that the EU has ldquosecured enough doses for our whole population of  million people.While here on our doorstep such news is undeniably welcome, the wider story of the vaccine rollout is shaping up to be a very dferent prospect when looked at on a global level. In fact, as the world ushers in the first week of , many of our fellow global citizens do so with even greater trepidation as to what lies ahead.Just who gets the supply of vaccines, how many and when is only part of a huge ethical debate unfolding daily across the planet. For some time now Covid- has been described as a disease of the haves and the have-nots. Only last month, on December , The New York Times reported that three of President Donald Trumprsquos close political allies, who were infected with the virus but quickly recovered, were given medications that were unavailable to the rest of the Americans.While it might have been one instance, the story brought home the inequity many feel exists in terms of the help and support those threatened or who succumb to Covid- can expect.Already campaigners have warned that an estimated nine out of  people in dozens of poor nations could miss out on getting vaccinated against Covid- this year because rich countries have hoarded far more doses than they need.That warning last month from the Peoplersquos Vaccine Alliance, a coalition including Oxfam, Amnesty International and Global Justice Now, has taken on fresh resonance with news that the new virus iant continues to spread globally from Finland to Japan, India to South Africa and beyond.As early as last November, says the Peoplersquos Vaccine Alliance, rich nations home to  per cent of the global population had bought % of the total stock of the most promising vaccines.According to alliance member Oxfam, Britain, the EU, US, Canada, Japan, Switzerland, Australia, Hong Kong, Macau, New Zealand, Israel and Kuwait have acquired more than half of these potential doses.The UK alone has secured enough to cover nearly three times its population. The EU and the US could immunise almost all of their inhabitants twice with the number of vaccine doses they have reserved. Canada, meanwhile, has bought enough to vaccinate its population anywhere between four and five times over.ldquoThis shouldnrsquot be a battle between countries to secure enough doses, Mohga Kamal-Yanni, an adviser for the Peoplersquos Vaccine Alliance, told Reuters news agency last month.ldquoDuring these unprecedented times of a global pandemic, peoplersquos lives and livelihoods should be put before pharmaceutical company profit, she added.As history has more than once demonstrated, a vaccine of this sort is often quickly given to those lucky enough to live in the worldrsquos richest nations, while the rest of the globersquos population suffers for several decades before deadly diseases are eradicated,they ever are. Polio is typically one example.This was a disease for which vaccines were first found in the s and s, leading to the eradication of the virus in most developed countries. But, staggeringly, it was only in August last year that the World Health Organisationdeclared the continent of Africa free of wild polio.Speaking to the news agency Inter Press Servicea few days ago, Ben Phillips, campaigner and author of How To Fight Inequality, highlighted how the scandal is not limited to the fact that rich nations are marginalising poor nations from scarce supplies.By far an even bigger outrage is that there is only such scarcity of supplies because companies are being allowed to hoard licences and know-how.IPS cited Phillips as observing how, between and , the prioritisation of companiesrsquo intellectual property over peoplersquos health meant millions of people in poor countries died from Aids when the treatment for HIV was known and able to be produced cheaply, but was kept by profit-driven policy deliberately too costly and too rare.ldquoItrsquos astonishingly mean-spirited, and utterly short-sighted, that the same approach is being pursued now with Covid-, said Phillips.For many of us the very idea that the fight against Covid- could be hampered worldwide by battles between countries to secure surplus doses or pharmaceutical company profit is both noisome and baffling.After all, from very early on it quickly became clear thatdistribution of the vaccine was based solely on the ability of a country to buy it alongside other treatments and test at scale, poorer countries would be left behind and all of us would be less safe.Unequal access to vaccines too was likely to happen not just between countries but within them, leaving millions of vulnerable people defenceless against the virus.Throughout this crisis such transnational realities always seemed to play second fiddle in a pandemic lexicon that increasingly stressed what bioethicists call ldquovaccine nationalism.Looking back now, itrsquos obvious that the principle put forward by many of the worldrsquos leading health experts that ldquono-one is safe until everyone is safe was from the outset always likely to be drowned out by the clamour of ldquome first demands by certain wealthy countries.That any government should prioritise its own citizens is doubtless a viewpoint many would subscribe to. What, after all, is a governmentrsquos rolenot looking out for the safety and wellbeing of its own citizens  In that respect there are probably many more ldquovaccine nationalists among us than some might willingly admit.Speaking to BuzzFeed News recently, Arthur Caplan, head of the ision of medical ethics at the NYU School of Medicine, said he partly defends the ldquovaccine nationalist school of thought.Not only should those countries that can afford it take care of their own first with a little extra supply for insurance, says Caplan, but also the virus has ldquowreaked such havoc on the world that equity is not part of the decision-making when it comes to vaccine distribution among countries.Such views are a far cry from those expressed in September  when several months before Covid- swept across the globe world leaders made a historic declaration at the United Nations General Assembly, committing themselves to achieving universal health coveragethat recognised the right to health for all.Included in this global commitment was ldquofinancial risk protection, access to quality essential healthcare services and access to safe, effective, quality and affordable essential medicines and vaccines for all.Now here we are, just over a year on, with millions of people affected by Covid- and millions more lacking access to basic health services due to lockdowns and overburdened health systems.In a recent joint op-ed piece for the British Medical journal , four global health experts from the UN and international medical research institutions highlighted how even before the pandemic hit, at least half of the worldrsquos population was not receiving the essential health services it needed.ldquoWhen it comes to vaccine coverage levels, a proxy measure to assess how well a health system is ing, the Gates Foundation and Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluationhas estimated that the pandemic has set the world back by about  years in only  weeks, with childhood vaccination rates dropping to levels last seen in the s, the experts pointed out.While among the wealthier developed nations there is a collective sigh of relief given that the vaccine offers a way out, across much of Africa, Asia and Latin America there is still no light at the end of the tunnel.As the world watches mass vaccinations begin in the UK, John Nkengasong, director of the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, warned that Africa might not see vaccines until after the second quarter of .Speaking to broadcaster Al Jazeera following the report released by the Peoplersquos Vaccine Alliance, Nkengasong called it a ldquomoral issue and urged the UN to summon a special session to discuss the ethical and fair distribution of vaccines to avoid ldquothis North-South distrust in respect to vaccines, which is a common good.At the time of his remarks, Africarsquos  countries had recorded more than . million confirmed infections.Like many low-income countries around the world, those in Africa would be reliant on COVAX, one of three pillars of The Access to Covid- ToolsAccelerator, which was launched last April by the WHO for a more equitable distribution of Covid- vaccines. COVAX has  million doses at the moment, far from its two billion-dose goal. EvenCOVAX reaches this goal, it will only be enough to vaccinate % of people in low-income countries: medical workers and vulnerable populations.The implications are obvious. Without concerted collaboration, the rollout of vaccines will be uneven and risks exacerbating inequalities and global tensions.As The New York Times highlighted last week, beyond the issue of health itself the iniquity of vaccine distribution will also most likely worsen a defining economic reality.ldquoThe global economy has long been cleaved by profound disparities in wealth, education and access to vital elements like clean water, electricity and the internet, observed Peter S Goodman, the NYTrsquos European economic correspondent.ldquoThe pandemic has trained its death and destruction of livelihood on ethnic minorities, women and lower-income households.ldquoThe ending is likely to add another ision that could shape economic le for years, separating countries with access to vaccines from those without, Goodman continued.For the moment many of those rich countries already with access to the vaccine appear happy to pay only lip service on the issue of equitable access to the medicine.Asked about these glaring inequalities in places like Africa during a press conference at the start of last month, UN secretary-general Antonio Guterres admitted that what the world was witnessing was ldquovaccine nationalism moving with full speed.ldquoBut the vaccines the African continent needs, and we all need hellip has to be properly supported. Or we will not be able to fight the pandemic anywhere effectively, he added.As the recent joint op-ed in the BMJ pointed out, while the rollout of the Covid- vaccine has been met with optimism and hopes that we may soon turn the tide on the pandemic, they continue to present the world with another challenge in the shape of ensuring equitable access to the medication globally.It is only natural that those living in countries where the vaccine is already being made available have cause to be upbeat and celebrate.While hopes remain high that huge numbers of people in the UK and where will be immunised by late spring, relief for millions of others in far-flung countries may not, however, come until the end of , or even later.In that respect the world that emerges from this frightening chapter in our history will likely be more unequal than ever.If there is to be any true celebration resulting from the Covid- vaccine, perhaps it should wait until every one of our fellow global citizens has access to it, regardless of where they live and how much money they or their country have."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/12192177.jpg?type=article-full","title":"scotland-highest-percentage-fairtrade-councils-uk","story":"Fairtrade UK data shows that  of Scotlandrsquos  council areasare Fairtrade areas, compared with just % of councils in England and % in Wales.Endorsing Fairtrade products and practices means farmers in developing countries get a fair price for their products and are not exploited.:Joanna Blythman goes on a Palestinian adventureFarmers in industries such as coffee and cocoa can earn a fair living, enabling them to put food on their tables.One Scottish council placing great importance on this is Renfrewshire Council, which has its own Fairtrade steering group.Renfrewshire SNP councillor Natalie Don said: ldquoFairtrade is vital in ensuring farmers in the developing world get an acceptable price for their goods and are not exploited for cheap labour.ldquoItrsquos great news that Scotland is leading the way in recognising the benefits of being a Fairtrade area.ldquoShoppers may not see the impact of Fairtrade when they buy a coffee or fruit, but you will know that making that choice is helping some of the poorest people across the world to make a living and have control of their lives.:Chef inspired by grannys cooking to turn his le helps vulnerable youngsters to do the sameldquoIn Renfrewshire we have placed great importance on this issue with our SNP council leader sitting on the Fairtrade steering group.ldquoI would urge all councils in Scotland who have not already signed up to start their journey to becoming a fair trade area and make Scotland the first fully fair trade country."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/12183339.jpg?type=article-full","title":"nicola-sturgeon-new-restrictions-may-introduced-halt-coronavirus-spread","story":"The Scottish Government is to meet on Monday to discuss further restrictions to stop the spread of the new strain of Covid-.In a series of tweets, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said: ldquoThe rapid increase in Covid cases, driven by the new iant, is of very serious concern.ldquoThe steep increases and severe NHS pressure being experienced in other parts of the UK is a sign of what may lie ahead.

Republican control is in question until Tuesdayrsquos run-off elections for two Senate seats in Georgia. The outcome will determine which party holds the chamber. vw,vw,px, px\"Nancy Pelosi of Cal., waves the gavel on the opening day of Congress The House and Senate were required to convene on Sunday, by law, and imposed strict Covid- protocols.Elbow bumps replaced handshakes as senators took the oath of office. Fewer family members than usual joined politicians at the Capitol. A special enclosed seating section was designed for legislators who are in Covid- quarantine but tested negative for the virus.But by dayrsquos end, House members were hugging and congratulating one another after taking oath in the crowded chamber, an alarming scene during the pandemic.ldquoTo say the new Congress convenes at a challenging time would be an understatement, Mr McConnell said as the chamber opened.Still, Mr McConnell said with the start of a new year there were reasons for optimism, adding ldquoLetrsquos make the American people proud.Ms Pelosi said the top priority was defeating the coronavirus. And ldquodefeat it we will, she said to applause.It is often said that ided government can be a time for legislative compromises, but politicians are charging into the th Congress with the nation more torn than ever, disputing even basic facts including that Mr Biden won the presidential election.ldquoWhen it is all said and done, history will record that today was a good day. @RepJeffries.@SpeakerPelosi is the TRUE embodiment of a servant leader.We are grateful to work under her leadership and are PROUD to welcome her as #MadameSpeaker.mdash House DemocratsJanuary , Fraud did not spoil the  presidential election, a fact confirmed by election officials across the country.Before stepping down last month, attorney general William Barr, a Republican appointed by Mr Trump, said there was no evidence of fraud that affected the electionrsquos outcome.Arizonarsquos and Georgiarsquos Republican governors, whose states were crucial to Mr Bidenrsquos victory, have also stated that their election results were accurate.But Mr Trump has enlisted support from a dozen Republican senators and up to  House Republicans to challenge the Electoral College vote when Congress meets in a joint session on Wednesday to confirm Mr Bidenrsquos - win.Vice President Mike Pence, who as president of the Senate, presides over the session and declares the winner, is facing growing pressure from Mr Trumprsquos allies over that ceremonial role.Mr Pencersquos chief of staff, Marc Short, said in a statement on Saturday that Mr Pence ldquowelcomes the efforts of members of the House and Senate to use the authority they have under the law to raise objections. vw,vw,px, px\"Newly sworn in House members mingle and congratulate each other on the opening day of Congress, despite Covid protocols Democrats, meanwhile, are pushing ahead, eager to partner with Mr Biden on shared priorities, starting with efforts to stem the pandemic and economic crisis.

The first ferry from Britain operating under the terms of Northern Ireland Protocol docked in Belfast at .pm on Friday. The Stena Line ship arrived at Belfast Port from Cairnryan on schedule.On the opposite side of the water, business was quiet in Scotland, with no queues or disruption. Read MoreFirst ferries arrive in Ireland under new trade rulesAround  freight lorries were joined by a handful of cars on the first ferry to dock under the new rules. And the Port of Dover reported on Friday that everything is running smoothly. As of New Year#s Day, new documentation is required between EU member states and Britain. The Protocol, which was created to avoid disrupting cross-border trade, also means that any goods coming from Britain are subject to EU checks and documentation.Nigel Moore of McBurney Transport, which has bases in Belfast and Ballymena, said Friday was no reflection of what was to come. He said New Year#s Day did not illustrate the full negative effect this will have on GB-NI movements, as there is very little moving.He said HMRC had given goods loaded on New Year#s Eve a -hour pass on paper work but despite that some reports from docks indicated complications. Seamus Leheny, policy manager at the Northern Ireland Freight Association, said that - minute delays were already evident in some places due to declarations# admin-heavy processes. And Stena Line, which had called on the EU to allow for a grace period while it came up to speed with the bureaucracy around our exit, said: Currently, traffic is flowing well through our ports across the UK and Ireland with occasional turnaways due to paperwork issues, but in the main the IT and regulatory systems are working well.At present freight traffic volumes are markedly down on pre-Christmas Brexit stockpiling levels and Stena Line will be working with the authorities in the weeks and months ahead to help ensure the free flow of traffic continues as freight volumes begin to rise again. There will be an adjustment period while businesses get used to the new procedures, so for any hauliers that have not registered on the customs systems, Stena Line would urge them obtain the correct references before they arrive at check-in, otherwise they may not be allowed access into ports.In the Republic ports were beginning to feel the weight of increased red tape, with one haulage professional warning of mayhem at the harbours in the coming weeks. Eugene Drennan, president of the Irish Road Haulage Association , said that a lack of practice on the new set-up would make its self known imminently.He said: The systems have not been tested, they have not been tried. There will be delays, for sure. The mayhem that#s coming in Dublin Port is unbelievable.Looking to the year ahead, president of the NI Chamber of Commerce and Industry Ian Henry, said  began with even greater turbulence for supply chains, trade and markets - and higher costs for us all, leaving us with a disadvantage. But many warn there is more to come.Belfast Related Content\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news republic-of-ireland eb .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_fd-e-cc--dbf_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news republic-of-ireland eb .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_fd-e-cc--dbf_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news republic-of-ireland eb .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_fd-e-cc--dbf_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news republic-of-ireland eb .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_fd-e-cc--dbf_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news republic-of-ireland eb .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_fd-e-cc--dbf_ w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"Republic of IrelandFirst ferries arrive in Ireland under new trade rulesThe first ferries have arrived in Ireland from Britain under new trade rules following the end of the Brexit transition period.\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming ac .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_aef-f-b-bd-aecbfef_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming ac .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_aef-f-b-bd-aecbfef_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming ac .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_aef-f-b-bd-aecbfef_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming ac .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_aef-f-b-bd-aecbfef_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming ac .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_aef-f-b-bd-aecbfef_ w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"Northern IrelandPM pledges to ‘turbocharge’ UK economy as first Brexit teething problems feltLeaving the European Union’s trading arrangements offers the chance to “transform our country”, Boris Johnson has claimed as UK businesses acclimatised to new Brexit border requirements.Most ReadBallymena Covid idiots throw New Year#s Eve street party just yards from police station Jim Corr#s claims over Margaret Keenan#s #fake# Covid vaccine blastedWhere it all went wrong: Five reasons why Covid infections in Northern Ireland have soared to a record highCouple use lockdown to make over stately homeGarda tipped off terror boss Michael McKevitt over home raidLatest BrexitViewpointOpinionIn nobody#s interest for Brexit to failDUP hits back after Theresa May#s former Spad Raoul Ruparel rounds on party for Brexit trade deal stance Brexit Day: Historic moment after four years of bitterness passes almost unnoticed on borderDUP’s critics slam Poots as he hails Leave EU chief Arron Banks for Brexit effortsLatest from Belfast Julian Assange to find out whether he will be extradited to the USCongress opens new session as virus and election result dominateWhat the papers say – January England looks set for new lockdown as Johnson signals tougher Covid regimeBritish former UN leader Sir Brian Urquhart dies,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Primary pupils are to be taught remotely for the week from Monday until Friday, January  as the spread of coronavirus surges.Read MoreArlene Foster: Remote learning in Northern Ireland should be for short periodBut Mr McCamphill said all schools need to be closed until February to coincide with the current lockdown.There are two aspects to closing schools, he said. There#s the transmission that occurs in schools but then there#s the associated transmission, such as children travelling on buses and parents dropping children off.If we want the lockdown to be effective, andwe want to get Covid under control, we must take all the necessary steps otherwise our health system won#t be able to cope.Mr McCamphill said he was disappointed after Mrs Foster told the BBC that keeping children in school was a priority.The DUP leader said: We will do all that we can to keep pupils in school. We do recognise that with this new mutant version of Covid- there are dficulties and it transmits among younger people, and we have to take that into consideration.However, Mr McCamphill said the DUP “need to start listening to the scientic advice and acting on it”.His comments come after all four teaching unions in England said it was unsafe for schools to reopen and called for their closure for the next two weeks.But Boris Johnson said parents should send primary-age children back to schools that are open this week. The Prime Minister also said he has no doubt that classrooms are safe and that the risk to young people was very, very small.Mr Johnson told the Marr Show: Schools are safe. It is very, very important to stress that.I would advise all parents thinking about want to do, look at where your area is, overwhelmingly you#ll be in a part of the country where primary schools tomorrow will be open.Meanwhile, Northern Ireland nursery schools leaders have urged Mr Weir to treat them the same as their primary and secondary school counterparts.In a letter, the North and South Belfast Nursery Schools Principals Group urged him to hear the voices from the sector working on the ground in these unprecedented times.They added: We urge you to apply the same safety measures around delayed opening for primary school to all nurseries and preschools, thus enabling them to offer the same essential care for key workers and vulnerable children, to minimise contact and the spread of the virus.Belfast Related Content\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland ecd .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_dff-fa--afa-aa_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland ecd .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_dff-fa--afa-aa_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland ecd .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_dff-fa--afa-aa_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland ecd .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_dff-fa--afa-aa_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland ecd .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_dff-fa--afa-aa_ w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"EducationWeir has failed thousands of pupils over transfer test, says Stormont Education Committee chair Chris LyttleThe chair of Stormont’s Education Committee has said the Education Minister has failed thousands of primary school children as they prepare to sit the first transfer test on Saturday.\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland  .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_b-d-b-ae-ef_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland  .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_b-d-b-ae-ef_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland  .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_b-d-b-ae-ef_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland  .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_b-d-b-ae-ef_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland  .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_b-d-b-ae-ef_ w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"Northern IrelandArlene Foster: Remote learning in Northern Ireland should be for short periodRemote learning for school children in Northern Ireland should only be for a short period, the First Minister has said.Most ReadBallymena Covid idiots throw New Year#s Eve street party just yards from police station Jim Corr#s claims over Margaret Keenan#s #fake# Covid vaccine blastedWhere it all went wrong: Five reasons why Covid infections in Northern Ireland have soared to a record highCouple use lockdown to make over stately homeGarda tipped off terror boss Michael McKevitt over home raidLatest CoronavirusWeir has failed thousands of pupils over transfer test, says Stormont Education Committee chair Chris Lyttle#Our already very high numbers are now only the tip of the iceberg# - NI #s struggle against pandemicMapping coronavirus in Northern Ireland: Confirmed cases of Covid- in your council areaCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Further six deaths and , new cases reported by Department of HealthLatest from Belfast Julian Assange to find out whether he will be extradited to the USCongress opens new session as virus and election result dominateWhat the papers say – January England looks set for new lockdown as Johnson signals tougher Covid regimeBritish former UN leader Sir Brian Urquhart dies,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Photo: Kelvin BoyesRodney EdwardsTwitterEmailJanuary   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailNew Year#s Eve: inside Northern Ireland#s Nightingale Hospital in Belfast, there#s growing unease among medical professionals who may soon have to decide who lives and who dies.In seven days the region has had more than , positive cases, of which , affect the over-s. It is the largest increase in infection rates since the pandemic began last March.Yesterday it was announced , people have tested positive for Covid- in Northern Ireland over a -hour period, with  more deaths.Butthe figures keep rising, then the consequences are that hospitals like Nightingale may run out of critical care capacity and more people will die who did not have to, says Dr George Gardiner, the Covid facility#s ICU clinical director.As the virus spreads, people dying is an inescapable consequence he says, explaining it is entirely possible that at some stage we will have more patients than we can safely treat, and we are going to have to change the expectations of what we can achieve.Around , of those affected in the past week are aged between  and , while almost  are aged under . The hospitals are running at pc capacity for signicant periods of time, and ambulances are back parked up outside AE departments waiting for available beds.The frightening reality, says Gardiner, is the current trajectory does not bode well.When I have to make a really dficult decision -we get to the pointresources won#t go far enough - I hear no voice that says, #we support you in whatever decision you have to make, ethically or socially#. How do we decide which people get a longer time in critical care or who gets it in the first place He admits that conundrum keeps him up at night and is not a medical decision but a social, political and economic decision.Inside this hospital, there#s the constant ringing of alarms, the noise of the ventilators that are keeping patients alive and the arrival of more very sick people.Outside,  New Year#s Eve house parties that took place throughout Northern Ireland have been reported to PSNI officers, who issued  fines. But there may be many more undiscovered.We have  patients in ICU, with one more on the way, explains Gardiner. There is the potential of three to five coming here in the next  hours.Those partying while others are gravely ill are not only complicit in the spreading of the virus but forcing us against our will to make plans about who we can treat and who we can#t.Do those partying have blood on their hands  Utterly, he replies. You can taste the potential for victory against this disease and it would be an absolute travesty to screw it up at this stage.Over at the Royal Victoria Hospital, Dr Siobhan Quinn, an associate specialist in emergency medicine, says she and her colleagues are desperately trying to free up beds as, in some cases, up to seven ambulances wait outside while a nurse stands at the front door guiding paramedics.Over the last few days these poor patients were having to wait outside the emergency department and in some cases, they are anxious, worrying they have Covid.Then we get calls through about another standby and you have to make decisions quickly about who is the least sick person here so you can move them on, she explains.There will be more deaths, says undertaker David Brown of S D Brown in Lisburn, who believes the reality of failing to abide by the guidelines will not sink in until it comes to people#s doors.How bad is it  The first Sunday I visited the mortuary, there was one Covid in that week, the following Saturday it was six, the Sunday after there were  in there. This is just the start.The family of grandfather Andy Pinkerton , formerly of Crumlin in Co Antrim, who died with Covid- days before Christmas, know how serious the disease is. His son Gareth and Andy#s we of  years, Menai, had to watch him die through the window of his room at the Royal Victoria as they did not want to risk going inside.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseGareth Pinkerton and his mother could not be with his father when he died. Photo: Kelvin Boyes FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueGareth Pinkerton and his mother could not be with his father when he died. Photo: Kelvin BoyesWe were concerned about the disease and even beforehand we sat in the hospital car park debatingwe were right to go in or not, says Gareth.In the end, we looked at him through a window, we knew he wouldn#t have wanted us to risk it. Not having a chance to say goodbye, or to hold his hand when he died, was hard, he says.In Co Fermanagh, the Very Rev Kenneth Hall, the Dean of Clogher, cannot visit Covid patients in the hospital and instead has been forced to pray with the dying via video or telephone.Seeing someone lying on their death bed surrounded by medical staff all gowned up with a mask and visor and seeing, or maybe only hearing me, not in person, but through some form of technology has made it an exceptionally dficult time, he says.Often, Hall must ask doctors and nurses to sign the dying person with the sign of the cross as he gives the final blessing.We have underestimated, and often taken for granted the privilege of being able to be present at bedsides, to touch a person, to hold their hand and to comfort them in their hour of need… Covid- has taken that away from us, he says.The Department of Health said yesterday there were  confirmed Covid- patients in hospitals there, with  in ICU, of whom  were on ventilators.The question now is: could the current surge in cases have been avoided Dr Alan Stout, the chairman of Northern Ireland#s GP committee, was one of several medical professionals who warned political leaders of the ramications of not taking control of the disease before Christmas. He says healthcare workers are going to be struggling in the coming weeks because Northern Ireland did not go into lockdown sooner.We are seeing our cases increase dramatically because we are now in the third wave our hospitals are full and the implications of that over the next few weeks will be immense.We didn#t go into a lockdown hard enough or quick enough, says Stout. We were saying for weeks and weeks we needed to go into a hard lockdown… our already very high numbers are now only the tip of the iceberg, with worse to come.Sinn Féin MLA Pat Sheenan, a member of Stormont#s health committee, points the finger at the Department of Health, saying it has had no strategic plan in dealing with Covid- and is making it up on the hoof.There are people who are going to die who need not have died and there are people who have already died who need not have died and that#s because we haven#t had a proper strategy to deal with this it#s all been done on a wing and prayer, he said. But his own political party - and the Democratic Unionists - is continuing to be criticised after it emerged deep ision at the Executive table has hindered the response.Despite pledging to be united, the two main parties continue to be at loggerheads, say Executive sources, with Sinn Féin disagreeing with taking guidance from London and the DUP disagreeing to an all-island response.Politics has failed people throughout the pandemic, says the SDLP leader Colum Eastwood.Political leaders failing to follow public health guidance, failing to wear masks and extraordinarily using cross-community vetoes to block Executive decisions has weakened our response.The situation is a national disgrace, says Derry-based Professor Deirdre Heenan of Ulster University.Our government is failing catastrophically at its primaryto protect people.It beggars belief that following the worst week since the pandemic began, there has been stony silence from Stormont, she says.Where is the reassurance that the government get the urgency of the situation  At a time of national crisis, where are the first minister, deputy first minister and chief medical officer She believes that it is unconscionable and outrageous that people are suffering and dying unnecessarily because of failures of political leadership, confused contradictory messaging, indefensible delays and inadequate planning.The story of this pandemic is politicians here who have never led nor been proactive and simply react when it#s too late. There is no sign of any leadership it is shameful, says Heenan.Most ReadBallymena Covid idiots throw New Year#s Eve street party just yards from police station Jim Corr#s claims over Margaret Keenan#s #fake# Covid vaccine blastedWhere it all went wrong: Five reasons why Covid infections in Northern Ireland have soared to a record highCouple use lockdown to make over stately homeGarda tipped off terror boss Michael McKevitt over home raidLatest CoronavirusCoronavirus: Northern Ireland#s schools must remain closed until the end of January, says unionWeir has failed thousands of pupils over transfer test, says Stormont Education Committee chair Chris LyttleMapping coronavirus in Northern Ireland: Confirmed cases of Covid- in your council areaCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Further six deaths and , new cases reported by Department of HealthLatest from Belfast Julian Assange to find out whether he will be extradited to the USCongress opens new session as virus and election result dominateWhat the papers say – January England looks set for new lockdown as Johnson signals tougher Covid regimeBritish former UN leader Sir Brian Urquhart dies,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

An epidemiological investigation is underway to determine the likely source of infection and determine the risk of disease spread.”There have been eight positive cases Highly Pathogenic Avian InfluenzaHN confirmed in wild birds in Northern Ireland across five dferent locations to date, with further detections in wild birds, poultry and captive birds across Great Britain and Republic of Ireland.Since December  a mandatory housing order has been in place for poultry flocks, which means they must be housed at all times, to prevent the spread of the disease.Public health officials have advised that bird flu poses a very low risk to humans and food safety.Dr Huey added: “The actions taken to date in NI have helped to protect our commercial flocks from wild birds. This incursion of suspected notiable AI, however, reminds us all of how critically important it is to be vigilant and take all necessary steps required to prevent the further spread of AI in Northern Ireland. I urge all bird keepers to critically review their biosecurity measures and remind them that birds are now legally required to be housed or otherwise kept separate from wild birds.“To assist all bird keepers in complying with the new rules we have developed a biosecurity - self assessment tool which is available on the DAERA website.Belfast Most ReadBallymena Covid idiots throw New Year#s Eve street party just yards from police station Jim Corr#s claims over Margaret Keenan#s #fake# Covid vaccine blastedWhere it all went wrong: Five reasons why Covid infections in Northern Ireland have soared to a record highCouple use lockdown to make over stately homeGarda tipped off terror boss Michael McKevitt over home raidLatest Northern IrelandWhen are schools due to reopen across the UK Oxford vaccinations start in NI on MondayCoronavirus: Northern Ireland#s schools must remain closed until the end of January, says unionDeath of teen in Twinbrook not suspicious: policeHeartbroken husband Lee Parker pays tribute to late we Jade, who has died two days after weddingLatest from Belfast Five teenagers arrested in Reading murder investigationJulian Assange to find out whether he will be extradited to the USCongress opens new session as virus and election result dominateWhat the papers say – January England looks set for new lockdown as Johnson signals tougher Covid regime,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Mr Watt also took time to reimagine the story of the house’s contrasting architectural styles – one front Classical, the other half Gothic.The long-standing story was this “Frankenstein house” of two halves was the result of a bitter row between the then Lord and Lady Bangor, with neither willing to give ground on their design preference for their new home.This tale never sat well with Mr Watt.“There’s no way this was born out of an argument, nothing so trivial could have created this house,” he said.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseCastle Ward, an th-century National Trust property located near the village of Strangford, in County Down, Northern Ireland.

We’re a gay couple who moved into a big old country house and really, without exception, even during the trials of Covid, they couldn’t have been more welcoming, more wonderful.“There’s just such a lovely spirit here.

After the most dficult of  months, Jon Tonge rates our ministers.Arlene Foster: First MinisterThis was the First Minister#s best year in a while, although that may damn with faint praise.Mrs Foster got her job back, devolution was restored, she sailed through the RHI inquiry report and earned praise even beyond her community for Covid consistency.Then her party bizarrely forced a cross-community vote against lockdown before agreeing to tougher restrictions within a fortnight. That at least united lockdown zealots and sceptics in anger and bafflement.Brexit yielded an Irish Sea border, and many blamed the DUP as midwives of their misfortune.Arlene nonetheless celebrated five years as DUP leader, most spent not dealing with Sammy Wilson or Edwin Poots.She was also confronted by the biggest rebellion in DUP history as  MLAs refused to support their leader on the Executive Functions Bill.Yet all the endless talk of leadership challenges remains just that - chatter. Foster remains the undisputed leader of unionism as her beloved country enters its centenary. Michelle O#Neill: Deputy First MinisterPaid a price for attending what seems the longest funeral in history, given the arguments it still attracts.Having survived a curious party leadership challenge from John O#Dowd in , the Deputy First Minister began the year promisingly. Sinn Fein#s quiet compromise on a standalone Irish Language Act helped facilitate New Decade, New Approach and theof Stormont.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseMichelle O#NeillPA FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueMichelle O#Neill Via existing legislation, Irish language provision was to be extended and a dedicated commissioner appointedO#Neill#s party got most of what it wanted, on terms nonetheless acceptable to the DUP. O#Neill#s pronouncements on the need for an all-island strategy to deal with Covid made good sense. But at the end of June came that funeral furore. This extended even beyond those whose views on republican commitments to public safety were shaped by an earlier era.We did not really miss the joint briefings from the First and Deputy First Minister. Loveless marriages on public show are not a great watch. But their absence symbolised the void in joined-up government. And no one was surprised when Michelle found  reasons why she was unable to attend Arlene#s big centenary party next year.For the Deputy First Minister, the hope is to seize the main office in . Sinn Fein#s strong performances in the South increase expectations, and pressure, on its northern leader. Robin Swann: HealthThe lockdown king had a strong year, commanding respect across the political spectrum. LucidTalk surveys showed most of the public backed tough Covid restrictions. Swann immunised Northern Ireland from the wildlyoptimisticus virus strain offered by the Prime Minister.The Health Minister must have had moments of regret at choosing the one job more taxing than his former role leading the UUP. Still, such experience helped with the crisis management.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseRobin SwannMichael Cooper FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueRobin Swann Northern Ireland#s NHS crisis long pre-dated Covid, shocking testimony to the three-year absence of devolved government. Swann helped prevent total collapse and quickly settled the health workers# strike.Critics suggested Swann was optimism#s antidote. They criticised his early warning that , might die as alarmist, % beyond the actual toll. There remained concern over whether the Covid focus was at the expense of other treatments. Businesses raged against stop-start lockdowns. Van Morrison declined the invitation to the Swann Christmas household bubble. Ironically, Swann ended the year being criticised for being too soft in not imposing a travel ban from Britain.But overall, no one could accuse Swann of swerving science or ducking extraordinarily dficult challenges. Edwin Poots: AgricultureAppeared at times a masked version of Sammy Wilson in terms of lockdown scepticism and leadership challenges.In an extraordinary scientic breakthrough in October, Poots seemed to discover a mutant strain of the virus in which transmission in nationalist areas exceeded that in unionist communities by six to one.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseEdwin Poots FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueEdwin Poots When sticking to his agriculture brief, Poots is well regarded as a capable and often conciliatory minister who listens and engages. The DUP old-school veteran is on top of the issues and commands the respect of the farmers and the community he serves.Whatever Poots# aversion to some aspects of lockdown, there were no rule breaches amid the grief of the funeral of his father earlier this year.Ended a dficult year testing positive for Covid-. Peter Weir: EducationSometimes seemed so keen on keeping children in school at all costs you half-expected them to be in class on Christmas Day morning. But it#s a strange world when an Education Minister - or Under-fire Education Minister, to give Peter Weir his full title for most of the year - gets criticised for wanting children to go to school.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeClosePeter Weir FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":truePeter Weir Arguments over transfer test locations at least deflectedfrom the age-old battle about the tests themselves. Public opinion is evenly ided. Those whose kids are most likely to pass are most in favour of the tests, funnily enough. Such arguments will persist long beyond the DUP minister#s tenure.An Arlene loyalist, Weir deserves credit for wanting to keep education as normal as possible. He recognised that remote learning experiences y wildly and disadvantage most those in greatest need. Nonetheless, January classes in school look unlikely. Expect his decision to persist, with some GCSE and A-level examinations next summer to come under further pressure. Another climbdown seems likely. Nichola Mallon: InfrastructureThis ought to be one of the more attractive Executive posts, allowing strategic development. Yet the Covid grimness was so all-consuming that Mallon#s job became simply keeping the show on the road - literally in terms of transport services.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseNichola Mallon FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueNichola Mallon The SDLP#s solitary Executive presence, Mallon did good work in terms of liaising with those services andkeeping airports alive, but some taxi outfits remain close to collapse, even with rescue packages. Greener bus orders and Casement Park renewal were rare decisions beyond the crisis management. Naomi Long: JusticeNormally one of the adults in the room.

PADecember   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailSinn Fein’s invitation to an Anglo-Irish Christmas party during the peace process created a headache at Maryfield.Civil servants worried it could dissuade some from attending and pose a security risk.An October  note on the affair was published by the Public Record Office for Northern Ireland as part of the annual release of Government archives.The Christmas spirit will not come entirely free this yearPN BellSenior NIO official PN Bell wrote: “Now that Sinn Fein are, following the restoration of their ceasefire and full membership of the talks, a constitutional party, I can see no justication for not extending an invitation which, almost certainly, they will accept.”The Maryfield Secretariat near Belfast was established as part of the Anglo-Irish Agreement which instituted closer north south cooperation.The civil servant added: “Nevertheless, such an invitation would not be without its downside: once news of a Sinn Fein presence became common place, it would intensy unionist dislike of the Secretariat it could generate some security risk it might even deter other guests – although I greatly hope not, from wishing to attend, as well as creating some management problems within the Secretariat itself.“The Christmas spirit will not come entirely free this year.”Up to that point, unionists had never attended the Maryfield Christmas party.The official added: “To sum up, the case for extending a joint invitation to Sinn Fein is irresistible.“But, given the likely reaction in some quarters, I wish to be certain that ministers know all the implications, and are content that I should proceed with inviting a few leading Sinn Fein players along with other leading Northern Irish politicians.”The Northern Ireland Forum for Political Dialogue had also reflected on those who worked at Maryfield, the historic files said.The Government archives quoted from a debate: “Even the prosperous burghers of Holywood were so outraged at the Anglo-Irish Agreement in  that the Maryfield bunker had to be virtually the most fortied place in Northern Ireland, and that remains the case today.”It said civil servants working there and from Northern Ireland did not dare tell friends and neighbours for fear of “shame and opprobrium”.“If he is from the Irish Republic he is furtively ferried

Mr Blair and Taoiseach Bertie Ahern were among those lauded for their roles in bringing about the peace accord in  after years of The Troubles in Northern Ireland. Documents on Anglo-Irish relations from Mr Blair#s first few weeks in office, following New Labour#s surge to victory in May , show a meeting between the two men signalled an intent to bring peace. A briefing note from Robin Cook, then Foreign Secretary, to Mr Blair said: Your meeting with the Taoiseach on July  was inevitably dominated by discussion of Northern Ireland. But there was agreement in principle to developing the wider relationship. Mr Cook acknowledged that a nationalist government would likely be less instinctively committed to improving the relationship between Ireland and the UK. But he said having Mr Ahern as the Fianna Fail party#s leader gave genuine cause for optimism. Ahern is a pragmatist, Mr Cook wrote. He has spoken privately to our Ambassador and in public of the possibility of developing a new era in UK Irish relations. Better so-called #East West# relations have intrinsic value and will improve the climate for our exchanges with the Irish over Northern Ireland. The Good Friday Agreement set the way for peaceful powersharing in Northern Ireland.It was backed by % of voters in a referendum in Northern Ireland while % voted in favour of it in the Republic.It became one of the defining achievements of the Blair years. Before the signing of the deal, he referred to the #Hand of History# being on his shoulder.The new Stormont Assembly met for the first time in July  and David Trimble and Seamus Mallon were elected as First and deputy First Ministers.In , on the th anniversary of the deal, Mr Blair and Mr Ahern spoke at a conference in Belfast.Mr Blair said the  deal took real courage by Northern Ireland parties. He added that for all its faults, the Good Friday Agreement was worth doing and worth keeping.Mr Ahern said: The art of politics is compromise, you can#t make progress without compromise.Belfast Most ReadBallymena Covid idiots throw New Year#s Eve street party just yards from police station Jim Corr#s claims over Margaret Keenan#s #fake# Covid vaccine blastedWhere it all went wrong: Five reasons why Covid infections in Northern Ireland have soared to a record highCouple use lockdown to make over stately homeGarda tipped off terror boss Michael McKevitt over home raidLatest Northern IrelandWhen are schools due to reopen across the UK Oxford vaccinations start in NI on MondayCoronavirus: Northern Ireland#s schools must remain closed until the end of January, says unionDeath of teen in Twinbrook not suspicious: policeHeartbroken husband Lee Parker pays tribute to late we Jade, who has died two days after weddingLatest from Belfast Julian Assange to find out whether he will be extradited to the USCongress opens new session as virus and election result dominateWhat the papers say – January England looks set for new lockdown as Johnson signals tougher Covid regimeBritish former UN leader Sir Brian Urquhart dies,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

However, a civil servant advised that the issue of the Aboriginal head was not of major political signicance.Mr Adams wrote personally to Mr Haughey over the issue on February , .I believe that the refusal to do so , over a five-year period, demonstrates a total insensitivity to the spiritual values of the aboriginal people of Australia, Mr Adams wrote.This is being interpreted as racist by those people.The Irish Government was briefed that the RCSI decided tothe remains to Australia.In a letter dated March  to the Taoiseach, the Aboriginal Centre invited him to attend a handing over ceremony for the remains at the Australian Embassy on March , a memo outlined.The embassy had no knowledge of any such ceremony which, in the light of the removal of the remains from Ireland, does not now arise.Following the decision of the RCSI to give back the remains, the embassy are not anxious to add to the extensive publicity which has already been given to this whole issue and thereby embarrass the college even further.

Barman Andy Nutt is preparing to pour the last measure at the well-known local pub.Reporter: Liam Tunney::  Dec   addthis, Knobbsrsquo Tavern closed in March, just before the pandemic arrived. In the week leading up to its final hurrah, we caught up with barman Andy Nutt and a few regulars.A well-known County Derry pub that has been in operation since  will close its door for the final time on Thursday.Knobbs’ Tavern in Kildoag, between Claudy and Donemana, was originally a grocery store that serviced the local area, but the community it sustained has been shrinking.On Saturday, they held a packed farewell concert, and when the County Derry Post caught up with a few of the regulars on the Friday afternoon, they were in reflective mood.“We’ll miss the yarns and the company,” said previous owner, Jack Knobbs, who was perched at the corner of the bar with his dog, Honey.“It was originally what they call a licensed shop and the first time it was opened as a bar was in . Until , the shop was still here and the bar could only hold maybe seven or eight people.“It would have been mostly locals in the bar and then in  they built on the upstairs and it would have hosted a lot of music – mostly country and western music.” googletag.cmd.push Jack is quietly spoken but points me in the direction of black and white photographs on the wall, where he featured in the Kildoag Wanderers FC side and the local cricket team in a previous era.Both teams used the bar as their base, and the social aspect the rural pub brought to the area is something Jack feels will be greatly missed.“The place would have been packed out on a Saturday night – people would have come from Donemana, Waterside and Claudy for the music.“We just enjoyed the craic. You had the odd tall story told. It’s hard to beat a good story, evenit’s not true!”Mervyn McComb lays claim to being the bar’s oldest customer. “I’ve been coming here about  years,” boasts the -year-old. googletag.cmd.push  “I was in it when the old bar was in the other room. Then, when they opened up the lounge, the place was packed to the rafters. “A lot of old bars seem to be closing up, there’s not the customers there used to be. It’s going to be badly missed. “It’s local people that come here.”Right on cue, a loud cheer erupts from the men as another regular walks into the bar, while Ian informs me the bar has its own taxi driver in residence.Barman Andy Nutt prepares to explain further. He mutes the small television mounted above the bar. This is serious stuff now.“There were six women arrived from Cumbria in England on a Tuesday night. They were on a biking tour and on their way to Park.“They came in and asked to use the toilet and I said that was no bother at all. One of them askedthis was a bar and I said it’s been called many things, but you could definitely call it a bar.“She askedthere was any chance they could have a drink and to cut a long story short, they ended up leaving the bikes here!“They stayed all night so I said I would get them a taxi man to get them back to Park. I rung up Eddie Curry and askedhe could do a run.“Eddie said ‘I’m definitely not going to Park’. Then I told him it was six women and he asked what time I wanted him down!     “I got a text from them that evening then – I think they were in Portrush.“It said: Andy, no Guinness at pound., no gin and tonic at pound. – we shouldn’t have left you!”The tale is typical of the kind of comical, slightly embellished yarns that used to be commonplace in bars across the country, but rural decline is threatening to silence them.Mervyn McComb’s son, Ian, believes that people make the bar what it is.“It’s a good wee bar, with great people in it,” he says. “There were memorable nights here every weekend. It was always good craic.“There used to be bands in upstairs and the place would have been jammed. It always did a good trade, was well run and there was never any trouble. “I’m  now so I’ve been coming here maybe  years. It will be sorely missed and it’ll hurt the community.”The range of presentation cheques that adorn the bar’s walls give an indication of how the community will suffer without its hub. Each year, the bar ran a charity drive and the evidence of their impact is clear in the many comments left on social media following news of Knobbs’ closure. Nicola Doherty fondly recalled a vintage tractor rally held at Knobbs’ after her father had beaten cancer.She commented: “We held our first tractor run in there when my dad beat cancer and bought a vintage tractor. “We hoped for a few tractors to show up and to raise a couple of hundred, but the place was packed, and we raised pound, for the Sperrin Room. “Great memories, I’m sad to see it close the doors.”The doors will indeed close, but Saturday night’s punters were treated to the nostalgic sight of the rafters reverberating to the sound of the Father and Son Remo band in the lounge above. There is a black cat that Jack Knobbs says follows him to and from his house to the bar on every visit.It sits almost sentry-like on the windowsill outside Knobbs.On a bright summer’s afternoon, Jack’s feline companion would be treated to a breathtaking view of the Faughan valley, but on Knobbs’ farewell night, Storm Jorge’s wind and rain battered its weary walls.The storm will have calmed by Thursday, as Andy Nutt prepares to close the doors. There is no doubt that Jack Knobbs will be there to oversee what will be an emotional moment.Knobbs concedes to the march of time.“I’m just a customer now,” says the former owner.“Sometimes I sit too long.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Until now. Liam Tunney talks to an ex-member of the infamous Gorilla Gang, who were responsible for many a headache at Slaughtneil discoThe Slaughtneil GAC committee used to meet every Monday evening. The meeting was supposed to be a general meeting about club business, but usually got bogged down with the disco. Discussions often revolved around two groups of boisterous young men in particular – the Gorilla Gang from Draperstown and the Banana Gang of Bellaghy. The latter were set up in reaction to the former, whose name was notorious around south Derry throughout the s. “The name was actually originally meant to be ‘Guerrilla Gang’,” an ex-member told the County Derry Post. “About  or , things were getting hot and heavy and the likes of Ballinascreen was getting saturated by the British Army. googletag.cmd.push “There would have been fighting with the UDR or the Brits, andthey came into Draperstown, the Gorilla Gang would have gathered up a posse and put them out. “There were two or three gangs in Draperstown at that time. One of them was the Wombles and the other one was the Sixtown Clowns. “They all used to fight amongst each other at small discos that used to be on round Draperstown before Slaughtneil started. “The police knew about the Gorilla Gang. I had a few older brothers that went to Spain, and on their way home they were pulled in at London airport and quizzed about the gang!” googletag.cmd.push As the disco’s popularity began to grow, the three gangs soon set their grievances aside as the possibility of taking their local scuffles to a wider field presented itself. “The disco took in the whole of south Derry, so there was more boys to fight with outside your own town,” he recalled. “It was just like that at those times around dance halls. In the early s, before Slaughtneil, the older Gorilla Gang would all have been over in Dungiven fighting at the Castle. “There were a wile lot of boys in the Gorilla Gang that were mad for fighting, and then everyone started making up their own gangs to fight us.     “I think that’s where the Banana Gang came out of, that they were going to get the Gorilla Gang at Slaughtneil. “I think the Banana Gang gave the Wombles and the Sixtown Clowns a bad beating one night and then they didn’t want to go anymore. “Well, they were mad to go, but they couldn’t because they were scared of the Banana Gang. They came to the Gorilla Gang and askedthey could join up.” The merger prompted a rivalry that lasted throughout the late s and caused the Slaughtneil bouncers no end of trouble. Our ex-member feels that the gangs’ propensity for bravado and fisticuffs helped boost the crowds that flocked to the hall on a Friday night. “Four carloads of us would leave the town to go down to Slaughtneil. We didn’t chance taking the bus, becauseyou were fighting, the bus driver wouldn’t let you on,” he said. “I remember going down to Slaughtneil and being told these Banana Gang boys were gonna be there, and two nights in a row, we went down, and they weren’t there. “The third night we went down, we thought they weren’t turning up, so maybe only five or ten of us went and we got some beating from the Banana Gang that night – they all turned up! “God help them bouncers. I don’t think Slaughtneil would have been Slaughtneil without it. Everybody was going, girls and all, to see what was going to happen next week. “If there was a small scuffle in the car park, threats were made about who was going to be there next week that wasn’t there tonight.  The characters’ nicknames roll off the ex-member’s tongue. Bungle. Flan. Rocky. Numan. Turk. Goggles. Nelly. Bruce. Shiny, who ‘couldn’t beat eggs’ but drove the getaway car. The King, who would run out onto the pitch and shout, ‘I’m the King of the Gorillas and I eat bananas for breakfast’ before a dust-up. Johnny the Donkey, who played the role of negotiator when the gangs were thrown out of the car park and arranged to meet halfway between Draperstown and Bellaghy to finish it off. An eclectic mix, but one name resonated more than others. “Flathead was the feared name. He was a real tight boy, he would have fought anybody man to man,” he said. “We would have said, ‘you boys will be in trouble next week, we’re taking big Flathead with us’, and everybody would have been at Slaughtneil the next week for the big punch up outside! “Even the bouncers were a wee bit scared of big Flathead because he was big for his age. There were some characters about.” While the rivalry between the two gangs was intense, it never created any lasting grudges and the member recalled how, by chance, he encountered one of his nemeses years later. “I hadn’t seen this boy for years, until I was going along one day in the car through Rocktown and heading for Bellaghy,” he said. “I saw a man walking along the road in the pouring rain and I stopped to seehe wanted a lt. “He hopped in anyway and was talking away to me and when he was getting out of the car, whatever way he turned sideways I recognised him. He caught on then to who I was too. “We were good friends at school, but then he was in the Banana Gang and I didn’t really want to let him know that I wanted to kill him, and he didn’t want to let me know either!” Time and people move on. The exploits of the Gorilla Gang may seem shocking when viewed through a st century lens, but our ex-member says it was a dferent era. “When I look back, I never knew of a man being hurt badly. When I hear the gang mentioned, it makes me laugh,” he said. “There were no mobile phones, no fancy cars. Anybody that had a car, it had cost them maybe pound. That whole thing is just lost. “I know it wasn’t good going to all them dance halls and fighting, but at the same time, no one was doing drugs or anything, it was just a punch-up. “Just a locka lads with a few beers in them, that fell out with another group of lads and there were a load of myths and legends that never even happened. “There were a few nights when I was younger that I maybe woke up in the morning with a black eye and a cut forehead and I said to myself, ‘oh my God, what am I at ’, but apart from that, I’ve no regrets. “We were all young cubs. Apart from the odd bleeding mouth and a bust lip, there wasn’t much harm done.” “God help them bouncers, those men got some torturing! Them boys did some organising to keep that all going. “For a club on top of a mountain, they did well to actually get people to get up there. There’s not even a pub.” It’s unlikely south Derry will ever see the likes of the Gorilla Gang again, but their mention invokes howls of recognition and intrigue. With a chuckle no doubt brought on by the memory of discos past, the ex-member had one idea that might have some under lockdown pining for its end. “I couldn’t say that I’ve any enemies out of it, put it like that.

This is dferent. Last weeks edition of this column made two proposals for a new-look Derry senior football championship. Both were based around the inclusion of isional teams and in part two, we put some flesh on the bones. The thought process is the poorof players from the intermediate and junior grades coming through to the Derry senior football team in the last decade. Of  players used in league and championship, by five dferent managers, none hail from junior clubs and  from intermediate, one less than Ballinderrys club total. googletag.cmd.push Also, the decade saw Coleraine, Slaughtneil and Ballinderry dominate the competition. Its great for the clubs in question, but in a bid to help raise the quality overall. A county team needs more options. In Sideline Views proposal,  senior clubs have been selected on the basis of the last five years of the senior championship. The  teams who reached at least one semi-final were joined by Swatraghand Dungivenas the highest placed teams in the  league standings. The other three teams are isional teams picked from the rest of the clubs. Foyle Oaks , North Derry and South Derry. googletag.cmd.push Logistically it will be dficult to fit in around hurling. So in a case where Tiarnaacuten McHugh is trying to balance North Derry, Drumsurn and Kevin Lynchs, it will be far from ideal. A balance will be needed and proper dialogue between all three managers, with the players training regime at the heart of it. The senior championship will need to be played off over dferent weekends to intermediate and junior. This would be a stumbling block as it stands, with so much tied up in the leagues. Under this new concept, leagues would be totally dferent from championship. Leagues of  with a two up two down relegation, would be devised with one thing in mind – getting as many games as possible. The CCC would allocate rounds on the weekends the NFL is on.     Club games are on Friday or Saturday night, with the county taking place on Sunday. The county manager names his starting  and anyone outside of that, who didnt see any meaningful game time in previous round, is eligible for club football. It would need checked with the county physio, buta player is going to be of any benefit, they need competition in the legs. The advantage is having more games on a more regular basis, with more room to balance the club championship commitments. It would help avoid loggerheads at a time of year when it really matters, it would help get rid of the alarming drop-off rate from players being caught between two stools. A situation where nobody wins and in the case of Derry, it leaves a situation that stles any continuity. ON THE DRAW Last week, Liam Tunneyrandomly picked  numbers and the draw was populated as you see below. It has some mouthwatering ties. North Derrys clash with a Dungiven side clambering their way back from their decline is the tie of the round, with the late Sunday night billing at Owenbeg. The appointment of former Dungiven manager Michael OKane and Darren McShane as managers of North Derry will add a bit of spice along the sideline. South Derrys debut in the championship see them up against a ravenous Slaughtneil, who have aim to win back the John McLaughlin Cup after a two year absence and have the astute Paul Bradley at the helm. In the opposition dugout is Ronan Rocks who will know the intermediate scene well and has an handle on the up and coming minor talent from his time with Derry Us. He is joined in the South Derry management team by Hugh Mulholland, who never misses a club championship game and will know Slaughtneil inside out. Foyle Oaks, under the management of Michael McLaughlin and Joe Gray, come up against Loup, with Paddy Bradley in his first season in charge. Lavey and Coleraine renew their  final rivalries.

At the end of the season, two from the first teams eliminated will meet in a play-off to stay in the senior championship. From the last five years, form will be assessed for wins, draws and defeats, as well as scoring totals to pick the two lowest performing teams, who will play in a relegation play-off. The loser will drop to intermediate, with the intermediate winners promoted to the senior grade.

Robert Fullerton, who is , bought the pound ‘Treasure Bingo’ Scratchcard at his local Vivoxtra store whilst shopping for some essential grocery items on May . Little did Robert know that later the same evening he would discover he’d won an amount , times greater than the price of the scratchcard! The incredible news comes as an amazing boost for Robert and his we Susanas both had been recently furloughed from the company they work for as a result of the COVID- pandemic. googletag.cmd.push Robert works as a spray painter and Susan as a machine operator for a leading local kitchen supplier and, like many across the country, have been furloughed for the past five weeks as part of the Government’s job retention scheme. Robert explained how his le-changing win came about. “I was out doing an essential grocery shop and had a scratchcard in my pocket with a pound win on it. So while I was paying for the groceries, I exchanged it for another similar National Lottery Scratchcard, and bought an extra one for good measure. “I brought the two scratchcards home and played them that night. I didn’t win anything on the first scratchcard and gave it to Susan to check, while I was scratching the second card,” he continued. googletag.cmd.push “Half-way through, it was already showing that I’d won pound, and I started physically shaking. I was thinking to myself, ‘that’s not right’ and had to get up and go outside for some fresh air. “I showed the scratchcard to Susan and took a photo that I sent to my mum and sister – both of whom agreed that I wasn’t seeing things and that, as far as they could see, I’d won three hundred grand! “After a restless night, with little or no sleep, I called The National Lottery the following morning. They asked for some details and then, I’ll never forget, the lady on the phone said… ‘Congratulations, you have won pound,’!     “My reply was ‘you what ’ My heart felt like it was going to burst out of my chest. In fact, I still can’t believe it. It’s like a dream come true, especially in these uncertain times when we’re stuck at home and don’t really know how our jobs will be affected by this coronavirus pandemic.” Despite his big win, Robert hopes to get back to work as soon as possible, saying that he loves his job and the ‘banter’ with his workmates. Robert bought the winning National Lottery Treasure Bingo Scratchcard from the Vivoxtra store on Magherafelt Road in Castledawson.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Bernadette Radclfe, from the Brandywell, bought a ticket for a competition to win a black Lamborghini Gallardo on a whim when she saw it advertised on social media. Mrs Radclfe had just a one in , chance of winning the prize from Derry company Vogue Competitions She couldnt believe her luck when she got a call from Derry singer and entertainer Micky Doherty who had picked her name out using a computerised random number generator. Micky then paid a surprise visit to Bernadette who was celebrating with a cup of tea at her sister Siobhans house in Galliagh Park. googletag.cmd.push Shes doesnt drink, she doesnt smoke and she doesnt drive so she was celebrating with a cup of tea and a Club biscuit, laughed Micky. Anybody  would be drinking a bucket of vodka. Micky said he was delighted Mrs Radclfe had won the prize because shes a lovely person. Shes from the Lecky Road which is where my mother was from so it was very special to me. At first I didnt recognise her name because I would know her as Bernie, but then I realised that I know her and all her sisters for a long time. Shes a lovely person and a real lady. googletag.cmd.push I always say nice things happen to nice people. Earlier that day Bernie was out handing out candles of Sister Clareand I said a wee prayer to Sr Clare before I picked the winner that I would pick the person that deserved it. She works in mysterious ways. The Lamborghini was part of a three part prize draw that also included a Rolex watch which was won by Niall McDaid from Bishops Street from a pound ticket and a lawn mower which went to Patrick McDaid from Rosemount who purchased a ticket for pound. Blaine Tierney of Vogue Competitions and Vogue Car sales in Springtown has given away a large number of cars in competitions since lockdown began in March.     The Lamborghini is our biggest giveaway yet, its an amazing car and it would cost pound, new, he said.

Lynn and Philip Hasson had arranged to get married in Donegals Redcastle Hotel in May, but the coronavirus outbreak halted their plans. The big day was rescheduled for November. However, as the date grew closer they were advised to move the celebrations to October in case lockdown restrictions got tighter again. When the ban on unnecessary cross-border travel came into force in early autumn, the couple were told they couldnt get married in the Republic. Undeterred, they rebooked their wedding at Derrys Beech Hill Country House in Ardmore at the end last month. googletag.cmd.push But on Wednesday, October , they got a call to say they would have to get married three days later, Saturday, October , before fresh lockdown measures came into play. After confirming that her son, Matthew, and his partner could make the wedding, Lynn gave it the go ahead. It was a bit crazy, I was working until .pm on the Thursday so we didnt have much time to pull it together, said Lynn, who is a support worker with Praxis Care. A host of Derry businesses pulled out all the stops to make sure the wedding could go ahead early and Lynn and Philip finally made it down the aisle. googletag.cmd.push We both have big families and lots of friends and we didnt want to leave anyone out so our initial wedding was for  people and ended up being for just  - including the bride and groom. In the end we only had close family and a few friends and they couldnt even bring their partners, but that was just the way it had to happen. There were a few people that couldnt come because they were isolating which was a pity.  Thankfully, Lynns two sons and Philips four children were able to attend. In the end it was very intimate and I stood back and looked and it was all the people that are closest to us which was lovely, said Lynn.     I was starting to think I was jinxed and in the run up to the wedding I was very nervous, but that day around lunch time all of a sudden I felt so, so relaxed. It was a brilliant day. And Lynn isnt resentful that she missed out on her big day As long as no one is sick then anything  is fixable, she said. I wouldnt want to be one of those families waiting on a phone call from the hospital. Lynn and Philp thanked everyone who made their last minute nuptials such a success. Wed like to say a special thank you to Aisling and Michael at the Redcastle who were excellent and gave us a full refund. To Jenny and James at the Beech Hill Country House for making everything run so smoothly and to Lisdale Signature Cars, Funky Cakes, Sass and Halo for the flowers, Natalie Doherty for the photography, Erin Gilroy for the make-up and Charlene Ferguson for the hair. And to my friend Anne Marie Boyle who did the balloons and decorations- she was my rock,” added the new bride.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Special schools and childcare provision will, however, remain open.  “All schools must provide supervised learning for vulnerable children and key workers’ children. “I must stress that these decisions are not made lightly as I know the negative impact on children’s learning and mental health and well-being of not being in school. However, particularly after unprecedented levels of positive Covid- tests since Christmas, and the pressure this applies to our health service, it is critical that we all must consider the public health and scientic advice as we look forward to brighter days ahead.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Colette Rogers, Strategic Lead for Tobacco Control with the PHA, said: “During the COVID- pandemic, our health is more important than ever. Stopping smoking now will have a positive impact on your health, not only in the long-term, but also sooner in ways you probably hadn’t thought about. For example,you smoke, your fingers are in contact with your lips, increasing the possibility of transmission of COVID- from hand to mouth. “This has been a dficult year in lots of ways, but you can use the New Year as an opportunity to take a positive step to quit smoking and make use of our free support services to help. googletag.cmd.push “Due to the present COVID- situation we have put plans in place to ensure you can access PHA-funded Stop Smoking Services while still following social distancing guidelines,” said Colette. “This may include telephone contact or video calls as opposed to face-to-face support. These measures will ensure you can still access Stop Smoking Services in a manner which is safe and convenient for you.” Studies have shown that you are four times more likely to quit with help. Local Stop Smoking Services, nicotine replacement therapyand support from your family and friends can make all the dference when you are quitting, so make sure you are familiar with all the help available. googletag.cmd.push “We know quitting smoking isn’t easy and it can take several attempts for many people to quit for good, butyou are determined you can do it,” said Colette. “There is lots of help available to support you to quit. If you have tried to quit before and relapsed, accept it, work out why it happened, and focus on how you can avoid it happening again. If you found you have relapsed due to the dficulty and stress of the pandemic, remember the positives. You have quit before and you can do it again! “We would encourage people to take the time to look at our website at www.stopsmokingni.info.     As well as support and advice, you will find real le stories of people in Northern Ireland who have quit successfully. You can get insight from their experience and what has motivated them as you consider your smoke free choices this New Year.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Michael OKane took on the role at St Colmcilles Primary School in Claudy after Easter this year, with schools already closed by the first Covid- lockdown. He was nominated for the award by parent Fiona Garrett, who told presenter Stephen Nolan that Mr OKane had helped her children with two particularly tricky transitions. “My son Matthew was transitioning from P to big school and my daughter Oacuterlagh-Janetransitioning from nursery to P,” she said. “My daughter has a statement of special educational needs. During lockdown, she became very distressed at the sudden change of routine and Mr OKane really helped with this. googletag.cmd.push “He did this by doing videos to show her where her new classroom was going to be, what it would look like, who her new classroom assistant was going to be and how to sanitise your hands properly. “He also helped my son with the P leaving transition. My son started becoming distressed at not seeing his friends and the fact they wouldnt get a last opportunity to all be together. “Mr OKane arranged a wonderful Year  leaving mass, where he shot a beautul photo and video of the group together with his drone. “Matthews short, but positive experience of Mr OKane actually inspired him to want to become a teacher now.” googletag.cmd.push Miss Garrett said Mr OKane had gone beyond the call of duty to make sure parents were looked after too, and said he was a special person. “He is so good with children who have special educational needs. He goes above and beyond, going that extra little step just to make everything run smoothly. That takes a special person,” she said. “He goes out of his way to be so approachable and friendly. “Hes in the thick of it with the children, showing them how to use their talents and getting the best out of everyone, including his staff. “He really cares for his school family. Absolutely anything is possible with the right support and Im so grateful.”     Michael admitted it was a shock to receive a call from Stephen Nolan, initially askinganything was wrong, but he regained his composure to pay tribute to the schools staff. “I only started here at Easter and I inherited a fantastic school with fantastic staff and I dont think Ive done too much myself – everybody in the school has really pulled together,” he said. “Im just looking out the window here on a dreary Monday morning and thats the sort of thing we need to hear.

Students save a considerable amount of time by using the laneway to get to and from school.The former Down Council attempted to secure funds to upgrade the laneway and carry out a much-needed resurfacing and lighting scheme but liaising with representatives from a number of statutory agencies including the Housing Executive and Roads Service, the ownership issue could not be firmly established.Describing the laneway as a ldquovital link for residents who live at the Langley Road area in particular, Cllr Walker hopes that, with the publicrsquos help, he can find out who owns the land.ldquoThere are several street lights along part of the laneway but the Department for Infrastructure insists that it is not responsible for the land, he said.Cllr Walker says it is necessary to find out who owns the laneway as work is starting to upgrade Ballynahinchrsquos masterplan which includes a number of new walking trails in and around the town.ldquoWhy not include Beedhamrsquos Lane in the planned trails andwe could find out who this piece of ground it could pave the way for its upgrade, he continued.ldquoPeople could be forgiven for thinking that it leads to a farm. Given that we are in the midst of winter, the laneway is an awful state and children who are walking to school are literally getting covered in mud.Cllr Walker has suggested that it would not cost a signicant sum of money to upgrade the laneway which he suggests has the potential to become a key component of the townrsquos planned new walking trails.ldquoIf anyone can help me identy who is responsible for this piece of land could they contact either myself, the Langley Road Residentsrsquo Association or Newry, Mourne and Down Council, he said.Cllr Walker added: ldquoThe upgrade of this particular laneway has been raised on numerous occasions in the past, but nothing has ever been done.ldquoGiven the high volume of pedestrian traffic which uses it, itrsquos important work gets underway to upgrade it.ldquoIn seeking to find out who owns the laneway I hope that it can be determined of this particular piece of ground is a registered right of way..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22nd December 2020 Caldwell.jpg","title":"Caldwell’s goal seals cup win  ","story":"DOWNrsquoS U- hurlers will have cause to celebrate Christmas with a little more cheer after they clinched the Peadar Oacute Laithaacutein Cup with a two-point win over Meath in Navan on Sunday.Two minutes into injury time, and with the sides deadlocked at - apiece, it looked aswe were heading to extra time when Ryan Byas struck over a wonderful m sideline.Meath looked to have sealed victory from a doggedly tough Down side with virtually the last play of the contest.However, straight from the resulting puck-out Michael Dorrian raced clear of midfield and floated the sliotar towards the edge of the box.Francis Caldwell reached highest and as he slipped past both Cottrell and Ennis in defence.A deftly-placed one handed flick out-foxed Jack Fagan as he lunged out to intercept the sliotar. He could only watch on but as it bypassed his attempts and nestled in the back of the Meath net.Finn Turpin opened the day with the first score of the game inside a minute. Downrsquos captain, Tom McGrattan, knocked over a free a minute later, but by the end of the first quarter Meath were in front as midfielder Joey Cole got the next three scores.McGrattan levelled matters from play shortly afterwards, as both defences were kept busy.On several occasions in the first half, Down threatened the Meath rearguard as goal chances went begging with James Clarke, Michael Dorrian and Caldwell all having attempts saved, blocked or bundled away from danger.Down struggled in the middle of the park and found it hard to win any puck-outs against a physically strong Meath team.They did though throw themselves into every tackle. Jarlath McCollum, Deaglan Mallon and James Higgins played out of their skins, harrying, hustling and shutting down any potential danger as Meath tried in vain to breach the Down defence.A McGrattan free and a Caldwell point saw Down edge into a two-point lead in a very scrappy final ten minutes of the half.With less than three minutes to the whistle, Meath hit a purple patch with four unanswered scores, two courtesy of the dangerous Ryan Byas and the others from corner men Rory Fagan and Josh Harris.Playing with a slight breeze in the first half, Meath knew thatthey were to ensure a victory on home soil, they would surely need some daylight between themselves and their northern opponents before the change of ends.Thankfully for Down, Turpin, Dorrian and Clarke kept Meath on their toes as they eventually managed to engineer the last score of the half.Oisiacuten Coulter popped the sliotar over from out near the side-line to leave just two points between the sides at the end of the half.Within the opening two minutes of the restart, Oisiacuten Coulter continued a good vain of form and had the sides level for the fth time, as both sides refused to yield.Joey Cole pointed four minutes later as the Royals introduced Matthew Cully to full forward, his introduction would breathe new le into their attack.Down initially struggled to handle the burly full forward, who ended the day with three superbly-taken points whilst under severe pressure from their Ulster counterparts.The lead changed hands again as two McGrattan frees and a Michael Dorrian point gave them a slight edge with the game fast approaching the second water break.A Jack Meagher score, followed swtly by Matthew Cullyrsquos first of the day, when he picked Downrsquos pocket after a quick puck-out had failed to reach its intended target, shook Down. Instead of leading going down the home straight, it was level at - each.With  minutes played Denis Darby won a sideline for the home side and when Byas hit the sweetest of strikes straight over Pearse Smythrsquos crossbar there were scenes of jubilation and euphoria from the Meath bench as surely it looked asJustin Coyne would be presented with the cup.Sean Young had this young Down side well drilled and it was a credit to the teamrsquos spirit that within the next  seconds Downrsquos goal machine, Francis Caldwell ensured that it would be a victory for Down in the strangest of seasons five days before Christmas.After seeing Tom McGrattan lt the cup, a delighted Young was magnanimous in victory and praised Meath for the high standard of Hurling that made this contest such a thriller.ldquoWe knew coming into the game today this would be a very dferent challenge than last week, he said.ldquoMeath are always a big strong physical side with a spread of talented Hurlers in their ranks. We knew it wasnrsquot going to be easy to play them in their back yard, it was going to be a monumental task to get over the line.ldquoI thought the game was nip and tuck in the first quarter as our main objective was not to concede any early goals playing against a stf breeze in the first half. I canrsquot praise the boys enough, our bench helped us over the line and it was a superbly taken goal from Francis.Meath: J Fagan, R Ennis, H Cottrell, E Cole, P Connelly, J Coyne, K OrsquoGorman, J Cole , E Grehan, R Byas , J Meagher , S Donnelly, R Fagan , J Harris, S Cunningham .Subs: M Cullyfor Harris, E McCormack for Donnelly, D Darby for Cunningham.Down: P Smyth, J Higgins, D Mallon, J McCollum, N Kelly, C Savage, F McFall, R OrsquoNeill, J Duggan, F Turpin , T McGrattan , M Dorrian , O Coulter , J Clarke, F Caldwell .Subs: S Milliganfor OrsquoNeill, F MacManus for McGrattan..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22nd December 2020 Castlewellan.jpg","title":"Castlewellan woman’s releases debut children’s book  ","story":"A CASTLEWELLAN woman has joined the ranks of childrenrsquos book authors.Kathleen McPolin, who is a Speech and Language Therapy Assistant in Downpatrick SureStart, has just published the first in an exciting new series featuring the farm-based adventures of Boomer and Blanky.Produced by Shanway Press in Belfast, the books are aimed at encouraging early yearsrsquo interest in reading and promote new vocabulary.Part of Kathleenrsquos work with SureStart over the past  years has been helping to facilitate rhythm, rhyme, and story sessions each week for children - with their parents or s.ldquoBecause this age group have short attention spans, I find the books that really capture their attention are the colourful ones with few words but yet have a story to tell, explained Kathleen.After finding it dficult to get the right books to cover everyday topics such as transport, weather, clothes, and food in a short-story style, Kathleen decided to create her own.ldquoChildren love to see the same characters appear regularly in their books. They become familiar with the characters and enjoy the new vocabulary in each story. My stories are intentionally short with the aim of retaining the childrsquos interest.ldquoThe language is at the childrsquos level, Kathleen continued. ldquoI have used repetitive language because this is a great way to encourage early words and sounds. My hope is not only to help a child develop their speech and language skills but also to foster a love for reading.The first of Kathleenrsquos books is entitled Boomer and Blanky On the Farm. Therersquos no water on Hollybush Farm and the two central characters come to the rescue in a delightfully written and beautully illustrated story. Other adventures featuring the two heroes will appear in .Kathleen was brought up on a farm and now helps her husband, John, and three sons whenever she can.

On the side of a rural road, devoid of street lights, all but hidden by trees, was an old fashioned car, with smoke escaping from its engine.Standing beside the car, kicking it was a young woman in a bridal dress. She appeared to be beating up the motor. Jim applied the brakes of his vehicle and rolled down the window.lsquoCan I help rsquo The young woman looked at him with burning blue eyes, turned away and thumped the boot. lsquoUseless piece of junk,rsquo she shrieked. The young woman attempted to give the car one last kick, missed and ped with a thud on to her rear. Jim got out of his car. Trying not to laugh he rushed over to the young woman and attempted to help her to her feet.She pulled her arm away and with an effort dragged herself up using the carrsquos half open door.

The lady could not walk to her own wedding, besides it was growing dark. She grabbed his coat in near panic. lsquoMy ring,rsquo she cried. lsquoIrsquove lost my engagement ring!rsquo She dropped on to her knees. lsquoThis is a nightmare and you are not helping.rsquoJim walked at speed to his car and grabbed a torch as the bride crawled around the ground, feeling the earth in a vain attempt to retrieve the ring. Jim ed and shone the torch about the trees and grass. She grabbed his leg and pointed towards her car.lsquoItrsquos cursed, the car is cursed, and so are you.rsquo She bit him on the knee. lsquoGet off me,rsquo he shouted. She sat back on a muddy mound. lsquoI may have overreacted,rsquo she said. lsquoIs my lipstick smudged rsquo She wiped her hand across her lips. rsquoI think it might be smudged.rsquoJim did not answer, choosing to rub his knee, shine the torch, find the ring and hightail it to his unclersquos house as fast as possible. lsquoItrsquos all go,rsquo she said, trying to make conversation. lsquoIf my father could see me now, he would be so proud.rsquo The young woman adjusted her veil. It slowly drooped on to the side of her head and from there drted towards her lap. She picked it up and tossed it away.Jim located the ring beside the front wheel. lsquoIrsquove got it, Irsquove got the ring.rsquo He retrieved it and gave it a amateur polish. It was silver with an small amber stone as its centre piece. He read the inion lsquoTo M.K, Saul rsquo. It must have been handed down through her intendedrsquos family.lsquoYou great big sexy man.

Jim had spotted a somewhat sad looking gentleman on the road a few minutes before. lsquoShall we go rsquo asked the bride, as she gathered up her dress and walked towards his car, tripping over her loose shoe, all the while muttering under her breath.They didnrsquot speak much during the short trip to the church lsquoYes, I am looking for a ring.

The car came to a halt outside the little church. Warm lights beamed from inside. Jim thought it was an odd time of day to get married and a strange time of year. A few indistinct people stood around the grounds of the church.The bride opened the door, lsquoIrsquom here,rsquo she said and fell out of the car, lsquoIrsquom alright,rsquo she said painfully, stood up and slipped. Steadying herself, she kicked his car and her shoe dropped off. She picked it up and without so much as a thank you, disappeared, muddy and wet, into the church, resembling a worn-out scarecrow more than a bride. Jim waited a moment before driving off.Uncle Will and Jim talked and joked as they caught up with all the news over tea and cake. lsquoDid you ever meet Maureen Walsh rsquo asked Uncle Will. Jim shook his head as he helped himself to an extra slice of cake.Your grandfather was meant to give her lt to her wedding. She and he didnrsquot hit it off.rsquoUncle Will poked the dying embers of the fire. lsquoHe wasnrsquot one for bathing,rsquo he mumbled under his breath.lsquoShe died a few hours ago.

It was slightly bizarre, as one was a track and field meet, and the other a cross country race.As most of us donrsquot know what day it is, let alone which month, this blending of two dferent seasons seemed acceptable to many.The ANI Winter Track Series, spread over two nights, included a range of distances with East Down ACrsquos Neil Curran opting to give the km a blast. He has mostly been training solo since March and was glad of the opportunity to mix with some speedy competitors.He raced well and was pleased with third place in his heat. He recorded a time of .. which is only five seconds off his PB for the distance and proves that he remains in good form, despite the lack of racing to keep him sharp.In  his attempts at this distance exceeded the  minute barrier so this represents commendable progress overall. Keep at it Neil.The first cross country event of the  autumn season was also the last of the year. The Bobby Rea Memorial had been scheduled and rescheduled as restrictions rose and fell, but finally got away on Sunday at the Billy Neill playing fields in Comber.There was a limit on the entries and waves were allocated to permit social distancing. Sadly there were no spectators allowed. East Down AC had only three runners taking part as the change of date had affected overall attendance.The first to test the underfoot conditions were the senior men with Aaron McGrady representing East Down.The race got underway after a short period of silence in honour of John McKeag, the Ballydrain Harriers stalwart who sadly passed away the previous Monday in his th year.Aaron had hoped to fit in this particular race as a marker for his form ahead of the Intermediate Championships scheduled for mid-January but now likely to face abandonment due to the lockdown proposed to be implemented for six weeks after Christmas.The race consisted of two laps of .km each, the shorter distance designed, like the ision of the runners, into waves of up to a maximum of  runners each, to prevent mass overtaking to comply with social distancing requirements.As only half of the over  entries turned up, it was necessary to use only two waves.Aaron was drawn in the first wave alongside the faster runners and though he prefers to start relatively slowly and then set out to catch those in front, he doubtedit would be possible on this occasion so he was well to the fore from the off and came through at the end of the first lap in fourth place.However he stuck with his pre-race plan and when the runners re-appeared at the end of lap two, he was in third place behind Mark McKinstryand Craig McMeechan , and comfortably maintained his position until the finish line.He said afterwards that he was happy with how the race had gone and had no regrets about his tactics. The first three recorded times were ., . and . respectively, which is pretty hot running on a cross country course that was holding a fair amount of overnight rain. Well done Aaron.The second race was for senior and masters women and East Down AC again had only one representative mdash the ever-enthusiastic Sharon Madine.Sharon started conservatively in the second of the two waves, but proceeded to make steady progress and at the end of her two laps she had a time of . against her name. When the results of both waves were combined she placed overall th but first in the over- category. Well worth the efforts Sharon.The third and final event of the day was for Male Masters and again a sole East Down AC runner mdash the evergreen Dee Murray. Another who seems to have lost none of his competitive edge during the pandemic, Dee simply turns up and runs as hard as he can.On Sunday this meant that his time of . gave him th place overall and second in the over- category. Well done Dee.In spite of the absence of spectators, all who turned up said that it was well organised and they were glad to have taken part. As one of the few interested official observers, I have to agree with that.Sandwiched between these two events was the East Down AC annual Xmas predicted K at the Downshire Estate on Thursday evening.This is a fun event where runners try to guess how long they will take to cover the distance and then without a watch or other timing device do their best to match it. With the emphasis on accuracy and pacing rather than speed the way is wide open for all to snatch the prize.The top five were impressively close to their predicted times with fth place going to Johnny Holmes, who was seven seconds out. Deirdre Weatherall and Colin Shields tied for third equal - each with a five-second deficit.Seamus Savage was four seconds off his guess, which was good going, but it would have been hard to beat the winner Maureen Kelly who was a mere one second to the better of her guess. She was delighted to top the table and over the moon to find that her prize was a hamper of goodies as well as a pound voucher for Bells Supervalu Crossgar. Congratulations Maureen.Even though the runners had to be split into waves and social distancing was enforced, it was the best that was on offer due to current circumstances and it was a good boost to club morale. Instead of charging the normal entry fee, members were asked to donate food items which have been duly delivered to the Fountain Foodbank in the town.All in all it was a successful night for all concerned and an uplting end to a less than inspiring .

The enthralling cup tie ended - after  minutes with the sides locked at - after extra-time at Hampden Park.Hazard, who was recently handed the number one jersey by Hoops boss Neil Lennon, made both his European and Scottish Premiership debuts and retained the starting jersey for Sundayrsquos final.The stopper mdash who has also forced his way into the Northern Ireland international squad mdash was delighted to play a major part in his sidersquos cup final victory.And while his current contract expires in the summer which allows him to negotiate with other clubs in January, should he favour a move away from Celtic Park, leaving the club he has supported since he was a boy is the last thing on his mind.Conor described Sundayrsquos cup final as ldquocrazy day for him and his family who watched the match at home.ldquoThree weeks ago, I would never have been able to picture what happened there on that pitch, he said moments after his penalty shoot-out heroics.ldquoI am just absolutely over the moon. Irsquove been a Celtic fan my whole le and to get this opportunity, well I am just delighted, he said.ldquoTo play for such a worldwide club, we know what the fans expect and how much they drive us towards winning. It is an honour to play for them. I want to fully focus on each match, playing week in, week out here at Celtic, and hopefully it will come together.Conor said the final was a ldquomomentous day for him and his family, explaining that his lsquophone hasnrsquot stopped ringing.Conor grew up in Downpatrick and developed his skills in the Celtic academy, travelling across to Scotland for games from a young age.ldquoThe club means everything to me, he said. ldquoWe used to get up at am to get on the boat to go to matches and we wouldnrsquot be home until three the next morning. Itrsquos something I always dreamed of growing up.Conor has spent several spells out on loan in recent years in order to build-up his first team experience, readying him for a career between the sticks for Celtic.He got his chance to impress against Lille and Kilmarnock r as Celticrsquos form hit a rocky patch, but being selected by Lennon for the win over Hearts at Hampden Park was a huge confidence boost.ldquoI have to thank all of the staff and the manager for putting trust in me, said Conor.ldquoIt was a huge honour in such a big game. Thankfully, I was able to repay that trust with the two penalty saves. I have put a lot of work in and gone on loan spells waiting for my chance. The coaches have helped me a lot throughout the club.Sundayrsquos cup win clinched the domestic treble for Celtic for the fourth successive campaign, something that has never before been achieved. It is also the th time Celtic have been crowned Scottish Cup winners, with the Downpatrick man admitting the team has a lot of work to do to try and achieve its aims and targets this year.ldquoThe final was only my third game for the club, so Irsquom taking each day as it comes. As a team and as a group, this win could be a major factor in turning things round, he added.Conorrsquos family watched his cup final heroics at home in Downpatrick as fans were not allowed to attend the match due to coronavirus restrictions. However, they were over the moon with his achievements.ldquoI donrsquot think I have any fingernails left after that, laughed his beaming dad Gary. ldquoWe didnrsquot know up until the last minutehe would get the nod to play or not. We knew he did well in the European game and certainly made a case for himself. He only found out on Thursday from Lennon that he would be playing.Whilst there was undoubted pride from his dad, Gary said Conor has deserved his break due to how hard he has worked.ldquoHe has put so much time into Celtic over the years and done all the right things. All the close family are so proud of him, his mum Pauline, his younger brother Jack. He was superb.ldquoConor very much wants to be able to go on and make himself number one for Celtic. He is only  and this was just his third appearance, so hersquos been doing well. He had a loan spell at Dundee and did very well there and that has put him in good stead.Gary said Conor has also been drawing high praise from his Northern Ireland manager Ian Barraclough after breaking through for the senior team too.ldquoBarraclough has spoken really highly of Conor. He did very well for him when he was the manager at under-age level and the boss knows what he can do in training, he said.Conorrsquos family are no strangers to sporting success either.

The pupils I spoke to were confident and articulate users of the digital resources at their disposal. The school has developed effective support links during the pandemic to support distance learning.St Josephrsquos also received a special recognition badge last month for Cyber Resilience and Internet Safety, becoming the third primary school in Northern Ireland to be awarded this badge.The school had completed a pioneering education initiative developed to encourage online safety and cyber resilience amongst pupils in schools.The assessment report noted: lsquoSt Josephrsquos is a dynamic school which has a careful, considered and planned approach to developing and delivering a safe and secure digital technology learning environment for their pupils and have fully engaged their parental community in this development.rsquoPrincipal Laura Fitzsimons said: ldquoWe are delighted to have been awarded these prestigious titles which highlight the schoolrsquos continual investment in resources and training.ldquoWe are very pleased and proud of our teachers, student digital leaders and all our pupils for their commitment to digital learning.ldquoIt was particularly pleasing to receive this positive news in light of the challenging times which we are currently living in..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22nd December 2020 Talking.jpg","title":"Talking about coercive control  ","story":"TODAY there are mothers and their children from the wider Downpatrick area living in refuges run by Womenrsquos Aid.There may be more over the Christmas and New Year period as the festive time can be a dangerous time for people living with their abuser.The prospect of a six-week lockdown means that demand for help is also set to increase as Womenrsquos Aid supported , women and children during the last lockdown.Eileen Murphy, chief executive officer of the charity, has in her -plus years of working provided support to women from the Downpatrick area.Based in Newry, she works closely with the South Eastern Domestic Violence Partnership run by the local Health Trust and in partnership with other agencies, including the PSNI.ldquoOur refuges run at % capacity but we also work with many women who never stay in our refuges, said Eileen.She is all too aware of the worry and fear that some women will be experiencing over the holiday period.ldquoMothers will be trying to make the best Christmas Day possible for their children, no matter the situation. They will be hoping that he [the abuser] will be OK, she explained.ldquoI have seen over the years that women and children develop this radar with antennas scanning all the time to judge his mood, howrsquos he walking, howrsquos he eating, scanning constantly all the time, thinking is it safe, is he OK, are we annoying him  It will not matter as he is only one who can control his behaviour.While Eileen is keen to highlight that Womenrsquos Aid will provide   help to women, she also wants to dispel some myths about domestic abuse and violence and to talk about coercive control mdash any act or a pattern of acts of assault, threats, humiliation and intimidation or other abuse that is used to harm, punish, or frighten victims.ldquoOne of the main things we do for women when they come into the service is to help her understand that there was not anything she did as therersquos nothing she could have done which would have stopped him, she said.ldquoWe have women who have had to beg to have a shower and we have women who phone us who are literally hiding in a hedge as hersquos walking up and down the street trying to find her.ldquoA lot of us think its black eyes and broken bones but the real damage is the psychological torture that is going on where women and children are terrorised in their own home. They are led to believe that everything is all their fault, they are at the root cause of whatever incident. When you are living with that  , you are only surviving.Womenrsquos Aid recently launched an awareness campaign called lsquoUnlock Your Lockdownrsquo to highlight their services to women who are living in fear or under threat.Eileen said: ldquoI would say that any woman who is worried at how she is going to get through Christmas andit is to do with her partner, then I would say to ring us and have a chat. We donrsquot force anybody into the service and we donrsquot make women leave home, thatrsquos always their choice.ldquoWhat we do is to work with her and help her to determine where she is and whatrsquos the best option for her. It can be either just one phone call to her engaging in full services for anything up to two years.She stressed that the first thing Womenrsquos Aid do when a women calls them is to assess the risk she and her children are in.ldquoThe first we do is assess the risk, to find out how safe she is, where she is, where her children are, what is the immediate priority  she stressed.ldquoDepending on the level of risk, we may had to do several dferent things. It could be that a woman is hiding out at a family member or friendrsquos house, so it might involve the police or social services.Then we try to manage the risk and reduce it as much as possible and then we try and work with out how best to help her move forward and to keep her safe. For the top % of women who come to us, we would hold a Multi-Agency Risk Assessmentconference and then we would work with them on a continuous basis.ldquoHowever, I would like to stress there is no such thing as low level risk of domestic abuse for women because the only person who is in control of whether that risk is high, low or medium is the perpetrator.She is dismissive of abusers where an incident of abuse involves either drink or drugs.ldquoIf you keep terrorising the people that you love and continually use the excuse of alcohol or drugs I donrsquot buy that, said Eileen.ldquoWhat drink and drugs to is give him an excuse for violence. When itrsquos over he will say it was the drink or whatever. But I always say to that isI woke up tomorrow morning to see my partner battered or bruised and he told me I had done it last night with drink in me, would I take a drink again  Yet these guys continue to do it.ldquoThere is no doubt about that we work with traumatised women and children and people try and deal with it in many dferent ways.

As a consequence the unionist community has become war weary. This has been demonstrated by the lack of any signicant opposition to the implementation of an EU customs border in Irish Sea.   \" fill\"#ea\"  to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

It also means the People of Northern Ireland are now subject to EU laws without any democratic representation. This is a situation that would spark international outrageit was happening to any other community of people in the western world. However rather than make this case it would seem that the current strategy of the DUP leadership is to avoid potential electoral losses. The party now seeks to play down the long term constitutional signicance of the border and deny any responsibility in its creation .Grassroots DUP members must ask themselves how they can with any creditability celebrate the country’s centenary when their party is actively cooperating with a mechanism which will result in NI being gradually erased from the political atlas Eventhe NI Protocol cannot now be stopped, for the unionist parties to allow such a blatant violation of the principle of consent to continue without any consequence for local devolution is inexcusable. Their ongoing inaction is sending a message of defeatism to the ious strands of Irish nationalism, who believe Political Unionism has no bottom line. It also serves as an open invitation to the Irish Government to make further interventions in the Internal affairs of the Province, gradually eroding what is left of British Sovereignty. Be under no illusion that Eire will soon assume a self-appointed role of becoming NI’s representative in the EU. Unionists must use the opportunity of Northern Ireland’s centenary to rediscover their confidence and resolve. They must renew their zeal in upholding their right to exist as a small nation. They must demand their basic human right of no Government without representation.They also need to remind themselves that a united Ireland could nevereffectively without their cooperation. They are not as weak as its opponents would wish. Nor are their elected representatives quite as powerless to shape events as perhaps they would have us believe.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityMike Kingston, who this week collected his long service medal to recognise the achievement, has shared his pride and some of his memories over the years.Mr Kingston, who is married and has two children and two grandchildren, joined Penarth RNLI on November  , as a volunteer crew member ndash and quickly progressed to become leboat helm.Along with his fellow volunteer crew members, he attended hundreds of incidents, launching day and night in all kinds of weather conditions, to go to the aid of people in trouble at sea.Since his retirement from being a sea-going member of the team, he has spent the last  years as shore crew and one of Penarthrsquos Deputy Launching Authorities, liaising with the coastguards when they request assistance, and managing the leboatrsquos launch.Mr Kingstonrsquos leboat career has extended beyond the UK. In , he was a member of a crew of just eight leboat volunteers from across the UK who flew out to aid the relief effort in flood-stricken Mozambique.Together, the team faced the dangers of crocodiles, hippos, poisonous snakes and anti-personnel mines, navigating rivers that had burst their banks, in a rescue mission to bring desperately needed medical relief to , people in villages marooned by flood waters.ldquoWe had five small D class inflatable leboats, and had to ferry doctors and medical supplies to areas that had been written off as impossible, as helicopters couldnrsquot land there and they were inaccessible by road, he said.ldquoIt was so hot that the soles of my boots melted. We had to spend the night on sandbars where we took turns to keep watch, as the crocodiles were very keen to join us.Since he joined the crew, Mike has combined his volunteering with his paid job in the South Wales Fire and Rescue service. He joined the service back in , at just , and progressed from his position as a firefighter, to the lead instructor for recruit training, finally finishing his career in  as Chair of the Water Rescue group, and a member of the servicersquos all Wales flood response team.Over the past four decades, -year-old Mr Kingston has seen huge changes in the way the RNLI operates.He has seen Penarth leboat station move from its original home in the deck chair store underneath the current Coffi Co building on the Esplanade, to its current location just up the road in a purpose built, modern leboat station.ldquoIrsquom sure the people of Penarth will remember the hand held maroons that were fired off by a leboat crew member to call the rest of us to the station for a launch, he said.ldquoBut even before that, I remember when the Pier Master would get us down to the station by firing the maroons out of a small cannon.ldquoNowadays, technology has moved on and we use pagers, mobiles phones and computer systems to respond to a shout.ldquoThese systems are a lot more sophisticated, but itrsquos still the same feeling when yoursquore called out of bed in the early hours of a freezing cold January morning.ldquoNo matter how times have moved on, one thing that remains constant is the unbelievable commitment of the whole RNLI team.ldquoThere have been so many highs and lows over the past  years. As all the team will know, itrsquos good to feel that yoursquore part of a team, giving something to your community.ldquoBut there have also been some sad times when people have lost their lives. Irsquom proud to have been a part of Penarth RNLI family.Thanking him for his  years of service, Jason Dunlop, Penarth Leboat Operations Manager said: ldquoOn behalf of all at Penarth leboat station, I would like to congratulate Mike on this fantastic achievement and thank him for his commitment and support to saving lives at sea over the last  years.

These projected figures are the highest we have ever seen in this County and are likely to reach almost , cases per , in the seven-day period up until Christmas Day.If you compare that with the figure of  cases per , when we entered the local lockdown, you can see how serious the current situation is. We can no longer be complacent.We know from the first and second waves that as case numbers increase, more people get seriously unwell, and we will inevitably see more deaths from Coronavirus - many of which can be avoided,we act now.We are deeply concerned that hospitals and primary care services across Cardf and the Vale of Glamorgan are now under unsustainable pressure due to COVID-, and sadly, but inevitably, the number of people who are becoming very sick is increasing daily.Each and every one of us has a responsibility to act now. We must all follow Welsh Government coronavirus regulations, butyou can also take further actions to protect those you love, then we urge you to do so.We should not meet with anyone outside our household bubble and keep contact with people outside our household to an absolute minimum until the current threat has passed, but especially in the run-up to Christmas.We know that staying away from loved ones will be painful for many, especially at this time of year, butwe do this now, we will be doing everything we can to protect our family and friends for the months to come.We know many people think that the vaccine is going to become more widely available, so everything is going to be okay. Regrettably, that is simply not the case. If we donrsquot change our behaviour now,many people will die before the vaccine is rolled out, people who donrsquot need to die, possibly people who you know.The full roll out of the vaccine will take many months, so now is not the time to be complacent. Very few of us are immune and the virus is still prevalent in our communities and our hospitals. By practising social distancing, washing our hands regularly and wearing face coverings we will all be doing our bit to help.So, our message is simple.Wash your hands regularly oryou canrsquot do that use sanitiser hand gel.Please try and stay at home and only go out for essential reasons andit is essential to go out, please do so in quieter periods.If you do go out, wear a mask when required and keep socially distanced by at least  metres, wherever possible.Please do not mix with other households or your friends.Work from home,you can do so.If you develop symptoms such as a new and continuous cough, a temperature, or a loss of taste or smell please self-isolate with your household and arrange a test.These small steps can really help us all to keep our communities safe.As a Health Board and Council, we are fully mobilised in the fight against COVID-. Doing so continues to be a huge challenge and is one that we will best achieve,we do it together, just as we did in the Spring.We are asking every one of you to achieve this challenge together.Letrsquos stop the spread, and letrsquos keep the Vale of Glamorgan, the NHS and our loved ones safe.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Hospitality businesses would have joined them on pm Christmas Day, with a level four lockdown coming into place on Monday, December . The five day lsquorelaxationrsquo period would have still been in place according to these rules, but a change from three households mixing to two.But on Saturday, December , all this changed as prime minister Boris Johnson held a press conference to update the UK on the rapid spread of the new strain of coronavirus and announcing that the South East of England, including London would be moved into tier four.Tier four means residents must stay at home with some limited exemptions ndash which includes workunable to do so from home, however, working from home is strongly advisedit is possible. Non-essential services must also close. People also must not enter or leave a tier four area.This also saw a change to Englandrsquos Christmas restrictions, with households banned from mixing, apart from single households, which would be allowed to form a bubble to avoid isolation.Areas in the lower tiers were still allowed to continue to mix with up to three households ndash however, only on Christmas Day.So, what did this announcement mean for Wales The announcement by the prime minister was focused specically on England, but it was followed by Walesrsquo first minister making an announcement of his own the same evening. He announced that the tier four lockdown would come into place from midnight on Saturday, December , meaning businesses had a matter of hours to come to terms with the news and people rushed out to do some last-minute Christmas shopping before all the non-essential retail closed.Some of the supermarkets across Wales have now taken their lsquonon-essentialrsquo items off sale.The festive period bubble rule has also changed, with a maximum of two households allowed to mix on Christmas Day.MORE NEWS:Mr Drakeford said in a statement on Saturday evening that the pattern of transmission in London and the South East of England, which is linked to the new iant of coronavirus, is ldquoremarkably consistent with the rapid acceleration of transmission in Wales in recent weeks.Also in the statement, the first minister said that latest evidence had suggested the new strain is present throughout Wales and that it needed an ldquoimmediate response.After meeting with the Welsh Governmentrsquos Cabinet on Saturday and taking into consideration advice from senior medical and scientic advisors, he said: ldquoThe situation is incredibly serious. I cannot overstate this.ldquoWe have therefore reached the dficult decision to bring forward the alert level four restrictions for Wales, in line with the action being taken in London and the South East of England.Dr Chris Williams, incident director for the Novel Coronavirusoutbreak at Public Health Wales said in a statement: ldquoAs indicated by the Welsh Government, the immediate introduction of new restrictions is related to the identication of a new more transmissible iant of Coronavirus. Public Health Wales has been working with UK partners to investigate and respond to this iant.ldquoIt is normal for viruses to undergo mutations, and we expect this to happen. Although the iant is easier to transmit, there is currently no evidence that it is more severe.ldquoWe are reminding people that all current guidance relating to Coronavirus continues to apply to the new iant, including advice relating to symptoms, social distancing, self-isolation, and vaccination.ldquoThe new iant shows up as positive in Public Health Walesrsquo existing Coronavirus tests, and people must continue to seek a test in the usual waythey develop Coronavirus symptoms.ldquoIf you or a member of your household develop a cough, fever or change in sense of taste or smell, you must self-isolate immediately and book a free Coronavirus test by calling .ldquoPublic Health Wales urges everyone to follow the rules, to avoid transmission of Coronavirus and to protect everyone in our communities, including the most vulnerable. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

And light does more than create a festive mood mdash light brings hope.ldquoFor Christians, Jesus is lsquothe light of the worldrsquo, but we canrsquot celebrate his birth today in quite the usual way. People of all faiths have been unable to gather as they would wish for their festivals, such as Passover, Easter, Eid and Vaisakhi. But we need le to go on.ldquoLast month, fireworks lit up the sky around Windsor, as Hindus, Sikhs and Jains celebrated Diwali, the festival of lights, providing joyous moments of hope and unity mdash despite social distancing.ldquoRemarkably, a year that has necessarily kept people apart has, in many ways, brought us closer. Across the Commonwealth, my family and I have been inspired by stories of people volunteering in their communities, helping those in need.ldquoIn the United Kingdom and around the world, people have risen magnicently to the challenges of the year, and I am so proud and moved by this quiet, indomitable spirit. To our young people in particular I say thank you for the part you have played.ldquoThis year, we celebrated International Nursesrsquo Day, on the th anniversary of the birth of Florence Nightingale. As with other nursing pioneers like Mary Seacole, Florence Nightingale shone a lamp of hope across the world.ldquoToday, our frontline services still shine that lamp for us ndash supported by the amazing achievements of modern science ndash and we owe them a debt of gratitude.ldquoWe continue to be inspired by the kindness of strangers and draw comfort that ndash even on the darkest nights ndash there is hope in the new dawn.MORE NEWS:Do you know what happened to this poor kitten How Sully came together at Christmas through the power of the artsAll the supermarket opening times over Christmas and New YearldquoJesus touched on this with the parable of the Good Samaritan. The man who is robbed and left at the roadside is saved by someone who did not share his religion or culture. This wonderful story of kindness is still as relevant today.ldquoGood Samaritans have emerged across society showing care and respect for all, regardless of gender, race or background, reminding us that each one of us is special and equal in the eyes of God.ldquoThe teachings of Christ have served as my inner light, as has the sense of purpose we can find in coming together to worship.ldquoIn November, we commemorated another hero ndash though nobody knows his name. The Tomb of the Unknown Warrior isnrsquot a large memorial, but everyone entering Westminster Abbey has to walk around his resting place, honouring this unnamed combatant of the First World War mdash a symbol of selfless duty and ultimate sacrice.ldquoThe Unknown Warrior was not exceptional. Thatrsquos the point. He represents millions like him who throughout our history have put the lives of others above their own, and will be doing so today. For me, this is a source of enduring hope in dficult and unpredictable times.ldquoOf course, for many, this time of year will be tinged with sadness: some mourning the loss of those dear to them, and others missing friends and family members distanced for safety, when all theyrsquod really want for Christmas is a simple hug or a squeeze of the hand.ldquoIf you are among them, you are not alone, and let me assure you of my thoughts and prayers.ldquoThe Bible tells how a star appeared in the sky, its light guiding the shepherds and wise men to the scene of Jesusrsquos birth. Let the light of Christmas mdash the spirit of selflessness, love and above all hope mdash guide us in the times ahead.ldquoIt is in that spirit that I wish you a very happy Christmas. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.
