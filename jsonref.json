Meghan Markle imagined here wearing the gown she is rumoured to wear on her wedding day, at the Ralph \u0026amp Russo fashion show at Paris Fashion WeekWill Meghan’s wedding dress impact the bridal industry?Meghan, like Kate Middleton, is likely to choose a dress from a British brand in order to curry favour with the public and in turn, boost the nation’s valuable fashion and bridal industries.Despite the Meghan Markle effect being an industry in itself, being valued at £150 million to the British fashion industry in the form of unofficial brand endorsements, the new Royal’s impact on the bridal industry may be more subtle.After Kate Middleton’s marriage to Prince William, some bridal designers decided to replicate the Sarah Burton for Alexander McQueen dress with hopes that all those who had watched the Royal Wedding would want to purchase a wedding dress similar to hers.According to Lori Conley, Senior Vice President of Product and Design at David’s Bridal, the recreated dress with lace sleeves, plunging neckline and full skirt did not sell. ‘We have internal benchmarks we work with to understand traction of a dress. It feel below those.’While women were inspired by Kate’s look, they did not want to feel as if they were in a costume, so bridal designers are expected to take elements from Meghan’s dress after May 19 and incorporate them in their new collections.However, before the 2011 Royal Wedding, 75 per cent of wedding dresses that David’s Bridal sold were strapless, but after, around 65 percent of brides opted for something with more coverage, from straps to full sleeves.          Kate Middleton seen here on her wedding day with her Maid of Honour and sister Pippa Middleton at Westminster Abbey in LondonIn the same way, Kate’s second wedding dress sparked an interest in sashes, Brides magazine Deputy Digital Director Roberta Correia told Racked that bridal designers are still being influenced by this accessory seven years on.‘Long sleeves, V-necks, and lace have been seen all over the bridal runways since, even at the most recent Bridal Fashion Week. H\u0026ampM released a new dress as part of their wedding collection, which looked almost exactly like Kate’s,’ Roberta said.Although there is high consumer interest in what Meghan wears, trend adoption is slower in the bridal industry, but some brands, like minimalist brand Floravere have already announced that they will have styles inspired by the dress ready within days of the Royal Wedding.Floravere CEO Molly Kang said: ‘As soon as she goes down the aisle, we can see what’s going to explode, whether it’s silhouette, fabric, or neckline.’Royal Wedding dressesWhile Meghan has somewhat disregarded the unspoken Royal dress code when it comes to her day-to-day fashion, she is expected to go for a traditional and classic bridal gown for her big day, similar to what other Royal brides have worn before her.The Queen’s wedding dressQueen Elizabeth II wore a timeless dress designed by the favoured royal couturier Norman Hartnell for her marriage to Lord Philip Mountbatten.The Duchesse ivory silk-creation took three months to complete and had a heart-shaped neckline with a scalloped edge, crystals and a 13 foot patterned train. Like all British brides at the time, the Government gave her 200 extra clothing coupons towards her wedding trousseau.          This picture was taken during the wedding of Princess Elizabeth and the Duke of Edinburgh showing the couple at Buckingham PalacePrincess Margaret’s wedding dress Princess Margaret, the Countess of Snowdon and The Queen’s sister, was seen in a non-traditional dress made from silk organza in what was dubbed the most glamorous wedding of its time, in 1960.During her first marriage to Antony Armstrong-Jones, the Princess wore a modern dress with a skirt comprising of 30 metres of fabric, also designed by Norman Hartnell.Critics claimed it was the simplest wedding gown in history, yet beautiful and sophisticated and can be seen as part of a display at Kensington Palace in London.          Princess Margaret and Anthony Armstrong Jones seen here on the balcony of Buckingham Palace on their wedding day with one of the Princess\u0027s bridesmaidsPrincess Diana’s wedding dressAt the time, Lady Diana Spencer’s wedding dress was known as the ‘most closely guarded secret in fashion history’.Designed by David and Elizabeth Emanuel, the meringue style gown was worth £9,000 in 1981 and is now valued at approximately £36,800.For her wedding to Prince Charles, Diana’s dress was made of ivory silk taffeta and antique lace with what has now become an iconic 25 foot train.

You won’t see a lot of skin. At least you shouldn’t. It would be seen as disrespectful,’ Meier said. She continued to explain that dresses in black or white should not be worn, as white is for the bride and black is still associated with mourning.While light prints and patterns are welcome at a Spring wedding, big and block patterns are unacceptable but international guests will be permitted to wear their country’s equivalent.          Spain\u0027s Prince Felipe seen here flanked by Princess Letizia and Spain\u0027s Queen Sofia, outside of Westminster Abbey ahead of the wedding between Prince William and Kate MiddletonAccording to etiquette experts Debrett’s, Meghan Markle’s boundary-pushing style will allow for some leeway when it comes to traditional Royal Wedding protocol.It may be unusual to see women wearing trousers at a wedding, but Meghan’s own decision to wear a pantsuit at formal events may mean that covered legs could be welcomed on the big day, especially after jumpsuits were approved at Royal Ascot’s Royal Enclosure.Many invitees may also take a page out of Kate’s book and choose a piece by British labels such as Stella McCartney, Burberry, Emilia Wickstead, Erdem or even Marks and Spencer, as Meghan Markle has in the past.Will Royal Wedding guests be required to wear hats?Women often start with the hat when planning their outfits, as Meier explained and they are kept on during a wedding church service. ‘Hats are a sign of festivity for a British wedding. They are kept on inside the church, but people should be careful of the people sitting behind them. It\u0027s not the Kentucky Derby. No huge brims. Nothing too high.’Princess Beatrice’s hat at Prince William’s wedding was regarded ‘ridiculous in so many ways’ by Royal watcher Anne Chertoff.          Princess Beatrice seen here wearing the Philip Treacy hat she wore at the wedding of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge in 2011When it comes to shoes, open toes, wedges and slingbacks are too informal. Meier said: ‘You want something that is about 4 inches maximum. \u0027The walk in is not going to be easy. There are lots of cobblestones even though there will be different types of carpeting.’In addition to this, handbags should be small as the seating in St. George’s Chapel is very tight, so clutches are recommended.What will men wear to the Royal Wedding?Those who have a military uniform are encouraged to wear it, but most men will opt for a morning suit in either grey, navy or black with coattails. Men will also be expected to wear a waistcoat and a regular tie.For lounge suits, the rule of thumb is the darker it is, the more formal it will look and that rules goes for morning suits too. In the same way, brown shoes are considered less formal than black ones.          Prince William and his wife Kate, Duchess of Cambridge, seen here coming out of Westminster Abbey in London, after their wedding service in 2011What will Meghan Markle wear?Despite the Royal Wedding dress designer being a closely-guarded secret, rumours have suggested that Ralph \u0026amp Russo is the British couturer that has been picked by Meghan Markle. The dress is expected to be a hand-stitched and heavily beaded gown with long sleeves.What will Prince Harry wear?Prince Harry will most likely wear his Household Cavalry British Army uniform and it has been rumoured that he will have to shave his beard because facial hair is frowned upon by the military circle, according to Elle.However, Harry may also go for a morning suit because the wedding is a much more low key affair than that of his brother, Prince William’s. Other rumours suggest that he will wear the Royal Marines ceremonial uniform as a mark of respect to the regiment he took over from Prince Philip.Dancing With The Stars finale: Date, time, finalists and moreThe French Open 2018: Roland Garros dates, schedule and tickets revealedBachelorette 2018: Chris Harrison reveals premiere will have \u0027most ridiculous fight ever\u0027Who was Stephanie Adams?

Her father was a struggling department-store buyer. Wildenstein moved to Paris when she was a teenager.During that time she was in a relationship with the filmmaker Sergio Gobbi. Before her marriage to Alec, she was also linked to Saudi arms dealer Adnan Khashoggi and Cyril Piguet.In 1977, at the age of 31, Wildenstein met Alec on a safari trip to Kenya. Alec was there to kill a lion and Wildenstein asked to accompany him. The pair eloped the following year in Las Vegas.It was a tempestuous marriage. The couple reportedly spent $1 million a month on average and went for his-and-hers eye-lifts a year into their marriage. This marked the beginning of a long list of plastic surgeries.‘I would always find out last. She was thinking that she could fix her face like a piece of furniture. Skin does not work that way. But she wouldn’t listen,’ Alec Wildenstein told Vanity Fair.\u0027I don’t think I’ve known her when she wasn’t healing from something,\u0027 said a friend of Jocelyn in 1998. Wildenstein has frequently denied she’s had work done, saying in 1998 that her looks, which led to her being branded ‘Catwoman’, were natural.          In February 2018, the 77-year-old socialite said that she hasn\u0027t had any plastic surgery done‘If I show you pictures of my grandmother,’ she says, ‘what you see is these eyes—cat eyes—and high cheekbones.’ Wildenstein went on to deny she ever had any work done on her nose.After the couple’s children left home, Alec and Wildenstein ended up having ‘constant’ fights.One night, Wildenstein says she walked in on her husband with another woman and alleges he pointed a gun at her and her bodyguards—something Alec disputed, saying Wildenstein was downstairs when he saw the bodyguards.Alec spent the night in jail after the police were called.The pair’s orce was highly public and messy, with Alec slowly cutting Wildenstein’s financial means.Jocelyn Wildenstein before and after plastic surgeryJocelyn Wildenstein reportedly had her first plastic surgery a year after marrying her husband, in 1978. The pair went in for eye-lifts and the surgery was reportedly the first of many.However, in February 2018, Wildenstein and her now second husband, Lloyd Klein both denied she had any work done.\u0027I don\u0027t understand the whole press and the Catwoman thing because Jocelyn always looked like that,\u0027 Klein told DailyMailTV.Jocelyn Wildenstein reportedly had her first plastic surgery, an eye-lift, with Alec in 1978\u0027She never really did anything to change her face. I have pictures from 16 years old where she looks exactly the same as today.\u0027 However, in April 2018, Wildenstein admitted to having surgeries but stopping for a time during her orce from Alec.\u0027In the beginning, it\u0027s why I stopped correcting my appearance because the articles were mean and would repeat the image that my ex-husband tried to paint of me,\u0027 she told Paper Magazine. What is Jocelyn Wildenstein’s net worth?Jocelyn Wildenstein’s net worth is $16,386,100, according to her Chapter 11 bankruptcy documentation.This is a far cry from the $2.5 billion she was awarded during her orce from Alec Wildenstein. The filing lists that the socialite receives a $900 check a month from Social Security, which it says is her only source of income.Jocelyn Wildenstein bankruptcyJocelyn Wildenstein filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in May 2018, reportedly owing 16 creditors over $6 million. This includes hundreds of thousands of dollars to several building contractors, $70,000 to American Express, over $200,000 to two law firms, and $179,000 to Trump world Tower Condominium.Wildenstein also owes a staggering $4.6 million to Castellan Capital and $700,000 to a New York storage company.Dancing With The Stars finale: Date, time, finalists and moreThe French Open 2018: Roland Garros dates, schedule and tickets revealedBachelorette 2018: Chris Harrison reveals premiere will have \u0027most ridiculous fight ever\u0027Who was Stephanie Adams?

Things get done out of frustration then you look back and you know you\u0027ve made a mistake,\u0027 he said. He went on to share his \u0027fondest\u0027 memory of hs estranged half-sibling. \u0027My favourite and fondest memory of Meghan is - well, it was an unfortunate time with my grandmother passing - but in the two years prior to that we would spend every other weekend together, with my grandmother, and it was a very personal time. \u0027She gave selfless attention and cared for my grandmother. It was incredible. Meghan would come into the room and she would light up like a Christmas tree.          Meghan Markle married Prince Harry in an extraordinary ceremony at St George\u0027s Chapel in Windsor on Saturday. Thomas Markle Jr. was not invited \u0027It was a great time because that was the real Meghan. It is the real Meghan. I will never forget it and my father will never forget it. It\u0027s very special,\u0027 he said. He said it was \u0027understandable\u0027 that she threw herself into the role of a lifetime on Suits and, despite previous comments, now doesn\u0027t blame her for it.                              \u0027It\u0027s hard on everybody. Things get done out of frustration then you look back and you know you\u0027ve made a mistake                        \u0027When she went to Toronto, and jumped right into that, it was her biggest role. When you jump into Hollywood like that it demands so much of you it pulls you in every different direction, away from your family and away from contact.\u0027And that\u0027s completely understandable - that\u0027s Hollywood. If you ask any actress or actor they\u0027ll do that first before anything. We still remain close at heart.\u0027If I was in Meghan\u0027s shoes I would get caught up and forget to make that phone call.\u0027We didn\u0027t have a falling out, we always had a great relationship and I\u0027m very proud of her. I was busy in my life too and I\u0027d relocated from LA.\u0027Everyone gets busy. It\u0027s normal in our family,\u0027 he said. Considering himself an expert on the occasion, he predicted that the bride\u0027s dress would be \u0027the nicest dress anyone has ever seen\u0027.   Thomas\u0027s sister Samantha has also launched astonishing attacks on Meghan (seen together right in 2008)          On Saturday, Samantha continued her cashing-in crusade by inviting a TV crew round to her Ocala, Florida, home to watch the wedding \u0027The dress is probably going to be the most stand out, one of a kind wedding dress ever made and she wouldn\u0027t have it any other way. \u0027It\u0027s going to be the nicest dress anyone has ever seen - a proper princess. I don\u0027t think being that it\u0027s her second wedding dress has anything to do with it.\u0027I think this is the one that counts. This is the one that matters,\u0027 he said.  He added that their father, who has had his own share of embarrassment this week after it was revealed he had staged paparazzi photographs and taken money for it, backed out of the wedding at the last minute.           Also not there was the bride\u0027s father Thomas Markle Sr. who embarrassed himself this week by staging paparazzi photographs and taking a sum for it. He suffered a heart attack and said that was the reason he would not attend           Doria Ragland, Meghan\u0027s mother, was the only member of her family who was seen. She beamed with pride throughout her drive to the chapel with her daughter and during the emotional ceremony Thomas Markle Sr. said a recent heart attack, which he suffered days before he was due to walk his daughter down the aisle, kept him from the event.Markle Sr. said his father was happy Prince Charles stood in to accompany Meghan for some of her long walk down St. George\u0027s Chapel. \u0027I think my dad would be sad that he can\u0027t be here but if there was a choice he would be overjoyed Prince Charles is there,\u0027 he said. Markle Jr. added that he was sure Meghan and Harry would be eager to start their own family soon and painted her as a maternal figure who had long doted on his children.           Meghan, 36, is pictured in St George\u0027s Chapel on Saturday during her wedding to Prince Harry. Her half-brother said on Friday that she is \u0027incredible\u0027 \u0027When she was young, dealing with my kids and the way she interacted with them and loved them unconditionally and played with them, it was very obvious she loves children.\u0027She\u0027ll be looking forward to starting her family and that\u0027s a good thing. She\u0027s going to have a great time. \u0027I wish them all the happiness in the world,\u0027 he said.The only member of Meghan\u0027s family who was visibly present at the wedding was her mother, Doria Ragland. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/19/15/4C6E82FA00000578-5747793-image-m-61_1526738688843.jpg","title":"Kate arrives hand hand Meghans adorable flower girls page boys","story":"Dress your little princess in white like Charlotte in Clare Waight Keller for GivenchyClare Waight Keller for Givenchy couture bridesmaid dressUnavailable to buy - click to browse the current collection by the deisgnerPrincess Charlotte always looks adorable, and her cuteness reached a whole new level in this gorgeous little flower girl dress.

Instead this week he was first in Rosarito, Mexico, where he lives and then, he told TMZ, in California recovering from heart surgeryBefore the wedding, Meghan\u0027s half-brother Thomas Jr. sent numerous letters to US magazines pleading with Prince Harry to call the whole thing off. Her half-sister, Samantha, gave similarly scathing attacks in a number of television interviews.Thomas Jr. has spent the week posing for photographs with British newspaper website The Mirror. On Friday, he said he regretted how he had treated Meghan and admitted feeling like an \u0027a**\u0027.Samantha, on the other hand, invited a TV crew round to her home in Ocala, Florida, to watch the televised service.Her partner said she likely received a hefty sum for the stunt. The only member of Meghan\u0027s family who was visible at her wedding was her mother, Doria.           Enough!

I don’t speak good English but I understood what he wanted me to do.

The Duchesse ivory silk-satin creation took royal couturier Sir Norman and his team three months to finishWith a heart-shaped neckline with scalloped edge, the gown was decorated with 10,000 seed pearls, glittering crystals and featured an intricate 13ft star-patterned train. Embroidered with roses, star-shaped flowers and wheat in pearl, crystal and appliques of transparent tulle, its floral design was seen as a symbol of growth and regeneration after the hardships of the Second World War. On the day of the wedding at Westminster Cathedral, the seamstresses who worked tirelessly on the gown were given a prime spot outside Buckingham Palace as a reward.  The Queen, like all British brides in the post-war days, was given 200 extra clothing coupons from the Government towards her wedding trousseau.Women across the UK, keen to ensure Princess Elizabeth would have the dress of her dreams, sent their own coupons to the young royal to help out.But it was illegal to give coupons away and the gifts had to be returned.  However, The Crown gave a good idea of how much the dress might cost to make today as designers for the BBC programme created an identical gown for the wedding scene, which cost £30,000.

So I feel personally invested in this romance!)The large crowd whooped ecstatically with each celebrity sighting and the stars waved with as much faux regalness as they could muster.But as I watched, my mind kept going back to one uneasy question: how can you justify having NONE of your family at your own marriage when you’re filling the church with famous people whom you’ve known for a fraction of the time?It smacked of ruthless and rather distasteful social climbing by a woman who was absolutely delightful when we met in my pub, but whose life has been marked by a worrying tendency to ditch people when they cease to be of use to her. (Her first husband thought they had a happy marriage until the day that Meghan sent his rings back in the post.)          Piers Morgan has given his verdict on the ultimate showbiz weddingMy hackles were raised further when some of the actors strode to the front of the church quire, nestling opposite senior Royals in a clear thespian statement of intent from Ms Markle that screamed: ‘We’re just as big stars as you stuffy lot in tiaras.’They are not, of course. There are no bigger stars than the British Royals, no other human beings who can command 5,000 media people to their weddings, or a billion television viewers.But there’s no doubt Hollywood hijacked this Royal Wedding, both in personnel and in tone, in a carefully co-ordinated operation by an actress putting on the performance of her life, to celebrate the greatest day of her life.Meghan played it safe with her choice of elegant, stylish dress. For her choice of speaker, she played with fire. Literally.The Most Reverend Michael Curry let rip with surely the most memorable Royal Wedding speech ever heard. A sensational tour de force that cited slaves, quoted Dr Martin Luther King, and spoke repeatedly of the raging power of fire and love.At first, I was startled. What the hell was happening here? Then, I was amused. Was he ever going to stop? The cameras cut to a giggling William, Charles and Camilla, to a stern-faced Queen and Philip, and then to a completely baffled Sir Elton John.As Bishop Curry roused himself to ever-higher decibels, I found myself laughing out loud, as were all my family watching with me at home.Eventually, he finished, and my phone rang. It was my 17-year-old son Bertie, who was at school.‘Dad, did you see that?’ he exclaimed excitedly.‘Yes, hilarious wasn’t it…’  US chat show host Oprah Winfrey waved to cameras as she arrived, and Mumford \u0026amp Sons singer Marcus Mumford and actress wife Carey Mulligan arrived together          Sir Elton John, pictured, wore a pair of ominous rose-tinted spectacles at the wedding. Morgan says: \u0027I would think it’s hard to overstate the significance of the ceremony, beamed live around the world, to black people everywhere\u0027‘No! It was incredible!’ he replied. ‘Can you imagine what this must mean to a black American – seeing a black preacher make that kind of speech at a traditionally white British Royal Wedding? This was history happening right before our eyes. I love this wedding!’His youthful passion and excitement shamed my middle-aged cynicism. Bertie was right.Bishop Curry sent us all to church yesterday and reminded us that at its core this wedding was about race too: a biracial woman from America marrying into the world’s most famous white family.When he finally sat down, the cameras panned to the bride’s mother Doria, sitting alone, diamond nose stud glinting, tears rolling from her eyes.It was very obvious just what the speech meant to her.He was followed by a black gospel choir singing a brilliant version of Stand By Me and 19-year-old black musical genius Sheku Kanneh-Mason playing the cello so beautifully.I would think it’s hard to overstate the significance of the ceremony, beamed live around the world, to black people everywhere. To borrow the words of Dr King, this was a day when little black girls could watch TV and genuinely share little white girls’ long-held dreams of one day marrying a Prince.(And yes, before the tiresome radical feminists start raging, I know not all girls want to be princesses, and I know not all girls now identify as girls…)In the end, though, this was like the greatest Oscars ceremony of all time: just one hour long, with tub-thumpingly brilliant off-piste speeches, musical performances to melt the heart, comedy moments to make you cry with laughter, and raw emotion to just make you cry.I loved seeing Prince Philip, 96, march into the church without a stick just weeks after a hip operation. (Perhaps he should send Thomas Markle a guidebook on how to man-up for important family events?)I loved seeing Prince Charles chivalrously take Meghan’s arm halfway down the aisle and focus so intently on his brief but vital job in delivering her safely to his son.And I loved the bridesmaids and pageboys all desperately trying not to behave too badly and succeeding remarkably well.I also loved the fact that, in direct contrast to most awards ceremonies, the biggest winners were two superstars who the public clearly adore.  Actor Idris Elba arrived with his model fiancée Sabrina Dhowre, both wearing navy blue, and James Corden looked sharp alongside his elegant wife Julia CareyMeghan looked radiantly beautiful, supremely confident, and born to play the role of a princess, even if in fact she’s going to be the Duchess of Sussex, the county where I grew up.Harry looked madly in love, endearingly nervous (His ‘I’m ******** it!’ confession to his bride at the altar spoke for every man at every wedding ever) and carrying the weight of the world’s hopes on his shoulders.We all want this charming, sensitive young man to be happy. Not least because we all remember him trudging so sadly behind the coffin of his mother, Diana.Of course, we have no idea if this marriage will last.The recent matrimonial record of Royal couples is inarguably dreadful and palace life remains such a suffocating force for even the brightest of those, like Meghan and Diana before her, who enter its confines.So, we’ll just have to sit back and hope for the best.But what I do know is that their marriage ceremony was the most enjoyable and unpredictable Royal Wedding I’ve ever experienced.It mixed the best of traditional British pomp and majesty with large dollops of Markle Sparkle and the result was a biracial, Hollywood-fused union of very different cultures that worked magnificently well.As my Good Morning Britain co-presenter Susanna Reid, who only last week reaffirmed to me her lifelong phobia of all things marital, tweeted afterwards: ‘I may have just been converted to weddings.’Since I’m a orcee, I prefer not to give advice to newlyweds. But I can proffer one piece of uncontestable wisdom that is very easy to adopt.Meghan apparently insisted on lots of geraniums at her wedding. They’re one of her favourite flowers. By coincidence, my family motto is based on something that a Covent Garden flower seller once said to my grandmother: ‘Life ain’t much, but it’s all ya got, so stick a geranium in yer ’at and be ’appy.’ "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/19/22/4C7384D100000578-0-image-a-4_1526765077031.jpg","title":"Oprah Winfrey arrives royal wedding mystery man Stella McCartney dress overnight","story":"    Who dat?: Oprah Winfrey arrived to the royal wedding without Stedman Graham and instead with a mystery man, entering behind Idris Elba          It\u0027s been real: She and the man did part ways however when Oprah went to find her much better seat in St George\u0027s Chapel      Think pink like Oprah in a Stella McCartney midi dressShop the current line here!Achieving best-dressed guest status is no easy feat when you\u0026#39re attending the most anticipated wedding of the year, but we think Oprah Winfrey might be a strong contender for the title!The talk show host donned a custom Stella McCartney midi dress for Harry and Meghan\u0026#39s big day, topping off her look with a bespoke Philip Treacy concertina lace hat with a feather plume.

These days it is used mainly for entertainingIn fact, their dinner party had more in common with a West End club night than a traditional wedding breakfast, with Harry’s favourite House tracks ‘curated’ by DJ Sam Totolee (who also performed at Pippa Middleton’s wedding), a ‘drinks of the world’ themed bar, and candyfloss and ‘dirty burgers’ as midnight snacks.One source reported a cocktail featuring ginger and rum was put on the menu as a cheeky nod to Harry’s red hair. It was named ‘When Harry Met Meghan’, a play on the film When Harry Met Sally.The party was a notably relaxed, more youthful occasion than the afternoon reception.The intimate guestlist of 200 meant there was no room for mere acquaintances, nor even many minor Royals. Pippa Middleton and Harry’s party-girl ex Chelsy Davy were expected to be absentees.There was something of a carnival atmosphere in the gardens of the 230-year-old stately home, which once belonged to King George III. These days it is used mainly for entertaining.The sit-down dinner was strictly organic, sourced at the request of Prince Charles, and the light-bite canapes were themed ‘spring meets summer’. The meal, paid for by the Prince of Wales, started at 7.30pm and finished at around 10pm.Its three courses were understood to have been peppered with ‘naughty’ speeches from Prince William and a joint effort from Tom Inskip, known as ‘Skippy’ and Tom Van Straubenzee. Any crude nods to Prince Harry’s playboy past were held back until the older guests had departed.Prince Harry took his new wife Meghan Markle out for a spin in a Jaguar that was hailed as \u0027the most beautiful electric car in the world\u0027          The revamped classic car\u0027s number plate read \u0027E190518\u0027 - a tribute to the newlywed\u0027s wedding date.

Another party had been planned in a soundproofed private home in Chelsea.It was quite a contrast with the earlier ‘stand-up’ wedding breakfast in Windsor Castle’s St George’s Hall, which saw 600 guests enjoy ‘bowl food’ and canapes such as Scottish langoustines wrapped in smoked salmon, croquette of confit Windsor Lamb and champagne and pistachio macarons. Harry and his father then gave speeches. Suhani Jalota, the founder of the India-based Myna Mahila charity, said of Harry’s speech: ‘He was talking about his wife. Everybody was clapping because it was the first time he was using that term for Meghan so it was really nice.’She described a speech by the Prince of Wales as ‘lovely’, adding: ‘Essentially it was just about how Harry was as a child and growing up. And about the couple and how beautiful they are together.’Another guest said: ‘Charles nailed it in his speech. He talked about Harry being a baby needing bottles and diapers, then said: “Look how well he turned out.” ’    Guests are also understood to have returned to London late last night for an ‘after-after party’ at celebrity favourite Chiltern Firehouse in Marylebone.

Harry and Meghan had already spoken in their engagement interview of their passion for the Commonwealth and their hopes for engaging with its young people.          Telling aides that they want to ‘hit the ground running’, Harry and Meghan will instead join the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall at his 70th Birthday Patronage Celebration in the gardens of Buckingham Palace on TuesdayIt is hoped the pair will join Charles and Camilla and William and Kate in helping to exercise ‘soft power’ diplomacy.Meghan has already seen a great deal since her engagement to Harry. Within a few months, the couple had visited every country in the United Kingdom and she appeared to take it all in her stride. Displaying characteristic confidence, she would often introduce herself without waiting for Harry to show her the way.Meghan will be 37 on August 4, so it is likely that starting a family will be a priority. It is something they would both like.Three years ago, after I revealed Harry was quitting the Army, I asked the Prince: ‘What are you going to do next?’ ‘You’ll probably know before me,’ he joked. But he soon became reflective, saying that he wanted to use his celebrity for the good of others.We spoke about his plans to focus on his charity work and a desire to spend ‘a significant period abroad’ on field projects in Africa, which he later did. But mostly he was driven to give back, especially to former military colleagues, as well as to continue his mother’s legacy in helping to eradicate AIDS.

The stunning leather interior of the car driven by the Duke of Sussex away from Windsor CastleIt was known in-house as ‘Project Dylan’, a nod to singer-song-writer Bob Dylan’s controversial switch in the mid 1960-s from acoustic to electric guitar when one traditionalist fan shouted ‘Judas.’But converting the classic E-Type means owners can ‘future proof’ their classic cars, says Jaguar. The original engine can even, if required, be swapped back.It can accelerate from rest to 62mph in 5.5 seconds – about a second faster than the original petrol version – with a top speed 150mph. However, with Prince Harry at the wheel he appeared to be taking things much more sensibly.The electric E-Type claims a ‘real world’ range of about 170 miles though that could increase to just over 200 miles. So there was little risk of running out of juice for the short hop between engagements at Windsor.It can be fully charged at home overnight in about six to seven hours with the fuel cap flap opening to reveal the electric charging point.          The Duke and Duchess of Sussex drive off from Windsor Castle in a fully electric version of Jaguar’s legendary E-Type sports car          Prince Harry took his new wife Meghan Markle out for a spin in a Jaguar that was hailed as \u0027the most beautiful electric car in the world\u0027If they had time to to avert their gaze from each other, the road ahead, and the cheering well-wishers, Harry and Meghan may have had time to admire how the original dashboard has been replaced with hi-tech carbon-fibre and the classic instruments given a digital revamp with hi-tech ‘virtual’ dials showing road speed and engine speed.But all other underpinnings, including brakes and suspension are the same, to ensure it still drives like the ‘original’ E-Type.The one-off electric E-Type would cost around £350,000 although Jaguar says prices could drop as more orders are received. But with its new royal connection, this one could now be priceless.Tim Hannig, director, Jaguar Land Rover Classic, said other models could follow: ‘Our aim with E-type Zero is to future-proof classic car ownership.’‘The Jaguar E-type Zero not only drives and looks like an E-type, it also offers outstanding performance. It’s quicker than an original E-type: 0-62mph takes only 5.5 sec, about one second quicker than a Series 1 E-type. But it is authentic to its DNA.’Jaguar said the restored Series 1.5 Roadster is’ totally original apart from its 21st century electric powertrain and modified instrumentation and facia. It also has LED headlights to save energy. The Zero’s lithium-ion battery pack has the same dimensions as the original XK six-cylinder petrol engine and sits in precisely the same place. The 220kW motor lies just behind the battery pack where the original gearbox used to be.          Under the bonnet: Jaguar have replaced the powerful petrol engine with a zero emissions electric motor and plug-in battery          The boot of the stunning Jaguar driven by the Duke of Sussex on Saturday after his weddingOne of Jaguar’s own restored ‘Reborn’ range – with a petrol engine - would be £280,000. Classic E-Types can cost from around £70,000, depending on condition. Back in the 1960s a new E-Type cost just a few thousand pounds.The electric E-Type Zero was one of three battery-powered cars that Jaguar showcased at its special ‘Tech Fest’ event in London last Autumn.Jaguar Land Rover chief executive officer Dr Ralf Speth said: ‘Every new Jaguar Land Rover model line will be electrified from 2020, giving our customers even more choice. We will introduce a portfolio of electrified products across our model range, embracing fully electric, plug-in hybrid and mild hybrid vehicles.’There is already a strong link between the Royal Family and Jaguar Land Rover.In April Prince Charles became the first VIP to be seen in Jaguar’s new I-PACE electric car – on the day that the heir to the throne was confirmed as the Queen’s successor as head of the Commonwealth.He used the all-new electric Jaguar I-PACE for official duties at during the Commonwealth Heads of Government (CHOGM) meetings – having been kept abreast of its hi-tech and environmentally-friendly development towards more ‘green’ electric cars for more than a year.The new I-PACE was unveiled at the Geneva motor in Spring with first customer deliveries begin in June priced from £62,000 to £84,000. The zero-emissions coupe accelerates from rest to 60mph in just 4.5 seconds with a top speed of 298 miles and enough battery charge to drive 300 miles from London to Newcastle on one charge.Jaguar Land Rover his the only car maker to hold three royal warrants: from the Queen, the Duke of Edinburgh and Prince Charles. JLR’s German-born chief executive Dr Ralf Speth has an honorary knighthood, which ca be granted to foreign nations, but recently took up UK citizenship.The Queen is regularly seen and photographed driving Land Rovers around her royal estates and, as Hon Second Subaltern Princess Elizabeth, trained during the war as a truck mechanic with the Territorial Service ‘ATS’.  "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/19/01/4C6A304B00000578-0-image-m-191_1526690224906.jpg","title":"Ocado chief pocket record 110m bonuses","story":"Share this articleSteiner arriving at the High Court in London with lawyer Fiona Shackleton (pictured left) for the settlement hearing in his orce hearing with wife Belinda Steiner (right picture)Ocado has racked up large losses over the years, and reported its first pre-tax profit only in 2015.

He has more than 1,300 crocodiles and alligators and a unique ability to coax them to him by imitating their mating calls. Although his father, a crocodile wrestler, was killed by the creatures, Ross still holds them in some bewildering form of affection.One of the film unit asks Ross how he can tell the difference between the males and the females. He replies: \u0027Oh, that\u0027s easy. The girls have such pretty, petite faces.\u0027Ross has lent his surname to Live And Let Die. Tom Mankiewicz, the scriptwriter, liked the sound of the name Kananga and has called one of our characters Dr Kananga after him.The 007 love scene that drove my wife crazy – and sparked a...Mayfair casino once popular with Princess Margaret, Roger...Share this articleJoining us for the first time in this far-from-jolly location today is Julius Harris who plays Tee Hee, the chilling heavy who has a steel snipping claw on his artificial arm.Today\u0027s scene is where Bond is in captivity and introduced to the crocodiles by Tee Hee, who is casually feeding them chicken with this gadget.Julius and I watch, sweating and waiting on jelly knees as Ross summons the beasts with his special call. As the crocs slither around, my colleague struggles manfully to claw up the chicken and fling it at their snapping jaws.          Today\u0027s scene is where Bond is in captivity and introduced to the crocodiles by Tee Hee, who is casually feeding them chicken with this gadgetOne piece sticks to his hook and a croc seems to have its eye on it, causing Julius to back away somewhat smartly then another piece of chicken falls to his feet unnoticed by us — but not by an 8ft croc, which is torpedoing towards us to get it until someone kicks the grisly lump of meat into the swamp in the nick of time.Rather to our relief, Harry Saltzman, the co-producer, says that tomorrow the main unit, including me, will switch to the bus chase sequence, while the second unit stays to get painstaking shots of the crocs crunching their chicken.B-Day 38. At this stage in the plot, Bond becomes a bus driver. I jump into the driving seat, Jane Seymour — who plays Solitaire — clambers aboard, and we use it to escape from pursuing police. This bus, shipped over from London, is a normal double-decker that has spent the best years of its life on the No 19 run.In preparation for the scene in which it whizzes under a low bridge, the upper deck has been cut away and placed on rollers so that when the crash comes it will shoot spectacularly backwards, leaving Bond and Solitaire in the bottom half.In charge of the bus and here to teach me how to handle it is Maurice Patchett, a London Transport driving instructor who has flown in specially.          Rather to our relief, Harry Saltzman, the co-producer, says that tomorrow the main unit, including me, will switch to the bus chase sequenceB-Day 39. A slow day. It looks as if we might all be stuck here for Christmas — efforts to charter a plane back to Britain for December have hit trouble. I would not be too disturbed by the thought as my family is with me, but there would be a revolt among the film crew who would miss their wives, children and Christmas cheer.B-Day 40. If I never land another film role, I can always get a job on the buses. To qualify as a London bus driver takes ten days\u0027 instruction, and Maurice says that I am doing very nicely indeed.The cab of a London bus is full of gadgets. Maurice is particularly careful to explain the function of a small red flag that drops down in an emergency.\u0027When you see that,\u0027 he warns, \u0027put your foot down on the brake and don\u0027t lift it off again because you don\u0027t get a second chance. It means your brakes have gone.\u0027For the first shot, I have to drive the bus fast for 20ft to where an electrician stands in the road with sun reflector boards to get the proper lighting effect.The boards are striking the sun right into my eyes and, as I take off as fast as I can, it is difficult to see where to stop. I do it four times, each time getting a little faster, so the electricians with the reflector boards are side-stepping more rapidly each time.On the last take, I hit the brake and down comes the red flag I keep my foot down hard and pull on the handbrake. If Maurice hadn\u0027t told me about it, there would have been one electrician as flat as his reflector board, under an AEC Regent London bus.Amazingly, we get the shots we want, and first time. A tremendous end to B-Day 40.B-Day 47. Fire and 1,300 ferocious crocodiles make this a day to remember, and I am lucky to have lost no more than the hair on my hands and arms.We shoot the scene where Bond, encircled by crocodiles, escapes from the island near a shed where the villains\u0027 workers are packing heroin. Bond surrounds it with benzene-soaked rags and rubber, and lays a trail of chicken pieces from the swamp to the shed door.An alligator slithers from the swamp, follows the trail through a gate and inside the shed. We see workers tumbling over each other to get out of the door on the other side, but Bond has lit the rags and ringed the building in flames.To escape from the island, Bond makes a death-defying leap over the crocodile-infested water. I am glad we get this shot in the can quickly because I must confess my \u0027bottle\u0027 is twitching.\u0027Bottle\u0027, for those unfamiliar with rhyming slang, is short for \u0027bottle and glass\u0027, which rhymes with what was twitching.          We are moving back to Britain, where most of the rest of the film will be shot at Pinewood Studios, not far from my homeWhen it comes to the burning building, our special effects have a field day. The shed is circled in a sheet of fire, and before I can dodge back the licking flames have singed all the hair off my hands and arms.However, the whole thing goes beautifully, and our star alligator, Daisy, crawls on cue through the gate and into the hut.Ross has had Daisy since she was eight, and she is now 30. From the moment he saw the Live And Let Die script, Ross trained her to walk up the bank at a certain spot, choosing a nice, shady place she fancied, and fed her there.When Daisy was familiar with her walk, the construction team then moved in and built the hut at the end of it. Daisy is quite a tough lady she is the alligator who killed two crocodiles and duffed up three more, losing half her teeth in the conflict, which upset Ross because she is unlikely to grow any more.Personally, I confess that I am not at all perturbed.B-Day 49. We are moving back to Britain, where most of the rest of the film will be shot at Pinewood Studios, not far from my home.After a lot of transatlantic telephone talking, a DC-10 charter flight for England has been fixed for December 20, and before then we must have a clear day to pack our ten tons of equipment, plus personal belongings and close the offices.It\u0027s hard to believe it\u0027s nearly Christmas. The children are looking forward to going home to the pony and the dog I am looking forward to Sunday papers, English marmalade, frosty mornings and seeing my mother and father.B-Day 58. My big love scene with Jane. Despite the fact that her father-in-law, Richard Attenborough, is one of my best friends, and her husband, Michael, has had dinner at our house, it is still an enjoyable experience, even if she is wearing thick tights and knickers under her flimsy negligee!It reminds me of something Joan Collins said when she visited us for lunch on Sunday with her husband, Ron Kass. Doing a love scene with a leading man she detested, she armed herself with tights and the heaviest pair of football socks that she could find. Jane, cuddling a hot water bottle between takes, complains of the cold, but stoically reminds herself that it is all in a good cause.B-Day 59. I get out of bed, do my work-out, have a shower, shave, brush my teeth, get dressed, eat my breakfast of scrambled eggs, get into the car, drive to the studio, take my clothes off, and get back into bed with Jane Seymour. It\u0027s a hell of a way to earn a living!B-Day 64. We are having dramas with the première date because the Duke of Edinburgh won\u0027t be available, nor will Princess Anne, nor Prince Charles, who is at sea with the Royal Navy. It looks like the date will have to be changed.B-Day 66 and I have spent a romantic weekend in Paris with my wife Luisa after an early wrap on Friday.The weekend isn\u0027t all pleasure, though. Co-producer Harry Saltzman asks me if I will visit the Crazy Horse cabaret, and look the girls over for a likely lass to play a scene in the picture that calls for a busty beauty.Ever devoted to duty, I stoically sit through two hours of striptease, and Luisa kindly comes along, too.I pass my opinion to Harry and tell him that, if really necessary, I will go back and have another look with him.Oh, the burdens of Bond!          We are having dramas with the première date because the Duke of Edinburgh won\u0027t be available, nor will Princess Anne, nor Prince Charles, who is at sea with the Royal NavyBrenda Arnau, who was such a success on the London stage in Oh! Calcutta!, appears in the movie as a club singer performing the Live And Let Die title song.Paul McCARTNEY has written it, and I have lunch today with the man who is arranging it, George Martin. It is a tremendous piece of music, and I will stick my neck out and say that three weeks from its release it will be No. 1.B-Day 75 is the day I bed my third Bond girl: a lovely Italian secret agent played by the voluptuous Madeline Smith. Our pillow appointment is in a bed in Bond\u0027s London mews — in other words an elegantly furnished construction on \u0027B\u0027 stage at Pinewood.First-time visitors to a film studio are always struck by the fact that sets built for interior shots rarely have roofs, so that light can blaze in from above. As a result, Madeline and I are exposed to freezing draughts, and the bed is icy.Props have not provided hot water bottles, no doubt taking the view that anyone in bed with Madeline will find them superfluous. I bound and rebound in and out of bed all morning, my feet freezing with every leap.It would tarnish Bond\u0027s image to wear woolly socks, and I envy Madeline, who, though bare from the waist up, can slide under the bed clothes she squeals every time my cold feet touch her knees.At this point in the story, Miss Moneypenny — the secretary of secret service boss M — has delivered to Bond an intriguing magnetic watch.During the preamble to the encounter in bed, James embraces the signorina, then, holding the watch magnet near the back zip on her dress, draws his wrist down her spine without touching her.The metal zip responds and the dress falls to the floor.\u0027What a gentle touch you have, James,\u0027 she whispers.\u0027Sheer magnetism,\u0027 I reply.It may seem money for jam being pressed close to the beautiful Madeline, but on the 20th take, your arm is aching, you\u0027ve got cramp in your left foot and your right knee is going to sleep.Part of the trouble is that Madeline\u0027s dress just will not fall far enough down. Costume designer Julie Harris has to go on her knees off camera and gently pull the dress down.As the watch isn\u0027t really magnetic, assistant director Derek Cracknell, nicknamed Crackers, is also on his knees with his hands up Madeline\u0027s skirt, pulling a hidden wire attached to the zip — so the floor around our feet is starting to get pretty crowded.When I arrive home, the children ask me, as they always do: \u0027What did you do today, Daddy?\u0027I\u0027m not quite sure what to tell them. I can hardly say: \u0027I was in bed with a lady this morning, and I made 20 attempts to take her dress off this afternoon.\u0027After so many months, it is a depleted crowd that flies back to New York to complete the final scenes — it has even crossed my mind that the producers are trying to get out of paying me by having me bumped off in the car chase scenes on Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive expressway.Be that as it may, I am still not ready for the phone call that comes on the evening of B-Day 84.It is Crackers, saying with qualifying caution learned from years in the picture business: \u0027All being equal, that is, if the rushes are okayed tomorrow afternoon from London, you are finished on the picture.\u0027This is it, then. The party is over. I feel a terrible sense of anti-climax. Numbed, I mix myself a very stiff drink.Luisa and I are leaving for California Bond co-producer Cubby Broccoli and his wife Dana have kindly loaned us their house in Beverly Hills, Hollywood, where I have been asked to present the Oscar for \u0027Best Actor\u0027.Without wishing to sound too partisan, I hope I hand it to my mate, Michael Caine, nominated for his performance in Sleuth.Later, Joan Collins and husband Ron Kass are bringing our children to join us at the Acapulco house of English songwriter Leslie Bricusse and his wife Evie, where I will recuperate from the rigours of Bond.After jetting the bayous in boats, whizzing around in a wingless plane, courting bites by crocodiles, and crashing cars, I will always wryly recall my last line in Live And Let Die. Delivered to the driver on the Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive expressway, it is: \u0027Easy, Charlie, let\u0027s get there in one piece.\u0027Give or take a tooth, I have.Adapted from The 007 Diaries: Filming Live And Let Die by Sir Roger Moore, published by The History Press on June 1 at £14.99. © Roger Moore 2018.

And yet Doria’s loneliness on the bride’s side was brutally obvious.And there was her hand, fluttering, for one uncertain moment, towards Prince Charles. Immediately, his hand reached out towards hers and, in a gesture that seemed to symbolise the joining of two very different families, she held on to it firmly as he gently pulled her into the group.No face in the chapel on Saturday glowed with pleasure as hers did at that moment, even more than when it was turned towards the Most Rev Michael Curry, drinking in his fervent and unexpectedly lengthy message of love.For her, there were tears, too, moments before her daughter entered through the West Door to make her solitary progress halfway down the aisle to the top of the nave. Quickly, Doria controlled her emotions. Not easy for her. Indeed, nothing was easy for her last week.Sore heads? Wills and Kate cover their eyes with sunglasses...George who-ney? Police keep actor and his wife waiting for...Share this articleAs she flew alone to Heathrow on an 11-hour flight from Los Angeles on Wednesday, family discord threatened to overshadow her daughter’s big day. Although, of course, it was her ex-husband’s side of the family and did not directly affect her.Meghan’s personal assistant, Amy Pickerill, was at the airport to greet her and take her to Kensington Palace. After that came 48 dazzling hours when Meghan’s sole family representative had tea with Prince Charles and Camilla at Clarence House and then with the Queen and Prince Philip at Windsor Castle.With Charles and Camilla, she felt comfortable and welcomed. What made it so much easier was that Meghan was there with Harry, with his jokes and easy manner. At least she had met Harry before, at the Invictus Games in Toronto.With the Queen, though, it was not quite so easy as they talked over tea (a blend of Darjeeling and Assam) and fruit cake in the Oak Room, where Her Majesty has tea every day in her private apartment in the castle.  Charles and Doria pictured in St George\u0027s Chapel at the wedding of Harry and Meghan MarkleAlthough the Queen has a lifetime of experience making uneasy guests feel at home, Doria was nervous at first. However, by the time she was saying her goodbyes 40 minutes later, she was much more relaxed.At 61, Doria Ragland had suddenly been elevated into the social stratosphere. But why should we be surprised that she rose so superbly to the occasion? Those who know Meghan’s family have always noted that the actress gets her brains and her fluency from her mother.Doria’s start in life was as the bright, only child of a single mother whose parents were the bell-boy and lift-girl in a hotel in Cleveland, Ohio – a five-star establishment for white guests only. She was in the top academic stream at school but, money being short, didn’t go to university and instead began training as a make-up artist.It was on the set of ABC’s popular TV series General Hospital that she met the show’s lighting director Tom Markle, a orced man with two children, and married him.Meghan was their only child before they in turn orced, though amicably, even continuing to go on holidays together. One can only wonder what her ex-husband, apparently unable to be at the wedding because of a recent operation, felt as he watched Doria on the arm of the Prince of Wales.The truth is that Doria has conducted herself with extraordinary dignity since it emerged that her only daughter was marrying the Queen’s grandson.Never an attention-grabber, her work in Los Angeles as a yoga instructor and social worker, particularly among the elderly, has not allowed the excitement or the sudden spotlight to change anything about the way she goes about her life. Never for her the staged paparazzi pictures her ex-husband so foolishly allowed himself to do. No interviews. No efforts to profit from her daughter’s happiness.           Doria Ragland, Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall walk down the steps of the chapelThat said, her daughter becoming the Duchess of Sussex changes things. Being an in-law to the royal family hasn’t meant too much to the parents of sons or daughters who have married into the Firm.Traditionally, they would be welcomed by the royal family, share the wedding and then summarily be forgotten. For example, the mother of Mark Phillips, Princess Anne’s first husband, complained that she and her husband were ‘virtually ignored and never invited to anything by the palace’.That attitude changed with the arrival of Kate Middleton.Even before she and Prince William married, her parents, Michael and Carole, were regularly extended invitations to royal homes. They have stayed as guests at Balmoral and Sandringham.William has insisted they are included in royal gatherings – they’ve been guests of the Queen at Royal Ascot, participating in the carriage drive down the course.Harry will want to go the same way, and for royal doors to be as open to Meghan’s mum Doria as they are to the Middletons.For now, at least, Meghan’s mother will continue to live 5,500 miles away in LA and go to work as normal, so her participation in royal life is hardly likely to be as frequent as Mike and Carole Middleton.But judging by the way she linked arms with Prince Charles on the steps of the chapel, when those embossed invitations come she’ll certainly be able to handle it."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/20/22/4C6B8C6C00000578-5751241-image-a-43_1526853472685.jpg","title":"So Beckhams Clooneys invited royal wedding","story":"Take style tips from Julia in a dress by Tom FordFind it at Farfetch!Deciding what to wear to a wedding can be tricky at the best of times, but when it\u0026#39s the wedding of the century...

The Royal Wedding hits and misses by LIZ JONESThere were no real clangers on the big day. No outrageous hats from Eugenie and Beatrice. No outrageous bottoms threatening to eclipse the bride. There were only two slight faux pas: Amal Clooney threatened to outshine the sun, and the mother of the bride wore mint while the Queen chose lime: almost, almost a colour clash.On the whole, the female guests – particularly the Royals – had put in time and effort to get it right, and had clearly been poring over the springsummer catwalk photos to make sure they were all bang on trend. Hence, there was lots of asymmetric tailoring on show, so much so many assumed Windsor had been built on a hill. The HITS              Pippa Middleton in a £495 print by British label The Fold.

The length of skirts proved problematical: either a tad too short, a la Eugenie and Joss Stone, or midi length, which looks great on teenage supermodels but a little droopy drawers on normal women.Not too many gloves on show: the Duchess of York, a surprise hit on the day, was a rare fan, with a short navy pair, and the Queen, of course, wore hers.Hats were all proper structures, and not half-baked fascinators. And, thank the Lord, on such a hot day there were plenty of pretty open shoes displaying toe cleavage: not possible if the ceremony had taken place in a cathedral.Heels, though, were as high as the sun in the sky.Rumour has it slippers were handed out later for those who could no longer teeter after yet another glass of champagne             Amal Clooney chose a marigold dress by Stella McCartney with a bow at the back and a train            Singer Joss Stone sported shorter hair and swapped her hippy look for a girly print            Carole Middleton looks very elegant in Princess Diana\u0027s favourite atelier Catherine Walker            Pastel Stella McCartney for Oprah Winfrey, with a Philip Treacy turkey and pheasant feather hat            Countess of Wessex wears ice-blue satin by London couturier Suzannah and hat by Jane Taylor            Meghan\u0027s Suits co-star Gina Torres in a very elegant floral tea dress by Costarellos            Fergie was a picture of elegance on Saturday as she paired a navy skirt suit with a Jess Collet hat and towering heelsThe MISSES            Sofia Wellesley, James Blunt\u0027s wife, is in new season Valentino.

Some even believed the space in front of the Queen was left empty for Princess DianaThen there was the bridal bouquet of forget-me-nots — the Princess’s favourite — that Harry hand-picked from the walled garden at Nottingham Cottage, his home at Kensington Palace.The ring Meghan wore to the evening reception had been a gift to Diana in 1996. After her orce, when she no longer wanted to wear her sapphire engagement ring — now worn by Kate — it sometimes appeared on the third finger of her left hand.Both rings were part of Diana’s small personal jewel collection — there were also aquamarine drop earrings and a charm bracelet bought by Prince Charles. Not much really, for the mother of a future King, and nowhere near the amount of jewellery the Prince has since lavished on the Duchess of Cornwall.All the other major pieces Diana had were returned to the Royal Collection after she died, but Harry and William inherited her privately owned trinkets.Each has used these treasured pieces for the truly significant moments in their lives.\u0027Keep waving, Philip!\u0027: Lip reader reveals the Queen\u0027s...The moment Prince Charles grabbed Doria\u0027s hand, she was one...Share this articleBut perhaps the most indelible element of Diana’s legacy was not in any physical object but in the choice of speaker for the ceremony’s only reading — her sister, Lady Jane Fellowes.Some might think she would not ordinarily have been the most obvious choice. Diana was closer to her eldest sister, Lady Sarah McCorquodale, who often accompanied her on official engagements as a lady-in-waiting.And Jane’s marriage to the Queen’s then private secretary, Sir Robert — now Lord — Fellowes, with whom Diana quarrelled, had created tension between the two women.Harry, however, wanted it to be Aunt Jane. He is close to the Fellowes’s children, Laura, Alexander and Eleanor. As youngsters they lived and played together at Kensington Palace and there were memorable holidays to Necker Island, Sir Richard Branson’s Caribbean hideaway.Visits to Aunt Sarah and her children at their home in Lincolnshire were less frequent.  The ring Meghan wore to the evening reception had been a gift to Diana in 1996. After her orce, when she no longer wanted to wear her sapphire engagement ring — now worn by Kate — it sometimes appeared on the third finger of her left hand.Tellingly, William also asked Jane’s daughter Laura to be godmother to Princess Charlotte.Indeed, these deep links ensure that for both Harry and William, their mother continues to play a huge part in their lives.Only four years separated Diana from Jane, and many listening to her read from the Song of Solomon in St George’s Chapel were mentally transported back to Jane’s powerful contribution at Diana’s funeral.Then, her voice, cracking with emotion, had sounded so like Diana’s.In the intervening years, she has remained the most low-profile of the Spencer family. So low, indeed, that many were surprised she agreed to carry out such a prominent role.She spoke the lines with feeling but you could sense that, unlike the bride, she is a woman used to living a totally private life and who, for the best of reasons, had taken her courage in both hands to do something this public.For her part, it was perhaps a healing act — and with Harry’s overture to her, a similar gesture on his side. We all recall the harsh, long-scarring words of the Spencer sisters’ little brother Charles, Earl Spencer, at Diana’s funeral, when he spoke of Diana’s ‘blood family’ — a phrase interpreted as deeply wounding to the Windsors.In all circumstances, how appropriate it was for Jane and her husband to be sitting in the sovereign stall where the Queen normally sits. And, significantly, the couple were on the steps near Harry and Meghan when they had their first kiss as man and wife.This was proof, surely, that Meghan and the Spencers are going to get to know one another very well in the coming months.Meanwhile, sprinkled among the congregation in some of the most prized seats, were friends of Diana who played key roles in her life.There was Carolyn Bartholomew, with her husband William, in the front of the choir, facing the best man and the Prince of Wales. She is Harry’s godmother and was one of three young women who shared Diana’s Earl’s Court flat and was privy to the secret when she first met Charles.Willie Van Straubenzee, Diana’s tennis partner and confidant, was across the aisle from her friend Julia Samuel and her husband Michael — she is the founder of Child Bereavement UK, a charity with which Meghan and Harry have formed strong links.Diana’s childhood friend, the former Lady Carolyn Herbert — who is married to John Warren, who oversees the Queen’s equine interests — was sitting alongside George Clooney.Poignantly, Harry’s one-time nanny Jessie Webb, whom Diana hired, was seated next to Princess Anne’s son, Peter Phillips.No royal ceremony, it seems, is complete without Sir Elton John, who has been entertaining the Queen’s guests since Prince Andrew’s 21st birthday party in 1981. It was there that Diana, not yet married, first met Elton — the pair danced the Charleston for 20 minutes.  Perhaps the most indelible element of Diana’s legacy was not in any physical object but in the choice of speaker for the ceremony’s only reading — her sister, Lady Jane Fellowes (left). Diana was closer to her eldest sister, Lady Sarah McCorquodale, but Harry chose Jane who they visited regularly as kidsIt was a friendship at first sight, but their relationship was complicated at times.In 1997 they fell out after the pop star used pictures of Diana and the boys, among others of semi-nude models, for a charity fundraising book. They were reconciled at the funeral of the murdered fashion designer Gianni Versace.Six weeks later, Diana was dead.Elton performed at Diana’s funeral and because Harry knew how much his mother had loved Elton’s music, he invited him to attend the wedding — and to perform at the reception.One intriguing element of the day that was noted by many television viewers was the empty seat in front of the Queen and next to Prince William.Could it have been a deliberate and profoundly emotional gesture by Harry, leaving a space for his absent mother?As touching as this sounds, the real reason is more mundane.Remember that St George’s is the Queen’s private chapel and this particular seat is one she doesn’t find comfortable. Nor, under protocol, can anyone sit in front of her.So no one did.For many, however, it served as an emotional symbol of Harry’s deep sadness that his mother could not be there. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/21/00/4C6DE1E800000578-5751563-image-a-5_1526860191218.jpg","title":"Copy blue number worn Meghans best friend Miss Mulroney available online 1 000","story":"    A pop-up collection by Di Carlo Couture went live on the morning of the wedding with the ‘Jessica’ dress – a replica of Miss Mulroney’s form-fitting number, available to purchase for £1,100Her seven-year-old twin boys Brian and John played a key part in the wedding ceremony, carrying the bride’s train.But mother Jessica Mulroney appears to be carving out a starring role of her own.While the 37-year-old Canadian mother-of-three, who is Meghan’s best friend and closest confidante, was circumspect online, the style guru and her outfits were plastered over social media by her associates.The PR consultant and bridal expert, who has been dubbed Toronto’s Gwyneth Paltrow, met Meghan when the actress moved to the city to film US legal drama Suits and the pair bonded over a love of yoga.Over the weekend Instagram addict Miss Mulroney posted just a single photograph on her Instagram account – a picture of her twins holding Meghan’s train as she walked up the steps of St George’s Chapel on Saturday. ‘Proud friend.

Dotted throughout the gardens to entertain the guests were outdoor games, including a giant chessboard, fairground performers and stalls offering late-night snacks – from burger and ice cream vans to candy floss kiosks and bars stocked with several types of expensive whisky.Bespoke cocktails were flowing from a ‘round the world’ bar, whose top offering was the ‘When Harry Met Meghan’, combining rum and ginger beer – a cheeky nod to the colour of the groom’s hair.Musical entertainment came from DJ Sam Totolee, a celebrity favourite who has previously played at the weddings of both Pippa Middleton and Rod Stewart, and Uma Thurman’s engagement party.Harry is said to have danced ‘furiously’ to the DJ’s set – which included the controversial drug-themed hit I Took A Pill In Ibiza – at Pippa’s wedding last May, and had put him under strict instructions to ‘avoid cheese’ and stick to trendy house music and R\u0026ampB.          Harry looked very emotional at points in the service and several others in the congregation were in tears on their happy day         Harry and Meghan exchanged vows and then rings as the couple married after a whirlwind romance               Meghan\u0027s mother Doria Ragland, who the star calls her rock, was in tears ahead of her daughter\u0027s big entrance         Meghan walked halfway through the church before being met Prince Charles at the Quire who took her to Harry         Meghan walks down the aisle in St George\u0027s Chapel at the start of the royal wedding ceremony in Windsor         Meghan, wearing her bridal veil, smiles at her groom Prince Harry as she arrives at the wedding ceremony in Windsor              Meghan smiles broadly during her wedding to Prince Harry at St George\u0027s Chapel in Windsor         The Archbishop of Canterbury smiles as Prince Harry and Meghan Markle stand at the altar at St George\u0027s Chapel         Harry and Meghan hold hands as they walk out of St George\u0027s Chapel after the wedding ceremony       Meghan\u0027s mother Doria Ragland (far left) stands next to Prince Charles, Camilla, George, William, Charlotte and Kate on the steps of St George\u0027s Chapel after the wedding         Prince Harry watches as his father, Prince Charles, accompanies Meghan Markle down the aisle at St George\u0027s Chapel         The train of Meghan\u0027s dress trails down the aisle as she and Prince Harry stand in front of Archbishop Justin WelbyAt one point later in the evening, British actor Idris Elba – who has DJ’d in some of the world’s top clubs – apparently took over for a brief turn on the decks. But that didn’t stop Meghan from making her own musical requests, and she is believed to have been behind the list of Sixties soul songs that were played by covers band Atlantic Soul Orchestra, which calls itself ‘the country’s hardest-hitting and most authentic soul band’. Its musicians have toured and recorded with groups including Take That, Girls Aloud and Sir Elton John.Their set list included My Girl by the Temptations Signed, Sealed, Delivered, I’m Yours by Stevie Wonder Marvin Gaye’s How Sweet It Is and Ain’t No Mountain High Enough Soul Man by Sam and Dave and Knock On Wood by Eddie Floyd.The reception went on into the early hours, with music and cheering heard as far away as Windsor’s Long Walk. Even as the clock struck midnight, guests could be heard singing along enthusiastically to Respect by Aretha Franklin, and Dancing In The Street by Martha and the Vandellas.The newlyweds’ first dance is believed to have followed a similar theme, with Harry and Meghan eschewing a slow song for the 1966 hit Land Of A Thousand Dances by American soul singer Wilson Pickett (not, as has been reported elsewhere, Whitney Houston’s I Wanna Dance With Somebody).The final coaches departed Frogmore House around 3.30am, with insiders reporting that George Clooney was among the last to stagger off the dancefloor, having earlier shown off his moves alongside actor Tom Hardy. Bleary-eyed revellers were offered bacon or sausage sandwiches for the journey home.A select few were then invited to the late-night party which reportedly took place at celebrity haunt Chiltern Firehouse in Marylebone, followed by a private party in a sound-proofed home in Chelsea. It is not known if the bride or groom accompanied them.Yesterday morning, though the newlyweds – who spent the night at Windsor Castle – were nowhere to be seen, several of the guests appeared rather the worse for wear.A weary looking James Corden was seen checking out of Coworth Park with his wife at 8am, while Jessica Mulroney did not emerge from her £600-a-night room before lunchtime. A fresh-faced Serena Williams was one of the few to make it down to breakfast.Rugby player Will Greenwood left with his wife Caroline around 9.40am, followed by Meghan’s Suits co-star Patrick Adams and his children, who left for a flight to LA.Earl Spencer, Harry’s uncle, was spotted at Cliveden House – where the bride stayed the night before the wedding – enjoying Bloody Marys with his family yesterday afternoon. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/21/05/4C6D7D2100000578-5751779-image-a-58_1526878184151.jpg","title":"Newlyweds Harry Meghan return royal duty fairytale wedding","story":"Meghan Markle reportedly didn\u0027t talk to her father, Thomas Markle, on her wedding day.

I prefer to come here to get water rather than waste my time,\u0027 said Raul Sanchez, filling a jug from a tap by a busy road in the arid northwestern city of Punto Fijo because his community has not had running water for 26 days.With the election behind him, Maduro may choose to deepen a purge of critics within the ruling \u0027Chavismo\u0027 movement.He faces a Herculean task to turn around the moribund economy, with the bolivar currency down 99 per cent in the past year and inflation at an annual 14,000 per cent, according to the National Assembly."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/21/09/4C6B70BB00000578-5752413-image-m-23_1526890066091.jpg","title":"Doria Ragland Oprah interview filmed England","story":"Doria Ragland is planning to film an interview with Oprah Winfrey while the pair are in London, it was reported today  Think pink like Oprah in a Stella McCartney midi dressShop the current line here!Achieving best-dressed guest status is no easy feat when you\u0026#39re attending the most anticipated wedding of the year, but we think Oprah Winfrey might be a strong contender for the title!The talk show host donned a custom Stella McCartney midi dress for Harry and Meghan\u0026#39s big day, topping off her look with a bespoke Philip Treacy concertina lace hat with a feather plume.

So, when you are doing embroidery, you need to keep your hands very fresh.‘There were many people involved in the workmanship and, obviously, it took an enormous amount of hours to do it.’The idea to embroider each of the 53 Commonwealth flowers on to the veil was the designer’s idea, after long discussions with Meghan, who wanted to include a tribute to the ‘Family of Nations’ that will be such a central part of her new life, working on behalf of the Queen.‘There was a conversation early on about the story that we were going to tell through this wedding,’ she said. ‘And the fact she and Prince Harry will be working a lot in the Commonwealth was something that could be built on.’It was Meghan, however, who came up with the idea for the simple, but utterly enchanting, little bridesmaids’ outfits.

They have slippers for us. Slippers!\u0027Meghan is also believed to have given her closest friends – none of whom was chosen to be a bridesmaid – bespoke bracelets worth £450 as a mark of their friendship and support on her big day.Once inside the grounds, guests were guided to a giant marquee at the back of the house, bedecked with stunning floral displays by royal florist Philippa Craddock.Liveried waiters circulated, offering guests drinks – English sparkling wine and ice-cold beer – and trays of light canapes, themed in the style of \u0027spring meets summer\u0027. These, and the three-course sit-down dinner, all comprised seasonal organic produce, much of it sourced from Prince Charles\u0027s Duchy Estate.While the canapes and bowl food earlier in the day had been provided by Buckingham Palace, Harry and Meghan used leading society caterers Table Talk for the evening do.          The newlyweds leave Windsor Castle after the royal wedding on their way to the reception at Frogmore House         Princess Eugenie (left), the Duke of York and Princess Beatrice arrive at St George\u0027s Chapel in Windsor Castle yesterday         A car carrying Prince Edward and Sophie, Countess of Wessex arrives at Frogmore House for the reception yesterday       George Clooney, who attended the royal wedding earlier, arrives for the evening party at Frogmore House       Security outside Frogmore House where around 200 guests were expected to attend Harry and Meghan\u0027s wedding reception              Meghan and Harry\u0027s kiss sparked huge cheers from people outside the chapel and the 100,000 watching on the streets of Windsor         The Duke and Duchess of Sussex shared their first kiss as a married couple outside St George\u0027s Chapel          A sea of smiling faces greets Harry and Meghan as they leave the church after the American-influenced service conducted by the Archbishop of Canterbury         Meghan and Harry process out of the chapel after exchanging vows in a quite extraordinary wedding       Harry looked delighted as he walked his new wife out of St George\u0027s Chapel to start their new life together         The couple, who are now the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, organised a wedding that reflected both their backgrounds         Meghan and Harry wave to royal fans during their open-top procession through Windsor after the wedding ceremony         The newlyweds stare deeply into each other\u0027s eyes after the biggest and happiest day of their lives         This extraordinary image shows Meghan clutching her husband\u0027s gloved hand while resting her holding her other hand and bouquet, which was picked by Harry, in the lap of her Givenchy dress         Laughter: One of the well-wishers in the crowds makes Meghan laugh and Prince Harry smile as they continue with their 25-minute tour of the royal market town Insiders say that the meal was punctuated by informal toasts and speeches – most memorably a brief toast by the bride herself, who, in a historic break with tradition, stood up to thank Harry and his family for their kindness and hospitality.In return, Harry gave a gushing, off-the-cuff speech praising Meghan for \u0027navigating everything with such grace\u0027 after a turbulent week. \u0027We make such a great team,\u0027 he said. \u0027I can\u0027t wait to spend the rest of my life with you.\u0027Guests reportedly burst into cheers when he referred to her as his wife for the first time.Prince William is believed to have performed something of a double act with Charlie van Straubenzee, who attended prep school with Harry at Ludgrove in Berkshire.As well as a poignant reminder of how proud their mother would have been of her youngest son on his wedding day, the speech included several family in-jokes.A fourth speech was reportedly given by Charlie\u0027s older brother, Thomas, along with Tom \u0027Skippy\u0027 Inskip, who was under strict instructions from the Palace to downplay Prince Harry\u0027s exploits during a 2012 boys-only trip to Las Vegas – long before Meghan was in the picture.Actor and talk show host James Corden, who attended the reception with his wife Julia, acted as compere, introducing speakers and keeping guests in stitches by gently ribbing Harry for \u0027punching above his weight\u0027. Dotted throughout the gardens to entertain the guests were outdoor games, including a giant chessboard, fairground performers and stalls offering late-night snacks – from burger and ice cream vans to candy floss kiosks and bars stocked with several types of expensive whisky.Bespoke cocktails were flowing from a \u0027round the world\u0027 bar, whose top offering was the \u0027When Harry Met Meghan\u0027, combining rum and ginger beer – a cheeky nod to the colour of the groom\u0027s hair.Musical entertainment came from DJ Sam Totolee, a celebrity favourite who has previously played at the weddings of both Pippa Middleton and Rod Stewart, and Uma Thurman\u0027s engagement party.Harry is said to have danced \u0027furiously\u0027 to the DJ\u0027s set – which included the controversial drug-themed hit I Took A Pill In Ibiza – at Pippa\u0027s wedding last May, and had put him under strict instructions to \u0027avoid cheese\u0027 and stick to trendy house music and R\u0026ampB.          Harry looked very emotional at points in the service and several others in the congregation were in tears on their happy day         Harry and Meghan exchanged vows and then rings as the couple married after a whirlwind romance               Meghan\u0027s mother Doria Ragland, who the star calls her rock, was in tears ahead of her daughter\u0027s big entrance         Meghan walked halfway through the church before being met Prince Charles at the Quire who took her to Harry         Meghan walks down the aisle in St George\u0027s Chapel at the start of the royal wedding ceremony in Windsor         Meghan, wearing her bridal veil, smiles at her groom Prince Harry as she arrives at the wedding ceremony in Windsor              Meghan smiles broadly during her wedding to Prince Harry at St George\u0027s Chapel in Windsor         The Archbishop of Canterbury smiles as Prince Harry and Meghan Markle stand at the altar at St George\u0027s Chapel         Harry and Meghan hold hands as they walk out of St George\u0027s Chapel after the wedding ceremony       Meghan\u0027s mother Doria Ragland (far left) stands next to Prince Charles, Camilla, George, William, Charlotte and Kate on the steps of St George\u0027s Chapel after the wedding         The train of Meghan\u0027s dress trails down the aisle as she and Prince Harry stand in front of Archbishop Justin WelbyAt one point later in the evening, British actor Idris Elba – who has DJ\u0027d in some of the world\u0027s top clubs – apparently took over for a brief turn on the decks. But that didn\u0027t stop Meghan from making her own musical requests, and she is believed to have been behind the list of Sixties soul songs that were played by covers band Atlantic Soul Orchestra, which calls itself \u0027the country\u0027s hardest-hitting and most authentic soul band\u0027. Its musicians have toured and recorded with groups including Take That, Girls Aloud and Sir Elton John.Their set list included My Girl by the Temptations Signed, Sealed, Delivered, I\u0027m Yours by Stevie Wonder Marvin Gaye\u0027s How Sweet It Is and Ain\u0027t No Mountain High Enough Soul Man by Sam and Dave and Knock On Wood by Eddie Floyd.The reception went on into the early hours, with music and cheering heard as far away as Windsor\u0027s Long Walk. Even as the clock struck midnight, guests could be heard singing along enthusiastically to Respect by Aretha Franklin, and Dancing In The Street by Martha and the Vandellas.The newlyweds\u0027 first dance is believed to have followed a similar theme, with Harry and Meghan eschewing a slow song for the 1966 hit Land Of A Thousand Dances by American soul singer Wilson Pickett (not, as has been reported elsewhere, Whitney Houston\u0027s I Wanna Dance With Somebody).The final coaches departed Frogmore House around 3.30am, with insiders reporting that George Clooney was among the last to stagger off the dancefloor, having earlier shown off his moves alongside actor Tom Hardy. Bleary-eyed revellers were offered bacon or sausage sandwiches for the journey home.A select few were then invited to the late-night party which reportedly took place at celebrity haunt Chiltern Firehouse in Marylebone, followed by a private party in a sound-proofed home in Chelsea. It is not known if the bride or groom accompanied them.Yesterday morning, though the newlyweds – who spent the night at Windsor Castle – were nowhere to be seen, several of the guests appeared rather the worse for wear.A weary looking James Corden was seen checking out of Coworth Park with his wife at 8am, while Jessica Mulroney did not emerge from her £600-a-night room before lunchtime. A fresh-faced Serena Williams was one of the few to make it down to breakfast.Rugby player Will Greenwood left with his wife Caroline around 9.40am, followed by Meghan\u0027s Suits co-star Patrick Adams and his children, who left for a flight to LA.Earl Spencer, Harry\u0027s uncle, was spotted at Cliveden House – where the bride stayed the night before the wedding – enjoying Bloody Marys with his family yesterday afternoon. Prince Harry and Meghan Markle¿s fun-filled wedding reception featured a royal dance-off and boozy \u0027beer pong\u0027 gamesGeorge Clooney danced with Meghan then Kate but Fergie turned him down: Exclusive details from party of the year - Mirror Online"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/19/19/4C70FF7900000578-5748651-image-a-9_1526754459426.jpg","title":"Inside Harry Meghans lavish evening wedding reception hosted Prince Charles","story":"Wow them in white like the Duchess of Sussex in a dress by Stella McCartneyShop the current collection here...Meghan Markle\u0026#39s Givenchy gown was everything we imagined it might be and so much more.

And yet Doria’s loneliness on the bride’s side was brutally obvious.And there was her hand, fluttering, for one uncertain moment, towards Prince Charles. Immediately, his hand reached out towards hers and, in a gesture that seemed to symbolise the joining of two very different families, she held on to it firmly as he gently pulled her into the group.No face in the chapel on Saturday glowed with pleasure as hers did at that moment, even more than when it was turned towards the Most Rev Michael Curry, drinking in his fervent and unexpectedly lengthy message of love.For her, there were tears, too, moments before her daughter entered through the West Door to make her solitary progress halfway down the aisle to the top of the nave. Quickly, Doria controlled her emotions. Not easy for her. Indeed, nothing was easy for her last week.Sore heads? Wills and Kate cover their eyes with sunglasses...George who-ney? Police keep actor and his wife waiting for...Share this articleAs she flew alone to Heathrow on an 11-hour flight from Los Angeles on Wednesday, family discord threatened to overshadow her daughter’s big day. Although, of course, it was her ex-husband’s side of the family and did not directly affect her.Meghan’s personal assistant, Amy Pickerill, was at the airport to greet her and take her to Kensington Palace. After that came 48 dazzling hours when Meghan’s sole family representative had tea with Prince Charles and Camilla at Clarence House and then with the Queen and Prince Philip at Windsor Castle.With Charles and Camilla, she felt comfortable and welcomed. What made it so much easier was that Meghan was there with Harry, with his jokes and easy manner. At least she had met Harry before, at the Invictus Games in Toronto.With the Queen, though, it was not quite so easy as they talked over tea (a blend of Darjeeling and Assam) and fruit cake in the Oak Room, where Her Majesty has tea every day in her private apartment in the castle.  Charles and Doria pictured in St George\u0027s Chapel at the wedding of Harry and Meghan MarkleAlthough the Queen has a lifetime of experience making uneasy guests feel at home, Doria was nervous at first. However, by the time she was saying her goodbyes 40 minutes later, she was much more relaxed.At 61, Doria Ragland had suddenly been elevated into the social stratosphere. But why should we be surprised that she rose so superbly to the occasion? Those who know Meghan’s family have always noted that the actress gets her brains and her fluency from her mother.Doria’s start in life was as the bright, only child of a single mother whose parents were the bell-boy and lift-girl in a hotel in Cleveland, Ohio – a five-star establishment for white guests only. She was in the top academic stream at school but, money being short, didn’t go to university and instead began training as a make-up artist.It was on the set of ABC’s popular TV series General Hospital that she met the show’s lighting director Tom Markle, a orced man with two children, and married him.Meghan was their only child before they in turn orced, though amicably, even continuing to go on holidays together. One can only wonder what her ex-husband, apparently unable to be at the wedding because of a recent operation, felt as he watched Doria on the arm of the Prince of Wales.The truth is that Doria has conducted herself with extraordinary dignity since it emerged that her only daughter was marrying the Queen’s grandson.Never an attention-grabber, her work in Los Angeles as a yoga instructor and social worker, particularly among the elderly, has not allowed the excitement or the sudden spotlight to change anything about the way she goes about her life. Never for her the staged paparazzi pictures her ex-husband so foolishly allowed himself to do. No interviews. No efforts to profit from her daughter’s happiness.           Doria Ragland, Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall walk down the steps of the chapelThat said, her daughter becoming the Duchess of Sussex changes things. Being an in-law to the royal family hasn’t meant too much to the parents of sons or daughters who have married into the Firm.Traditionally, they would be welcomed by the royal family, share the wedding and then summarily be forgotten. For example, the mother of Mark Phillips, Princess Anne’s first husband, complained that she and her husband were ‘virtually ignored and never invited to anything by the palace’.That attitude changed with the arrival of Kate Middleton.Even before she and Prince William married, her parents, Michael and Carole, were regularly extended invitations to royal homes. They have stayed as guests at Balmoral and Sandringham.William has insisted they are included in royal gatherings – they’ve been guests of the Queen at Royal Ascot, participating in the carriage drive down the course.Harry will want to go the same way, and for royal doors to be as open to Meghan’s mum Doria as they are to the Middletons.For now, at least, Meghan’s mother will continue to live 5,500 miles away in LA and go to work as normal, so her participation in royal life is hardly likely to be as frequent as Mike and Carole Middleton.But judging by the way she linked arms with Prince Charles on the steps of the chapel, when those embossed invitations come she’ll certainly be able to handle it."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/20/22/4C6B8C6C00000578-5751241-image-a-43_1526853472685.jpg","title":"So Beckhams Clooneys invited royal wedding","story":"Take style tips from Julia in a dress by Tom FordFind it at Farfetch!Deciding what to wear to a wedding can be tricky at the best of times, but when it\u0026#39s the wedding of the century...

The Royal Wedding hits and misses by LIZ JONESThere were no real clangers on the big day. No outrageous hats from Eugenie and Beatrice. No outrageous bottoms threatening to eclipse the bride. There were only two slight faux pas: Amal Clooney threatened to outshine the sun, and the mother of the bride wore mint while the Queen chose lime: almost, almost a colour clash.On the whole, the female guests – particularly the Royals – had put in time and effort to get it right, and had clearly been poring over the springsummer catwalk photos to make sure they were all bang on trend. Hence, there was lots of asymmetric tailoring on show, so much so many assumed Windsor had been built on a hill. The HITS              Pippa Middleton in a £495 print by British label The Fold.

After her orce, when she no longer wanted to wear her sapphire engagement ring — now worn by Kate — it sometimes appeared on the third finger of her left hand.Both rings were part of Diana’s small personal jewel collection — there were also aquamarine drop earrings and a charm bracelet bought by Prince Charles. Not much really, for the mother of a future King, and nowhere near the amount of jewellery the Prince has since lavished on the Duchess of Cornwall.All the other major pieces Diana had were returned to the Royal Collection after she died, but Harry and William inherited her privately owned trinkets.Each has used these treasured pieces for the truly significant moments in their lives.\u0027Keep waving, Philip!\u0027: Lip reader reveals the Queen\u0027s...The moment Prince Charles grabbed Doria\u0027s hand, she was one...Share this articleBut perhaps the most indelible element of Diana’s legacy was not in any physical object but in the choice of speaker for the ceremony’s only reading — her sister, Lady Jane Fellowes.Some might think she would not ordinarily have been the most obvious choice. Diana was closer to her eldest sister, Lady Sarah McCorquodale, who often accompanied her on official engagements as a lady-in-waiting.And Jane’s marriage to the Queen’s then private secretary, Sir Robert — now Lord — Fellowes, with whom Diana quarrelled, had created tension between the two women.Harry, however, wanted it to be Aunt Jane. He is close to the Fellowes’s children, Laura, Alexander and Eleanor. As youngsters they lived and played together at Kensington Palace and there were memorable holidays to Necker Island, Sir Richard Branson’s Caribbean hideaway.Visits to Aunt Sarah and her children at their home in Lincolnshire were less frequent.  The ring Meghan wore to the evening reception had been a gift to Diana in 1996. After her orce, when she no longer wanted to wear her sapphire engagement ring — now worn by Kate — it sometimes appeared on the third finger of her left hand.Tellingly, William also asked Jane’s daughter Laura to be godmother to Princess Charlotte.Indeed, these deep links ensure that for both Harry and William, their mother continues to play a huge part in their lives.Only four years separated Diana from Jane, and many listening to her read from the Song of Solomon in St George’s Chapel were mentally transported back to Jane’s powerful contribution at Diana’s funeral.Then, her voice, cracking with emotion, had sounded so like Diana’s.In the intervening years, she has remained the most low-profile of the Spencer family. So low, indeed, that many were surprised she agreed to carry out such a prominent role.She spoke the lines with feeling but you could sense that, unlike the bride, she is a woman used to living a totally private life and who, for the best of reasons, had taken her courage in both hands to do something this public.For her part, it was perhaps a healing act — and with Harry’s overture to her, a similar gesture on his side. We all recall the harsh, long-scarring words of the Spencer sisters’ little brother Charles, Earl Spencer, at Diana’s funeral, when he spoke of Diana’s ‘blood family’ — a phrase interpreted as deeply wounding to the Windsors.In all circumstances, how appropriate it was for Jane and her husband to be sitting in the sovereign stall where the Queen normally sits. And, significantly, the couple were on the steps near Harry and Meghan when they had their first kiss as man and wife.This was proof, surely, that Meghan and the Spencers are going to get to know one another very well in the coming months.Meanwhile, sprinkled among the congregation in some of the most prized seats, were friends of Diana who played key roles in her life.There was Carolyn Bartholomew, with her husband William, in the front of the choir, facing the best man and the Prince of Wales. She is Harry’s godmother and was one of three young women who shared Diana’s Earl’s Court flat and was privy to the secret when she first met Charles.Willie Van Straubenzee, Diana’s tennis partner and confidant, was across the aisle from her friend Julia Samuel and her husband Michael — she is the founder of Child Bereavement UK, a charity with which Meghan and Harry have formed strong links.Diana’s childhood friend, the former Lady Carolyn Herbert — who is married to John Warren, who oversees the Queen’s equine interests — was sitting alongside George Clooney.Poignantly, Harry’s one-time nanny Jessie Webb, whom Diana hired, was seated next to Princess Anne’s son, Peter Phillips.No royal ceremony, it seems, is complete without Sir Elton John, who has been entertaining the Queen’s guests since Prince Andrew’s 21st birthday party in 1981. It was there that Diana, not yet married, first met Elton — the pair danced the Charleston for 20 minutes.  Perhaps the most indelible element of Diana’s legacy was not in any physical object but in the choice of speaker for the ceremony’s only reading — her sister, Lady Jane Fellowes (left). Diana was closer to her eldest sister, Lady Sarah McCorquodale, but Harry chose Jane who they visited regularly as kidsIt was a friendship at first sight, but their relationship was complicated at times.In 1997 they fell out after the pop star used pictures of Diana and the boys, among others of semi-nude models, for a charity fundraising book. They were reconciled at the funeral of the murdered fashion designer Gianni Versace.Six weeks later, Diana was dead.Elton performed at Diana’s funeral and because Harry knew how much his mother had loved Elton’s music, he invited him to attend the wedding — and to perform at the reception.One intriguing element of the day that was noted by many television viewers was the empty seat in front of the Queen and next to Prince William.Could it have been a deliberate and profoundly emotional gesture by Harry, leaving a space for his absent mother?As touching as this sounds, the real reason is more mundane.Remember that St George’s is the Queen’s private chapel and this particular seat is one she doesn’t find comfortable. Nor, under protocol, can anyone sit in front of her.So no one did.For many, however, it served as an emotional symbol of Harry’s deep sadness that his mother could not be there. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/21/00/4C6DE1E800000578-5751563-image-a-5_1526860191218.jpg","title":"Copy blue number worn Meghans best friend Miss Mulroney available online 1 000","story":"    A pop-up collection by Di Carlo Couture went live on the morning of the wedding with the ‘Jessica’ dress – a replica of Miss Mulroney’s form-fitting number, available to purchase for £1,100Her seven-year-old twin boys Brian and John played a key part in the wedding ceremony, carrying the bride’s train.But mother Jessica Mulroney appears to be carving out a starring role of her own.While the 37-year-old Canadian mother-of-three, who is Meghan’s best friend and closest confidante, was circumspect online, the style guru and her outfits were plastered over social media by her associates.The PR consultant and bridal expert, who has been dubbed Toronto’s Gwyneth Paltrow, met Meghan when the actress moved to the city to film US legal drama Suits and the pair bonded over a love of yoga.Over the weekend Instagram addict Miss Mulroney posted just a single photograph on her Instagram account – a picture of her twins holding Meghan’s train as she walked up the steps of St George’s Chapel on Saturday. ‘Proud friend.

They have slippers for us. Slippers!’Meghan is also believed to have given her closest friends – none of whom was chosen to be a bridesmaid – bespoke bracelets worth £450 as a mark of their friendship and support on her big day.Once inside the grounds, guests were guided to a giant marquee at the back of the house, bedecked with stunning floral displays by royal florist Philippa Craddock.Liveried waiters circulated, offering guests drinks – English sparkling wine and ice-cold beer – and trays of light canapes, themed in the style of ‘spring meets summer’. These, and the three-course sit-down dinner, all comprised seasonal organic produce, much of it sourced from Prince Charles’s Duchy Estate.While the canapes and bowl food earlier in the day had been provided by Buckingham Palace, Harry and Meghan used leading society caterers Table Talk for the evening do.          The newlyweds leave Windsor Castle after the royal wedding on their way to the reception at Frogmore House         Princess Eugenie (left), the Duke of York and Princess Beatrice arrive at St George\u0027s Chapel in Windsor Castle yesterday         A car carrying Prince Edward and Sophie, Countess of Wessex arrives at Frogmore House for the reception yesterday       George Clooney, who attended the royal wedding earlier, arrives for the evening party at Frogmore House       Security outside Frogmore House where around 200 guests were expected to attend Harry and Meghan\u0027s wedding reception              Meghan and Harry\u0027s kiss sparked huge cheers from people outside the chapel and the 100,000 watching on the streets of Windsor         The Duke and Duchess of Sussex shared their first kiss as a married couple outside St George\u0027s Chapel          A sea of smiling faces greets Harry and Meghan as they leave the church after the American-influenced service conducted by the Archbishop of Canterbury         Meghan and Harry process out of the chapel after exchanging vows in a quite extraordinary wedding       Harry looked delighted as he walked his new wife out of St George\u0027s Chapel to start their new life together         The couple, who are now the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, organised a wedding that reflected both their backgrounds         Meghan and Harry wave to royal fans during their open-top procession through Windsor after the wedding ceremony         The newlyweds stare deeply into each other\u0027s eyes after the biggest and happiest day of their lives         This extraordinary image shows Meghan clutching her husband\u0027s gloved hand while resting her holding her other hand and bouquet, which was picked by Harry, in the lap of her Givenchy dress         Laughter: One of the well-wishers in the crowds makes Meghan laugh and Prince Harry smile as they continue with their 25-minute tour of the royal market town Insiders say that the meal was punctuated by informal toasts and speeches – most memorably a brief toast by the bride herself, who, in a historic break with tradition, stood up to thank Harry and his family for their kindness and hospitality.In return, Harry gave a gushing, off-the-cuff speech praising Meghan for ‘navigating everything with such grace’ after a turbulent week. ‘We make such a great team,’ he said. ‘I can’t wait to spend the rest of my life with you.’Guests reportedly burst into cheers when he referred to her as his wife for the first time.Prince William is believed to have performed something of a double act with Charlie van Straubenzee, who attended prep school with Harry at Ludgrove in Berkshire.As well as a poignant reminder of how proud their mother would have been of her youngest son on his wedding day, the speech included several family in-jokes.A fourth speech was reportedly given by Charlie’s older brother, Thomas, along with Tom ‘Skippy’ Inskip, who was under strict instructions from the Palace to downplay Prince Harry’s exploits during a 2012 boys-only trip to Las Vegas – long before Meghan was in the picture.Actor and talk show host James Corden, who attended the reception with his wife Julia, acted as compere, introducing speakers and keeping guests in stitches by gently ribbing Harry for ‘punching above his weight’. Dotted throughout the gardens to entertain the guests were outdoor games, including a giant chessboard, fairground performers and stalls offering late-night snacks – from burger and ice cream vans to candy floss kiosks and bars stocked with several types of expensive whisky.Bespoke cocktails were flowing from a ‘round the world’ bar, whose top offering was the ‘When Harry Met Meghan’, combining rum and ginger beer – a cheeky nod to the colour of the groom’s hair.Musical entertainment came from DJ Sam Totolee, a celebrity favourite who has previously played at the weddings of both Pippa Middleton and Rod Stewart, and Uma Thurman’s engagement party.Harry is said to have danced ‘furiously’ to the DJ’s set – which included the controversial drug-themed hit I Took A Pill In Ibiza – at Pippa’s wedding last May, and had put him under strict instructions to ‘avoid cheese’ and stick to trendy house music and R\u0026ampB.          Harry looked very emotional at points in the service and several others in the congregation were in tears on their happy day         Harry and Meghan exchanged vows and then rings as the couple married after a whirlwind romance               Meghan\u0027s mother Doria Ragland, who the star calls her rock, was in tears ahead of her daughter\u0027s big entrance         Meghan walked halfway through the church before being met Prince Charles at the Quire who took her to Harry         Meghan walks down the aisle in St George\u0027s Chapel at the start of the royal wedding ceremony in Windsor         Meghan, wearing her bridal veil, smiles at her groom Prince Harry as she arrives at the wedding ceremony in Windsor              Meghan smiles broadly during her wedding to Prince Harry at St George\u0027s Chapel in Windsor         The Archbishop of Canterbury smiles as Prince Harry and Meghan Markle stand at the altar at St George\u0027s Chapel         Harry and Meghan hold hands as they walk out of St George\u0027s Chapel after the wedding ceremony       Meghan\u0027s mother Doria Ragland (far left) stands next to Prince Charles, Camilla, George, William, Charlotte and Kate on the steps of St George\u0027s Chapel after the wedding         Prince Harry watches as his father, Prince Charles, accompanies Meghan Markle down the aisle at St George\u0027s Chapel         The train of Meghan\u0027s dress trails down the aisle as she and Prince Harry stand in front of Archbishop Justin WelbyAt one point later in the evening, British actor Idris Elba – who has DJ’d in some of the world’s top clubs – apparently took over for a brief turn on the decks. But that didn’t stop Meghan from making her own musical requests, and she is believed to have been behind the list of Sixties soul songs that were played by covers band Atlantic Soul Orchestra, which calls itself ‘the country’s hardest-hitting and most authentic soul band’. Its musicians have toured and recorded with groups including Take That, Girls Aloud and Sir Elton John.Their set list included My Girl by the Temptations Signed, Sealed, Delivered, I’m Yours by Stevie Wonder Marvin Gaye’s How Sweet It Is and Ain’t No Mountain High Enough Soul Man by Sam and Dave and Knock On Wood by Eddie Floyd.The reception went on into the early hours, with music and cheering heard as far away as Windsor’s Long Walk. Even as the clock struck midnight, guests could be heard singing along enthusiastically to Respect by Aretha Franklin, and Dancing In The Street by Martha and the Vandellas.The newlyweds’ first dance is believed to have followed a similar theme, with Harry and Meghan eschewing a slow song for the 1966 hit Land Of A Thousand Dances by American soul singer Wilson Pickett (not, as has been reported elsewhere, Whitney Houston’s I Wanna Dance With Somebody).The final coaches departed Frogmore House around 3.30am, with insiders reporting that George Clooney was among the last to stagger off the dancefloor, having earlier shown off his moves alongside actor Tom Hardy. Bleary-eyed revellers were offered bacon or sausage sandwiches for the journey home.A select few were then invited to the late-night party which reportedly took place at celebrity haunt Chiltern Firehouse in Marylebone, followed by a private party in a sound-proofed home in Chelsea. It is not known if the bride or groom accompanied them.Yesterday morning, though the newlyweds – who spent the night at Windsor Castle – were nowhere to be seen, several of the guests appeared rather the worse for wear.A weary looking James Corden was seen checking out of Coworth Park with his wife at 8am, while Jessica Mulroney did not emerge from her £600-a-night room before lunchtime. A fresh-faced Serena Williams was one of the few to make it down to breakfast.Rugby player Will Greenwood left with his wife Caroline around 9.40am, followed by Meghan’s Suits co-star Patrick Adams and his children, who left for a flight to LA.Earl Spencer, Harry’s uncle, was spotted at Cliveden House – where the bride stayed the night before the wedding – enjoying Bloody Marys with his family yesterday afternoon. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/21/05/4C6D7D2100000578-5751779-image-a-58_1526878184151.jpg","title":"Newlyweds Harry Meghan return royal duty fairytale wedding","story":"Meghan Markle reportedly didn\u0027t talk to her father, Thomas Markle, on her wedding day.

Venezuela\u0027s election board, run by Maduro loyalists, said he took 5.8 million votes, versus 1.8 million for his closest challenger Henri Falcon, a former governor  \u0027The process undoubtedly lacks legitimacy and as such we do not recognize it,\u0027 said Falcon, a 56-year-old former state governor, looking downcast.Maduro had welcomed Falcon\u0027s candidacy, which gave some legitimacy to a process critics at home and around the world had condemned in advance as the \u0027coronation\u0027 of a dictator.Falcon\u0027s quick rejection of Sunday\u0027s election, and call for a new vote, was therefore a blow to the government\u0027s strategy.Falcon, a former member of the Socialist Party who went over to the opposition in 2010, said he was outraged at the government\u0027s placing of nearly 13,000 pro-government stands called \u0027red spots\u0027 close to polling stations nationwide.Mainly poor Venezuelans were asked to scan state-issued \u0027fatherland cards\u0027 at red tents after voting in hope of receiving a \u0027prize\u0027 promised by Maduro, which opponents said was akin to vote-buying.Labour\u0027s shadow chancellor John McDonnell says he wants to...Share this articleThe \u0027fatherland cards\u0027 are required to receive benefits including food boxes and money transfers.A third presidential candidate, evangelical pastor Javier Bertucci, followed Falcon in slamming irregularities during Sunday\u0027s vote and calling for a new election.Despite his unpopularity over a national economic meltdown, Maduro benefited on Sunday not just from the opposition boycott but also from a ban on his two most popular rivals and the liberal use of state resources in his campaign.His tally, however, fell short of the 10 million votes he had said throughout the campaign he wanted to win.   Falcon (center, in white), a former member of the Socialist Party who went over to the opposition in 2010, said he was outraged at the government\u0027s placing of nearly 13,000 pro-government stands called \u0027red spots\u0027 close to polling stations nationwide           Supporters of the opposition react during the announcement of the electoral results in Caracas, Venezuela          Supporters of the opposition are seen hugging and crying after the announcement was made on Sunday  Maduro, the self-described \u0027son\u0027 of Chavez, says he is battling an \u0027imperialist\u0027 plot to crush socialism and take over Venezuela\u0027s oil. Opponents say he has destroyed a once-wealthy economy and ruthlessly crushed dissent.Attendance appeared thin in many polling stations visited by Reuters reporters, from wealthy east Caracas to the Andean mountains near Colombia. There were lines, however, at poorer government strongholds, where the majority of voters interviewed said they were backing Maduro.\u0027I\u0027m hungry and don\u0027t have a job, but I\u0027m sticking to Maduro,\u0027 said Carlos Rincones, 49, in the once-thriving industrial city of Valencia, accusing right-wing business owners of purposefully hiding food and hiking prices.Many Venezuelans are disillusioned and angry over the election: they criticize Maduro for economic hardships and the opposition for its dysfunctional splits.Reeling from a fifth year of recession, falling oil production and U.S. sanctions, Venezuela is seeing growing levels of malnutrition and hyperinflation, and mass emigration.Venezuelan migrants staged small anti-Maduro protests in cities from Madrid to Miami.   Turnout at the election was just 46.1 per cent, the election board said, way down from the 80 per cent registered at the last presidential vote in 2013   Voters line up at a polling station during the presidential election in Barquisimeto, Venezuela, on Sunday In the highland city of San Cristobal near Colombia, three cloth dolls representing widely loathed officials - Electoral Council head Tibisay Lucena, Socialist Party No. 2 Diosdado Cabello and Vice President Tareck El Aissami - were hung from a footbridge.But streets were calm, with children playing soccer on one road in San Cristobal blocked off at past elections to accommodate long voter lines. For many Venezuelans, Sunday was a day to look for scant food or stock up on water, which is increasingly running short because of years of underinvestment.\u0027I\u0027m not voting - what\u0027s the point if we already know the result? I prefer to come here to get water rather than waste my time,\u0027 said Raul Sanchez, filling a jug from a tap by a busy road in the arid northwestern city of Punto Fijo because his community has not had running water for 26 days.With the election behind him, Maduro may choose to deepen a purge of critics within the ruling \u0027Chavismo\u0027 movement.He faces a Herculean task to turn around the moribund economy, with the bolivar currency down 99 per cent in the past year and inflation at an annual 14,000 per cent, according to the National Assembly."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/21/07/4C7D1BD800000578-5752281-image-a-2_1526884334419.jpg","title":"Cheeky guests caught trying flog Royal Wedding gift bag eBay 400","story":"    Guests invited by Meghan and Harry to see them marry are already cashing in by selling their gift bags on eBay for £400 or more          Dozens of the so-called Community Champions started auctioning these free gifts off to the highest bidder.Many had clearly planned to do it and photographed the items outside St George\u0027s Chapel.    MailOnline has found at least 25 listings ranging from between £25 and £420. So why WERE the Beckhams and Clooneys (not to mention Chloe...Why did George and Charlotte suddenly go missing?

So, when you are doing embroidery, you need to keep your hands very fresh.‘There were many people involved in the workmanship and, obviously, it took an enormous amount of hours to do it.’The idea to embroider each of the 53 Commonwealth flowers on to the veil was the designer’s idea, after long discussions with Meghan, who wanted to include a tribute to the ‘Family of Nations’ that will be such a central part of her new life, working on behalf of the Queen.‘There was a conversation early on about the story that we were going to tell through this wedding,’ she said. ‘And the fact she and Prince Harry will be working a lot in the Commonwealth was something that could be built on.’It was Meghan, however, who came up with the idea for the simple, but utterly enchanting, little bridesmaids’ outfits.

Dotted throughout the gardens to entertain the guests were outdoor games, including a giant chessboard, fairground performers and stalls offering late-night snacks – from burger and ice cream vans to candy floss kiosks and bars stocked with several types of expensive whisky.Bespoke cocktails were flowing from a \u0027round the world\u0027 bar, whose top offering was the \u0027When Harry Met Meghan\u0027, combining rum and ginger beer – a cheeky nod to the colour of the groom\u0027s hair.Musical entertainment came from DJ Sam Totolee, a celebrity favourite who has previously played at the weddings of both Pippa Middleton and Rod Stewart, and Uma Thurman\u0027s engagement party.Harry is said to have danced \u0027furiously\u0027 to the DJ\u0027s set – which included the controversial drug-themed hit I Took A Pill In Ibiza – at Pippa\u0027s wedding last May, and had put him under strict instructions to \u0027avoid cheese\u0027 and stick to trendy house music and R\u0026ampB.          Harry looked very emotional at points in the service and several others in the congregation were in tears on their happy day         Harry and Meghan exchanged vows and then rings as the couple married after a whirlwind romance               Meghan\u0027s mother Doria Ragland, who the star calls her rock, was in tears ahead of her daughter\u0027s big entrance         Meghan walked halfway through the church before being met Prince Charles at the Quire who took her to Harry         Meghan walks down the aisle in St George\u0027s Chapel at the start of the royal wedding ceremony in Windsor         Meghan, wearing her bridal veil, smiles at her groom Prince Harry as she arrives at the wedding ceremony in Windsor              Meghan smiles broadly during her wedding to Prince Harry at St George\u0027s Chapel in Windsor         The Archbishop of Canterbury smiles as Prince Harry and Meghan Markle stand at the altar at St George\u0027s Chapel         Harry and Meghan hold hands as they walk out of St George\u0027s Chapel after the wedding ceremony       Meghan\u0027s mother Doria Ragland (far left) stands next to Prince Charles, Camilla, George, William, Charlotte and Kate on the steps of St George\u0027s Chapel after the wedding         The train of Meghan\u0027s dress trails down the aisle as she and Prince Harry stand in front of Archbishop Justin WelbyAt one point later in the evening, British actor Idris Elba – who has DJ\u0027d in some of the world\u0027s top clubs – apparently took over for a brief turn on the decks. But that didn\u0027t stop Meghan from making her own musical requests, and she is believed to have been behind the list of Sixties soul songs that were played by covers band Atlantic Soul Orchestra, which calls itself \u0027the country\u0027s hardest-hitting and most authentic soul band\u0027. Its musicians have toured and recorded with groups including Take That, Girls Aloud and Sir Elton John.Their set list included My Girl by the Temptations Signed, Sealed, Delivered, I\u0027m Yours by Stevie Wonder Marvin Gaye\u0027s How Sweet It Is and Ain\u0027t No Mountain High Enough Soul Man by Sam and Dave and Knock On Wood by Eddie Floyd.The reception went on into the early hours, with music and cheering heard as far away as Windsor\u0027s Long Walk. Even as the clock struck midnight, guests could be heard singing along enthusiastically to Respect by Aretha Franklin, and Dancing In The Street by Martha and the Vandellas.The newlyweds\u0027 first dance is believed to have followed a similar theme, with Harry and Meghan eschewing a slow song for the 1966 hit Land Of A Thousand Dances by American soul singer Wilson Pickett (not, as has been reported elsewhere, Whitney Houston\u0027s I Wanna Dance With Somebody).The final coaches departed Frogmore House around 3.30am, with insiders reporting that George Clooney was among the last to stagger off the dancefloor, having earlier shown off his moves alongside actor Tom Hardy. Bleary-eyed revellers were offered bacon or sausage sandwiches for the journey home.A select few were then invited to the late-night party which reportedly took place at celebrity haunt Chiltern Firehouse in Marylebone, followed by a private party in a sound-proofed home in Chelsea. It is not known if the bride or groom accompanied them.Yesterday morning, though the newlyweds – who spent the night at Windsor Castle – were nowhere to be seen, several of the guests appeared rather the worse for wear.A weary looking James Corden was seen checking out of Coworth Park with his wife at 8am, while Jessica Mulroney did not emerge from her £600-a-night room before lunchtime. A fresh-faced Serena Williams was one of the few to make it down to breakfast.Rugby player Will Greenwood left with his wife Caroline around 9.40am, followed by Meghan\u0027s Suits co-star Patrick Adams and his children, who left for a flight to LA.Earl Spencer, Harry\u0027s uncle, was spotted at Cliveden House – where the bride stayed the night before the wedding – enjoying Bloody Marys with his family yesterday afternoon. Prince Harry and Meghan Markle¿s fun-filled wedding reception featured a royal dance-off and boozy \u0027beer pong\u0027 gamesGeorge Clooney danced with Meghan then Kate but Fergie turned him down: Exclusive details from party of the year - Mirror Online"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c2d107c9b89295a4b721e60f67450f98ab932642/0_0_5184_3456/master/5184.jpg?w=1010\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=394100cbd8ac0aa023a6656e8328ff85 1010w","title":"mfon women photographers of the african diaspora in pictures","story":"The MFON journal and book is committed to establishing and representing a collective voice of female photographers of African descent and features more than 100 from across the diaspora.

It has already closed 20, affecting about 900 jobs, but staff are braced for the axe to fall on another tranche of stores before the announcement of its annual results on Wednesday.The closures are part of a plan announced 18 months ago to slash the amount of shopfloor space devoted to its ailing clothing ranges. Initially, just 30 out of a group of 105 underperforming stores were to shut but Rowe has decided on a more aggressive closure plan as sales move online.After several years of disappointing financial results, the restructuring at M\u0026ampS has entered a more radical phase since Archie Norman was installed as chairman. There have been a number of casualties in the boardroom including Andy Adcock, the boss of its upmarket food halls, who has been replaced, and marketing chief Patrick Bousquet-Chavanne.When the company updated investors six months ago, Norman was frank about the scale of its problems. M\u0026ampS had been “drifting” for more than 15 years, he said, as he promised to speed up store changes and tackle its misfiring food business.Rowe has been in charge for two years but, with no green shoots to celebrate and a backdrop of weak consumer spending, M\u0026ampS’s share price has fallen by nearly a quarter over the past year. The decline means the 134-year-old retailer’s place in the prestigious FTSE 100 could now be in jeopardy. M\u0026ampS has been a member of the blue chip index since its inception in 1984 but could be relegated to the FTSE 250 in a stock exchange reshuffle this week. Relegation would be a symbolic moment for the British institution that has struggled to hang on to shoppers in a digital age.Ocado, the online grocer, and Asos, the fashion website, are now worth more than M\u0026ampS in market value terms in a sign of the sea change in shopping habits. Ocado surged past M\u0026ampS on Thursday after it struck a major deal with US supermarket chain Kroger.Rowe will flag price cuts this week in the food and clothing aisles as M\u0026ampS attempts to fight back against the growth of value chains such as Primark, Aldi and Lidl. He will also announce investment in the warehousing needed to support the growth of its website.Shore Capital analyst Clive Black predicted an improving trend in clothing sales but felt that the food business had fared less well. “It’s the perpetual conundrum of M\u0026ampS,” he said. “Can it get the stars aligned and both businesses growing at the same time? Not yet.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/afbc0053e8755e0e36c28f510c44764f7af5d382/0_289_4426_2656/master/4426.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5375e199647dc70407c784e534ed0336","title":"new starbucks policy allows nonpaying guests use restrooms","story":"Move comes after company was accused of bias when two black men were arrested for sitting without ordering anything Starbucks has told its employees to allow all guests to use store facilities, including restrooms, regardless of their spending.The move comes a month after the coffee giant found itself accused of discriminatory practices, after a store manager in Philadelphia called the police  on two black men who asked to use the bathroom without purchasing anything and then refused to leave. The new policy was announced on Saturday in a company-wide letter that stated: “Any person who enters our spaces, including patios, cafes and restrooms, regardless of whether they make a purchase, is considered a customer.”Previously, Starbucks employees had been free to exercise judgment about nonpaying guests. The company said the new policy would apply to its more than 8,000 company-operated US cafes. It would issue different guidelines for its international stores, it said.The Philadelphia store involved in the 12 April incident had signs informing visitors that the bathrooms were for paying customers only. After the police were called on Rashon Nelson and Donte Robinson, the men were arrested and spent hours in jail.They were not charged and later reached settlements that included a nominal financial sum and “a commitment to continued listening and dialogue between the parties as a means toward developing specific actions and opportunities”. “I want to thank Donte and Rashon for their willingness to reconcile,” said Starbucks chief executive Kevin Johnson, announcing the settlement. “Starbucks will continue to take actions that stem from this incident to repair and reaffirm our values and vision for the kind of company we want to be.” The chain plans to close its company-operated stores next Sunday afternoon, to give employees anti-bias training. In 2015, Starbucks initiated a program to encourage employees to discuss race with customers. The directive was quickly dropped. Under the new policy, customers will be able to stay in stores unless they’re “behaving in a disruptive manner”. The company has yet to offer guidelines on what constitutes disruptive behaviour or what procedures managers and baristas should follow. Starbucks employees should call 911 if a situation presents an immediate danger or threat to employee or customer safety, the company said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5ea50c8c415b15830edfc1c997ff9e03b339cb03/0_300_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b48d9859e3865634d4cc989c228c7943","title":"ryanair hand luggage airline strikes profits michael oleary","story":"The Ryanair chief executive, Michael O’Leary, has said the airline may have to review its new luggage policy if large numbers of passengers continue to hand over their bags at the gate.Ryanair has introduced a stricter cabin bag policy, which means customers have to pay £5 for priority boarding to avoid having their main cabin bag checked in to the hold at the departure gate. This has improved boarding and punctuality, the airline said, but O’Leary added that “it is creating a handling issue, especially at peak periods” such as bank holiday weekends and during the summer.“There are many flights where we’re now having to put 100 or 120 gate bags free of charge into the hold,” O’Leary said in a video presentation. “If that continues to build, it’s something we may have to look at again.”However, O’Leary warned of a fall in profits this year, saying the outlook was “on the pessimistic side of cautious”. He said there could be strikes in some countries over Ryanair’s discussions to recognise trade unions, but the airline would face any action down.O’Leary said air fares were likely to be flat over the coming year, as it takes about 12 months for changes in fuel prices to feed through to fares. He added that he believed airlines that had not hedged oil prices, such as Norwegian, would struggle next winter and that this would “accelerate the shakeout” in the industry, with some carriers going bust.Ryanair averted widespread Christmas strikes by unilaterally recognising unions in December for the first time in its 32-year history, but it has struggled to formalise relations in some countries. “Being unionised means we will have occasional strikes,” O’Leary said.Ryanair repeated its warnings about the risk of a hard Brexit, and said it would scrap voting rights for non-EU shareholders if there was no transition agreement."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bb107c33c4ddb41859e889c403c4e6e671132a79/0_218_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b22cf6cac0b5c437eddc85477ce077d8","title":"bishop michael curry sermon history harry meghan wedding","story":"The candle flames were trembling. The pulpit was on fire. The bride and groom were waiting. As were the Queen, Oprah, Idris Elba, and Doria Ragland, now the world’s most famous yoga teacher. Just before he got on to the subject of fire, Bishop Michael Curry, the first African-American leader of the US Episcopal church, promised the happy couple, “and with this I’ll sit down, we got to get y’all married”. But there’s a lot to say about the French Jesuit Pierre Teilhard de Chardin and his relevance to modern technology and the concept of love and how this relates to Martin Luther King, so he went on for another three minutes.Curry’s sermon was one of three moments during the royal wedding when I felt moved. I had not expected to be moved. I had expected to remain full of cold indignation at the pomp and aristocratic indulgence of the day, at the preparatory shooing of the homeless off the streets of Windsor by police officers who should be tending to more important things like knife crime, at the £32m shamelessly spent amid the rising presence of foodbanks and child poverty. The first of these moments was Ragland arriving at the chapel, a black woman quietly alone, being assisted from her car by a representative of an institution that had partaken in her oppression and was now required to respect her. The other was the Kingdom Choir’s beautiful rendition of Stand By Me, in part because it followed the sermon.Reading from his iPad, gesticulating, swinging his robes, smiling, rocking back and forth on his feet, Curry was in complete contrast to the solemn and stationary ecclesiastical address that preceded his. Where there was stillness, now there was movement. For 14 minutes he preached in the full-throated, uninhibited, theatrical and emotive style of the traditional African-American church. He preached of Moses and Jesus of Nazareth, the Hebrew scriptures and the “old slaves in America’s antebellum South” who recognised in their singing of spirituals, “even in the midst of their captivity”, that there is “a balm in Gilead to make the wounded whole”. Quoting from Martin Luther King to begin and end the speech, this was not something ever witnessed within the lofty walls of the pinnacle of the Anglican establishment at a royal wedding. This was a speech that could have been lifted straight out of the pages of James Baldwin or ZZ Packer.An ardent campaigner for social justice, particularly on immigration and same-sex marriage, Chicago-born Curry, himself a descendent of slaves, did not tone down his passionate message of the social and political power of love in order to align with the reserve of his pale and stately onlookers. He did not filter. He did it black, with music in his arms, and rhythm in his voice, and a looseness and openness in his face that supposed an almost familial acquaintance with his audience.In his world, words do not travel alone from the mouth, with just their letters and their grammar for company. Here the body comes too, giving life to the words, lifting them into the air to float and dance into comprehension and human feeling. For Zara Tindall, captured open-mouthed in her pricey, shiny teal in the pews, it was something to behold.The expressions on the faces of the congregation around the church were also something to behold, ranging from empathy to bemusement to confusion to downright scorn. Four minutes in, Camilla Parker Bowles’s ludicrous hat was trembling as she held down her head: was she laughing? Prince Charles was also bowed, red around the ears, more so than usual: was he?There was half a smirk at the Duchess of Cambridge’s mouth, and, when Curry exclaimed: “Oh that’s the balm in Gilead!”, throwing up his hands in emphasis, the Queen straightened in her chair, purse-lipped. Meanwhile, Oprah swayed. Ragland looked steadily on, a little sadly, as if aware of something of which others were not, yet also with an innate sweetness while her daughter sat holding hands with her prince, occasionally conferring in love-soaked whispers.It was a sermon that will go down in history as a moment when the enduring seat of colonialism was brought before the Lord, and questioned in its own house. In the mention of slavery was the inherent accusation of white silver-spoon complicity, and that this union should not go forth without acknowledging it.“Love is the way,” Curry chanted, in a rolling, conversational repetition borne of the deep south. “When love is the way, we actually treat each other, well” – he put his hand on his hip and his elbow on the lectern – “like we are actually a family.” A utopia for our time indeed, delivered with a grand humility apparently wasted on some of its listeners, who were not quite expecting such blackness from a black bride."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4e5f972c2f51ce67f593c36689177c495d430120/0_156_3649_2189/master/3649.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=65c2e94754a5a5e30cefd62a01fe47e3","title":"spirit britain royal wedding brexit","story":"The rest of the world is baffled by Britain – and understandably so. In the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics, directed by Danny Boyle, we dramatised a confidence, openness and multiplicity that only a nation at ease with itself could muster. The global “soft power” of our language, cultural and scientific institutions, and international development programmes – still ringfenced by the Treasury – remains formidable. And on Saturday, hundreds of millions around the world watched the royal wedding: as glorious a fusion of pageantry and pluralism, of monarchy and modernity, as you could hope for.Yet this spirit of generous self-assurance has its evil twin. We are also the country of Brexit of Nigel Farage of Jacob Rees-Mogg posing outside No 10 to deliver a petition demanding cuts to the aid budget and, most recently and shamefully, of the Windrush scandal.Which is the authentic Britain? Open or closed? Warm or frostily parochial? Both, I suppose. Most countries are, to use a word much-loved by Nick Clegg, “bicephalous”: two-headed and contradictory. The question we should ask in 2018 is: which of the two heads dominates?On my travels in the past year, I have encountered understandable confusion about our national trajectory. To crunch a complex series of perceptions into a seriously oversimplified narrative, the view from beyond our shores runs as follows: Britain was in terrible shape in 1979. Margaret Thatcher’s shock therapy, painful for a great many, laid the foundations of renewed national prosperity. Labour’s election in 1997 marked a determination to match economic growth with social justice and liberalism.According to this happy version of events, the 2012 Olympics represented the culmination of more than three decades of regenerative work: a global festival in which Britain declared itself to be both open for business and open in spirit. Into which narrative, the rusty ner of Brexit was thrown with clanking ferocity four years later. Suddenly, Britain was declaring its furious hostility to “mass immigration”, to its putative imprisonment as a “vassal state”, to the supposed\u0026nbspmutilation of its island heritage. Optimism had yielded to fear. We were, to quote Nigel Farage’s vile poster, at\u0026nbsp“breaking point”. You can forgive the rest of the world its perplexity. When, exactly, did Britain decide angry nativism was the way forward?This global confusion about who we are and what we want has profoundly practical consequences. Ask any senior diplomat or chief executive and they will tell you the same thing: namely, that technical detail forms the structure of any deal, alliance or treaty, but that the much more nebulous question of culture, shared ideals and emotional identity determines the foundation. Trade agreements and investment decisions are not decided by algorithm alone. Each side must ask: what sort of partner am I aligning myself with? Will my employees be heading towards an outstretched hand or a “hostile environment”?If I had to single out the principal cause of our national identity crisis, I would cite the catastrophic absence of leadership on immigration policy. The issue has maddened us, unnecessarily and tragically. It has drained much of our national confidence, made us mean, bred an uncharitable insularity.In their words, deeds and tactical silences, politicians of both main parties have allowed a series of myths to enter and settle into mainstream discourse: that migrants depress wages and take jobs from indigenous citizens that migrants are a drain on the taxpayer that only the “metropolitan elite” benefits from migrant labour that migrants are more likely to commit crimes. All this is rubbish, and deserves to be robustly and repeatedly dismissed as such – not left to fester in the national consciousness. I also believe immigration is culturally enriching. But then I have skin in the game (the surname is a clue). So let us concentrate on economic necessity.A familiar refrain of pro-Brexit MPs is that their constituents were somehow “not consulted” on recent immigration. To which the only answer should be: oh yes they were. They were consulted when they voted repeatedly for an NHS that has the capacity to treat them – an objective that would be unthinkable without migrant labour.They made a decision in favour of immigration when they opted for low-price consumer goods, for rapid delivery services, for facilities and shops that are open around the clock. They chose. We all did. It is outrageous hypocrisy to pretend otherwise.In cabinet, I am told, even the arch-Brexiteers declare that national prosperity should not be sacrificed to the achievement of arbitrarily low net migration targets. Well, thanks a lot. Now they spot the flaw in the plan.To be fair to the Brexit secretary, David Davis, he has repeatedly conceded that immigration policy post-Brexit will require many exemptions to meet the needs of the labour market. And as for all those shiny trade deals we are promised after 29 March 2019: the immigration minister, Caroline Nokes, told a Commons committee in February that visas could “absolutely” be exchanged for commercial access in future negotiations.Brexit encapsulates this cognitive dissonance and its damaging consequences: it is about much more than our institutional relationship with the EU. I long for political leaders with the courage and candour to declare that the great challenges facing this country – automation, fiscal fairness, entrenched poverty, human longevity – have nothing to do with immigration, race or the much-needed influx of newcomers. That it has taken a royal wedding to reinstate this straightforward truth should shame our drab political class."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1b611449a1227eaaa4ece9443d720da9fc692a42/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=65d64f8414a898b311368b432428b008","title":"big tech products silicon valley","story":"It’s years since Silicon Valley gave us a game-changer. Instead, from curing disease to colonies on Mars, we’re fed overblown promisesBack in 1999, Google hit 1bn searches a year. Wifi began to make an impact about two years later. Thanks to the pioneers of Facebook and Twitter, the age of mass social media dawned between 2004 and 2006 – and non-stop posting, messaging and following was soon enabled by the iPhone, launched in 2007. These things have changed the world and, in hindsight, the way they became ubiquitous had a powerful sense of inevitability. But the revolution they represented is old now, and nothing comparable has come along for more than a decade.Despite this, a regular ritual of hype and hysteria is now built into the news cycle. Every now and again, at some huge auditorium, a senior staff member at one of the big firms based in northern California – ordinarily a man – will take the stage dressed in box-fresh casualwear, and inform the gathered multitudes of some hitherto unimagined leap forward, supposedly destined to transform millions of lives. (There will be whoops and gasps in response, and a splurge of media coverage – before, in the wider world, a palpable feeling of anticlimax sets in.)It happened again a fortnight ago, when the Google chief executive, Sundar Pichai, addressed his company’s annual developers’ conference. Among his other tasks, he was there to rhapsodise about developments in artificial intelligence, and the ever-evolving application known as Google Assistant (created, he said, to “help you get things done”), and a new innovation called Duplex. “It turns out that a big part of getting things done is making a phone call,” he said. He then mentioned getting an appointment for a haircut: “You know, we’re working hard to get users through those moments.”The screens behind him lit up, and the sound system played a synthesised female voice, whose words were punctuated with authentic-sounding umms and aahs. The voice conversed with a human being at the other end of a phone line, who apparently had no idea she was talking to a machine, and the software seemed to quickly and seamlessly secure a 10am appointment. Pockets of the crowd went into raptures. “That was a real call you just heard,” said Pichai. “The amazing thing is, our Assistant can actually understand the nuances of conversation.”Now, when was the last time you came to book a haircut or restaurant table and concluded that the task was so onerous that you would ideally delegate it to a machine? And even if you can easily think of a scenario, would there not be something ethically questionable about doing so, if the person at the other end had no idea who or what they were talking to? In fact, might Duplex be a grim portal into a future in which high-flyers get digital “assistants” to do their chores, while poorly paid people have to meekly talk to computers, in constant fear that they are about to be automated into joblessness?Pichai also announced the introduction of a new feature of Gmail called Smart Compose: a kind of supercharged predictive text that offers you extended phrases as you type, which then build up into whole sentences. (To quote one report, the software will “tailor its predictions to each inidual user, based … on information that Google already knows about you”.) Pichai showed an email exchange in which Smart Compose understood that the matter at hand was “Taco Tuesday”, and suggested “chips, salsa, and guacamole”. Hearing more whoops of delight from the audience, I thought about a vision of the near future in which half the human race will converse in preordained cliches.The endless noise emanating from Silicon Valley essentially has two complementary elements. One is all about dreams so unlikely that they beggar belief: the idea that the Tesla CEO Elon Musk will one day set up a colony on Mars or that Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg can successfully marshal an attempt to “cure, prevent and manage” all diseases in a single generation. Whatever its basis in fact, this stuff casts people and corporations as godlike visionaries, and then provides a puffed-up context for the stuff the big tech companies shout about week in, week out: stuff we either don’t need or, worse, which threatens some of the basic aspects of everyday\u0026nbspcivilisation.Our phones are full of apps that gather digital dust, and the same fate has befallen many supposedly groundbreaking inventions. Though the idea of internet-enabled spectacles has potentially fascinating uses in such fields as autism, education and high-end manufacturing, Google Glass was never going to be a mass-market product in the way its inventors thought.Yet some people fall in love with these things. Among the great mountain of writing at the heart of the current so-called “techlash” is a great book entitled Radical Technologies, by the former tech insider Adam Greenfield. When he writes about people obsessed with the kind of internet-enabled devices that monitor sleep, heart rates and exercise levels, he nails something that applies to a whole array of allegedly cutting-edge innovations. “A not-insignificant percentage of the population has so decisively internalised the values of the market for their labour,” he writes, “that the act of resculpting themselves to better meet its needs feels like authentic expression.” What he says echoes a key passage in Guy Debord’s visionary text The Society of the Spectacle, published 50 years ago: “Just when the mass of commodities slides toward puerility, the puerile itself becomes a special commodity this is epitomised by the gadget … The only use which remains here is the fundamental use of submission.”Such ornate words speak an enduring truth. Amazing and sometimes life-enhancing innovations, I dare say, are being worked on by tech geniuses across the world. In fields such as driverless transport, virtual reality and blockchain technology, new inventions may eventually transform our lives, and fulfil the cliched big-tech promise about making the world a better place. But that is the not the nature of our current phase of history, nor the absurd and often dangerous creations we are now being offered on an almost monthly basis.Ignore all those whoops. If we do not want to live in a world in which “assistants” trick us into flimsy conversations, and human contact is a chore left to the bottom of the labour market, we do not have to. There is a basic fact about the future the figureheads of big tech too often forget: that what it will look like is actually up to us, not them."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8a4ce699c45a66da51b5bc10b5d46c4519fa869d/0_0_4724_2834/master/4724.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2f2e9d0a4673cdd23f33cdbbf7173683","title":"detoxifying social media online misogyny","story":"It’s great that Matt Hancock and Sajid Javid have said they will regulate the internet, but what could they actually do? The culture secretary said that when he called in representatives of 14 leading internet companies to discuss his ideas, only four turned up.The government said it will introduce new laws to tackle “the full range of online harm”. This must mean dealing not just with serious crime, but with the harm produced every day by social media, such as abuse, bullying, racism and misogyny, with little or no protection for children. These things either aren’t quite crimes, or aren’t serious enough for the police to chase – and there are precious few concrete ideas for how to reduce them.Social networks have few incentives to stamp them out – after all, a proliferation of controversial or aggressive comments helps drive their growth, regardless of the human impact.The UK has struggled to find a way to regulate away the poisonous byproducts of social media. There’s much talk of treating platforms as publishers, but there’s been little follow-through as to how this would work to prevent harm.Instead, politicians fret over whether the baffling technology can be regulated at all where regulation stops and censorship starts and how effective rules could ever be for multinational companies anyway. Silicon valley tech bros even muse whether regulators are smart enough to keep up with them.This is, in part, a symptom of the government’s decade-long love affair with tech. As we have rushed headlong into the arms of the big tech companies, we haven’t kept sight of the need for regulatory tools to balance shareholder and societal interests.For all the hand-wringing about the newfangled nature of this technology, there are important clues from our past on how to effectively regulate the tech giants. Parliament actually has a good track record for creating enduring tools to tackle corporate harms.Back in the 1950s, the law to protect people from physical harm on other people’s property was a confusing mess, the result of decades of complex case law. The brilliant former Nuremberg prosecutor David Maxwell Fyfe, by then a Conservative lord chancellor, legislated to create a “duty of care” on people or companies that control land or property to make it as safe as reasonably possible for people on or in it.In the 1970s, a similar tool was used to reform the byzantine and ineffective health and safety rules that had been built on a century of specific laws introduced in response to specific accidents and tragedies. In 1974, the then employment minister Michael Foot took the Health and Safety at Work etc Act through parliament, creating a duty of care on employers towards their employees.Both pieces of legislation, with their emphasis on putting the onus on companies to prevent reasonably foreseeable harms, remain in force today, and Britain now has the safest workplaces in Europe.Statutory duties of care work because they define a general problem to be solved, without getting caught up in the specifics of how it happened. This cuts through the complexity of case law to focus on either harm or safety.Instead of looking backwards, trying to avoid the replication of the types of incidents that inspired lawmakers in the past, the law becomes forward-looking. Harm or safety becomes the thing the company or person on whom the duty sits has to avoid or achieve as far as is reasonably possible.Focusing on the end point gives companies flexibility to tackle the problem without daily interference from government. The all-encompassing nature of a duty of care also makes it future-proof – it doesn’t matter what fancy new tech thing you come up with, it has to be safe or avoid doing harm.A duty of care could be the way to clean up the daily bile on social media. We’ve already seen that technology companies respond when the law changes or starts to be properly enforced. For example, the European commission has the big tech companies working in concert to remove extremist material, and tough new laws on sex trafficking in the US have led to the closure of several sex-work websites.Working with professor of internet law Lorna Woods, we’ve proposed legislation to create a duty of care on the largest social media companies to their users, backed up by a regulator that is funded from a fraction of the government’s forthcoming internet revenue tax.MPs should set out a list of key harms they want to see tackled in law, for instance misogynistic abuse, or safeguarding children. Then it will come down to the regulator and ultimately the courts to decide how well the companies do at reducing these harms. The regulator would have a range of enforcement powers including enforcement notices, fines and powers of direction.We would exclude services that already have detailed industry rules from regulation – such as the traditional media – and services with fewer than 1 million UK users. This would create a duty of care for platforms such as Facebook, but it would also maintain freedom of speech by leaving unregulated a huge range of smaller platforms.As is currently the case with the environment, health and safety, and data regulation, companies would have to design (or redesign) their services to reduce harm. We think these rules could be delivered quickly, in a short, simple bill that could fit into the crowded Brexit legislation.Social media can be a huge force for good, but it’s becoming ever-more imperative that we reduce its harmful effects. It needn’t be as complicated as everyone thinks.• William Perrin, a trustee of several charities working for a healthier digital environment, is a former senior civil servant who worked on regulatory policy"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3f5be77eb8940b3ddc5835ac692accda65b9b82b/0_0_4080_2448/master/4080.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=691f03f31546567bf548579ef059a63e","title":"jeremy corbyn values brexit detail labour ambiguous","story":"The Labour leader’s position on leaving the EU remains ambiguous. Maybe he just doesn’t care that muchAmbiguity on Brexit has spawned many Jeremy Corbyns, and they all lie in the eye of the beholder, depending on political allegiances, frustrations and hopes. There is the cunning Corbyn: secretly a hard Brexiter but who doesn’t want to alienate remainers. There is the craven Corbyn: pro-remain but too afraid of Brexit populism to be too open about it. There is also another pro-remain version: coy Corbyn, playing a game of political subterfuge, winking at remain Labour voters and waiting for the government to be completely worn down before he swoops in with a campaign for a second referendum. Then there is calm Corbyn: above all else, a democrat and a respecter of the will of the people, so he will grit his teeth and think of England.It is likely that none of these Corbyns exist. He has sent signals that can be interpreted in any of these ways. He has been a strong supporter of withdrawal from the single market, but still won’t come completely off the fence on the matter. He consistently denies interest in a second referendum but also indulges speculation, saying late last year that he would vote remain in a second round. When confronted, he won’t rule a second referendum out.Why all the uncertainty? Perhaps the more straightforward explanation is that Corbyn simply doesn’t care about Brexit enough to engage with it robustly one way or the other.But “indifferent Corbyn” fits no one’s narrative. He cannot be smeared by Blairites as a parochial anti-trade ideologue leading his naive young remain supporters down the Brexit path he cannot be lauded by the party faithful as a wise man with a plan, and he cannot be painted by the right as an open-borders-loving softie.Even his most consistent positions are not necessarily a smoking gun. Voting for article 50, sacking a shadow cabinet minister who called for another referendum, and urging MPs to abstain from votes that make the government’s life harder need not indicate covert support for Brexit. They may be attempts at asphyxiating a combustible issue, one which could be used against him by Brexit-supporting opponents.Sure, Corbyn is interested in Brexit, but only insofar as it is a tool with which to club Theresa May and the Tories. Like last week, where at prime minister’s questions he nailed her on the weakness of her negotiating hand given the isions within her own party.But he doesn’t always show up. In fact, he has received repeated criticism for failing to challenge May in parliament. And his on-off enthusiasm over Brexit exposes the things Corbyn really does care about: austerity, rampant capitalism and inequality. As a frontbench Labour MP told me, Brexit is quite far down his list of priorities. His view of challenging the government does not involve spending lots of time bogged down in technical detail about the Irish border.And that’s fine. Indifferent Corbyn is not necessarily a bad thing – the reason he became popular in the first place is because he had not been swallowed up by the dulling obligations of technocracy, nor did he have the detached tone of other Labour figures who lost the pulse of the party’s voters. These same figures, incensed by Brexit, still do little but scold leave voters for their ignorance and agitate for a second referendum – despite the fact that there’s little polling to suggest there is a popular appetite for one.Even if they are right about the impossible technicalities of leaving the EU, the “it’s all above your head” argument isn’t really a vote winner. There’s a reason it didn’t cut through first time round. Corbyn’s strength remains in his ability to focus on issues such as job security (job losses due to businesses relocating over Brexit uncertainty was his focus in last week’s clash with\u0026nbspMay). Brexit fatigue also works for him. In this month’s English local elections there was a distinct “bins over Brexit” vibe.But Corbyn’s changeability and inconsistent engagement on Brexit also plays into what could be seen as his greatest weakness: that he is only a flagship values politician, valuable on the back benches but not interested in the mundane daily grind of government. Corbyn is NHS, austerity, nationalisation, social housing. He is Stop The War and nuclear disarmament. As far back as the referendum campaign, Corbyn’s listlessness over Brexit fed the impression that he was lukewarm and not leadership material.I sympathise with indifferent Corbyn. Brexit came out of the blue, within a year of his election as party leader. It hijacked a space that could have been utilised for returning Labour to its socialist roots and mounting a credible challenge against the Tories, which was all he ever wanted. After all these years in the wilderness he finally had a clean shot, and Brexit got in the way. But now it’s here, he has a chance to burnish his leadership credentials, be forensic, adopt a firm stance (be it hard or soft Brexit) and prove he can do detail as well as drama."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/646862c53997537d13a7009da31c80fede44f4d1/2_299_3465_2079/master/3465.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cc32407ec4642b916181f7480f8186ba","title":"drax power station to lead fresh carbon capture trial","story":"Biomass-burning unit to use pioneering technology that aims to cut emissionsDrax Group will lead a £400,000 trial to capture and store carbon at its north Yorkshire power station in an attempt to kickstart a technology that has repeatedly failed to get off the ground in the UK.The company was part of earlier efforts to build a £1bn prototype carbon capture coal plant, but pulled out in 2015 after it missed out on renewable energy subsidies. Now the firm will try again with a pioneering form of the technology, bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS), to cut emissions from one of its four biomass-burning units.

When Campion broke through and was recognised as an auteur by her male peers – with the Palme d’Or and three Oscars in her handbag – feminists assumed that more women artists would follow in her wake. They were wrong.There was no great bursting of the financial and cultural dam that held back women film-makers. Instead their work filtered through in drips, excluded from directing blockbusters, and excluded from competition at Cannes and other festivals. “I think we got caught in a complicated supplicancy, a very sophisticated supplicancy,” says Campion.But now, a quarter of a century later, Campion feels that time is up for supplicancy as the #MeToo movement reverberates in the film industry and beyond. “Right now, we’re in a really special moment. I’m so excited about it. It’s like the Berlin wall coming down, like the end of apartheid. I think we have lived in one of the more ferocious patriarchal periods of our time, the 80s, 90s and noughties. Capitalism is such a macho force. I felt run over.”Dipping croissants into coffee in Soho on a trip from her home in New Zealand to London, Campion seems the last person anyone would dare to run over, with her iron will, silver hair and ready laugh. But even after The Piano’s success, Campion’s journey was never easy, and her insistence on a stubbornly female gaze in her work did not translate into big box office returns.She made The Portrait of a Lady (1996) with Nicole Kidman, Holy Smoke (1999) with Kate Winslet, and In the Cut (2003), with Meg Ryan no longer playing the bubbly creature of romcoms but instead handcuffing a detective and having sex with him. That film is experiencing a renaissance back then it was too much for the mainstream male critics. As Campion recently noted: “There’s this sort of mountain of corduroy you have to get through.”So after In the Cut she took a break to look after her daughter Alice Englert, and reappeared in 2009 with Bright Star, the poet Keats’s story from the point of view of his lover Fanny Brawne. It was not until the massive success of the two television series of Top of the Lake (2013 and 2017) that the world caught up with Campion’s point of view again.In 2017, Cannes premiered Top of the Lake: China Girl to acclaim. It was also the 70th anniversary of the festival and Campion joined all the male Palme d’Or-winners on stage. She was the lone woman. “I hadn’t ever really thought about the numbers of women and men that had won the Palme d’Or. I still really hadn’t taken it in. That was the most shocking thing I’d ever been involved in. If there had been no women it wouldn’t be an issue, but man after man came up. I thought, ‘Oh my God! What is going on?’”Money, was the answer. The female talent is there, but the financial backing is missing in film, less so now in television. “I guess at this age I expect to make Top of the Lake as I want it, without any concern for other people’s opinions and taste. I just do what I want, and weirdly people love it.”Many of the themes of Top of the Lake were hatched in The Piano. Wilderness madness colonial and immigrant stories, from the Maori community of New Zealand to Asian immigrants in Sydney and above all, strange, bolshy women unbowed by life’s struggles.“Rewatching my films is like digging up buried bones,” says Campion, who is 64. Yet when she saw The Piano again recently (she laughs that she could only find a French dubbed version, but at least the heroine played by Holly Hunter is mute), “I really felt excited by it. I thought, my God, this is a film told from a female point of view and nowadays that’s still so rare. Even when a story appears to be from a female point of view, it’s often an apology for it.”The Piano is now a classic, unforgettable, with its powerful, surreal imagery, soul-scarring amputation scene, silent heroine, and above all, the erotic electricity played out note by note between Harvey Keitel and Hunter, seated at the carved rosewood piano in a hut deep in the bush.Each watching of the 1850s drama reveals more riches. There is the mute but emotionally devastating performance by Hunter as Ada McGrath, a Scotswoman sent like baggage with her piano to New Zealand to marry a man she has never met. Hunter and Anna Paquin – who plays her young daughter – both won Academy awards, as did Campion’s screenplay. The musical score from Michael Nyman often takes the place of dialogue and the cinematography from Stuart Dryburgh shifts from the epic to the intimate. In writing and directing, Campion set herself a series of challenges: a wordless protagonist, a hostile landscape, a colonial conundrum and then allowed the film to burst out of its own carefully constructed corset.The image of a piano stranded with a woman and child on a volcanic beach beneath glowering cliffs epitomised Ada’s predicament in an isolated Maori and British community in the bush. But the necessary interior nature of Ada’s world, only allowed an outlet through music, sign language and facial expressions revealing contempt or wilfulness, subverts the male-controlled world. Sam Neill plays her husband Alisdair Stewart, who is silently outmanoeuvred by Ada, until his frustration turns to violence.Eventually, the axe falls, but until then, “Ada was experiencing things for herself in her own body and she could close the patriarchy out,” says Campion. “It was really strong for me to see that, and also the intimacy, sexuality and sensuality from a more female point of view.” Surprisingly for the time, when Keitel’s Baines is eventually given permission by Ada to freely make love to her, his first move is to kneel down and disappear beneath her crinoline, favouring her pleasure over his own.The power is also shown to be literally in Ada’s hands she strokes her husband’s naked buttocks with the caresses she also lavishes on the piano keys, but refuses to allow him to touch her in return. Stewart is humiliated. As Campion notes, “This is a very sexual story, and to see him overwhelmed and unable to control what’s happening … that’s quite sexy.”Campion’s taste for wild passion in the wilderness was partly inculcated by the Brontës when she was growing up in Wellington, New Zealand, the daughter of theatrical parents. “I always loved Emily Brontë’s imagination. I feel like she saved my life, in the sense of giving me powerful female stories. To have that model for how a woman and an artist could be was very involving to me.”Speaking of Wuthering Heights, Campion noted Catherine’s strength. “She was not pliant. She was firm of mind and conviction.” For the director, Heathcliff “was a dark metaphor for sexual drive, and Emily had a sexual drive, obviously, and she rode it like a horse.” Campion roars with laughter. “My psyche understood that at a time when it wasn’t being much explored in literature and film.”Sealing these moments on screen, often more with pictures than words, is one of Campion’s great skills. “The most powerful experiences we have as humans are a combination of psyche, love and erotica, which can really lock you in an extraordinarily powerful way to experiences beyond what you know and beyond what you can control,” says Campion. “If you look back at those moments, they are often powerful awakenings, way beyond your comfort zone. There’s a sort of calling against decorum, against what’s best.”She has always championed the unconventional, from her first feature Sweetie (1989), a punkish and ultimately devastating family drama about two sisters, one of whom is mentally troubled. Her second film, An Angel at my Table (1990), was a three-hour television biography of writer Janet Frame, which was so cinematic that it was given a theatrical release.Campion was also fearless about tackling a film with a large cast of Maori actors, and while a few of The Piano’s scenes border on embarrassing in retrospect, she made the effort to find a Maori film director and advisers to work with her. “I had an easier time because I had been out of the country for a long time, so I was desensitised to this feeling that a white person couldn’t have a Maori character. I thought that was crazy when there was a chance for different roles.” There were complexities: some of the Maori actors did not speak their native language. “They felt shame about it, but they learned it. What they really found offensive was the pidgin English we had written, so we changed that and the problem went away. They wanted to work with me – they don’t like people charging in and creating ‘blackgrounds’.”While The Piano has become a landmark of Antipodean cinema, it was in fact financed by a French company, encouraged to take a punt on Campion by the Cannes film scout Pierre Rissient, who died earlier this month just before this interview. “I’m a little bit subdued today because of Pierre,” says Campion. “He brought all my films to Cannes.” Rissient discovered her film Peel, which won best short in 1986.Thanks to Rissient’s championing, The Piano was made and edited while Campion was pregnant with her first child by her husband Colin Englert (second unit director on the film). She flew out to Cannes in May 1993 to the premiere, but she was unable to stay until the end of the festival to pick up her Palme d’Or.“I had to fly back before I couldn’t fly. I was there for the screening but it wasn’t really a good time because my blood pressure was shooting up, with interviews and managing the pregnancy. So I was back in Sydney and I heard that we’d won, which was amazing. Then really shortly after I found out my baby was seriously in trouble – born alive, and died at 11 days. That was the worst time of my life. I really didn’t enjoy any of the success. It almost felt like ‘at the cost of’, weirdly.” Campion still wears her scars painfully close to the surface. “For that time, it felt like that. I did six months of suffering and grieving intensely.”Then she got pregnant with Alice, who now stars in Top of the Lake. Campion says the loss of her son, Jasper, changed her forever. “I am incredibly grateful for having that whole experience of that baby that did not live, because it put me in touch with that kind of suffering. It just changed my perspective forever. When you’ve had a death like that you become part of a club you never leave, and because of the love you feel for them, you never resent it.”The experience resonates in her more recent work in Top of the Lake, in which Robin (Elisabeth Moss) reveals that in the past she was raped and gave the baby away for adoption. She searches for her lost child, and other stories feature surrogacy, miscarriages and loss. “This whole area of female experience is so unknown, but it’s like the equivalent of going to war, except no one makes movies about it,” says Campion.But everyone is making television about it, from Big Little Lies to The Handmaid’s Tale, and Campion’s favoured actresses, Nicole Kidman and Moss, seem to be everywhere. “Hero stories are wearing thin. We have lived a male life, we have lived within the patriarchy. It’s something else to take ownership of your own story.”Ever the iconoclast, Campion is going against the trend by writing her first male lead in her new (untitled) film. “Because at last I feel I can.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/02b618fe8400f2f6d3132c80233ec630ad5f5a77/315_0_5957_3574/master/5957.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=934ad80e5e95b41782646d67056e05d6","title":"jane goodall the wild immersion vr safari wildlife","story":"The wildlife legend wants to take the whole world on safari. As her stunning new VR film series launches, she talks about firing up David Attenborough – and explains why Andy Serkis was ‘fantastic’ as an ape ‘Amazing!” gasps Jane Goodall, as she tilts her head in all directions, oblivious to the outside world. Goodall is the primatologist who changed our understanding of nature by recording chimpanzees using tools, a skill previously thought to separate humans from animals. But today Goodall is the one mastering a new tool: the 84-year-old is sitting spellbound on a sofa, wearing a VR headset and a wry smile.She’s watching a film from The Wild Immersion, a project intended to raise awareness of – and perhaps even save – the natural world, via 360-degree virtual reality wildlife documentaries. Introduced by Goodall, they really are immersive: you’re practically nuzzling into the pandas’ fur, flying with the flamingos over an African lake. Then a lioness comes up and sniffs your face, before a giraffe walks right over you, its vast legs splayed above you like pillars. So that’s what a giraffe’s underneath looks like. Turn your head and the savannah stretches to the horizon in every direction.“Mouse, you have a go,” says Goodall, passing the headset to her assistant Mary Lewis. We’re in the London offices of the Jane Goodall Institute, which is in Mary’s house. “Aaargh!” screams Mary. She’s just come face to face with a cobra. “My favourite thing is watching other people watch,” Goodall says. “It’s so funny!” Having lived in the wilds of Tanzania for 15 years, Goodall is less fearful. “I used to be afraid if I heard a leopard at night when I was alone up on the peak,” she says. “I’d pull the blanket over my head.” Now the fear is more global. We hardly need reminding that these animals and their habitats, and by extension our own survival, are in mortal danger. The numbers are chilling: 16,000 species in danger of extinction, including a quarter of all mammals and one in five plant species (and much more by the end of the century). It’s time we all stopped pulling the blanket over our heads.That’s where The Wild Immersion comes in. The first three 12-minute films, capturing African savannah, underwater and polar habitats, are debuting at the Cannes film festival. There are plans to exhibit them at venues globally (including in China, the US, and London). Beyond that, headset-makers Lenovo are currently marketing its VR Classroom technology, including The Wild Immersion’s content, to schools in the US, enabling “virtual field trips”. Money raised will fund existing nature reserves and create new ones.It took 120 days of filming, on five continents, to produce 80 minutes of footage, using a small team headed by French film-maker Raphaël Aupy. There was no trickery such as scent or food to attract animals: the cameras were simply placed in the habitats, manned or unmanned. Sometimes they were on drones – or, in the case of the pandas, on the end of four-metre poles. They did lose a few cameras to the lions.“The films are a way of interesting kids in conservation,” says Goodall. “And they may inspire people to save up and go out there and see it for themselves.” There’s also the depressing thought that The Wild Immersion may one day be the only way future generations get to see these creatures – because we’ve made them extinct.Goodall first travelled to Gombe, Tanzania, in 1960 as an untrained 26-year-old researcher, generating such headlines as “Comely miss spends her time eyeing apes” and ruffling scientific feathers by giving the chimps names, before documenting their personalities and relationships. But she discovered what nobody else had: that chimpanzees used tools, hunted strategically and ate other chimps or monkeys, even killed each other. Goodall’s work redefined humanity’s conception of itself. Her book, In the Shadow of Man, has been translated into 48 languages.But Goodall gave up full-time research at Gombe in 1986. “I suddenly realised the chimps were vanishing, the forests were going, terrible things were going on in medical research, and I knew my time had come to do something about it.”Today she occupies a rarefied place in the cultural ecosystem, having been a fixture of naturalism, conservation and environmentalism for more than half a century. Elegant, unflappable, calm of voice, sharp of intellect, awesome of reputation, she returns to Gombe twice a year but is no longer on first-name terms with the chimps. She spends most of her time travelling – lecturing, campaigning, visiting the innumerable outposts of her institute. Just hearing her current itinerary is exhausting: a few days in England (home is still Bournemouth, with her sister’s family), then “Austria, Hungary, Sweden, Holland, back five days, then all over Africa: Tanzania, Uganda, South Africa, Kenya – I’ve just cut out the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Republic of Congo, but I’m away, what is it, two weeks?”“Four weeks in Africa,” Lewis corrects her. “I never know,” Goodall smiles. She is in constant demand: “Will I write this? Will I endorse this? People wanting video messages for conferences I can’t attend. I can’t do it all.” The Wild Immersion was such a request. The company’s French founder, Adrien Moisson, an entrepreneur with a background in marketing and veterinary science, secured an audience with Goodall while she was in transit at Heathrow two years ago, convincing her this would be a worthwhile venture.So the virtual Goodall can now be in places the actual one can’t. “Changing minds, that’s the key,” she says. “How do you change the mind of somebody who thinks it’s fine to cut down a forest? It’s never easy. It’s no good arguing with them because they’ll argue back. So the only way is telling stories.”The cinematic potential of Goodall’s own story has not gone unnoticed. In 2016, it was told in Jane, which benefited from rediscovered lustrous colour footage of her time in Gombe, not to mention a bonus love story. It was shot by Hugo van Lawick, the dashing National Geographic cameraman who would become her first husband. Then there was the 1965 TV documentary, Miss Goodall and the Wild Chimpanzees, narrated by Orson Welles.Unsurprisingly, Goodall has little time to watch movies. “I haven’t seen any of the Star Wars or Mission Impossibles,” says, though one franchise has not passed her by. “I did see Planet of the Apes because they consulted us on the chimp behaviour. Andy Serkis: I thought he was fantastic as Caesar. They got it really right.”Goodall knows there are limits to how much film, TV and VR can do to fix the world’s problems. Viewing creatures in unsullied natural habitats can reinforce the impression that there’s plenty of nature still around so we need not worry. And even if it doesn’t induce apathy, conservationist sentiment only really counts if it is translated into action.Goodall recalls discussing this with David Attenborough. “There was one time, years ago, when he was going to give up. When I talked to him, he was totally depressed and feeling hopeless. Then somehow something happened and he ed back in.” What did she say to him? “I did my usual spiel, ‘We can’t give up.’”“Most ordinary people just feel, ‘What can I do to help?’ So they do nothing. My life mission is to give people hope, because without hope you don’t bother. Being abusive is not going to get you anywhere. You need to reach the heart. Once you’ve reached the heart, you’ve got somebody for good.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fcddef938350d0ab9728b6e92fd65d06de93f71f/405_306_3523_2114/master/3523.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=41f420a444862c2c11c8082601602d2a","title":"manuel neuer germany bayern munich goalkeeper","story":"In an extract from Grant Wahl’s new book, the Germany and Bayern Munich captain reveals his goalkeeping philosophy and explains his sweeper-keeper roleModern football has a lot in common with the German autobahn. The speed of the game has no limits these days and the players are like finely calibrated sports cars: faster, sleeker and more powerful than ever. Movement is constant, and yet\u0026nbspthere remains an order to things,\u0026nbspa reminder that even on the edge, there are forces that prevent chaos. No player better illustrates this than Manuel Neuer, the world’s\u0026nbspbest goalkeeper, who has redefined his position. “I’m a little bit risky, but I’m standing for security and protection, and you have to give your team-mates that feeling as well,” says Neuer, captain of Bayern Munich and Germany. “In life, I’m a guy who likes to drive a car quite fast, but I wear a seat belt at the same time.”The downside of Neuer’s approach is the football version of hara-kiri. If he misjudges the speed and trajectory of the ball or the striker and arrives too late, he may concede a goal and look silly in the process. “I don’t feel the fear in my head in this moment,” he says. “I am always thinking positive. It’s all about the first step. If I think I will get the ball, I go out. I can’t stop halfway because the goal is empty and the player would have the opportunity to shoot. You make the reaction, and then, of course, you have to be sure to get the ball. But it’s years of practice. You can’t say from one day to the other: ‘Now I will do it,’ you know? You have to feel it.”A goalkeeper from the age of four, he discovered early on that he had a leading foot and a standing leg, and for him it felt more comfortable to jump to his left than to his right in order to make a save. Dives to his right, he says, would often result in awkward landings that gave him bruises on his right hip.Working with a coach, Neuer had to train himself to explode to his right more easily, just as a right-footed player would work on passing and shooting with his left. Even today, Neuer acknowledges that ing and extending his body to his right to stop a shot won’t look the same as when he does the same thing to his left. “It’s the same power, but it looks different because the body changes when you are up in the air,” he says. “When you are lying down on the grass and need to stand up, you stand up in a different way on each side. It’s not symmetrical. The important thing is that you can jump high and long and stand up quickly. It doesn’t have to look perfect, but it has to be quick.”Yet shot stopping, which was once the hallmark of a proficient goalkeeper, is now a bare-minimum requirement. The 21st-century keeper also needs to organise the back line and set-piece defence, command the box on crosses, disrupt opposing attacks outside the box and initiate his team’s attack.Comfort on the ball with both feet is mandatory, as is the ability to play passes to moving targets over short and long distances, with your feet and with an overhand throw. What’s more, the strategic trend of extreme defensive pressing all over the field means goalkeepers often need to make themselves available as pressure-release valves for defenders needing to get rid of the ball.If you watch Bayern Munich regularly, it becomes clear that Neuer almost never boots the ball aimlessly downfield, like so many other goalkeepers do. Under Pep Guardiola, the word you heard most often from the Bayern players describing their attacking philosophy was “control”. Why would you boom the ball downfield and risk giving up control? “The passing game has become more important,” Neuer says. “We rarely just hammer the ball forward. I probably have twice as many touches of the ball now than I used to have at Schalke.”Bayern Munich’s and Germany’s stranglehold on possession often means Neuer has fewer occasions to demonstrate some of the more traditional goalkeeping skills. But he still has to call upon them at times, knowing that one mistake can turn a game. How does he know when to come out for a cross? The thought process on whether to commit is not much different from deciding whether to leave his box to cut off a through-ball – though there tends to be more human traffic in his path on crosses, requiring him to read even more variables in a split second. “You have to know which players are in your area and whether you have a free way to get to the ball,” he explains. “If I know I can’t get the ball, then I have to stay in.”Television commentators sometimes say goalkeepers should always come out for any cross in their six-yard box. But Neuer argues that is not necessarily the case. “It depends how high the ball is coming into the box,” Neuer says. “If it’s a high ball they can’t reach, you know you can go out. But if it’s a very low ball and a striker is there, it’s very dangerous and you can’t go out.” Even today, there are enough variables that the same keeper who will venture 40 yards from his goal to pick off a through-ball will sometimes refuse to move even six yards, depending on the situation.More commonly, though, Bayern’s and Germany’s obsession with control means the ball is at the other end of the field. Neuer says one of the hardest parts of his job is when he hasn’t faced a shot from the opposition in 45 minutes, and then he’s suddenly called into action. “Sometimes in the winter it’s very cold, you know, especially in Bavaria,” he says, half-smiling but fully serious. “It’s not easy in this moment, because you have to go from 0 to 100.”Such is life on the German autobahn.This is an edited extract from Football 2.0: How the World’s Best Play the Modern Game by Grant Wahl.

Club president Aurelio De Laurentiis said this weekend that “time is up” for the Naples-born tactician to make a decision over his future at the Stadio San Paolo.Following Sunday’s 2-1 home victory over Crotone, which saw the Azzurri end the season with 91 points but finish as runners-up to Juventus, Sarri told La Gazzetta dello Sport: “Everything in life ends and it is better to finish things after writing a beautiful story. I don’t know if I will stay, I have to talk about it with my family.“The situation is complicated. You can’t say you’re ready to go and try again with this squad when you don’t know that everyone will remain here. I don’t know if the club will manage to keep the players who have release clauses when offers will come in from big clubs. What I do think is that I could not go directly to another Italian team, and that if I had to make a change I would prefer to go abroad.”Napoli led the championship at certain times during the recently-concluded campaign and were only cut adrift by champions Juve over the final few fixtures, with the final gap standing at four points.Former Empoli boss Sarri, who joined Napoli in June 2015, added: “We devoted so much to getting more than 90 points and until now that’s all I’d been thinking about. Tomorrow (Monday) I will talk to my family and work out what is the best thing to do. I know the president needs an answer from me as soon as possible as he needs to plan.”On Sunday De Laurentiis had told Gazzetta.it: “Is Sarri staying? You’ll have to ask him. He’s never wanted to answer, always leaving it to his agent. For me the deadline has passed, time is up. We have to move forward. I’m not saying he’ll leave but there is a release clause and we’ll see what happens.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ae3287885b5d0d30dc6d562659dcd022ee528d86/10_241_3490_2093/master/3490.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1dfb1208577e793c21459d3ba94c8feb","title":"fernando torres takes his leave as atletico madrids historic memory","story":"This time it really was the end for The Kid, taking his final bow with Atlético on an emotional evening at the WandaDefeat hit hard and so did the coach, apportioning blame and pointing the finger they had let everyone down, he said. It was 2001, Spain had been knocked out of the U17 World Cup, and during the flight home Fernando Torres and Andrés Iniesta, close friends since they had met at 14, decided to put their feelings into words. As they sat on the plane, they wrote a letter outlining everything that had gone wrong. They never posted it but the writing helped and when they touched down back at Barajas airport they swapped shirts, dedicating them to each other. On the shirt Fernando handed to Andrés, it read: “One day you and me will win the World Cup together.”Nine years later, they did. Eight years after that, they bade farewell together. Six hundred kilometres apart but on the same day – the kids, fathers now, who scored the two most important goals in Spain’s history, in Vienna in 2008 and Johannesburg in 2010, played their last games at their clubs. Their paths have not been the same, but their departures shared more than just a date and because there are two of them, friends, team-mates and popular idols, because they leave the country, the loss feels more significant still.Iniesta’s official send-off was on Friday. Samuel Eto’o and Xavi Hernández were among those there Real Madrid were represented by Emilio Butragueño, video messages were played, Pep Guardiola and Sergio Ramos appearing and Iniesta’s shirts sold with the number on its side, infinity instead of eight. On the same night, Torres had begun his goodbye from the statue of Neptune in central Madrid, thousands of fans before him, celebrating their Europa League success against Marseille 55,000 had gathered there where Torres said he had stood himself 22 years before, back when he was 11.But while their departures had been announced some time ago, even though they’d had moments that felt like farewells already, Iniesta dancing his last waltz in the Copa del Rey final, Torres lifting the trophy in Lyon, and although they’d been commemorated three days earlier, this time really was the end.Torres lifted the trophy, captain Gabi inviting him to join him, just as Antoine Griezmann had invited him to. With a couple of minutes to go, Torres was still on the bench that was when Griezmann ran across and told Atlético’s assistant manager, Germán Burgos, to send him on. In his penultimate game for the club, he won his first title. As he stood before fans the following night he insisted: “For all those kids who have dreams: nothing is impossible, and still less if you’re Atlético.” For years, though, winning anything seemed impossible, which is why they never blamed him for going. In fact, they encouraged him to they loved him, so they set him free. His only other title was the Second Division, 16 years ago – and that too helps to explain his impact, why Sunday mattered so much. When Torres returned, Diego Simeone insisted he had signed the footballer not the icon, but that is what he is. Just in footballing terms, his departure is not so traumatic. Torres, though, is not just a footballer. He is The Kid from Fuenlabrada, the youth product and fan, who appeared when they were relegated to the second ision, the embodiment of hope, their only hope. One little year in hell, Jesús Gil called it, only it turned out to be two but Torres led them back, became the youngest ever captain, and leaving took longer than anyone imagined. He turned down Real Madrid. He embraced and embodied Atlético’s identity, understanding and expressing it better than anyone, the pitch, tone and sentiment invariably perfect.He suffered but waited when he walked, it wasn’t just with their blessing but their gratitude. He was too good for this team, they knew they convinced themselves that it was as if he hurt more than they did and they didn’t stop supporting him. Liverpool shirts appeared at the Calderón. When he returned with them, both sets of fans chanted his name. When he returned properly, re-joining his club, they were delighted. At his presentation over 35,000 were at the Calderón. He was always acutely conscious that he hadn’t actually done very much, almost a little embarrassed at how well they treated him. “You made me the happiest person in the world,” he said on Sunday. “I remember that he asked what he had done to deserve that when he came back,” Gabi said this week. “Well, I ask what we have done to deserve having you as the greatest exponent of Atlético around the world.”A lot had changed since he had been away, since Simeone had arrived. When he scored his first goal Jean-Francois Hernández was among his team-mates when he scored his 100th, Jean-Francois’s son Lucas was. he’d been away and come back and in the meantime Atlético started to win. He surpassed 100 goals, but from his return until Thursday they didn’t win again. Mostly, he embraced a secondary role, although the sense that he could offer more ultimate hastened his departure. He lifted the trophy, delighted, but he had only been on the pitch a couple of minutes.Torres talked about the Champions League final in Milan as the game of his life they were playing against Real Madrid, the club where, he once insisted, “they don’t feel their football”, and they lost on penalties. But at least they had played in a Champions League final, and that was unthinkable before. Which didn’t hurt any less but shouldn’t be forgotten and he was a reminder, so important precisely because he had been there in the bad times as well as the good. As well? Instead.“Now that we win,” Iñako Díaz Guerra wrote, “we have to remember who we are. And that’s what Fernando’s there for. It’s not that he’s the veteran who came on to waste time and treated it like a gift it’s not that he’s the star who won the World Cup and the Euros but never felt so fulfilled as when he won the Europa League as a bit-part with Atleti, his Atleti it’s not a star saying goodbye, it’s our historic memory.”Raised on Germany Street, the country against whom he scored the winning goal at Euro 2008, first taken to the Calderón by his grandfather in January 1995 to see Atlético draw 1-1 with Compostela, Torres recalled going to school in Fuenlabrada, “almost always pissed off because we had lost”, feeling like a lone Atlético in a place dominated by them, wearing his tracksuit in defiance. On Sunday, he walked out, for his last ever game, knowing Atlético were going to finish ahead of Real for only the second time this century.Atlético have finished the season having let in just 22 goals in 38 games. He left after they let in more than a quarter of that in a single game. Things had changed, alright. “I never needed a trophy to feel like the most loved player in the world,” he said on Sunday. By then, at last, he had one, 17 years after his debut. Outside the Wanda politano, a giant shirt was there for fans to sign. Photographs were lined along the concourse outside, a blond kid with freckles, an open-air Torres museum. He walked on for the last time as captain, carrying Nora, Leo and Elsa with him, his shirt, like those of all his team-mates, embroidered with the slogan: from Kid to Legend. A huge mosaic delivered the same message. They chanted his name. They lifted from their seats when he raced into the area, only to hit the ball wide, and again when he put a shot into the side netting. Then it happened: they roared when Ángel Correa laid it on a plate for him to score. There was another roar when he got the second, racing through to finish. Running into the crowd, he disappeared under the bodies.On his last night at the Calderón, he had scored twice. On his last night as an atlético, here he was again: two goals, ahead of Real Madrid, a winner at last. But going now, just like Iniesta who was in tears in Barcelona. Even the DJ and his abysmal music couldn’t entirely ruin it. There was a guard of honour and a joint ceremony with Prieto at the start. At the end, after he departed with 10 minutes to go, almost ceremoniously handing over the captain’s armband to Leo Messi and sitting in tears on the bench, he was lifted by his team-mates and thrown into the air. He took to the microphone to offer one last: “Visca Barca! Visca Catalunya! Visca Fuentealbilla!” “I’ll always tell the story of the day I was at Iniesta’s farewell,” Ernesto Valverde said.In Madrid, they’ll talk of the day the Kid left. Torres went down the tunnel, and then returned, his team-mates giving him a guard of honour. Opponents Eibar applauded him too. No one had left, the place packed, but there was silence as the video played, a freckled kid with a blond mop appearing on the screen, and as he took the microphone. “I’d like to start with those in the ‘third tier’,” he said, looking up beyond the stand in front, to the heavens, “especially Luis Aragonés, who showed us what Atletico Madrid is, and to my granddad …” His voice broke, tears appeared in his eyes. Gripping tighter, he pressed on: “… who gave his grandson the greatest gift you can give, which is to an atlético …”With every line – his parents, his wife and children, the staff, team-mates – Torres seemed to swallow harder and the pauses grew longer, filled with song from the stands. “Today is the last day. It’s been over 400 games and it’s very hard knowing that this is the end,” he said. Then he started crying. As he circled the pitch one last time, they sang Atletico’s theme, a capella. And then, like Iniesta, he was gone.• All that and it comes down to this … nothing, really. For the first time ever, La Liga went into the final day with everything sorted. There was nothing to play for, unless you count the battle to be best of the Basques – Eibar for the first time. No relegation, no European places, no Champions League, and definitely not the title, which had been wrapped up early enough that they even managed to present Barcelona with their trophy in the season in which they actually won it.• Speaking of the Basque country, this is the second worst season in Athletic’s history.• It wasn’t just Iniesta, Prieto and Torres saying goodbye – already quite a hit in a single day. Among others, there was also Joaquín Caparrós, Asier Garitano and, although no one said so, Gareth Bale, scoring on what is probably his last game in Spain – at the stadium at which he scored his first."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5a1812b6d34049ab9d449d832f19409ac7bccb08/0_0_1200_720/master/1200.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=baa7cbcdfed1f58414591a79e0302d1b","title":"colombia discovers the art of keeping young people off the streets","story":"After a failed peace pact raised the spectre of gang violence, music and dance have thrown the youth of Colombia’s Chocó region a lifelineA rat skitters through the prison cell where Harold Cuesta sits handcuffed, beads of sweat dripping down his brow. He says his imprisonment means the delicate peace pact that his gang and others negotiated with the mayor of Quibdó is now dead.Since April, Cuesta, a key figure in the peace talks, has languished in the deprived Colombian city’s overpopulated Anayancy prison, alongside a dozen other ex-gang leaders. Cuesta’s list of convictions over the years is exhaustive, a catalogue of time in and out of prison for offences including extortion and, this time around, the alleged murder of his former lawyer. Yet it wasn’t always this way. Cuesta was once on track to realising his dream of becoming a professional footballer, until life took a turn for the worse and he turned to criminal activity to make a living. Now he has “The peace process has no future here,” reflects the 29-year-old, under the watchful gaze of the guards.The problem is not unusual in Colombia, where the Bogotá government has struggled to enforce a national peace accord in parts of the country where it holds little sway. Quibdó, however, has previously bucked that trend.The city, where the authorities struggle to provide basic services, has long felt abandoned by the state. Its predominantly black population sought to deal with their own safety. The pact over Quibdó’s street warfare once distinguished it from other Colombian cities, riddled with violence and poverty.Now they find their reconciliation process threatened by the same question rocking Colombia as a whole: how should gang members who agree to turn in their arms account for their crimes?The Quibdó pact, signed in September, was an attempt to lower the crime rate before Chocó’s famous San Pacho festival. The gangs agreed to lay down their weapons in exchange for the promise of access to education and work opportunities. Murder rates and vandalism dropped dramatically. “There is one simple problem,” says Quibdó’s mayor, Isaias Chalá. “These kinds of processes usually start from the top and work their way down … from the presidency down. But we started it the other way round.”In April, the Colombian vice president, Óscar Naranjo, travelled to the region, applauding the pact for its success. Three days later, without warning, came the arrests. Chalá claims the order to jail Cuesta and the other gang leaders came from the national police, “as a restorative justice process needs to be carried out”.A former slave-trading hub on the Pacific coast, Chocó remains one of Colombia’s most impoverished and marginalised regions. “Chocó is a region that has been marginalised, stigmatised and abandoned by the government, since the time of post-colonisation,” says Edwar Calderón, a Colombian academic at the University of Edinburgh.Since the signing of Colombia’s peace accord with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia in late 2016, a power vacuum has been created in areas where the guerillas demobilised, allowing criminal armed groups to expand. “What has happened with the Farc leaving these areas are territories without control. What we are seeing now is the same violence as before, sometimes even worse, but without control,” says Calderón.Amid the renewed violence, he wanted to try find a way to stop young people from joining gangs. Calderón hit upon the idea of using funds from an academic project to create a workshop involving Colombian artists and musicians.With the help of Mr Klaje, a Colombian music group who create instruments from recycled materials, and a group of artists from Fundación Casa Tres Patios in Medellín, a week-long workshop was held in late April.Tatiana Gamboa, a 29-year-old mother from the impoverished Obrero neighbourhood, took part.“It’s important, because all of the people who are here have had some kind of issue with one another,” she says.Another participant, Luis Romaña, 26, talks about displacement in his hometown. “Quibdó has seen a big increase in population over the last decade, a lot of it due to the arrival of displaced people as a result of the armed conflict. The population began to grow, there was no control over this, and we lost security in the city.On the final day of the workshop, young people from a variety of backgrounds, and from rival neighbourhoods, took part in a parade. Old buckets and paint tins were transformed into drums and carnival costumes crafted from sequins and feathers as the participants called for an end to violence in the city.Yeiner Belalcázar Paz, 40, better known as Candyman, is a teacher and the frontman of Mr Klaje. He comes from a neighbourhood in the Colombian city of Cali, where he grew up surrounded by gang crime.“We believe that art has a power that can help with the kind of processes that are happening like the one in Quibdó. It is like a magic tool. The young people here like to dance and sing. They live through art. When they hear a drum it runs through their veins.”Among those taking part was a group of about 15 young people from Reposo 3, a neighbourhood taxi drivers wont go near. One was Baeron Palomeque. “We don’t have a football pitch, a community centre or anywhere to carry out recreational activities, so the dance group is the only thing we have,” he says. “It is helping to keep a lot of these kids off the street and has brought young people from rival neighbourhoods together. The government must do more though.Many of the workshop attendees told of their childhood in the Chocó region.Rosney Mosquera, 29, has just finished her high school diploma. “I’ve been a victim throughout my life. A victim of displacement, moving from neighbourhood to neighbourhood all my life. I’m a victim of rape and of armed conflict.“There is a lot of violence in the neighbourhood where I live. People have always been fighting and killing one another.”The organisers were pleased with the outcome of the event. “When the young people realised that they could work together, they started to integrate, and when this happened they said that they didn’t know why they thought about people from other neighbourhoods the way they did before,” says Candyman.“There were a few young indigenous people there, and the black population of Quibdó. Both usually kept to their own groups. But when we started to do the activities, they started to come together.”On the final day, as the parade made its way through the puddle-laden streets of the city, onlookers peered from balconies, tapping their feet to the infectious rhythms and listening to the young people as they chanted: “Our neighbourhood is your neighbourhood, our street is your street. No more violence, Quibdó.”At one point they went past the prison where Cuesta is being held, reflecting on the ruined pact he built."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/45063def60a31d54dd090ee67b3eb2b3e886d74c/0_229_5122_3073/master/5122.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9c7f52a32c5c2b5b16c417940686f71f","title":"seven ways to manage anxiety","story":"There is some evidence that herbal products such as kava, galphimia, German chamomile, bacopa, ginkgo, roseroot and others may reduce anxiety symptoms due to their sedative effects. The most researched of these is kava, which has been found to be effective in several placebo-controlled trials, and may compare favourably to benzodiazepines. However, for all these products, research studies remain limited. There have also been safety concerns regarding kava due to some reports of liver toxicity. If you are considering herbal medicines, you should discuss with your doctor, especially regarding any medication you’re already taking.A few studies have suggested that nutriceuticals can help reduce anxiety. One fairly large placebo-controlled trial found that magnesium decreased anxiety in patients with mild-to-moderate symptoms, while another study of 100 anxiety patients suggested that the supplement a-casozepine peptide could help. In patients with panic disorders, inositol has been shown to reduce the frequency and severity of attacks. Again, as with herbal products, consult your doctor before taking supplements in case of adverse interactions with medications.In the past few years, a range of free apps have been developed to try and tackle anxiety. Flowy – designed with assistance from the Centre for Anxiety Disorders and Trauma at King’s College London – uses a game situation to reduce anxiety and panic, coaxing the user into practising breathing-control. In a 2017 study, the IntelliCare suite of apps – which teach users self-management skills for tackling anxiety based on psychological research – was found to significantly reduce anxiety symptoms.Caffeine is a psychostimulant and there are many decades of research to suggest it can both exacerbate the symptoms of GAD and also trigger panic attacks. Likewise, while many people with anxiety turn to alcohol as a calming sedative, that can trigger a vicious circle, where stress levels increase once the alcohol is processed and the initial effects wear off.Trying yoga, massage therapy or meditation can help keep anxiety under control, while practising various relaxation techniques for 30 minutes, two or three times a day, can also help with the muscle tension that anxiety can cause."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e53c0f1938d9b479a5c56591572c4d8d21c52317/0_89_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a701c940a8b7336c9b24d3ba82285a09","title":"russian dirty money is damaging uk security mps say","story":"Government must stop money laundering by ‘kleptocrats and rights abusers’, which is helping Putin subvert international rulesA powerful committee of MPs has warned that the government is putting national security at risk by allowing “kleptocrats and human rights abusers to use the City of London to launder their ill-gotten funds to circumvent sanctions”. The foreign affairs select committee said the government’s lax approach to tackling international money laundering is putting money “directly into the hands of regimes that would harm the UK, its interests and its allies”. In a hard-hitting report titled Moscow’s Gold: Russian Corruption in the UK, the committee said the government was failing to follow through on the prime minister’s “robust rhetoric” in the wake of the Skripals’ poisoning. “These assets, on which the Kremlin can call at any time, both directly and indirectly support President Putin’s campaign to subvert the international rules-based system, undermine our allies, and erode the mutually reinforcing international networks that support UK foreign policy.”Conservative MP Tom Tugendhat, the committee chair, said: “We can no longer allow ‘business as usual’. The UK must be clear that the corruption stemming from the Kremlin is no longer welcome in our markets and we will act.“The scale of damage that this ‘dirty money’ can do to UK foreign policy interests dwarfs the benefit of Russian transactions in the City. There is no excuse for the UK to turn a blind eye as President Putin’s kleptocrats and human rights abusers use money laundered through London to corrupt our friends, weaken our alliances, and erode faith in our institutions.”The report said the UK’s weakness to act to stem the flow of potentially questionable Russian money was exposed just days after the UK expelled two dozen Russian diplomats following the attempted murder of Sergei and Yulia Skripal in Salisbury. “On 16 March – two days after the government announced the expulsion of 23 Russian diplomats from the UK – Russia raised $4bn (£2.97bn) in eurobond issuances, nearly half of which were bought by investors from the UK,” the report said. A day earlier Russian energy company Gazprom raised €750m (£656m) in a bond sale, some of which were bought by UK investors according to VTB Capital, a Russian bank subjected to US sanctions.Following the sale, the Russian embassy in the UK tweeted:“The ease with which the Russian government was able to raise funds in London despite the strong measures that the government took in the wake of the Salisbury attack raises serious questions about the government’s commitment to combating Russian state aggression,” the report said. The committee also said the flotation of En+, a Russian energy company controlled by oligarch Oleg Deripaska on the London Stock Exchange last year, was also an example of “the contradictions inherent in UK government policy towards Russia”. Tugendhat said the government must be “clear that the Kremlin is no longer welcome in our markets. We must be united in our efforts to match rhetoric with action – in the City, through government policy and among allies in the US, G7 and EU,” he added.“We call on the Foreign and Commonwealth Office to set out a coherent strategy on Russia that clearly links together the diplomatic, military and financial tools that the UK can use to counter Russian state aggression.”The committee recommended that the government close gaps in the sanctions regime that have allowed companies to use London markets while being sanctioned in other jurisdictions. It also suggested that sanctions be extended to target more iniduals who are closely linked to President Putin’s regime. Deripaska has previously described the grounds for including him on a US sanctions list as groundless, ridiculous and absurd.Speaking before the report’s publication, the Russian ambassador to London, Alexander Yakovenko, said: “We believe that the statements like ‘someone is a friend of somebody’ is not the legal basis for taking decisions against someone.” He warned that Russian citizens based in London “could go to the courts and put certain things in front of the courts. They are going to complain – some of them are preparing these moves and the government should think twice.”He added Britain had a reputation to protect as a believer in the rule of law.

But it happens. Nothing you can do about it. He came out way faster, played way more aggressive than I did. It took me a long time to get activated again. I ran out of time. The break took my momentum away.”Asked how he might convert his good run of three-setters to the much different challenge of a slam, he said: “I will try to play the same way over a longer period of time. But I don’t even want to think about tennis the next few days, then to Paris, where Rafa will be the favourite, no doubt about it.”Ten years separate them in age, there is a gap of $90m in career earnings and the Spaniard now has 70 more titles than the 21-year-old world No 3. But Zverev is here to stay. He is growing in power and confidence and, seeded second in Roger Federer’s absence, he will be a threat at the French Open, which starts on Sunday and where Nadal will reach for his 11th Coupe de Mousquetaires. They cannot meet until the final.The demands of winning seven best-of-five matches in a row is still a huge ask for Zverev – as it will be for Dominic Thiem, who stopped Nadal’s run of 50 clay sets in a row in Madrid 9 days ago, before losing in the final to Zverev.The rival most likely to stop Nadal at Roland Garros could still be the man he has played 51 times over 12 years, and whom he beat for the 25th time in the semi-final on Saturday. Djokovic provided an exhausting test of Nadal’s game from start to finish this was a stop-start skirmish, because of the elements and the efforts of the combatants.The sharpness the German showed in pushing Kyle Edmund deep and wide in their close third-round battle was not quite there in the early exchanges. He had to take risks he could get away with against lesser players. From there, errors crept into his game.He had been 40-love up in the sixth game when a lazy forehand handed Nadal another break opportunity and he cashed, in when a return popped up off the net, to go 5-1 up after half an hour. He served out the set, untroubled.The match was then turned on its head. Zverev put his heart and soul into a fightback and he finally got a look on Nadal’s serve in the second game and forced Nadal wide enough to overstretch on his forehand for the break.Zverev held to love and, in the space of a few minutes, the complexion of the contest changed from walkover to engaging theatre to potential upset.The fourth game was pivotal – in the match and possibly in Zverev’s season. He got overexcited when he dumped a forehand when trying to pass Nadal at the net for a 4-0 lead, then lobbed long. He outfoxed him in an exchange of drop shots to grab another break point – this time sealing it with a devastating backhand down the line. His fist-pump to his box screamed defiance and resolve.The match was taking on an eerie familiarity for Nadal. In Buenos Aires 13 years ago, he beat Gastón Gaudio 0-6, 6-0, 6-1. There would be no bagel – nobody has done that to him since Roger Federer in Hamburg nine years ago – but he could not stop Zverev wrapping up the set 6-1 with another unreachable backhand.Zverev played a drop-shot to engineer the break at the start of the final frame – and, as the rain arrived, he held for 2-0. The gathering – including most of Nadal’s family – took in a gasp of warm, moist air. For Zverev, impatient to finish the job, a 22-minute pause to let the showers pass was a minor irritant. For Nadal, it allowed him time to regroup and when they resumed ever so briefly in a light drizzle he held for 2-3. Again, the rain held up the royal progress.Nadal was asking the more searching questions. His whipped forehand was down from a tournament average of 193kph to 167kph, yet he still bossed the important exchanges with angles and timing.Trailing in the serving cycle, Zverev struggled to control his temperament and his opponent. Another attacking lob drifted long and Nadal finished the job with a backhand drop shot that not even the fleet-footed Zverev could reach."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c30d0ee918af039bd90f71d057266489bc644fac/0_124_4480_2688/master/4480.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8c0e7b2afbe24d2f51f0f49f68ff8cbc","title":"simon yates giro d italia stage 15 cycling","story":"Two days before the time trial which could prove a decisive moment in the 101st Giro d’Italia, Simon Yates took his third stage victory of the race at the Sappada ski resort on Sunday , extending his overall lead over the defending champion, Tom Dumoulin, beyond the two-minute barrier. It was a massive step towards what could be a first British win in the Giro while the race favourite, Chris Froome, flopped badly following his stage victory on Saturday, with the overall win slipping further out of reach.With two short sharp climbs in the final kilometres and a further ascent to the finish, this stage finish favoured Yates’s punchy, attacking style more than the relentlessly steep slopes of Saturday’s finish on Monte Zoncolan. He made two incisive attacks in rapid succession at the foot of the penultimate ascent, Costalissoio the first pulled an elite group of half a dozen clear of the remnants of the lead peloton and the second took him clear for good.Yates decided to press on immediately after the rapid, chilly descent from the Passo di Sant’Antonio, which led straight up on to Costalissoio without giving the riders a pause to gather breath or stretch the legs. Froome was already floundering a little way behind as Yates’s team-mate Haig increased the pace, prompting the New Zealander Bennett to make a brief, unsuccessful attack.When the pink jersey had flown, Dumoulin was left in the company of four other contenders for the podium: Domenico Pozzovivo, Miguel Ángel López, Richard Carapaz and Thibaut Pinot. Only the Frenchman Pinot was willing to collaborate consistently with the Dutchman Dumoulin, who could be seen gesticulating at the quartet in an attempt to make them cooperate.Dumoulin was briefly dislodged by his four companions on the final ascent to the ski resort but regained contact when they began marking each other with their minds on the time bonuses awarded for second and third places behind Yates, whose stage victory looked assured from the moment he went past the five kilometres to go mark with 51sec in hand. The Dutchman ended the stage third, just behind López, but his loss of 47sec to Yates, including bonuses, extended his deficit to 2min 11sec.Stage 15 (Tolmezzo - Sappada 176km)\u0026nbsp1 Simon Yates (Gbr) Mitchelton-Scott 4hrs 37mins 56secs, 2 Miguel Angel Lopez (Col) Astana Pro Team at 41s, 3 Tom Dumoulin (Ned) Team Sunweb, 4 Domenico Pozzovivo (Ita) Bahrain-Merida, 5 Richard Carapaz (Ecu) Movistar Team, 6 Thibaut Pinot (Fra) Groupama-FDJ all at same time, 7 Alexandre Geniez (Fra) AG2R La Mondiale at 1m 20s, 8 Davide Formolo (Ita) Bora-Hansgrohe, 9 Pello Bilbao (Spa) Astana Pro Team, 10 Sam Oomen (Ned) Team Sunweb all at same time\u0026nbspGeneral classification after stage 15\u0026nbsp1 Simon Yates (Gbr) Mitchelton-Scott 65hrs 57mins 37secs, 2 Tom Dumoulin (Ned) Team Sunweb at 2mins 11secs, 3 Domenico Pozzovivo (Ita) Bahrain-Merida at 2m28s, 4 Thibaut Pinot (Fra) Groupama-FDJ at 2m37s, 5 Miguel Angel Lopez (Col) Astana Pro Team at 4m27s, 6 Richard Carapaz (Ecu) Movistar Team at same time, 7 Chris Froome (Gbr) Team Sky at 4m52s, 8 George Bennett (NZl) LottoNL-Jumbo at 5m34s, 9 Pello Bilbao (Spa) Astana Pro Team at 5m59s, 10 Patrick Konrad (Aut) Bora-Hansgrohe at 6m13s\u0026nbspAs for Froome, Yates had failed to overhaul the Team Sky leader in the final kilometres up Monte Zoncolan the previous day but 24 hours later Froome looked as if he had not recovered from that monumental stage-winning effort. At the finish the four times Tour de France winner had dropped from fifth overall to seventh but he is now 4min 52sec behind Yates, suggesting even a place on the podium may be out of reach.There are only six contenders for the podium in Rome on Sunday – seven counting Froome – and Yates’s stage victory puts him on a par with Eddy Merckx and the Italian Gilberto Simoni, the only others to have taken three stage wins while wearing the pink jersey. Those are not the key statistics for the Bury cyclist entering the final week, however.Dumoulin may well wipe out most if not all of that 2min 11sec in Tuesday’stomorrow’s time trial – he is the world champion at the discipline and the flat course will favour him – but the three mountain stages that follow it will give Yates the chance either to regain the lead or to reinforce it, depending on how things stand after Tuesday. The structure of this year’s Giro, with two time trials, one short and one longer if not over-long, means the tactical equation has always been simple: gain as much time on the specialists as possible.“It’s a good gap but he can take two minutes out of me in the time trial in one stage,” said Yates. “I’ve been fighting since Israel to get a good gap. I’m happy with the gap but it could vanish in 35 kilometres. I don’t know if it is enough.” His directeur sportif at Mitchelton-Scott, Matt White, put it differently: “We’re going to take a kicking from one of the best time triallists in the world.” The dimension of that kicking – if kicking it turns out to be – will go a long way to deciding the final outcome of this Giro."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7cc60bf9fd2cb98901469bb11265147464d41367/509_530_3136_1881/master/3136.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=86faf61f2c9a2c4d42508aee3791d024","title":"saracens exeter premiership final","story":"The Premiership’s two top clubs have hit peak form at the perfect time for their Twickenham showdown after overwhelming winsMajor finals featuring the competition’s two best teams peaking at precisely the right moment are surprisingly few in number. Not this year. When it really counted Saracens and Exeter performed as well as they have done all season in their respective semi-finals on Saturday, paving the way for a rip-roaring Premiership finale at Twickenham.If Saracens were spectacular at times in their 57-33 destruction of Wasps, the Chiefs were even more dominant in crushing Newcastle 36-5 at Sandy Park. The two top teams in the end-of-season table have raised their play-off games and neither sounds inclined to settle for consolatory pats on the back on Saturday.It says a lot about Exeter’s consistency over the past 18 months that, on paper, Rob Baxter’s defending champions boast the slimmest of edges. Having finished eight points clear of Saracens in the regular season and beaten their north London rivals home and away, they play relentlessly to their strengths and will back themselves to fight to the finish just as they did in their extra-time victory over Wasps a year ago.One key statistic also suggests they are a club still on the rise. Of the XV who kicked off the final against Wasps last May, just four started Saturday’s semi-final despite virtually everyone being fit. Even popular elder statesmen like Gareth Steenson and Thomas Waldrom are on the bench these days, having been superseded by the Simmonds brothers from Teignmouth. Breaking into the Exeter line-up is increasingly as tough as the actual games.With Dave Ewers also returning to his best and Don Armand continuing to make a mockery of his exclusion from England’s summer tour party, the Saracens pack can expect a much heavier-duty contest than Wasps could supply. While Maro Itoje, Mako Vunipola and Vincent Koch are all finishing the domestic season in impressive fashion, the possibility of Billy Vunipola’s tight hamstring limiting his final involvement might just give the Chiefs further cause for cautious optimism.Armand, for one, feels the days of Exeter being overawed by big occasions are long gone. “We are not going to be starstruck by the fact it is the final,” he said. “We just have to pitch up and do what we do. We will take it in our stride, take the learnings of the last two years and hopefully make it work in our favour.”No team containing Itoje, Owen Farrell or the Vunipolas could ever be described as vulnerable, but their next opponents certainly do not view them as invincible. “They have certainly started hitting their straps but we have had very good results against them over the last three or four years,” said Armand. “We know how to play them, we know how to play our game and it is going to be an exciting match. We need to make sure we pitch up and bring what Exeter brings.”While Armand is doing his best to remain diplomatic on the England selection front – “Obviously I am disappointed but we are in a final and I have bigger things to focus on at the moment” – a second consecutive Premiership crown for Exeter would reopen the debate about England’s best options a year out from the World Cup. Henry Slade and Sam Simmonds are in outstanding form, Alec Hepburn makes other loosehead props look positively lethargic and the 21-year-old Joe Simmonds will approach Twickenham full of confidence despite never having played there before.The ultimate test, though, still awaits the young fly-half who kicked a nerveless 19 points against Newcastle to set alongside tries from Nic White, Olly Woodman and Armand. His opposite number Farrell knows Twickenham rather better and slotted 11 out of 11 kicks against Wasps in a display that impressed his team-mates and coaches alike. “The guy’s incredible,” said his Lions Test colleague Jamie George. “He just keeps getting better and better. From what we’ve seen here, the more leadership and responsibility he is given, the better he gets.”Coincidentally, Farrell is due to have his stag weekend on the same weekend as Dylan Hartley, from whom he has just inherited the England tour captaincy, and Saracens’ director of rugby, Mark McCall, feels Eddie Jones has an increasingly key decision to make at No 10 in South Africa. “Owen had a brilliant game and was outstanding for us,” said McCall. “It is going to be a big call for Eddie where he plays him in South Africa. For me his best position is at 10 but I know Owen is happy to play wherever is best for the team.”This week, though, will be all about satisfying Saracens’ ambition to avoid a trophy-less season for the first time since 2013-14. “This is our fourth final in five years and we have been in three Champions Cup finals in five years,” said McCall. “To have those kind of tallies is an incredible achievement from the whole group but we want to go and win it now. You saw in the first 20 minutes against Wasps – which was maybe as good as we have ever played – the real intent and desire in the group to do that.”Two seasons ago, Sarries defeated a slightly off-key Exeter 28-20 in the final, but this year’s rematch could be a modern classic."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/36b07dae73ca8f1b450b4dd18058f712ad23b68a/0_126_2709_1626/master/2709.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b2b16d3647adb9427b70b2db2db83956","title":"own limited edition print sports photographer eamonn mccabe","story":"The award-winning sports photographer Eamonn McCabe, a former  head of photography, looks back at his favourite sporting images from the 1970s and 80s.

OnePlus has embraced what appears to be the smartphone trend for 2018, the “notch” – where the top of the screen cuts into the display to make room for sensors, the earpiece speaker and a 16-megapixel selfie camera.The 6.28in AMOLED screen is enormous, bright, colourful and crisp, with great viewing angles. Technically it isn’t as pin-sharp as some of Samsung’s top-end displays, which have a higher resolution, but you have to really try to see the difference.Also new for the OnePlus 6 is a curved glass back, available in both mirror and matt finishes, and with smooth, polished metal sides, the phone feels really nice in the hand. In fact the whole device feels like a significant step up in quality, matching that of Apple’s iPhone X and Samsung’s Galaxy S9+.There are downsides to a glass back. While it’s not slippery in the hand, it is on fabric surfaces, and the mirror finish picks up fingerprints like a magnet. Scratches are inevitable too, and it’ll be less robust if you drop it. Thankfully OnePlus is one of the few non-Apple manufacturers that makes really nice cases.There’s no getting over that this is a big phone firmly in the phablet category, but it’s not unmanageably wide or unwieldy, comparing well to Samsung’s Galaxy S9+.The OnePlus 6 ticks every box for a top-of-the-range smartphone in 2018: Qualcomm’s latest Snapdragon 845 processor, at least 6GB of RAM and plenty of storage.But it also feels like a top-end smartphone, absolutely flying along. When OnePlus claims there is “no lag of any kind” it isn’t kidding. The entire system is incredibly snappy all over, from switching apps to launching the camera. It’s delightful.Battery life is good, but not quite class leading. The OnePlus 6 lasted 29 hours between charges, starting up at 7am on day one and lasting until midday on day two.That was while using it as my primary device, with two sims in it, browsing and using apps for five hours while receiving hundreds of push emails and messages, 60 minutes of Amazon Video, around 30 photos and listening to around seven hours of music via Bluetooth headphones.OnePlus puts a customised version of Android on its phones called OxygenOS, this time based on Android 8.1 Oreo, which is the latest available right now, with Android P due in the summer.OxygenOS is a slightly refined version of so-called “stock” Android with small additions and tools, such as the ability to duplicate certain messaging apps including WhatsApp.OxygenOS 5.1 on the OnePlus 6 is the smoothest and most refined yet, matching that on Google’s Pixel 2 for speed, which is a very good thing. It lacks the Google Feed pane, instead having what OnePlus calls the “shelf” containing widgets, which is a shame.Customisation options include the ability to swap out the traditional Android navigation home, back and overview buttons for gestures similar to those used on the iPhone X and a choice whether or not to hide the notch by a permanently black status bar.OnePlus has long struggled to keep up with the likes of Apple, Google, Samsung and now Huawei when it comes to the camera.The OnePlus 6 has a 16+20-megapixel dual-camera system on the back. It uses both colour cameras to increase detail and low light performance, as well as provide a fairly good portrait mode.The camera is much improved, producing some really nice, well detailed and well coloured images in good lighting. Low light performance is also markedly better than last year’s phone, and the app is simple and easy to use. But the OnePlus 6 isn’t quite on a par with the Huawei P20 Pro or the Google Pixel 2. It may not have any real whiz-bang features, and lacks optical zoom, but most will be very pleased with the images for the money.The selfie camera is pretty good too, preserving a solid amount of detail, even in fairly poor fluorescent lighting. The optional beauty mode also manages to smooth skin without erasing beards, which is better than most.The OnePlus 6 lacks the 960fps slow-motion that 2018’s competitors have, but will record very good 720p slow-mo at 480fps for as long as you want, rather than just in bursts.The OnePlus 6 is available in three colours and three storage variants. It starts at £469 with the mirror black finish, 6GB of RAM and 64GB of storage. The version with 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage costs £519 in white, gloss or matt black, while an 8GB RAM, 256GB matt black version costs £569.For comparison, the 6.1in Huawei P20 Pro costs £799 with 128GB of storage, the 6in Huawei Mate 10 Pro with 128GB costs £699, the 6.2in Samsung Galaxy S9+ costs £869 with 128GB of storage, the 6in Google Pixel 2 XL with 64GB costs £799, the 6in Honor 10 View with 128GB costs £450, and the 5.8in iPhone X with 64GB costs £999.The OnePlus 6 is premium device that cuts the right corners in pursuit of a sub-£500 price. Starting at £469, it certainly isn’t a cheap smartphone but it is less than half the cost of Apple’s iPhone X and considerably cheaper than the top-end Android competition.It is as smooth and well made on the outside as it is high performing on the inside, which makes it one of the best smartphone experiences available at any price point right now.And while the camera is good, the screen is great, the battery life is good and it even has a headphone socket, there’s no real killer, stand-out feature to set the OnePlus 6 apart.Instead the OnePlus 6 demonstrates that despite what marketers might say, you really don’t need to pay £700 to £1,000 for a really great phone.Pros: good battery life, great screen, excellent performance, dual-sim, great camera, premium build and feel, Bluetooth 5Cons: glass is more fragile than metal, no wireless charging, no IP water resistance rating, no expandable storage"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cb1e6ec09d824ce35eb2e8dc2c676afcd9db7afe/14_4_1522_913/master/1522.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3189f717954d27c33bb0bfc27b625851","title":"the handmaids tale series 2 review as intense as tv gets","story":"The dystopian drama has strayed beyond Margaret Atwood’s novel, but it still manages to find beauty in the darkest traumaWant to comment on the new series of The Handmaid’s Tale? Comments are open on our series recap blog.We begin where we left off: with Offred – or June, as she is becoming once more – being bundled, pregnant, into a van and driven away. Into the darkness within, or else the light we don’t – and she doesn’t – know.Light is streaming through a metal grille when a viewing hatch is opened, but it is slammed shut again. Audible clues offer no comfort: shouting, dogs barking. On the soundtrack – used sparingly and so effectively – is the signature falling glissando of doom.The hope drains from June’s eyes. Elisabeth Moss can say more with her eyes and her face than most actors can with 1,000 words. It is 10 minutes before she makes her first utterance, but in that time she displays hope, dread, defiance, defeat and strength again. She says very little in the whole episode (mostly in the flashbacks), yet she is mesmerising.June is pulled out by guards with snarling dogs. She – and the other handmaids – are muzzled and herded along a tunnel. What hell is this where the dogs are not muzzled, but women are? Well, Gilead. Fenway Park, to be specific, home to the Boston Red Sox a place of recreation in happier times. Now? A place of execution. Like Afghanistan under the Taliban, Iran, Guinea in 2009, Chile after Pinochet’s coup in 1973 ... the death knell resonates with reality and with history.A massive scaffold has been erected and a row of nooses are lined up. One is placed over each handmaid’s head, as This Woman’s Work by Kate Bush is played. It is one of those moments in this show that somehow manage to find beauty in the darkest trauma.It turns out to be a mock execution, a lesson to be learned. Aunt Lydia (Ann Dowd on song) shows up with her interpretation of the Christian message and her instruction to love God. “Walk with him and fear him and cleave unto him and you shall obey his word and the word of his servants here on Earth.”Finally, June speaks, offering her own prayer – in her head, at least. “Our Father, who art in heaven. Seriously? What the actual fuck!” It is a moment to gasp for air – of levity, even – and a reminder that humanity still exists. Because the opening is about as intense a TV experience as it is possible to have. I felt it physically, a tightness in the stomach.And that is not the end of it. After the first flashback, to a decision by June and Luke to try for a second child, it is straight back to the nightmare of the present. Aunt Lydia has the handmaids kneeling in the rain, holding rocks out in front as punishment for refusing to stone Janine to death. Filmed from above, it is more beautifully choreographed horror. Janine, incidentally, is on her way to the Colonies. We – the series – will be going, too. And further back, before Gilead, to see how it came about.The first flashback is not all about love and the joy of further procreation. There are warning signs of what is to come. Taking the pill is not a woman’s decision Luke has to sign off on it. “It’s ridiculous,” he says, casually, before signing. Next time – if they had not decided to stop – he would probably have said nothing and signed. There it is, the creeping normalisation.In the next flashback, June is getting a hard time for not picking up her daughter from school the moment she felt ill … for having a job, basically abandoning her child and her duties for her selfish pursuits. In the final flashback, it has begun to kick off: shooting from the gallery in the Capitol building, an explosion in the White House. You are left wondering just how big a leap it is from the Handmaid’s Tale flashbacks to the actual present.It may have been best to leave the show at one season, with Margaret Atwood, open-ended, a hint of better things to come. And with no chance of it becoming diluted or losing the plot. But that was never going to happen – successful doesn’t walk away from an audience.This is next best, exploring not only forward, but backwards, looking at how it came about. No dilution or loss of plot yet, in an extraordinary first episode that will ring on in your nightmares like Aunt Lydia’s bell. Also, think about what has happened since the first series: #MeToo, mass shootings, you-know-who still in the White House, an abortion referendum in Ireland this week … dong, dong, dong, dong. It is not just Aunt Lydia’s bell that continues to chime. While The Handmaid’s Tale continues to be relevant, it needs to be told. Praise be."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d9b4d79a8de1d26e0cd3cef089b24979d0b8d85d/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=963a4aaa5e68eed17e5d678cfb66c00c","title":"brexit tv is it too soon to make great drama out of the eu referendum","story":"The most isive topic of recent British history is being adapted for the small screen – but the best political TV often comes years after the eventChannel 4 is to make a Brexit drama starring Benedict Cumberbatch, who will play Dominic Cummings, the former government special adviser who helped lead the leave campaign to victory. The broadcaster cannot be accused of being anything less than topical: although the referendum took place almost two years ago, the ifs and buts of EU withdrawal are, if anything, less settled than they were in 2016.The question is not whether it is too late to make a topical drama out of Brexit, but whether it is too soon. The vote may have taken place, but in many ways it is still being contested. The terms under which Britain will leave the EU have yet to be negotiated and the Electoral Commission is still investigating whether the leave campaign breached the referendum spending limit. When dramatising recent events, topicality is the point and there is merit in being first. Casting yesterday’s news as narrative history requires a measure of audacity, which in turn creates a stir. But there is also a freedom that comes with being patient. When drama and real life are too proximate, they have to compete. A Very English Scandal, the first episode of which aired on Sunday on BBC One, waited more than 40 years to revisit the Jeremy Thorpe scandal. The main advantages are clear: almost all the people caught up in those events are now dead (Norman Scott being the exception) and thus unable to raise objections. Younger viewers will come to the TV series not knowing the details of the original story. The Crown is busy relitigating history going even further back, in a way that certainly would not have been possible at the time, or even decades afterwards. When dramatising more recent events, timing is crucial, even if it is often more a matter of luck than anything else. Although Peter Morgan’s The Deal was written nearly 10 years after the 1994 Labour leadership battle it sought to dramatise, the story might have been rendered obsolete if, as some predicted, Brown had taken over from Blair by the time it aired in 2003 (he had not Blair hung on for another four years). Channel 4’s Brexit project is due to be broadcast next year, just before Britain leaves the EU. What if things change? At this point, one could hardly describe the Brexit negotiations as being on schedule. Imagine having to reckon with that timetable. That is one of the difficulties with a true political tale: you are stuck with what happens. The story may change, or it may outrun your script, or it may get old quick. Fictional representations of politics can better mirror political realities – or sometimes even anticipate them, the way The Thick of It and Veep seemed to do. None of these difficulties will matter much if Channel 4’s Brexit drama is good and there is no reason to think it won’t be. The real problem may lie not with those it portrays, but with its audience. Brexit is an extremely isive issue, the debate still bad-tempered and raw. At this stage, it seems unlikely that peace will have broken out in a year’s time. Accusations of bias dog every bit of reporting on Brexit, for and against. That is not the ideal atmosphere for the launch of a narrative account that, while it owes its audience and its subjects fairness and honesty, ought to have no business with impartiality. Drama needs to take a stand, if not a side.There is an obvious need for a Brexit TV drama that puts the whole sorry business into perspective for leavers and remainers. I am just not sure I am ready to watch it yet. Are you?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1d0edabeeafb4017e0c94ac8339f32bd63fd5a88/0_445_772_463/master/772.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9086f74e9a71124778ddf2e3ea6310e1","title":"chelsea owner roman abramovich is without a uk visa","story":"Russian billionaire’s visa ran out weeks ago and it is unclear whether he will get a new oneRoman Abramovich’s UK visa has expired and British authorities have not yet issued him with a new one, according to Russian media reports and people who know the businessman.The Russian oligarch and owner of Chelsea football club, who is the 13th richest person in Britain with a net worth of £9.3bn, according to the Sunday Times, held an entrepreneurial visa to the UK that expired several weeks ago. He has filed for a new visa, but has not yet been granted one, and it is not clear if or when he will be.Abramovich was not seen at Saturday’s FA Cup final at Wembley, which ended in a 1-0 victory for Chelsea over Manchester United.A person who knows Abramovich said he had not been denied a visa, but that it was taking longer than usual to renew and it was unclear why.A representative for Abramovich declined to comment on the reports, calling it a personal matter. Anglo-Russian relations have been strained since the double poisoning of the former Russian secret agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter in Salisbury in March. The UK expelled 23 Russian diplomats from the country in March, leading to a tit-for-tat expulsion by Russia later that month.Russia shut down the activities of the British Council, which promotes cultural programmes between the two countries, and Britain’s consulate-general in St Petersburg. The prime minister, Theresa May, also said the government would look more closely at Russian investments in the UK.The home secretary, Amber Rudd, said in March that the government would look retrospectively at Tier 1 visas, those given to applicants who want to open businesses in Britain and have at least £50,000 in investment funds, like the one Abramovich held. Nearly 700 Russians came to Britain between 2008 and 2015 on such visas.The delay in Abramovich’s visa was first reported by the Russian news agency the Bell, which wrote on Sunday that it had expired three weeks ago and that his private Boeing 767 last travelled to London on 1 April. The report cited three people who know Abramovich.A second person who knows him told the  the report “looked correct”, but emphasised that the Russian businessman had not yet received a firm answer from British authorities.The UK security minister Ben Wallace said: “We do not routinely comment on inidual cases.”Abramovich bought Chelsea in 2003 and has helped bankroll the club during a period of unprecedented success, including five league titles. He regularly attends the club’s matches at Wembley and was seen at previous cup finals.Once considered Russia’s richest man, he said in a British court in 2011 that he had an extravagant lifestyle, including properties in London and France and the luxury 533ft super-yacht Eclipse.The Russian, who does not hold UK residency, owns a £90m home in Kensington Palace Gardens, nicknamed Billionaires’ Row.He owns Evraz, Russia’s largest steelmaker, and the metals producer Norilsk Nickel. He made his fortune in the 1990s in oil and gas in a period when state assets were privatised and sold off to a number of businessmen who made fantastic fortunes. Abramovich sold his stake in the oil firm Sibneft to the state-controlled gas group Gazprom for £7.4bn in 2005, increasing the Kremlin’s control over the country’s energy assets.His stake in the company became the subject of a £2bn lawsuit in a British court. Boris Berezovsky, a once-powerful businessman who lived in self-imposed exile under Putin, sued Abramovich in 2008 over claims that he was forced to sell his shares in Sibneft under the threat of violence. Berezovsky lost the case in 2012.While Berezovsky fell foul of the Kremlin under Vladimir Putin, Abramovich has maintained good relations with the Russian government. He served as governor, and then as the chair of the legislature in the remote Russian region of Chukotka. He helped build infrastructure at the 2014 Sochi Olympics that became an important prestige project for the Kremlin.A judge in the Berezovsky lawsuit ruling said that while Abramovich “enjoyed very good relations with Putin and others in power at the Kremlin”, he did not have enough influence to “pull the presidential strings”.He was named on a list of Russian oligarchs supposedly linked to Putin released by the US Treasury Department earlier this year. But the list was ridiculed as a carbon copy of the Forbes list of all Russians worth more than $1bn.

In one, a Weibo user, referring to Donald Trump, said: “The madman won.” Another deleted post said China’s bid to get US sanctions lifted on the telecommunications equipment maker ZTE had been unsuccessful. “The other points of compromise – or kneeling, to put it more sharply – are small matters,” the user wrote, according to the project.On Saturday, Beijing and Washington released a statement saying they had come to a consensus of “effective measures” to narrow the US’s huge trade deficit with China.It was not clear exactly why the comments were censored. “One reason might be that the authorities are keen to tone down any suggestion of having been forced into concessions,” David Bandurski, co-director of the China Media Project, wrote in a blogpost. “Another reason might be the impulse to offset language that seems to suggest bilateral trade is not, as China now likes to say, ‘win-win.’”Qiu Yi, a former politician with Taiwan’s pro-Beijing Kuomintang party and a professor at the Chinese Culture University in Taiwan and Shanghai Jiaotong University, said his comments on the talks had been deleted within an hour of him posting them.Chinese officials on Monday were keen to show Beijing had stood firm in the talks. A researcher for China’s commerce ministry said in an interview that the country had demonstrated three “bottom lines”: it would not cut exports to the US in order to reduce the trade deficit, no target was set for reducing the deficit – Trump had previously pushed for a $200bn reduction, and China upheld its right to upgrade its industry. The White House’s threatened tariffs had targeted Beijing’s “Made in China” industrial programme.“Despite all the pressure, China didn’t ‘fold’, as US President Donald Trump observed,” the state-run China Daily said in an English-language editorial. “Instead, it stood firm and continually expressed its willingness to talk.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/63d7d4e98231e58911ed079b4e2051be70824765/0_19_5459_3276/master/5459.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f640ecac62fb16a9757c63d02450f927","title":"eu blocking cities efforts to curb airbnb say campaigners","story":"Commission is hypnotised by ‘sharing economy’ and not seeing its downside, says researcherThe explosive rise of short-stay Airbnb holiday rentals may be shutting locals out of housing and changing neighbourhoods across Europe, but cities’ efforts to halt it are being stymied by EU policies to promote the “sharing economy”, campaigners say.“It’s pretty clear,” said Kenneth Haar, author of UnfairBnB, a study published this month by the Brussels-based campaign group Corporate Europe Observatory. “Airbnb is under a lot of pressure locally across Europe, and they’re trying to use the top-down power of the EU institutions to fight back.”While it might have started as a “community” of amateur hosts offering spare rooms or temporarily vacant homes to travellers, Airbnb had seen three-digit growth in several European cities since 2014 and was now a big, powerful corporation with the lobbying clout to match, Haar said.“You can still find the pensioner renting out her spare room for a bit of extra cash,” Haar said. “But a very substantial proportion are commercial operators, often with multiple listings, making big bucks. It’s clearly having an impact on locals’ access to affordable housing, and it’s pretty hard to see it as a sharing economy.”In Paris, registration for short-term lettings is now mandatory Barcelona has suspended all new short-term rental permits Amsterdam has cut its permitted short-term lettings limit from two months a year to one and Berlin has brought back old laws and adapted them to new circumstances.But local attempts to protect residents’ access to affordable housing and preserve the face of city-centre neighbourhoods are being undermined, campaigners say, by the EU’s determination to see the “collaborative economy” as a key future driver of innovation and job creation across the bloc.“The commission seems almost hypnotised by the prospect of a strong sharing economy, and not really interested in its negative consequences,” said Haar. “Commissioners talk about ‘opportunities, not threats’. The parliament, too, recently condemned cities’ attempts to restrict lettings on online platforms.”Since 50-odd platforms, led by Airbnb, urged the commission two years ago to ensure “local laws do not unnecessarily limit the development of the collaborative economy to the detriment of Europeans”, two key EU directives, on e-commerce and services, had been clarified – largely in the industry’s favour, Haar said.Airbnb has welcomed the guidance, saying the commission is trying to provide “clear, simple and consistent” rules that “remove barriers to regular people benefiting from innovations like Airbnb”.Most worryingly for campaigners such as Haar, a formal complaint against Barcelona, Berlin, Paris and Brussels filed by the European Holiday Home Association, of which Airbnb and HomeAway are leading members, alleges “overzealous rules and restrictionsbans” in violation of EU laws. If not resolved by the commission and member states, the complaint could end up at the European court of justice.“Cities have to respond to local pressures, and they need to somehow recapture the legal space to do that,” said Haar. “Decision-makers in Brussels seem far removed from local realities. If we want to defend our right to affordable housing, this battle has to be fought now.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/700aaed5bc224d3d08ad7bccdece728e43c84732/0_233_4943_2965/master/4943.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=422a230aaee98876e1647a74d8f0d20e","title":"germany to roll out mass holding centres for asylum seekers","story":"‘Anchor’ camps will undermine country’s reputation for being welcoming, say criticsMass holding centres that Germany’s interior ministry wants to roll out across the country will stoke social tension between locals and migrants and undermine the welcoming image the country has gained in the eyes of the world, aid organisations have said.So-called anchor centres – an acronym for arrival, decision, return – are designed to speed up deportations of unsuccessful asylum seekers, by containing large groups of people and the authorities who rule on their claims inside the same holding facility.Until now, Germany’s policy has been to embed new arrivals in communities across the country. But Angela Merkel’s government is seeking to reverse its strategy, as a populist backlash builds against the chancellor’s handling of the refugee crisis. “We all know how difficult it is to deport people without protected status after they have been spread out across the country and put down roots in our cities and communities,” the interior minister, Horst Seehofer, told the German parliament last week.“In the future the end of an asylum application will coincide with the start of the deportation procedure,” said the leader of the CSU and former Bavarian state premier, adding that he wanted to see states set up the new centres this autumn.But the transit centre in Seehofer’s home state that is meant to work as a prototype for the scheme has experienced high crime rates, mass protests and rising tensions between asylum seekers and security forces, the  found during a visit to the Max-Immelmann barracks in Manching.The converted army compound is part of a complex outside Ingolstadt, Upper Bavaria, that holds about 1,100 people, mainly from the west Balkans, Ukraine, Nigeria and Afghanistan.“It is like a prison,” said Lucky Raphael, 24, from Nigeria, who said inmates were not allowed to lock their rooms, cook their own food, or go outside to seek work or attend school. “We can go outside, but always in the fear that we could be arrested,” said Raphael, who said he left his home country because of his dire economic and social circumstances, and arrived in Bavaria via Italy.Raphael said had been living in the Manching transit centre for 11 months, though authorities say the average length of stay for people who have arrived here since September 2015 is four-and-a-half months.Bavarian authorities hope to speed up the checking process with technology. They analyse metadata on smartphones and run speech samples through a “voice geometry” programme to determine the travel route and ethnic background of applicants who do not have passports.They are reacting to an increasingly heated political debate about Germany’s failure to deport asylum seekers whose applications have been rejected. Anis Amri, a Tunisian who in December 2016 killed 12 people by driving a truck into a crowd at a Berlin Christmas market, had been rejected but not deported. In 2017, about half a million unsuccessful asylum seekers remained in the country.Anchor centres “send out a signal to people who have low chances of being allowed to stay,” said Daniel Waidelich of the Upper Bavarian government. “It’s not worth coming to Germany, because your claim is processed very quickly here.” Since September 2015, the centre in Manching has carried out 1,000 deportations, while 2,500 inmates have left voluntarily.Critics say the new centres create an absurd double-bind on those inmates at the transit centres who have realistic chances of being granted asylum: while they are actively hindered from integrating into German society while their application is pending, they are expected to immediately integrate as soon as they get the all-clear.“Integration is like a four-legged table,” said Willi Dräxler of the Catholic aid charity Caritas, which has four people doing regular voluntary work at Manching. “Language, contacts in the local community, a job and a home are all vital ingredients. If you saw off one leg, the table is going to wobble. Within these transit centres, however, integration isn’t happening at all.”Inside the centres, frustration with long waits often boils over. “We are not told why we are here,” said Kelvi Batin, also from Nigeria. “It would be better if they told us straight away when we arrived that we cannot stay”.While Manching has not seen incidents like the one at a centre in Ellwangen, Baden–Württemberg, where 200 asylum seekers tried prevent the deportation of one inmate, police have to intervene at the compound on a daily basis. In 2017 the police were called 355 times to the Manching transit centre complex.During a recent media tour of the premises, a group of Nigerians staged an impromptu protest, chanting “We want our freedom” and holding up handmade signs reading: “We’re tired of living in camps. Please, we need transfer.”Dräxler said: “Protests about seemingly small issues like food are often actually protests about the conditions in these centres as a whole. The main source of troubles is that the people inside have no perspective and aren’t allowed to work.”The inability of the migrants inside the centre to engage themselves in the community was also stoking resentment and prejudice among the local population, said Gabriele Störkle of the Caritas centre in Pfaffenhofen. “These transit centres are like black boxes the local population isn’t allowed to go inside, so they project all their greatest fear into what is going on inside them.”“Three years ago, Germany was globally admired for its welcoming culture – the pictures from train stations in Munich travelled around the world,” said Dräxler. “What has happened to that culture? Now there is only fear of refugees.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a05cd4c489f6b8494e5ca7b600ebe4090123bca8/0_270_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9677fc644fed07e90a366db00d3cbd4c","title":"italy populist coalition set to name political novice as pm nominee","story":"Leaders of Five Star Movement and far right League expected to nominate to Giuseppe Conte at meeting with presidentThe leaders of the Five Star Movement and the far-right League are to announce their nominee to be prime minister of Italy’s first populist government at a meeting with the president.Italian press reports suggest Giuseppe Conte, 54, a lawyer and M5S member, is to take the job after Matteo Salvini, the leader of the League, and the M5S leader Luigi Di Maio, ruled themselves out.The parties will also present their cabinet lineup and government programme to the president, Sergio Mattarella.Speaking on Sunday, Salvini said: “We have agreed on the head and ministers and hope that nobody will veto a choice that represents the will of the majority of Italians.”He had reiterated a day earlier that the prime minister would be neither Di Maio nor himself, but “a professional who contributed to the drafting of the contract”.Conte, relatively unknown in the political world, is a law professor at the University of Florence. He is Di Maio’s personal lawyer and the mastermind behind the anti-establishment party’s pledge to abolish more than 400 “useless laws” that it claims will cut bureaucracy and free up the economy. He also said during the election campaign that Italy’s anti-corruption laws needed to be tightened and major school changes introduced.The professor, originally from the southern region of Puglia, was previously aligned to the left before joining M5S.Meanwhile, Salvini is tipped to be named Italy’s next interior minister and Di Maio minister of labour.Mattarella will need to ratify the choice of prime minister, the proposed programme of policies and cabinet lineup before a government can be sworn in.

The government’s lax approach was putting money into the hands of regimes opposed to the UK, the report by the foreign affairs select committee says, and accuses ministers of failing to live up to tough rhetoric in the wake of the Salisbury poisoning affair. The committee chair, Tory MP Tom Tugendhat, says the UK can no longer allow a “business as usual” approach to the Kremlin. “The scale of damage that this ‘dirty money’ can do to UK foreign policy interests dwarfs the benefit of Russian transactions in the City,” he says. Our investigative team has produced this very handy guide to explain, by way of Breaking Bad and the Paradise Papers, all you need to know about money laundering.‘She will deliver’ – The cabinet’s cold war over Brexit goes on after a thinly veiled threat from Boris Johnson to Theresa May that she has to deliver a deal that takes Britain out of the customs union. On a trip to Artgentina, the foreign secretary said he was confident the prime minister “will deliver” a deal that keeps the Brexiters happy and avoids what would be a doomsday scenario for them of having to remain in the customs union beyond 2020 – the so-called “backstop” solution. Jacob Rees Mogg, the leader of backbench hardliners, has described this outcome in suitably biblical terms as “perpetual purgatory”. But Johnson, in an outward display of loyalty, says his boss must be given “time and space to negotiate this Brexit vision”. Our columnist Nesrine Malik, meanwhile, says Jeremy Corbyn must show some leadership on Brexit – hard, soft, whatever, just some leadership.Trump trashing – Back to Russia, or at least its tentacles, and Donald Trump’s never-ending imbroglio over the investigation into his campaign’s alleged links to the Kremlin. On Sunday the US president lashed out at the New York Times for reporting that his oldest son and other aides met in August 2016 with a representative of two Gulf states offering to help the Trump campaign. Those people are now cooperating with Robert Mueller’s investigation, the report said. Trump earlier said he was asking the justice department to examine the possibility that the FBI had infiltrated his campaign.Rough justice – Vulnerable homeless people are being punished by the courts and even imprisoned for begging and rough sleeping, according to a  investigation. More than 50 local authorities have targeted homeless people with public space protection orders (PSPOs). Examples include a man jailed for four months for breaching a criminal behaviour order for begging in Gloucester and another who was fined £105 after a child dropped £2 in his sleeping bag.Cougar attack – The horrifying story of the mountain biker mauled to death by a cougar in Washington state prompted questions about what the man and his friend could have done to avoid the attack. But police have said the men did everything right by getting off their bikes and making a lot of noise when they realised the lion was following them on the remote Cascade mountains track. Although the animal was chased off initially, it returned and dragged one of the men to his death. “Something was wrong with this cougar,” police said.You really didn’t think the briefing was going to miss out on the royal wedding did you? As Windsor begins its mighty cleanup, the Duchess of Sussex (aka Suits star Meghan Markle) has announced her arrival with a profile on the in-laws’ family website. “I’m proud to be a woman and a feminist,” it says, and tells us that she has been interested in social issues from an early age helped by stints as a volunteer in the soup kitchens of her native Los Angeles. And in case you missed it, Hadley Freeman invokes the John Goodman film King Ralph to argue that the duchess could be just the right American that the royal family needs.Gary Cahill, the Chelsea captain, has urged the club’s board to end the uncertainty surrounding Antonio Conte’s future at Stamford Bridge after leading his team to victory in the FA Cup final. A year after Alexander Zverev announced his arrival in the big time by crushing Novak Djokovic to win the Italian Open, the young German held his own but not his crown as Rafael Nadal outlasted him to win his eighth title in Rome. Meanwhile, the women’s world No 1, Simona Halep, collapsed spectacularly in her rematch with Elina Svitolina to hand the Ukrainian a second Italian Open title. England’s rugby World Cup preparations have been thrown into turmoil with their defence coach, Paul Gustard, leaving Eddie Jones’s coaching staff to join Harlequins.

The day of a beautiful victory - of a truly popular victory,” Maduro shouted.Tibisay Lucena, the head of Venezuela’s electoral commission, told reporters Maduro had received more than 5.8m votes compared to the 1.8m of his nearest rival, Henri Falcón.  As results came out, Maduro supporters reportedly let off fireworks in poor Caracas neighbourhoods and danced to Latin pop around the downtown Miraflores presidential palace.But even before Maduro’s victory speech, domestic opponents and much of the international community were denouncing the election as a “fraud foretold”. Henri Falcón claimed widespread vote buying and electoral irregularities meant the election was “illegitimate”. “We do not regonize this electoral process as valid,” he told reporters. “As far as we are concerned there has been no election. There must be new elections in Venezuela.” “All Venezuelans know what happened today,” tweeted Henrique Capriles, who narrowly lost to Maduro in the 2013 election and was subsequently barred from running again. “Our beloved Venezuela must have truly free and democratic elections where the will of our People is reflected in the result.”Luz Mely Reyes, a prominent Venezuelan journalist, tweeted: “Today is a sad day for democracy. The government clings on and manipulates, the opposition is ided and lacking a strategy. And voters are without guides or leadership.”The United States’ mission to the United Nations indicated it would reject the result. “Today’s so-called election in Venezuela is an insult to democracy ... It’s time for Maduro to go,” it tweeted.The president of Chile, Sebastián Piñera, said that his country, “like the majority of democratic countries”, would not recognise the vote. “Venezuela’s elections do not meet the minimum standards for a true democracy. They are not clean or legitimate elections and they do not represent the free and sovereign will of the Venezuelan people,” Piñera wrote.“You have put your trust in me and I will pay back this infinite, loving trust,” he said. To cries of “Vamos, Nico!”, Maduro added: “Today I love the Venezuelan people more than ever before!” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/762365d533459b490c594fcf4d1bff0b849353b2/0_0_6346_3806/master/6346.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=85cd6c87ff1695c4ff720c333984561f","title":"sanja matsuri festival yakuza day in pictures","story":"Sanja Matsuri festival is a celebration of the three legendary founders of Sensoji Temple in the Asakusa neighbourhood, with nearly two million people visiting during the three-day event.

Photograph: Trevor McBride. “When I’m in Muff we pray for the President, and when I’m in Culmore we pray for the Queen.”For Archdeacon Robert Miller, that is the only difference between his parish in Donegal and his three in Derry.The rector of Christ Church, St Peter’s and Culmore in Derry City, and Muff in Co Donegal, Archdeacon Miller laughs at the idea of having an “international ministry” given the cross-Border nature of his work.With Brexit looming, he admits there is uncertainty among some in his parishes around what may come, but he says that for the church “the Border doesn’t really exist”.“I have joked that I hope I won’t need my passport to go to Muff on a Sunday morning,” he says, “but the reality is that we’ve been here before with Border checkpoints and crossings and during that time Muff and Culmore related and worked together, so I would be hopeful that whatever happens, we’ll manage.”Culmore is about 3km from Muff. The journey between the two takes less than five minutes and only the changing road signs and a poster erected by the Border Communities Against Brexit campaign group, marking the Border’s location, suggest that you have moved from Northern Ireland to the Republic.There may be complications down the line if a political agreement on Brexit is not reached but Archdeacon Miller says the Church of Ireland existed long before there was any Border.“We predate partition, and the reality then was that the Church of Ireland had to negotiate something that was imposed upon it and which put a Border between some of its dioceses,” says Archdeacon Miller.“But the Church of Ireland is a church of the whole island, and whilst obviously we acknowledge the secular way in which the island is ided, the Church of Ireland operates as a whole-island church.“If you talk to people they’ll say that the reality of the matter is that at partition a line was drawn on a map – and especially during the Troubles things were very, very difficult – but the relationships existed and persisted.”Archdeacon Miller ministers to about 330 families across the four parishes. He says his responsibility is to provide pastoral support for his parishioners throughout the challenges posed by Brexit.“I don’t do down the uncertainty, because certainly for people who are farming, or people whose business causes them to go back and forth across the Border, or even those who work in one or both of the currencies and then have to cross the Border, all of this causes uncertainty for them,” he says.“Each generation will have its own challenge, and in some ways our challenge is Brexit.”The archdeacon says that while it is not the church’s role to have an opinion on Brexit, its responsibility is to react to people’s concerns.“In terms of peacebuilding, you’re always aware that a change in the status quo at the minute could be a difficult thing,” he says. “For people who have lived on the Border for 40-plus years of troubles, that would be a concern if there was an attempt to reimpose it, but it does seem that it will be a soft Border.”Negotiations move to phase II after agreement reached on protecting the rights of citizens in both UK \u0026amp EU, Northern Ireland and the financial settlement of the orce"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3502193.1526838811!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"voters in north would support remain more strongly in second referendum","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe survey was carried out for the Economic and Social Research Council which is funding the UK in a Changing Europe project.  Photograph: Stefan RousseauPA Wire People in Northern Ireland would vote more strongly to remain in the European Union if another Brexit referendum was held, a new study suggests.A total of 69 per cent would favour remaining if there was another vote compared to the 56 per cent who voted to stay in the union in June 2016, the survey by the UK in a Changing Europe project found.Catholic respondents were much more likely to support a united Ireland if there was a “hard exit” in which the UK left the customs union and single market.Some 28 per cent of Catholics would vote for a united Ireland if the UK changed its mind and remained in the EU while 53 per cent of Catholics would vote for a united Ireland if there was a hard exit in which the UK left the customs union and single market.The Irish Border is one of the most difficult questions facing negotiators who aim to strike a deal by the autumn ahead of the UK’s withdrawal from the EU next year.Brendan O’Leary, Lauder Professor of Political Science at the University of Pennsylvania, who also holds a visiting position at Queen’s University Belfast (QUB), said: “The proportion wanting to Remain has risen since the 2016 referendum as more people have become aware of the possible costs and inconveniences of leaving the EU, as citizens and as employees or employers.”The survey was carried out for the Economic and Social Research Council which is funding the UK in a Changing Europe project. It said it provided an authoritative, non-partisan and impartial reference point for those looking for information, insights and analysis about UK-EU relations that stands aside from politics surrounding the debate.Some 61 per cent of the North’s population favoured the UK as a whole remaining in the customs union and single market.The survey also found there were strong expectations that protests against checks at the Irish Border or between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK would quickly become violent.Meanwhile, a British government working group including Brexit secretary David Davis, business secretary Greg Clark and Northern secretary Karen Bradley visited Belfast yesterday for what was described as a “customs fact-finding mission”.A statement from the Department for Exiting the European Union said the visit was “part of their working group exploring potential future customs arrangements, focusing on the proposed Highly Streamlined Customs Arrangements”.The department said the working group met representatives from the freight industry, cross-Border businesses and community stakeholders to “further explore how the highly-streamlined customs model could address the unique circumstances of Northern Ireland”.

Photograph:  Massimo PercossiANSA via APItaly’s anti-establishment Five Star Movement and League parties will seek the backing of the president on Monday for a prime minister to lead a government whose plans to raise spending are roiling financial markets. Eleven weeks after an inconclusive election, the rival parties are poised to put forward a prime minister whose programme – agreed last week – calls for billions of euro in tax cuts, additional spending on welfare for the poor, and a roll-back of pension reforms. While the premier’s name has not been confirmed, Italian media say the leading candidate is a little-known university professor, Giuseppe Conte, who is not a lawmaker, but was proposed as a possible minister by Five Star before the vote. President Sergio Mattarella has the final say on who becomes premier. If he should give his blessing after the meetings, the parties could put cabinet together rapidly and hold confidence votes in parliament later this week. Italian bond yields rose sharply on Monday on fears the government will go on a spending spree that will increase an already huge debt pile and put it on a collision course with European Union fiscal rules. Markets were also hammered last week when the two parties presented their government plans. But Italians appear to favour the tie-up. Some 60 per cent of Italians are in favour of a Five StarLeague coalition government, a Demos \u0026amp Pi poll published on Sunday showed. More than 80 per cent of Five Star and League voters back it, the poll said. The likely prime minister candidate, the Mr Conte (54), was put forward before the election as Five Star’s possible pick as public administration minister. He is seen as a compromise candidate, a technocrat who can balance the demands of the rival parties. Mr Conte has worked as a lawyer as well as an academic, and has studied for brief spells at Yale, New York University, Cambridge and other foreign universities. Five Star leader Luigi Di Maio and League leader Matteo Salvini will feature in the cabinet, according to newspapers. Mr Di Maio is tipped to become the labour and welfare minister to ensure the passage of the movement’s cornerstone election promise, a universal income for the poor. Mr Salvini, on the other hand, is expected to take over the interior ministry, which handles immigration issues. The arrival of more than 600,000 boat migrants on Italians shores over four years fuelled the anti-immigrant League’s popularity, catapulting it over Silvio Berlusconi’s Forza Italia on the right. More than one name circulated for the key economy ministry portfolio. Paolo Savona, an 81-year-old economist and former industry minister, was mentioned for the most, but Mr Salvini’s top adviser Giancarlo Giorgetti could also get the job, newspapers said. –

Today, with their salaries decimated by an economic collapse, their clothes hang off them uneasily, their bones protruding.As Venezuela prepares for fresh polls on Sunday, much of the population like the Perez twins are increasingly destitute and hopeless as they endure an economic crisis that seems to plumb new depths with every new day.“We don’t plan to vote and we’re not interested in elections,” said Lamski. “What we need is food.” As a country that relies almost exclusively on oil income for export revenue, the dramatic drop in global oil prices sparked Venezuela’s downward spiral in 2015 but in its path it revealed a political system rife with corruption and a socialist production system decimated by government interference and mismanagement.Just this week Kellogg\u0027s became the latest multinational to announce it would close its operations in the country, fed up with complicated price controls and shortages of raw materials.Boxes of corn flakes made by Kellogg are seen on a shelf inside a local shop in Caracas, where basic foods and other good are regularly A recent study conducted by several of the country’s top universities showed that in 2017, the average Venezuelan lost 11 kilograms and that 87 per cent of the country now lives in poverty, compared to only 48 percent who lived in poverty three years ago.Venezuelans who fall ill are met with a collapsing public health system, with most hospitals unable to stock items as simple as gloves. Moreover, the national pharmaceutical association estimates 90 per cent of the drugs needed to treat chronic conditions are unavailable.  “We’re seeing more HIV patients daily catching opportunistic infections, and many are dying,” said Mauricio Gutierrez, an advocate who warns of an AIDS crisis on par with the original 1980s outbreak due to a shortage of life-saving antiretroviral medication.As a freelance nursing assistant and paramedic, the Perez twins’ monthly salaries equate to less than $5 per month. They struggle to buy enough food for two meals daily and Tatsienlu has stopped taking medication for a chronic back injury.“Sometimes we even split an egg between the two of us,” Lamski said.But despite leading his country down an unprecedented economic collapse, President Nicolás Maduro is the favourite to win reelection Sunday, buoyed in part by a population dependent on him to survive the very crisis he helped create.The cost of coffee has jumped over 16,400 per cent in one yearMr Maduro has responded to widespread food and medicine shortages by creating a system of food handouts and subsidies on which a majority of the population now depends. On Sunday he will leverage those benefits to get out the vote. Central to the government’s new system of subsidies is an identification card known as “Fatherland Cards,” which Mr Maduro introduced in 2017. Venezuelans use the cards to receive periodic cash bonuses, sometimes spontaneously announced by Mr Maduro at political rallies, and sometimes to register for and receive food handouts.On Sunday they’ll also be asked to scan those cards outside of polling stations at government campaign tents known as “red spots”.While there’s no evidence to suggest government officials will know how cardholders vote, a running list of those who showed up at the polls will be maintained.  And Mr Maduro has suggested at several rallies that he’s “considering a prize” for those who vote.“The government has essentially created its own clientele,” said Trino Martis, a sociologist at the Central University of Venezuela.  “Public funds will be used for those who show up and vote for them, he added, dismissing the scheme as nothing short of “extortion and blackmail.Mr Maduro has campaigned with his wife Cilia Flores as he rallied his supporters ahead of Sunday\u0026#39s voteBut Mr Maduro will also be favoured thanks to an opposition in disarray, left fractured and squabbling after bloody anti-government protests left over 160 dead last year and mostly failed.  With many of its most popular politicians disqualified, the largest parties have called on supporters to boycott the vote.Instead Mr Maduro will face former governor and socialist party dissident Henri Falcon, along with former evangelical pastor Javier Bertucci. While some polls have given Mr Falcon a slight edge over Maduro, critics say a pro-government electoral board will tilt the results in favor of Mr Maduro.Mr Falcon has railed against the government’s use of Fatherland Cards and “red spots” as a thinly veiled vote-buying scheme. His campaign introduced a formal demand with the country’s supreme court to prevent the system.“This means that public money is being used for something shameful, to buy votes using ‘red spots\u0027,” his campaign manager Claudio Fermin told local paper El Nacional.Javier Bertucci speaks to supporters, during his campaign closing rally. Despite an unexpected surge in support he is unlikely to trouble Mr MadusoBut some government supporters like Jennifer Lizarazo deny Mr Falcon’s claims that the government has leveraged Venezuelan’s hunger to increase vote totals. As a longtime supporter of Mr Maduro and his predecessor Hugo Chavez, Ms Lizarazo sees the Fatherland Cards as another social programme from the government to help the poor.“This has helped me a lot,” she said, scrolling through her cell phone using a government created application showing all of the cash bonuses she has received using the card. “Of course, we should ideally be able to get food in the supermarkets.”She has friends who receive food handouts but vote against Maduro, she said, and government campaigners register the cards just to “keep a control and get people to vote.” For Ms Lizarazo, the claims that those who don’t vote won’t receive food bags is “another opposition media show”.Others like the Perez twins say that they’ve already lost benefits as non-cardholders and longtime government opponents. While their community doesn’t receive government food handouts, they wouldn’t receive them anyway, they said, because they don’t hold Fatherland Cards. Tatisenlu also stopped receiving regular food tickets because of her anti-government stance, she claimed.A dog rests on the ground in a makeshift camp for Venezuelan migrants at Simon Bolivar square in Boa Vista, Rondonia state, BrazilBut despite their weight loss and need for medicines, they have no plans to turn to government programmes or register for the cards.Instead, like many others, they plan to emigrate as soon as they can gather the funds. By some estimates, a million Venezuelans like them have left the country in the past two years to escape the crisis. Neighbouring Colombia has called the influx of Venezuelan refugees the most serious immigration problem it has ever faced.Eldery Alfonzo, who plans to vote for Mr Bertucci, said he’s considering leaving the country with this two small children to join his wife in Chile, who has already emigrated.“We don’t know if our vote really counts or not, but as least in our conscience we know we tried to do something for the country.Protect yourself and your family by learning more about Global Health SecurityPlease review our commenting policyRoyal wedding latest news: Meghan Markle and Prince Harry delay honeymoon to go straight back to workInside the royal wedding evening receptionRoyal wedding guests moved to tears by Prince Charles speech about his \u0026#39darling old Harry\u0026#39Meghan Markle\u0026#39s wedding dress: Clare Waight Keller of Givenchy designs the royal bridal gown of the yearBritish mother jailed in Iran for spying now faces fresh \u0026#39spreading propaganda\u0026#39 chargeMeghan Markle to fight for feminism: New Duchess of Sussex given palace blessing to champion women\u0026#39s rightsSpecial report: Why Ireland\u0026#39s abortion referendum is a matter of life and death for both sidesSafaa Odah: The perils of being a viral Palestinian cartoonist in GazaRoyal wedding latest news: Meghan Markle and Prince Harry delay honeymoon to go straight back to workRoyal protocol goes out the window as celebrity guests reveal wedding secretsMeghan Markle and Prince Harry wedding speeches: The most moving lines and best jokesThe Good Place star Jameela Jamil told she was \u0026#39too old, too ethnic and too fat\u0026#39 for the USSouth Korean women demand equal justice for internet sex crimes amid \u0026#39spy-cam porn epidemic\u0026#39Grenfell inquiry to open with victim tributes after venue changed to prevent survivors being traumatised by Tube journeyMost restaurant diners want calorie counts on the menuCrowded platforms and hour-long wait for trains after new timetable causes commuter chaosHow Nicolás Maduro\u0026#39s implausible election victory could also prove to be his downfallA Very English Scandal, episode 1 review: Hugh Grant is both charming and bone-chilling in this brilliant take on the Thorpe affairBunnies, badgers, and the bizarre truth behind episode one of A Very English Scandal Antony Gormley: Subject, Kettle\u0026#39s Yard review – A highfalutin way to recycle old ideasWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":null,"title":"hawaiis erupting kilauea volcano pictures","story":"Hawaii\u0027s Kilauea volcano spewed ash nearly six miles into the sky on Thursday and scientists predicted that hotter, fresher magma from Kilauea\u0027s summit would run underground and emerge some 25 miles east in the lower Puna district.

This unlikely pair tag-teamed with Huw Edwards (solid, dependable, a bit boring), who appeared to have been on a pre-wedding diet. Sitting side-on to the camera for some strange reason, the newly svelte Welshman couldn’t quite get his autocue-reading right and kept glancing off-screen as if distracted by something more interesting.ITV\u0027s audience peaked with 3.6 million viewers, at a different time to BBC One - just after 2pm.On ITV, coverage - which was fronted by Phillip Schofield and Julie Etchingham - averaged 2.5 million viewers and a 18.6 per cent share between 9.25am and 3pm.The five-minute audience peak on BBC One is the biggest across all channels this year, the broadcaster said.

But he soon could face a far bigger test – maintaining his grip on a country that is fast becoming a failed state.Since Maduro took over from Hugo Chavez – his mentor, who died in 2013 – Venezuela’s crisis has steadily intensified as a result of lower oil prices, corruption and a socialist system plagued with mismanagement. But as Maduro has sought to further consolidate power in the past 12 months, the economy, public services, security and health care have all but collapsed. Armed gangs and Colombian guerrilla groups are operating unchecked on Venezuela’s borders. Pro-government militias are terrorising urban areas, while police stand accused of extrajudicial killings. Four of the 10 most dangerous cities in the world are now in Venezuela, according to a 2017 study by the Igarape Institute, a Brazilian think tank that studies violence.Venezuela halts air and sea traffic with three neighbouring countriesHundreds if not thousands of members of the armed forces are deserting, in part due to meagre rations, according to military analysts.Power and water grids and the transportation systems are breaking down. In just the first three months of the year, Venezuela suffered over 7,000 blackouts.Saddled with a soaring inflation rate that has put food out of reach, weakened and thin Venezuelans are falling ill. Doctors say cases of diseases once thought largely eradicated – malaria, diphtheria, measles and tuberculosis – are not only resurfacing but surging. A child stands in front of water containers in Guarenas, VenezuelaIn a nation that lives off oil, production is collapsing as plants break down and the bankrupt government cannot fix equipment. Venezuela’s unpaid creditors are beginning to tighten the financial noose, moving to attach the country’s offshore assets. At the state oil giant, 25,000 workers – more than a quarter of its staff – quit last year in a mass exodus. Fleeing workers are joining a flood of humanity, at least 5,000 people a day, exiting the country. The outflow has left schools without teachers, hospitals without doctors and nurses, and utilities without electricians and engineers. “A failed state is one that cannot meet the most basic functions of government,” says Jean Paul Leidenz, an economist at Ecoanalitica, a Caracas-based analytical firm. Leidenz continues: “Venezuela now certainly has that characteristic.” Buses have become scarce along a Guarenas roadDuring a campaign stop in the eastern Guayana City on Wednesday, Maduro conceded his government “had made mistakes”. But he blamed the country’s crisis mostly on outside forces and domestic enemies and proclaimed the nation’s socialist revolution would see Venezuela through to better days.“Thanks to the social system created by the revolution, the people are protected and prepared,” he says. “We have a lot more to do, and that’s why we need victory.”In her cement block home in eastern Caracas, Zulay Perez, 63, walked into her kitchen and turned on the tap. “See? Nothing,” she says. “No water. No water at all.”For Venezuelans like Perez – the wife of a factory worker – life was never easy. But in the past, she says, the couple would get running water at least a few days each month. This year, they have had water once – and even then for just a few hours. The shortages have spread in 2018, reaching into middle-class and wealthy neighbourhoods, prompting hundreds of spontaneous, if small, protests.Venezuela\u0027s Maduro bids to be new ‘Christ of the poor’ with help from ‘Hand of God’Venezuela\u0027s Maduro bids to be new ‘Christ of the poor’ with help from ‘Hand of God’Argentina\u0027s football legend Diego Maradona takes part in the closing rally of the electoral campaign of Venezuelan acting President Acting Venezuelan president Nicolas Maduro greeting his supporters during his campaign closing act in Cabimas, VenezuelaVenezuela\u0027s opposition leader and presidential candidate Henrique Capriles speaks to supporters during a campaign rally in Caracas Supporters of Henrique Capriles RandonskiSupporters of opposition presidential candidate Henrique Capriles cheer during a campaign rally in Merida, VenezuelaSupporters of  Venezuelan acting President and presidential candidate Nicolas Maduro wear a moustache during his closing campaign rally in CaracasVenezuela\u0027s acting President Nicolas Maduro holds his grandson as he stands with his family on stageSupporters of Venezuelan opposition candidate for  president, Henrique Capriles Radonski, cheer during his campaign closing act in BarquisimetoA portrait of the late Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez is held by a supporter of  Venezuelan acting President and presidential candidate Nicolas Maduro during his closing campaign rally in CaracasVenezuela\u0027s acting President Nicolas Maduro greets supporters holding Cuba\u0027s and Venezula\u0027s flags with during his closing campaign rally in Caracas, VenezuelaVenezuela\u0027s opposition candidate, Henrique Capriles, holds a dove as a sign of peace during a campaign rally in BarquisimetoAn Henrique Capriles\u0027 supporter holds a dove besides a photo of the candidate during a campaign rally in BarquisimetoSupporters hold a toddler wearing a Maduro-style mustache at the closing campaign rally for Venezuela\u0027s acting President Nicolas Maduro Supporters of opposition presidential candidate Henrique Capriles cheer for him at his closing campaign rally in BarquisimetoA supporter of Venezuelan opposition candidate Henrique Capriles Radonski attends a campaign rally in CaracasVenezuela\u0027s opposition leader and presidential candidate Henrique Capriles greets supporters during a campaign rally Supporters of Venezuela\u0027s ruling party presidential candidate Nicolas Maduro, one dressed as Fidel Castro and the other as Cuban revolutionary hero Ernesto \u0027Che\u0027 Guevara, stand on a bus before the start of Maduro\u0027s closing campaign rally in Caracas, VenezuelaA sign poking fun of ruling party presidential candidate Nicolas Maduro is seen during an opposition campaign rallyA supporter of Venezuelan opposition candidate Henrique Capriles Radonski shows a poster that reads \u0027my mom wants to be your mother-in-law\u0027The government blames a drought, as well as electricity outages partly attributed to sabotage by opposition activists. But community groups say the cause of the damage is more systematic – a combination of corruption, the flight of specialised workers from the country and the difficulty of buying imported spare parts in a nation were the currency is so worthless that you could wallpaper a building with money notes for less than the cost of paint.In past years, Perez says, water would run frequently enough to fill up the big blue tanks the couple keep in a corner. Now she goes outside, to a gutter where stray dogs defecate, to collect water that she boils and uses for cleaning. For drinking and bathing, her husband carries empty bottles to the home of her sister, who has larger cisterns and has been somewhat more fortunate with service.The road to Caracas – where cargo trucks have become a novel way of travelThe water crisis is one symptom of the failing state around her. Another is the lack of food. Perez’s daughter, a public school teacher, collected back wages last week. The family used the money to buy a rare treat – a dozen eggs. Skyrocketing inflation means they cost 480,000 bolivares – the equivalent of nearly one week of her husband’s salary. Perez, nearly emaciated, has lost 17 pounds in the past year.“I feel hopeless,” she says, adding that she fears the government will ensure a Maduro victory on election day, no matter what voters do. “We want change, but I don’t think we’ll get it.”Inside Caracas University Hospital – one of the capital’s largest – the first thing that hits you is the smell.“We’ve had no water for two weeks, and it just came back today,” says a 29-year-old doctor who guided two journalists through its dim halls. The doctor spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid reprisals, since the hospital’s administration is pro-government. “For a while,” she says, “some toilets couldn’t be flushed.” Medical shortages have gripped Venezuelan for several years. But things have markedly worsened over the past few months as water and power have become more intermittent. Three weeks ago, the electricity went out for a whole weekend, with generators able to power only the emergency ward, surgery rooms and the intensive care unit.As Venezuela has rocketed into hyperinflation, drugs and supplies – almost all of them imported – are increasingly unaffordable.Malaria was once rare here. Now the hospital is receiving almost 40 infected patients a day. The worst cases end up in the infectious disease ward, which on the recent visit was loaded with patients suffering from preventable or treatable illnesses that have run amok in a weakened population.Lethargic measles patients filled a room marked “isolation”. There was a round hole in the door from a missing knob, allowing the air inside to easily filter into a hallway. The corridors echoed with the coughs of skeletal HIV patients, some of whom are suffering complications from tuberculosis.A child carries a plastic container on the outskirts of CaracasThere will be fewer and fewer doctors to treat them. “A big part of our newly graduated medical students are leaving the country right away. I’d say 90 percent of them,” says Oscar Noya, a doctor who heads the hospital’s malaria department. On a recent afternoon, Leon Avila, a 54-year-old security guard, was waiting at a bus stop at the bottom of a hill in Guarenas, a slum 18 miles east of Caracas. To reach his home at the top, he would normally travel by public bus.But of the 25 buses that used to ply the route five years ago, all but two are out of commission because of a lack of affordable spare parts. In Venezuela these days, a single tyre can cost 100 times what a bus driver makes in a month. Even the two buses currently running are suffering from breakdowns – so frequent that residents have been forced into a relatively novel type of transit – cargo trucks, whose drivers charge them a fare.Zulay Perez has only had running water once in the past year“Travelling like cargo is now our day-to-day life,” Avila says.In Caracas, 70 per cent of the city’s 18,000 buses are not operating. The rest work only intermittently, says Hugo Ocando, a transportation union leader. Ten to 15 per cent have gone out of order this year alone, he continued. After a midsize cargo truck pulled up to Avila’s bus stop, he piled into the back with a mob of others. “Stop boarding people! We’re getting asphyxiated!”, someone shouted in the back.In moments, more than 30 people were crammed inside, holding on to ropes to keep from falling. Much of the cabin’s interior was dark. There were no windows, with the only light and air funnelling through the open back doors.“It’s like we’re animals,” Avila says. The mainstream opposition is boycotting Sunday’s vote, citing a lack of guarantees of a free and fair election. Maduro’s government has banned some key opposition figures from running, kept others behind bars and prompted at least one to seek asylum at the Chilean Embassy in Caracas. Maduro, 55, will still face two main challengers: Henri Falcon, a former governor, and Javier Bertucci, an evangelical pastor. But despite growing international pressure, including an escalating list of US sanctions, few here believe that Maduro is prepared to lose. The government was widely accused of fraud in an election last year for an all-powerful legislative body. Venezuela blocks opposition candidates from presidential electionVenezuela’s opposition refuses to recognise surprise win for MaduroEvidence of ‘crimes against humanity’ in Venezuela conflict, says UNYet with so many Venezuelans expected to skip the vote, Maduro may genuinely edge out his opponents Sunday. According to the Delphos polling firm, Maduro and Falcon are neck and neck among likely voters, with Maduro at 38 percent compared with Falcon at 37 percent. Bertucci is polling in third, with 20 percent support.Critics say some Venezuelans may vote for Maduro out of fear – of losing state jobs or government-subsidised food baskets. Maduro says they will vote for him out of national pride. “When you ask Donald Trump who’s going to win in Venezuela, even he says, ‘Maduro,’” the Venezuelan leader said at a rally last week. “And why are we going to win? Because we are the fatherland, of history, of dignity.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

And now it might be one of our best hopes of finding alien life in our own solar system.Scientists announced this week that there is a water plume coming out of Europa, a moon of Jupiter and one of the prime candidates for life in our solar system.This comes in the wake of discovering plumes on Saturn’s moon Enceladus, during the Cassini mission, which suggested the strange moon has the building blocks of life. We might find alien life on Jupiter’s ocean moon, Nasa saysWhile the discovery about Europa is brand new, the data used to deduce it was old. The plume itself might be ancient, and could help us to finally solve the mystery of whether are alone in the universe – or even alone in our little patch of it: the Solar System.That’s because, while the plume themselves might be thrilling, they’re more exciting for what they might mean. They are spewing out water that would otherwise be hidden beneath the moon’s thick icy crust, and which would therefore be very difficult to access.“If Europa has plumes erupting into space, that really provides a new window for future exploration,” says Xianzhe Jia, a space physicist at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor and the lead author on the new study. “We might be able to find out what’s going on in the ocean.”The awareness that there might be a plume arrived gradually: first in pictures taken from the Hubble Space Telescope that seemed to suggest something strange was happening, and then through further, clearer Hubble pictures. One of those later sets of images sent Jia and his team back to the data – which already been collected all the way back in 1997, from a spacecraft that set off in 1989.“We already had the data  we had a flyby over this region,” he says, and the scientists resolved to “look more carefully at the data we have”.It worked. “In fact, when we look at the data more carefully – at the closest approach to the plume, we did detect strange changes which had not been explained before in the past,” he says.Nasa\u0027s most stunning pictures of spaceNasa\u0027s most stunning pictures of spaceFrom the International Space Station, Expedition 42 Flight Engineer Terry W.

These two pieces of information immediately stood up – seeming to tell us that this minimal signal is being produced by a localised source, of particles.”In scientific terms, the team had a very good hunch that something was going on. But they needed to prove it, so they used extensive computer modelling to work out whether the data lined up with what would be be expected if there were a plume – and it did, with what Jia calls “stunning” precision.That’s why, thought the data is fairly old, the discovery could never have been made at the time. Only with a hunch, and brand new modelling techniques, could scientists make sense of it.“Twenty years ago, you might have had the idea that this was related to the plume,” he says. “But the models of the time wouldn’t allow you to draw that conclusion – we’d have to wait for better images from future missions.”The Cassini mission to Enceladus (which Jia was not involved in) has already given scientists an understanding that they can bring to other plumes.“The knowledge that has been developed on the Enceladus missions and the studies gives us a very good idea about, if you do have water plumes in space, how would that change the magnetic and the plasma environment?”One of the central disappointments of the Cassini mission was that much of what it learnt about Enceladus suggested this strange moon was worthy of much more study – but its mission was imminently coming to a close. That is not the case with Europa. Both Nasa and the European Space Agency are gearing up to send missions to Jupiter and the system that orbits around it.The ESA hopes to send its Juice mission to Jupiter’s moons in 2022 – and it will look at the other moons that are thought to have large oceans hiding beneath their surfaces, Ganymede and Callisto, as well as Europa. Nasa’s Europa Clipper mission is being prepared for launch the same year.“If plumes exist, and we can directly sample what’s coming from the interior of Europa, then we can more easily get at whether Europa has the ingredients for life,” said Robert Pappalardo, Europa Clipper project scientist at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.“That’s what the mission is after. That’s the big picture.”  Nasa\u0027s canny decision to commission sumptuous vintage-inspired posters by Seattle design firm Invisible Creature has firmly placed space travel back where it belongs: in the imagination of travellersIt is particularly fitting that the Nasa commission went to Don and Ryan Clark, who have been running Invisible Creature since 2006, undertaking projects for the likes of Nike and TargetWe were ecstatic, just because our grandfather was an illustrator at Nasa for 30 years, says ClarkThe artwork harks back to the Jet Age-era posters commissioned by Howard Hughes\u0027 Trans World Airlines and its rival United in the 1950s and 1960s, when the work of David Klein (for TWA) and Stan Galli (for United) glamorised and essentially branded this new age of air travelIt doesn\u0027t matter that Nasa has no plans for a Grand Tour of Jupiter, Saturn, Neptune and UranusIf global travel is for daydreamers, going beyond the atmosphere is for true space cadetsThe two spacecrafts will be very well prepared for finding the plume if they do: they will be carrying a whole host of instruments that will be perfect for coming to understand whether the strange world would have the ability to host alien life. They will also be carrying radars that can see down beneath the ice to help us learn more about where the plume is coming from – and also about the mysterious watery world that it is erupting up and out of.“Habitable conditions require a certain balance of chemical elements: on Earth, life doesn’t want it to be too acidic, too alkaline, though there are a range of conditions in which life could potentially exist,” says Leigh Fletcher, senior research fellow in planetary science at the University of Leicester.“The more favourable it is, the more likely it is they would be there.”We’ve already had a go at some of this, on Enceladus, where we were able to detect the so-called building blocks of life. Such a discovery doesn’t prove there is aliens hiding in our own solar system, but it does suggest they could be.The time around, on Europa, we’re going to get an even better look.“The Cassini mission was able to characterise in exquisite detail what is happening on Enceladus,” says Fletcher. “I would say that has been our testing ground, with a spacecraft that was based on 1980s, 1990s technology.“Now we know what we’re looking for in the Europa environment. It’s been a fantastically useful thing.”He adds: “One wonders if we ever went out to Saturn and Neptune, with their icy moons, would we be able to see these plumes? These places are barely explored.“It shows that this geophysical activity – this activity in a place where you would expect it to be dead – is happening, and things are changing, today.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

I happily pay £40 a year for MoT safety check on my classic.Motor journalist Jonny Smith, who posts videos on Twitter as @carpervert, also opposes extending the exemption, which previously applied only to cars built before 1960.“I don’t think it’s a good idea,” he said. “It’s a good time to familiarise yourself with a car – sometimes you don’t know what jobs need doing, you need a second opinion.”The Department of Transport said the effect on road safety was “small” and claimed that there was no specific evidence of any risk from vehicles of historic interest.“The government gave significant consideration to the issue of any potential impact on rates of death and serious injury on the road,” said the Department of Transport.“The MOT failure rate and the number of people killed and seriously injured in accidents involving vehicles over 40 years old are both lower than those for newer vehicles.“We consider the element of risk arising from taking vehicles over 40 years old out of the testing regime is small.”The new MOT rules are also expected to increase confusion because of the lengthy list of exemptions and caveats.If classic cars have been “substantially changed” then the exemption does not apply – unless original parts are no longer available or the alterations were made to improve efficiency and safety.The exemptions also do not apply to older buses and commercial vehicles over 3.5 tonnes.The new MOT is here! Check here for details – https:t.coE1ZMKAbpb6 pic.twitter1JrrXqubY5Other changes to the MOT coming into force on 20 May mean that diesel vehicles will fail if smoke of any colour comes from the exhaust.Faults will now be categorised as either dangerous (fail), major (fail) or minor (pass), with new checks for tyre pressure, brake fluid, brake pads, headlight washers, and reversing and daytime running lights.There have also been some changes to the annual test for heavy goods vehicles, with the removal of exemptions for mobile cranes, breakdown vehicles, tower wagons and road construction vehicles.Motorists can be fined up to £1,000 for driving without a valid MOT.RAC spokesman Simon Williams said: “It is important everyone quickly gets to grips with the changes to the MOT, and that test centres and garages do a good job of explaining the new fault categories so motorists understand correctly the severity of faults with their vehicles.“Changes to the MOT that make vehicles using our roads safer are undoubtedly a positive step so we hope that testers everywhere interpret and apply the new rules fairly and consistently. The last thing we want to see is a lowering of MOT standards and an increase in the number of unroadworthy vehicles on our roads.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

We would give up our say over interest rate policy, exchange rate policy and inflation.“Scotland does not need, and the people of Scotland do not want, this tired argument again.

US investigators have accused Mr Najib\u0027s associates of stealing and laundering $4.5bn (£3.3) from the fund, some of which allegedly landed in Mr Najib\u0027s bank account and was used to buy a $23m pink diamond necklace for his wife. Ms Rosmah is known for her lavish spending on designer handbags, watches and jewellery when she travels abroad. Mr Najib’s critics have previously accused his wife of financing her expensive shopping habit with public funds.Mr Singh declined to say who the raided apartment belonged to but he confirmed that the search was “conducted in relevance to our 1MDB investigations. Anti-corruption police also carried out simultaneous raids at several other locations, including his former office as prime minister, an official residence and Mr Najib’s own home, where police seized more handbags and clothes following a 20-hour search.  Mr Singh said police were trying to crack open a safe in Mr Najib’s house.  Police search former prime minister Najib Razak\u0027s home in Kuala Lumpur as part of a corruption probe after billions of dollars were siphoned off from a state fund (REUTERSLai Seng Sin)Mr Najib has denied any wrongdoing and his lawyer denounced the long search at his home as harassment.The police raid marks an extraordinary turn of events a week after Mr Najib’s coalition was defeated in a general election he was expected to win – putting an end to the coalition\u0027s 60-year rule. After leading an opposition alliance to victory in the 9 May election, the new Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad re-opened the investigation into the state fund’s missing money. The 92-year-old, who was once Mr Najib’s mentor, was prime minister for 22 years until 2003. He ran again in the country’s latest election, pledging to tackle the corruption at the heart of the administration.World news in picturesWorld news in picturesSanta Fe High School student Dakota Shrader is comforted by her mother Susan Davidson following a shooting at the school in Texas.

The US legislation allows the targeting of Russian state personnel who are deemed to have been involved in Mr Magnitsky’s death.The UK parliament is in the process of passing a version of the Magnitsky Act under which Russian nationals responsible for human rights violations as well as engaging in activities against Britain such as the Salisbury poisoning can be prosecuted.The Foreign Affairs Committee points to the London flotation of EN+ an energy company part owned by VTB, a Russian state-owned bank which has been sanctioned by the US and EU. EN+ was owned by Oleg Deripaska, an oligarch who is close to Mr Putin, who has since stepped down from the board of the company in an attempt to lift American sanctions.The report charts how, just days after the UK expelled 23 Russian diplomats following the Salisbury attack, the Russian government was able to raise £3bn in Eurobond issuance and the Russian energy multinational Gazprom PJSC made a £500m sale followed by the Russian embassy in London tweeting “business as usual”.The Sanctions and Anti-Money Laundering Bill is currently in the final stages of passing through the Commons after going through the Lords. The MPs state: “We welcome the bill’s broad definition of the purpose of sanctions regulations, which will give the government the power to introduce sanctions for a range of reasons...” But the MPs want a register of overseas owners of properties in this country to be brought forward from the proposed date of 2021 and naming and shaming of iniduals “comparable to the US Magnitsky List” to be made public and updated by the Foreign Office.The wealthiest Russian oligarchs who call London homeThe committee’s chairperson, Conservative MP Tom Tugdenhat, said: “We must be united in our efforts to match rhetoric with action – in the City, through government policy and among allies in the US, G7 and EU. We call on the Foreign and Commonwealth Office to set out a coherent strategy on Russia that clearly links together the diplomatic, military and financial tools that the UK can use to counter Russian state aggression.”The report, however, does not reveal any new information about Russian money and corruption in the UK, drawing instead on existing public material, and statements by journalists, academics and researchers. There is a degree of scepticism about whether Theresa May’s government will rush to investigate and prosecute on this issue near future laws which already exist to do so have not been much used.Successive British governments have actively encouraged rich foreigners to come to this country and a slew of prosecutions, which, to apply the law equitably, would mean targeting of other nationalities as well as Russians is likely to result in money being moved out, capital flight, at a time of economic uncertainty and trepidation following Brexit.Widespread international support for further punitive action is also unlikely. The British government has suspended senior level interaction with Moscow, but other Western states have not. Although a number of allied countries expelled Russians working under diplomatic accreditation following the Skripal attack, contact has continued as normal at the highest level.Angela Merkel has just met Mr Putin in Sochi where topics under discussion included Nord Stream 2, a project to pipe Russian gas to Germany. French President Emmanuel Macron will meet Mr Putin in St Petersburg this week, and the populist coalition due to form Italy’s next government has stated that it will lift sanctions placed on Russia over Ukraine.In the US, Donald Trump – under investigation over claims that Moscow helped to put him in the White House – recently signed a new set of congressional sanctions on Russia, only after resisting doing so for months. And although America threw out 60 Russian diplomats over the Skripals, the US president is reported to have claimed subsequently that he had been misled into expelling a far larger number than he has intended.World news in picturesWorld news in picturesSanta Fe High School student Dakota Shrader is comforted by her mother Susan Davidson following a shooting at the school in Texas.

Some British politicians should also think about the kind of language they use, there are some people who are determined to make matters worse instead of better,” he said.“If the British government brings in these laws targeting Russians in the UK then the Russians can take the matter to court, I believe a lot of them are preparing for this already and preparing legal cases. This is something which should be open to them, after all we keep being told that the UK is a country of laws.”Mr Yakovenko wanted to stress that although the British government had chosen to break off high level liaison, other heads of state have maintained “links which are so essential” in the troubled international political climate.

She could easily have become trapped in the web of regal traditions.But Meghan navigated the intricacies with aplomb to pull off the most contemporary and delightfully multi-cultural royal wedding Britain has ever seen.There was a gospel choir, a bride’s mother with a nose stud and a star-studded guest list that was far more Soho House than Buck House. And of course, the aforementioned preacher Michael Curry.He milked his moment at the pulpit with a relentlessly repetitive call to love that went on . . . and on . . . and on, and clearly tickled some royals so much they looked fit to burst.The younger, modernising royals are now regarded more as celebrities than figureheads and this was a highly public melding of the old and new.After all Meghan, 36, is a divorcee with life experience, not some privileged ingenue straight out of finishing school.In Suits, the US telly series she starred in, her character married in a dress Meghan herself chose and described as “classic and fairytale and the culmination of everything she’s been waiting for”.The same could be said of yesterday’s creation by British designer Clare Waight Keller.In a nod to history, Meghan topped it with Queen Mary’s 1932 diamond bandeau tiara.And her “glam squad” of make-up artists, hairdresser, eyebrow shaper and skin guru worked their magic to accentuate a naturally radiant glow without looking overdone.She walked into the chapel alone, a break with form spun as a “bold, feminist statement” but really borne from sad necessity by her father’s absence.Meghan passed her Suits co-stars and the majority of the other celebrity guests in the Nave — what might be described as the cheap seats. Even Patrick J Adams, who played Suits love interest Mike Ross, was there.Yet curiously, celebrity royalty George and Amal Clooney were placed in the Quire alongside the Royal Family. Go figure.As Meghan reached halfway, she took the arm of her now father-in-law Prince Charles.He was to “accompany” her to the altar, rather than “give away” the woman who, let’s face it, he’s only just getting to know. For Charles the last-minute role was perhaps a godsend, placing him centre stage where the presence of his ever-strong mother might have eclipsed him.Not to mention the ghost of his ex-wife, always painted as the touch-feely parent to his seemingly more remote style.For, although it’s been 20 years since Diana’s death, how could anyone in the same situation not think of their mother and muse and how she would have savoured being there?And how could even the ­hardest of Republican hearts not have felt a small pang of regret she wasn’t?After all, in the middle of it all was the very human story of a young man who stole the nation’s hearts when forced to walk behind his mother’s coffin at the tender age of 12.On his engagement, Harry was asked what Diana would have thought of Meghan. He smiled and said: “They would have been thick as thieves. I think she would have been over the moon — jumping up and down, so excited for me, but then, as I said, she would have probably been best friends with Meghan.”Indeed she would. Diana always took great pains to make sure her sons knew not everyone’s life was as privileged.So she would have adored Harry’s choice of bride for her normality and independence.He could have had his pick of socialites but he chose a normal woman who has grafted and earned everything she has.The downside is that, unlike poshies who are as badly behaved as the rest of us but keep it to themselves, Meghan’s unedited life is ripe for scrutiny.Diana would have understood and done her utmost to support her. In addition, the media-savvy Princess of Wales would have brought Meghan’s father into the fold weeks ago, knowing a mix of estranged family and lack of disposable income is a potentially damaging cocktail.Want to celebrate Harry and Meghans wedding like a royal?Weve made a brand new Snapchat lens just for the big day!Unlock The Suns Royal Wedding lens on Snapchat here and send us your snaps to @TheSunUKBut all that was forgotten yesterday as Meghan’s 61-year-old mother Doria Ragland, a yoga teacher, watched her daughter (who she calls “flower”) from a front-row pew, compellingly regal in her solitude.Meghan is reportedly maternal herself apparent during their engagement interview, throughout which she guides Harry rather than the other way round.In Angela Levin’s book Harry: Conversations with the Prince, she quotes historian Dr David Starkey as saying: “She mothers him a bit, but he needs it and some women like to do it.”Harry says his mother’s death left him in total chaos and Levin feels his “air of vulnerability and sadness” has brought out Meghan’s mothering instinct.Good. In return, it’s plain to see she has Harry’s unconditional devotion, and that they’ll make fine parents.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But we have also watched him grow up.He is no longer the pampered prince surrounded by chinless sycophants, who got it horribly wrong at fancy dress parties and Las Vegas swimming pools.He has grown into an Afghan war veteran, a doer of genuinely good works that make a real difference to lives that have been shattered by combat.He has grown into the son that Princess Diana would have been incredibly proud of.Twenty years on from the death of Diana, this country desperately wants Harry’s life to have a happy ending.A wedding — even a royal wedding — is not the same as a marriage, of course. And a day — even a special day like yesterday in Windsor in the blazing sunshine — is not the same as building a successful relationship that endures a lifetime.But the wedding of Prince Harry to Meghan Markle felt like the start of Harry’s happy ever after.Many of us, I suspect, were caught off guard by the raw emotion of the day. Hardened old hacks who have covered their share of royal events do not usually shed a tear among all that pomp and circumstance.But it is 20 years since I watched William and Harry mourn their mother in Westminster Abbey, and I saw them grieve when the cameras were pointed away. And I could not watch this wedding without a lump in my throat. And I suspect there were millions like me.Windsor is not really built to host the wedding of the century. This ancient market town is more used to low-key royal nuptials — Charles marrying Camilla and Prince Edward and Sophie Rhys-Jones — and having Meghan and Harry’s wedding in the shadow of that 1,000-year-old castle was like ­throwing the Rio carnival in a telephone booth.But it worked. This was Woodstock for royalists, whatever part of the world they came from.The mood was good-humoured, stoic, polite and it all felt fantastically British. A lot of people brought their dogs.And there were Americans everywhere, like Fulvia Brooks, 52, of Washington DC, visiting the UK for the first time.“As an African-American, and a woman, and an American, this day means a lot to me,” Fulvia told me. “Most of all it means love is real.”Her sister Julietta Simmons, 54, said: “I wanted to be a part of history. And it’s amazing! Wonderful! Yeah!”Want to celebrate Harry and Meghans wedding like a royal?Weve made a brand new Snapchat lens just for the big day!Unlock The Suns Royal Wedding lens on Snapchat here and send us your snaps to @TheSunUKHarry and Meghan have lit a fire under the special relationship. There are 1,000 graduates of Meghan’s old university, Northwestern of Chicago, living in the UK and it felt like most of them had come to Windsor.“She is a smart, powerful, sophisticated woman,” said Ellen Bencard, a Northwestern alumna. “She is going to be able to do so much.”Some things about the crowds were unchanging, such as the presence of servicemen and women, the backbone of these events. But this was noticeably a different crowd from William and Kate’s wedding in 2011.There were more black faces, more brown faces, and more of a sense the entire nation felt included in a way they never did in the past.“She will modernise the Royal Family,” said Val West of Staines, Surrey. “There are millions of us who have been living in mixed-race families for years. The Windsors have joined us in the 21st century.”The last time an American divorcee married into the Royal Family, the British monarchy had a meltdown.This time, it might be the American divorcee who saves them.But you had to wonder if Meghan Markle TRULY understands what she’s getting into. She will be scrutinised like no other woman for the rest of her life.The fact she is 36 and has had a life — Diana was 19 when she wed Charles and died at 36 — will hold her in good stead, as will marrying a man clearly crazy about her.But there will be unimaginable pressure on Meghan to keep smiling, to keep hugging, to make the fairytale come true and — oh yes — produce a baby before she turns 40. So, even on this happiest of days, you had to fear for the bride.Because on Saturday we watched a once-obscure actress cement her place as without ­question the most famous woman on the planet.And you have to worry, just a ­little, about Harry. Like his brother, Harry sometimes seems a tad sulky about the constant, never-ending interest in his life.Behind the charming smiles, the younger royals too frequently seem to lack the stoic sense of duty the Queen has displayed for a lifetime, as though being born into the Royal Family is a heavy burden — when of course it is also a fantastic privilege.And you can’t dream of the quiet life when you just married the Grace Kelly of the 21st Century, a woman who blends regal charisma with Hollywood va-va-voom like nobody else alive. But this was not a day for nagging doubts.This was a day for believing Meghan and Harry will have the happy-ever-after they deserve, that the boy and girl from broken homes will build a home that lasts.The build-up to this special day has been difficult.Arranging your wedding day is never easy when you come from a dysfunctional, divorce-riven family full of bat-crazy relatives — and that’s just Harry!But thoughts of the sad past melted away in the sunshine. In 1947 Churchill called the Queen’s wedding “a flash of colour on the hard road we travel”.Windsor on Saturday made you believe we have not changed as much as we may have feared. The last was George V when he married Princess Victoria Mary of Teck at St James’s Palace in 1893.Harry had to get special permission from the Queen to keep his facial hair.As he is no longer a serving officer, Her Majesty had to give the OK for him to wear his military uniform.Since it is customary to be clean-shaven when in uniform, it is believed that her permission also covered Harry’s facial fuzz.Historian Hugo Vickers said: “Theoretically the Army don’t like it.”Along with brother Wills, Harry was in the frock coat uniform of the Household Cavalry’s Blues and Royals.They were hand-tailored by royal outfitters Dege and Skinner, of Savile Row in central London.A Royal Crown on his shoulder indicated Harry has been promoted to Major since leaving the Army as a Captain in 2015.He would have had the honour bestowed on him by The Queen, who can promote members of the Royal Family in line with their peers because they hold military appointments.On his left chest Harry displayed his Pilots’ Wings, awarded when he served with the Army Air Corps as an Apache helicopter pilot.His medal ribbons were the Knight Commander of the Royal Victorian Order Afghanistan with rosette The Queen’s Golden Jubilee and Diamond Jubilee. These were our people on the streets of Windsor. Men like Ray Brown, dressed as Uncle Sam — his friend Janet Butterfield was in a Union Jack dress — who had travelled all night from Yorkshire to cheer on the Long Walk.And Grace Gothard, from London out of Ghana, who wore a homemade dress she wore to Kate and William’s wedding.And you had to admire their patriotism, their good-natured humour, the quiet fortitude it took to be on those streets for hours.And this is our country, you realised, the real country that exists beyond the soft, sneering elite in Westminster. These decent, patriotic, polite people who are so often ignored are the best of us.We are often told this country is bitterly and permanently divided.But on Saturday in the spring sunshine of Windsor, it felt like those cheering crowds held up a mirror to the nation’s soul. And we did not seem divided at all.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

So is her mother.Honestly, they are touched beyond belief. It was important to her to make a point of thanking him publicly, although, of course, he knows privately how she feels.Another source told the newspaper: It is often said that he always wanted a daughter and I think he has been really moved by how well they have got on.There is definitely a connection there. Meghans mother means more to her than anything, so it was lovely to see the way he was so welcoming to Doria too.Charles is said to have spent a lot of time with his son and Meghan choosing the music to be played at their service.The Royal Wedding has been dogged by Meghans family speaking out against her.She has faced criticism from her half-sister Samantha Markle, who claimed their dad Thomas was alone and upset in hospital following his surgery for a dangerous heart condition.And she also slammed claims Kensington Palace was helping him - revealing she had to wire him cash to survive.Meghans brother Thomas Markle Jr has also hit out at the former actress - telling Prince Harry not to marry her.He wrote an explosive open letter telling Meghan to call off the upcoming nuptials, blasting it as a fake fairy tale.But he has now backtracked on his scathing comments - branding it a moment of madness.Meghan and Harry married on Saturday in front of a celeb-filled congregation at St Georges Chapel in Windsor.The ceremony was a modern affair - with the couple hailed for their multicultural ceremony. Their nuptials featured a rip-roaring sermon from an American preacher and a moving rendition of Stand By Me by a black gospel choir.The loved-up pair gazed at each other during the ceremony, with Meghan wowing in her spectacular gown by designer Clare Waight Keller of Givenchy.She teamed it with a dazzling Mary Diamond Bandeau tiara – lent to her by the Queen.Meghan expressed the wish of having all 53 countries of the Commonwealth with her on her journey through the ceremony.Harry greeted his beautiful bride at the altar and told her: “You look amazing.”Meghan was walked down the aisle by Prince Charles — standing in for her absent father Thomas.Harry, 33, who had nervously fiddled with his cuffs while waiting, turned to Charles and said: “Thank you, Pa.”They followed the ceremony with the evening reception in a £300,000 glass marquee in the grounds of Windsor Castle paid for by Prince Charles.Harrys dad left guests in stitches with a speech about changing his nappy, while the groom delighted everyone when he referred to Meghan as his wife.Jubilant guests were later treated to an incredible firework display that could be seen for miles around Windsor as the Royal Wedding was brought to a close."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict0004074535051.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"meghan markle and prince harry to delay honeymoon and begin royal duties with charles 70th birthday event on tuesday","story":"The happy couple are delaying their travels for a series of royal engagements as a further break from tradition sees them getting straight back to work.Harry and Meghan have been tipped to go to a dazzling array of exotic locations for their honeymoon including Botswana, Hawaii, Mexico and the Caribbean.Prince Charles’ 70th birthday patronage garden party at Buckingham Palace will be the first event they attend as the new Duke and Duchess of Sussex on Tuesday.Last night Charles reportedly had wedding guests rolling in the aisles with his speech after cracking a joke about changing Harry’s nappy.The outdoor event marks the heir to the thrones milestone birthday -

The Prime Minister would trounce any challenge.We are four points ahead of Labour and the PM is miles ahead of Corbyn.And another said: I doubt the PM would lose a vote of confidence.Many MPs think a fresh leadership battle could risk a less popular leader replacing Theresa May, and even throw up the prospect of Jeremy Corbyn getting into Downing Street -

Blow dry, I used a few products, a little mousse a little texturising product, just to make it look a bit more shiny.“I dried it with a round brush and then used a little iron on the edges just to give it texture.”Clare said Meghan may have admired her role as a successful “working mother”.She added: “I think she really admired the fact that I was a woman designer and the many companies I’ve worked for — British and international.“And the fact that I’m a working mother maybe played into that as well, so that was maybe part of her story.”Meghan’s hairdresser Paris-born Serge Normant, 52, said she was a calm and chatty bride.Meghan also wore earrings and a bracelet made by Cartier.He claimed it took him just 45 minutes to style her hair using grips you can pick up in a supermarket for only a few pounds.And he declared it was “dreamy” to work with the Suits star.Harry, 33, and his best man, brother Prince William 35 — looked respendent in their Blues and Royals uniforms. The brothers both served in the regiment.Birmingham-born Clare Waight Keller is set to be a household name, as the woman who made Meghan Markles stunning wedding dress.The 47-year-old took over as Artistic Director at the Givenchy design house in May 2017, the first female to take the reigns in its 66 year history.The labels founder Hubert de Givenchy died in March of this year at the age of 91, he styled style icons such as Audrey Hepburn and Jackie Kennedy in his legendary career.Keller studied for her BA at the Ravensbourne College of Art, before doing a Masters at Londons Royal College of Art.Her CV is a whos-who of the worlds biggest luxury designers.Her first graduate job was as a designer for CK Calvin Klein, before being promoted to working on the main collection.She stayed there for four years before designing menswear for Ralph Lauren.Tom Ford then employed her as a senior designer at Gucci in 2000.She was then Creative Director at Pringle of Scotland and was praised for modernising the brand.Keller was named Creative Director at French label Chloé in 2011, where she stayed for six years before moving onto Givenchy.She is married to architect Philip Keller, and they have three children - twins Charlotte and Amelia, 15 and son Harrison, six.The touching revelation came as reports revealed guests celebrated the couple tying the knot by downing themed cocktails, eating up-market fast food, watching a spectacular fireworks display and dancing to a celebrity DJ.Guests dined on posh burgers among other dishes, with candyfloss on offer for those with a sweet tooth - and there was reportedly a cocktail on offer named When Harry Met Meghan, a reference to the romantic comedy When Harry Met Sally starring Meg Ryan and Billy Crystal.Prince Harry and Meghan Markles guests didnt want the Royal Wedding to endJames Corden is reported to have acted as a surprise compere on the night, with Elton John taking to the piano to play some of his biggest hits for the newlyweds.Fun did not stop when Frogmore House - the famous royal home loved by Queen Victoria - closed it doors, as some guests are said to have staged an after party at top London hot spot Chiltern Firehouse.Following the exploits of Saturday night, Harry and Meghan left Windsor Castle during Sunday afternoon after being hosted by the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh over their wedding weekend.It had a boat neck that elegantly framed her shoulders — and a flattering sculpted waist.The chic design was topped off with a show-stopping 16ft veil and train.The lengthy design was held in place by Queen Mary’s tiara. Its Art Deco style complemented the comparatively understated dress.The simple, but extremely stylish choice, proves the American actress certainly knows what Suits her.Want to celebrate Harry and Meghans wedding like a royal?Weve made a brand new Snapchat lens just for the big day!Unlock The Suns Royal Wedding lens on Snapchat here and send us your snaps to @TheSunUKOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Well, Harry’s acted.They all talked about modernising the Royal Family. Harry has actually done it with a bride and a wedding service like no other.“Love,” Bishop Curry told us in his extraordinary sermon — which spoke in accents unheard of in polite English churches — “love can change this world.”It’s sure changed the Royal Family. Ms Markle, it is worth repeating, is mixed-race, American, of uncertain religion, an actress, divorced and with a sexual history.In the past any one of these would have rendered her deeply doubtful as a royal bride and the combination would have ruled her out entirely. But the times they are a’changing.The stigma of divorce was still powerful as late as the 1990s, which is why it took so long to dissolve the disastrous marriage of Harry’s parents, Prince Charles and Princess Diana.But their divorce, and Charles’s subsequent remarriage to Camilla, acted as a sort of earthquake which brought all the remaining conventions of royal marriages — virginal brides, nice English girls, no divorce — tumbling down.Which, in a nutshell, is how the Royal Family came to get Meghan.But why did Meghan want to become royal? The short answer is that she wanted Harry. But so did lots of other women, who all baulked at the prospect of becoming royal.Not Meghan. Indeed, she seems to have embraced it as passionately as Harry himself.As an actress, of course she wasn’t fazed by the publicity that had so put off Harry’s earlier girlfriends. But there’s more to it than that.At university she took a double major in theatre and international studies — which was her real love.She became an intern in the American embassy in Argentina. She took the exam to enter the US State Department, which is the equivalent of our Foreign Office.It was only when she failed the notoriously difficult test that she turned to acting.Moreover, the moment she enjoyed success and fame with Suits, she used it to leverage her entry on to the international stage as “Global Ambassador” for World Vision Canada, among many other good causes.In other words, acting was not her vocation. It was only a means to an end.And that end is much better served by her marrying Harry, becoming royal and using her fame — and his — to serve the issues, particularly women’s issues, she is so keen on.So you could say that Harry — the eternal boy-man — is marrying his mother, since Diana used her fame too.But Diana did it in opposition to her estranged husband. Meghan aims to do it in partnership with Harry and at the very heart of the Royal Family.And she’s proving astonishingly adept — is it those actressy skills again? — at winning over the British establishment.Back in the 1930s, the Archbishop of Canterbury was the deadly foe of Wallis Simpson, King Edward VIII’s divorced American bride, and led to his abdication.Today, Archbishop Justin Welby is Meghan’s best friend. Indeed, he’s practically three in a bed with the couple.There’s chemistry, of course. But there’s also calculation on both sides.Welby wants to use Meghan, who as an American does religion as well as touchy-feely, to spearhead a religious revival among the young.The Royal Family also want to buy into her as an international brand.Which is why the Queen appointed Harry Commonwealth Youth Ambassador.Weve made a brand new Snapchat lens just for the big day!Unlock The Suns Royal Wedding lens on Snapchat here and send us your snaps to @TheSunUKKeeping the Commonwealth going in the face of the overwhelming indifference of British politicians of all parties has been the greatest personal achievement of the Queen’s long reign.And she capped it by ruthlessly stage-managing Charles’s acclamation as her successor as Head of the Commonwealth at the most recent Commonwealth Conference.That was the constitutional bit sorted out.Harry’s appointment addresses the equally important question of PR.Meghan and Harry are the model modern couple: Mature (well, she is), bi-racial,bi-cultural, international, do-gooding, fashion-conscious and media-savvy to their fingertips.They are the perfect face of a modern monarchy at home and ideal Global Ambassadors for Brand Windsor abroad.And, come to think of it — which I’m sure the Queen and her advisers have done — they are the perfect Global Ambassadors for post-Brexit Brand Britain as well.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Nobody would believe that.Yet the happy couple set aside family rows, petty jealousies and drunken sabotage and basked in the warm embrace of an adoring public.Windsor’s Disney-style ceremony was watched in broad daylight north of the equator and the middle of the night Down Under by happy viewers of all races and creeds.There is a message here for us all.Harry and Meghan’s wedding did more than unite this nation in sympathy and affection for a popular prince and the love of his life. It showed this country is world class.The sub-plot, of course, was the emotional union between the damaged children of two broken families.Fans have long yearned for Prince Harry to find happiness after the roller-coaster life and shocking death of his fabled mother, Princess Diana.They have warmed to a young man who transformed himself from a mixed-up kid to a likeable soldier, helicopter pilot and champion of war-damaged Invictus casualties.As for his bride, Meghan Markle is the glamorous star of hit TV series Suits, who dreamed as a child of becoming a princess.Best of all in this age of right-on political correctness, she is the daughter of a charming African-American mother and an Emmy-winning Hollywood lighting specialist.The House of Windsor is now truly multicultural.It is also hip.Our amazing sovereign, at 92, and doughty Prince Philip, 96, both heading for their royal telegrams, are the Queen and King of Cool.Where else in the world would you see an Elton John double act with Windy City preacher Bishop Michael Curry?This was a truly uplifting occasion, worn lightly by a once-stuffy Royal Family.Nobody does it better when it comes to choreographing mounted cavalry, trumpets, banners and horse-drawn carriages with an electric-powered E-Type and a vintage Rolls-Royce.All underscored by a sense of humour, as Harry and his supportive brother William exchanged banter at the altar of Windsor’s historic St George’s Chapel.Even the weather turned out in tribute, bathing Windsor Great Park’s glorious greenery in spring sunshine.There may have been some muffled coughs over Markle family squabbles but they were nothing compared with the torrid dramas leading to the Queen’s own “annus horribilis”.The world has become used to British pageantry.But this Royal Wedding was a timely reminder that Britain is not just a small island with a fading history on the edge of Europe.The Duke and Duchess of Sussex ride in a carriage down The Long Walk back towards Windsor Castle after getting married in St Georges Chapel, WindsorThe 21st-century United Kingdom is an unrivalled brand on the global stage.The world was witnessing more than mere pomp and circumstance.This was UK plc on international parade, joining hands with the global community in a way no other nation can match — even the mighty USA.Had Meghan married into the family of a French or American president, a German Chancellor or a Kremlin tsar, would anyone have tuned in?Neither China nor Russia could captivate so many friendly eyeballs.The Olympics might do it.But London 2012 revealed Britain is best on these occasions, too.On Saturday, Britain proved it is capable of reaching out to a world beyond borders.Harry and Meghan’s marriage bonded the UK indelibly with the US.If the new Duke and Duchess have kids, they will be American citizens — as well as British due to Harry’s lineage — and will eventually be liable to American tax.Importantly, this wedding had special significance for the 2.5billion citizens of 52 Commonwealth countries, especially in Africa and the Caribbean, who swear allegiance to the Queen.My Australian in-laws were constantly on the phone from Sydney this weekend, all thoughts of becoming a republic abandoned, to discuss the finer points of royal protocol.But this event was watched from lands with no current ties to Britain — South America, the Far East and the Gulf States.It was a showcase of modern Britain forever adapting to change, the key to our success as an outward-looking nation.There was a clear hint of defiance, too. This steely couple were doing it their way.Our Brexit negotiators — on both sides of the argument — should take note.That big wide world, viewing us in high definition on Saturday, is where Britain’s future lies.These are our markets.The audience liked what they saw and they want some of what we’re having.In marketing terms alone, it was priceless.Too often we underestimate our strength and standing.We have developed an absurd inferiority complex.We’ve been led to believe we are too weak and puny to stand alone on the global stage.Yet we are among the world’s greatest economies, second only to Germany in the EU.We are a nuclear power with a real professional army which has helped keep the peace in Europe, and have an envied place on the UN Security Council.Republican lefties despise all this stuff.They smear Britain’s record as a brutal colonial power while ignoring our global lead in abolishing slavery.Disturbingly, some Conservatives seem to agree the UK is washed up and past its prime.Since we cannot run our own economy, they say, we should hand the job to unelected bureaucrats in Brussels.These, remember, would be the same Brussels flunkies who created the euro, wrecked the economies of member states and put millions of unemployed young people on the scrap heap.Most of those workless youngsters gratefully upped sticks and moved here.I wonder why?Saturday’s Royal Wedding showed we are in the Premier League.Now the world is watching, perhaps with slightly less enthusiasm, as another British saga lurches towards its climax — another broken family consumed with jealousy and bent on revenge.The cast is familiar — the statutory drunk, a bully who prefers to talk with a gun in his hand, some characters who would prefer a car crash to a happy ending.Can we stop the bickering and reach a good Brexit deal?Why can’t the Leavers and Remainers put the country first, join hands, bury their differences and take a vow to work together to serve the national interest?Inspired by the Royal Wedding, by the poem Invictus, we can rise above petty differences.“We are the masters of our fate: We are the captains of our soul.”Want to celebrate Harry and Meghans wedding like a royal?Weve made a brand new Snapchat lens just for the big day!Unlock The Suns Royal Wedding lens on Snapchat here and send us your snaps to @TheSunUKOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Then everyone danced, which really kicked off the party.”The bride’s US heritage was marked with the boozy American university drinking game beer pong, where players throw table tennis balls into cups of beers which their opponents then have to consume.The reception insider said: “Sere­na Williams played beer pong like it was tennis. Everyone had so much fun with it, there were even fireworks.”Charles and wife Camilla are thought to have left the party at Windsor’s Frogmore House before the celebrations became really wild.The source said: “Prince Charles and Camilla headed off at about 10.30pm, leaving the younger ones to party.It started to close down at about midnight to 1am — then people headed off to London, although some stayed.”Hollywood superstar George Clooney, 57, whisked Meghan away for a dance and also took Kate Middleton for a twirl, it was claimed.Pork belly and Pol Roger champagne was served. There was festival-themed food, with burger nibbles and bespoke cocktails.The source added: “There was a glass marquee for the dinner, festival-themed stalls and bars outside, with different themed drinks.“There were burger bar stalls, whiskey bars, candy floss, games to play, acts performing and a DJ with a dance floor.There was a gin vermouth cocktail created for Charles and Camilla, who are both massive gin fans apparently.”Cars were supplied by Jaguar Land Rover and there were also VIP buses with tinted windows to ferry guests around.The Sun revealed guests were also offered a cocktail called When Harry Met Meghan — a rum-based drink with a hint of ginger ale.The source confirmed: “That also went down a storm. Everyone found it hilarious.”The black-tie evening party was a sit-down dinner for 200 people.To provide the food, Harry and Meghan had hired Clare Smyth, Britain’s top chef and the first woman to hold three Michelin stars.Guests were told to “dress to the nines” for a night of “old-fashioned glamour and gallons of champagne”.Celebrity DJ Sam Totolee, who was hired by Rod Stewart and Uma Thurman for their wedding receptions, was on the decks.Actor Idris Elba also took a turn at DJ’ing, with a playlist filled with soul classics, 1960s R\u0026ampB and 1980s dance hits.As guests arrived at the evening party, they were asked to hand in their phones to prevent any ­unauthorised videos or pictures.In a striking break with royal tradition, Meghan gave a speech in which she thanked Prince Charles for walking her down the aisle and for such a “warm welcome” into the Royal Family.Harry also gave a “rip-roaring” speech and said he looked forward to “spending the rest of my life” with Meghan.But it was brother William, 35, who brought the house down ­during a joint speech with Harry’s best pal Charlie van Straubenzee.They teased the groom about his thinning hair and told Meghan she was “the best thing that had ever happened to Haz”.One guest said: “William managed to strike just the right balance between hilarious and solemn.“He did mention their late mother, Princess Diana, and said how proud she would have been of her younger son.He said he was proud of Harry too and welcomed Meghan as the sister he never had and the best thing that had ever happened to Haz.“But when he and Charlie got going, it was hilarious.They teased Harry about his growing bald patch and Wills said it would become as bad as his. It was some bash.”Celebrity guests included George Clooney and wife Amal, actress Priyanka Chopra, plus Meghan’s best friend Jessica Mulroney with her husband Ben.Society party planner Alexander Seamus Fitzgibbons — who arranged Wills and Kate’s evening do in 2011 and Pippa Middleton’s wedding — organised the bash through his company Fait Acompli.They worked with Gordon Ramsay protégée Clare, who runs her own restaurant in London’s Notting Hill, where dinner can cost £150 a head.Her specialities include crab and black truffle royale, Isle of Mull scallops, Scottish venison and Mont-Blanc pain perdu.Bleary-eyed celebs nursed epic hangovers yesterday after the knees-up — including actress Meghan’s on-screen lover, Patrick J Adams, who gushed: “She stole the show.”Patrick, 36, who plays Michael Ross in Suits, paid tribute to the new Duchess as he checked out of the luxurious Coworth Park hotel, where Wills and Harry had spent the night before the wedding.He said: “She looked beautiful and the day was amazing. We’re all so proud of Meg, she looked beautiful and stole the show.”Other celeb pals of the royal couple staggered out throughout the morning.James Corden left looking worse for wear, shouting at staff: “Let’s do it again at Christmas.”Suits actor Rick Hoffman, 47, was spotted singing a boozy rendition of Michael Jackson’s Billie Jean in a private section of the hotel.Jacinda Barrett, the wife of Gabriel Macht, 46 — another of Meghan’s co-stars — said: “Congratulations Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, what a beautiful and joyous day today was with your lovely family and friends.“I danced when Elton John sang, laughed at Prince Charles’ fantastic speech and am honoured to witness your commitment and love for each other, wishing you a long and happy life together.”She took her husband-to-be to several fittings at Kensington Palace but eventually settled on a slinky, lily-white Stella McCartney creation.A source said: “Meghan brought Harry along to get his seal of approval and was asking his opinion on everything she was trying on.“Harry wisely agreed that he liked everything and commented that fashion isn’t really his forte.”Amal Clooney, 40, and Oprah Winfrey, 64, also wore Stella McCartney for the Windsor ceremony.Jessica Mulroney, 38, whose three children were pageboys and bridesmaid, did not surface until the late afternoon.Prince Charles, 69, staged the glittering evening event for his son and Meghan, who had been given Princess Diana’s huge aquamarine ring as a wedding present from her husband.The Queen wore dark glasses yesterday as she attended Sunday morning service at The Royal Chapel of All Saints in Windsor Great Park. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Oh well.Most married couples leave it 18 months before they reach that arrangement.But on that bombshell it was on with the Royal Wedding, which normally divides the nation into two distinct camps.There are the royalists, who have great fun watching all the pomp and pageantry on television.And the republicans, who have great fun hating all the pomp and pageantry on television.So the only real choice to be made, for all of us, is: Which channel?Personally, six hours of a photobombing Kay Burley giving it the full Partridge on Sky News was a punishment that’s way beyond me, as was five hours of the E! channel gang ­yelling: “Oh my God. Wow!”ITV was never going to be anything less than thoroughly professional in the hands of Julie Etchingham and Phillip Schofield, once he shut up about Holly Willoughby, so I went with the Beeb, where Naga called it a night shortly after announcing Prince Harry was now: “The Duke of Essex.”Oi! Oi! “Sussex rather.” Oh. Pity.The real surprise for some of you, though, might have been discovering that to give it an informal vibe, ­alongside Kirsty Young, BBC1’s 9am-and-beyond coverage was now being fronted by the strangely contorted ­figure of Dermot O’Leary — the former host of ITV’s The Marriage Ref.A show that may have been the ­perfect rehearsal for most royal ­weddings, but probably not this one.They weren’t alone, obviously.The Beeb had the joint surrounded, in fact, by among others Huw Edwards, ­fashion expert Jo Elvin, who was “across the dress” (as clueless as the rest of us), Alex Jones, Ore Oduba and Anita Rani, who performed the ­essential task of repeating what the other person had just said.Ore: “First glimpse of the dress, it’s going to be a moment.”Anita: “It’s going to be a moment.” Traditionally, of course, on these great state occasions, the moment TV crews start interviewing other TV crews is the cue for the coverage to descend into flannel, repetition, idle speculation, cliche (“Excitement’s ­building”), imponderable questions and outright stupidity.On Saturday, by slight contrast, the trigger was actually the arrival of Oprah Winfrey and the first trickle of celebrity guests, who had a clearly ­nervous ­Dermot asking: “When the invite says ‘hats’, does that mean hats are an absolute given?”“Absolutely, it does,” said Kirsty, slapping him down testily.It got progressively worse with each arrival as well.So by the time Amal Clooney wafted in alongside husband George, who was dressed as one of Modern Romance, even basic motor tasks seemed beyond some of the BBC team.Kirsty: “It can be difficult to wear a hat, can’t it?”Jo: “I think so, yes.”In fairness, it should also be stated this idiocy was certainly not restricted to the BBC.I switched over to ITV during the ­arrivals and heard Meghan’s old drama teacher, Gigi Perreau, say: “This is incredible and we’re right there. Well, we’re here but we’re also there, so it’s fabulous.”It’s just the nature of the beast.With so much time to fill, everyone will say these things.Only the BBC, though, could possibly leave me feeling queasy with the choice of one of its Royal Wedding experts.This was left-wing “social commentator” Afua Hirsch, who was privately educated and has led a life of unimaginable advantage, compared to most of us, but is also a professional victim who thinks pretty much ­everything is “racist”, wants Nelson’s Column torn down and wasn’t about to drop her agenda with such a large audience at her mercy.“While I have felt alienated by the inherited privilege,” said Afua, who’s enjoyed more than most, “my own struggles with identity have made me appreciate the need for cultural ­continuity.“So while I didn’t relate to the Royal Family, I did relate to that need for a sense of tradition.”Quite a brass neck, isn’t it, speaking out against the whole concept of the Royal Family, while simultaneously using them to increase your TV profile, as Afua had been doing all week.Instead of telling her so, or pointing out Harry’s ex Chelsy Davy had arrived while she was guffing away, a nodding Dermot said he could listen to Afua “all day”.A claim I doubt, frankly.Indeed, I reckon he’d have been throwing himself off Windsor Castle’s ramparts before breakfast if he’d tried.No one else, I suspect though, was listening to a single word she said.Nor will they have needed Afua’s lofty approval to enjoy a day filled with so many memorable events, including Bishop Michael Curry’s fiery address to the congregation, the ­reappearance of the Duke of Edinburgh and Meghan’s Rolls-Royce ­hurtling up the Long Walk past 100,000 Union Flags like it was being driven by Richard Hammond.These are all magical moments you’ll possibly want to watch again — and if you do, having sat through both start to finish, I’d probably recommend the ITV version.It had the better ­historic detail, was never in any danger of missing Chelsy Davy’s arrival and rounded everything off nicely as well.Over on the BBC, meanwhile, Kirsty did it by searching for profundities and going where angels feared to tread.“Something has travelled between Harry and Meghan that might be the next page of the story, where they give us a gorgeous little product of their union which we might enjoy too . . . ?”Though not if Naga’s honeymoon arrangements are to be believed, they won’t.Obviously.Want to celebrate Harry and Meghans wedding like a royal?Weve made a brand new Snapchat lens just for the big day!Unlock The Suns Royal Wedding lens on Snapchat here and send us your snaps to @TheSunUKOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It was a day of history.And as the couple kissed on the steps of St George’s Chapel, Windsor, it felt like a new beginning.Here, we celebrate the day in words and pictures.It will always be remembered as the day worlds collided – and changed the course of the monarchy for ever.In St George’s Chapel, Windsor, surrounded by the long-buried kings and queens of England, British ceremony and American soul were put centre stage, blending centuries- old tradition and a forward-looking future.But for all the spectacle, for all the significance of a blue-blooded prince marrying a mixed-race divorcee, it boiled down to a lovestruck young couple who couldn’t keep their eyes off each other, who pledged themselves to each other like they just couldn’t believe their luck.As fiery Episcopal preacher Michael Curry later said in his soaring sermon on the power of love: “Two young people fell in love and we all showed up.”And didn’t we just.Across the country, in homes and pubs and parks, huddled around TVs or crowded in front of big screens, the British gathered to do what we do best.Armed with bottles of prosecco and supermarket sausage rolls, patriots prepared to swell with pride while cynics expected to laugh at those silly posh people and their stuffy old manners.In the event, of course, one and all were blindsided with emotion as a lovely young couple publicly declared their love.In Windsor the well-wishers stood 20 deep. They hoped to glimpse that cheeky prince who had lost his mum and lost his way, but who had grown into a fine young man — and had now found his soulmate.Bigwigs at the local tourist board must have been rubbing their hands in glee as pictures of the Berkshire town, looking resplendent in the dazzling May sunshine, were beamed around the world to a TV audience of 1.9billion.In fact, it was the kind of morning that couples who plan to marry in England — in the springtime — don’t dare to dream of.Perhaps Meghan is too American to have made the much-voiced wish of all British brides: “I don’t mind if it’s not sunny as long as it’s dry.”But if she did, her wish was more than granted.It must have been a relief to the VIP guests — and the handpicked normos who Meghan and Harry had invited to stand in the chapel grounds — that the weather had decided to put on its wedding best.It meant there were no umbrellas to ruin a fashion parade which would give the Oscars and the Met Ball a run for their money.The great, the good and the downright unexpected from the worlds of showbiz and sport joined bonafide aristocrats on the walk to the chapel, which was only missing a red carpet.Who on earth would have expected Chloe Madeley — daughter of Richard and Judy, and who insists she and rugby-player fiance James Haskell have sex every single day — to wangle an invite to a royal wedding?But there she was, alongside America’s very own version of the queen — Oprah Winfrey — as well as Idris Elba, Carey Mulligan and Marcus Mumford, James Blunt and the assorted cast of Suits.The male guests wore new suits, new shoes, new shirts, new ties. One, Mike Tindall, even had a new nose.The women had put as much thought into their hats as their outfits, and there were plenty of creations that you’d not have been happy to sit behind in the chapel for fear of them blocking your view.Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie turned up in disappointingly subdued hats — determinedly sidestepping a repeat of the furore over the outlandish designs they wore to William and Kate’s 2011 nuptials.Instead, Eugenie looked like a Fifties air hostess, while Beatrice channelled a Tudor peasant.Chelsy Davy, who dated Harry on-off for seven years, wore the kind of facial expression you would expect of any woman about to endure the wedding of her ex.At least she had moral support from another of Harry’s former flames, Cressida Bonas, and the two girls apparently arrived together.Britain’s alternative royal couple — the Beckhams — were naturally in attendance, with Posh accessorising her funereal navy shift dress with the sort of scowl that only someone who hasn’t eaten a carb since 2001 can really pull off.To Victoria’s undoubted dismay, she and David were upstaged by one of the few celebrity couples who can eclipse the Beckham star power – George Clooney and wife Amal, who was resplendent in mustard yellow Stella McCartney.While the likes of Jonny Wilkinson, Tom Hardy and even Sir Elton John had to sit behind the rood screen in the nave — which could be cruelly deemed the “cheap seats” — Amal and George were ushered into pole position in the quire, alongside the Royal Family.Was this Meghan, previously a relatively obscure star of a middling cable drama, pulling off the ultimate power move to cement her new status on the Hollywood A-List?As the guests took their seats — some more quickly than others, with Duchess of York Sarah Ferguson working the room like Tom Cruise — Meghan was preparing for the most nerve-racking drive of her life.Nine miles away at sumptuous Cliveden House, she was folding herself into the Queen’s 1950 Rolls-Royce Phantom IV, alongside her mum, Doria Ragland.When she was a youngster voraciously devouring Andrew Morton’s book on Princess Diana, or posing on the railings outside Buckingham Palace aged 15, could Meghan ever, even in her wildest moments, have imagined it might lead to this?When she was toiling to get a foot in the door in the acting profession, constantly boxed in by her so-called “ethnically ambiguous identity” — could she have dreamed that one day she’d be one of the most famous women in the world?Who knows what went through her head on the 26-minute drive to the chapel, and who knows what she may have said to her mum, who had raised her alone and who was at her side as she has always been?All we got was a glimpse of Meghan’s veiled face, looking remarkably composed as she waved to the crowd.Her American dream was about to come true — proof you really can be anything you want.Meanwhile, back at the chapel, Meghan’s beloved was arriving — in a laughably understated people carrier.Harry and best man Wills piled out — it really is impossible to get out of one of those cars elegantly — and the crowd whooped at the first glimpse of them in their dashing Blues and Royals uniforms.Harry looked nervous, but seemed to relax a little when his brother joked: “My trousers are too tight.”Those who remember the same princes as solemn young boys, walking grief-stricken behind their mother’s coffin, will have thrilled to see their easy intimacy as grown men, born from supporting each other through so much. Diana would have been delighted.With William and Harry in their seats at the front of the chapel — William keeping up a steady flow of whispered banter, just as Harry did when he was his best man — it was time for the mother of the bride to make her entrance.Doria, in mint green Oscar de la Renta, offset by her nose ring and dreadlocks, looked overcome with emotion as she took her place at the front of the church.Things don’t get much more surreal than arriving shortly before the Queen of England to watch your daughter marry a prince.But Doria also looked alarmingly alone – the only member of Meghan’s family to attend following a turbulent week which had ultimately resulted in the no-show of Meghan’s dad Thomas.Then Harry caught Doria’s eye and gave her a reassuring nod, and it was clear that she didn’t need anyone with her because she had a new family right here. That family could surely never have imagined that someone like Doria — a yoga teacher from California — would one day be their in-law.And yet here were Charles and Camilla — wearing what looked like a dead flamingo on her head — ready to cement that relationship.Finally, the Queen arrived, wearing lime green, accompanied by her ever steadfast husband, Prince Philip, who displayed the best of British stoicism by walking himself unaided down the aisle in his first public appearance since hip replacement surgery six weeks ago.Her Majesty was here to preside over the marriage of her grandson to an American divorcee — and it was down to another American divorcee that the Queen is the monarch at all.When Edward VIII fell in love with Wallis Simpson the Royal Family went into meltdown and the nation lost a king to exile and ignominy because tradition and the powers-that-be deemed it impossible he could marry such a woman.Yet here was Edward’s niece, 82 years later, ready to welcome Meghan with the closest the British upper class get to open arms.By her side was Philip, a man often seen as the old guard, but who has in fact spent his life fighting the whispering, back- stabbing traditionalists who had often treated him as an outsider too.If that parallel shows how far the Royal Family has come in embracing modern life, then they were about to get dragged further forward still by the arrival of the most modern bride in royal history.But first, the entrance of an adorable gaggle of page boys and flower girls, mainly children of Harry and Meghan’s closest friends — and of course four-year-old Prince George and his sister Princess Charlotte, three, who stole the show by sticking her tongue out at the crowds.The Duchess of Cambridge, generously in a cream Alexander McQueen coat dress she had worn three times before to make sure all eyes were on Meghan, was an earth mother in sharp tailoring as she ushered the children inside.Miraculously, the charming band of under-sevens all behaved themselves impeccably.Then finally — the moment the world had been waiting for.The bride stepped from her car and took away the collective breath of 1.9billion television viewers.After months of speculation, she revealed her gown to be the sort of showstopper that takes extortionate amounts of planning, time and money to make, but somehow manages to look effortless.Designed by British Givenchy boss Clare Waight Keller, the £200,000 ivory white gown demurely showed off Meghan’s figure to perfection.The look was completed with Queen Mary’s bandeau tiara, loaned to Meghan by the Queen, and a 16ft organza veil and train.It was embroidered with flowers from all 53 Commonwealth countries, as well as Meghan’s two favourite plants, the California poppy and wintersweet. Watching at home, her dad Thomas Markle declared: “My baby looks beautiful.”With her hair swept back in an elegant bun and a boat neck that showed off her delicate clavicles, Meghan had more than a little Audrey Hepburn about her. Which was appropriate, given that she was about to embark on the greatest screen moment of her life.Meghan was to become the first royal bride to walk herself down the aisle — before meeting Prince Charles half way for the final steps up to her betrothed. Before she set off on her momentous journey down the aisle, Meghan took a breath and gave a small smile, a picture of poise and composure.Who else in the world could have been so calm, so elegant, at such a moment?Watching Meghan’s progress on the arm of his dad, Harry – reddening with nerves – bit back tears, then met her eyes with a massive grin.As she reached the altar, Harry turned to Charles and murmured: “Thank you, Pa.” Then gazing at Meghan, he told her: “You look amazing, absolutely gorgeous.”Eagle-eyed viewers on Twitter were convinced that he added “I’m s***ting it” — easy to believe of a prince famous for his irreverent sense of humour.But it seems he actually told her “I missed you”, in reference to the night they had spent apart.Holding each other’s gaze, the air between Meghan and Harry crackled with chemistry that you could almost taste through the TV.It was as if they were the only people in the world — while across the globe, viewers at home found their eyes pricking with tears of joy.The tension was broken by the Dean of Windsor’s opening address: “The gift of marriage brings husband and wife together in the delight and tenderness of sexual union and joyful commitment to the end of their lives.”To their credit, the congregation managed to keep a straight face at the words “sexual union” — the rest of the British public, watching at home, were not so composed.There was further levity when the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, asked the couple if they knew of any reason why they could not marry. As is practically the law at British weddings, this provoked a wave of nervous laughter.Then it was time for the vows. Harry lifted Meghan’s veil to reveal her beautiful face, flawless in restrained make-up that showed off those trademark freckles, her eyes filled with wonder that this was actually happening.In the quintessentially English setting of St George’s Chapel, it felt almost incongruous — but wonderfully refreshing — to finally hear Meghan proclaim “I will” in her soft American accent.The couple promised to love, comfort, honour and protect each other with the sort of sincerity which would move even the hardest heart.If you weren’t bawling already, then surely the sight of Lady Jane Fellowes, sister of Harry’s beloved, lost mum Diana, arriving to deliver the reading would set you off.Taken from the Book of Solomon, the passage proclaimed that “love is strong as death, passion fierce as the grave”.Then the vaulting voices of the St George’s Chapel Choir delivered Thomas Tallis’s If Ye Love Me, British choral tradition at its finest.But traditions are there to be broken, and that’s where the Most Reverend Michael Curry came in.Theatrical, fire-breathing and entirely unrestrained by time, the man chosen to give the sermon was about as un-British as they come.The first African-American bishop to lead the Episcopal Church in the US, 65-year-old Curry was reportedly recommended to the couple by the Archbishop of Canterbury.He had described him as a “brilliant pastor, stunning preacher and someone with a great gift for sharing the good news of Jesus Christ.”This, it transpired, was an understatement.In a barnstorming address which ran to more than 13 minutes, Curry waxed lyrical about “harnessed fire” and “the redemptive power of love.” He quoted Martin Luther King and referenced justice, poverty and slavery in a room full of some of the planet’s richest and most privileged people.His passionate delivery was hailed on social media as the highlight of the service, but inside the chapel the faces of the senior royals, not used to this sort of unrestrained thundering, were a sight to behold.Beatrice and Eugenie got the giggles, Camilla and Charles seemed to be stifling laughter, and Kate looked like she had swallowed a wasp.The Queen was impassively stoney faced while Zara Phillips was open-mouthed.Meanwhile, the congregation were being wowed by a sublime cello performance from Sheku Kanneh-Mason.Young, gifted, British and black, and playing some of the most beautiful classical music ever written, Sheku epitomised how effortlessly Meghan and Harry had pulled together the old world and the new.The bride and groom returned for a rousing rendition of the National Anthem, then it was out into the dazzling sunshine as the choir sang the Etta James version of Amen/This Little Light Of Mine and the crowd whooped and hollered.On the steps of the chapel, underneath an Instagram-worthy floral arch, Meghan turned to her new husband and asked: “Do we kiss?” No prizes for guessing that he replied with an enthusiastic: “Yeah!”And just like that, there it was, sealed with a kiss — proof that fairytales really do come true. Everyone wanted a taste of the magic, and the newlyweds obliged with a thrillingly romantic carriage ride through the streets of Windsor, aboard the 13ft-long Ascot Landau.Meghan couldn’t quite believe the sea of people all there to wish them well, repeatedly mouthing “Wow.” Harry, meanwhile, told her: “I’m ready for a drink now.”It was a spectacular sight — the open-topped carriage, pulled by four Windsor greys and flanked by the household cavalry Blues and Royals.British pageantry at its best, but in typically British fashion most viewers were distracted by a rather lively looking horse at the front, which seemed ready to make a break for it.Thanks to the efforts of its rider, the horse’s behaviour remained just on the right side of disastrous.The feelgood atmosphere was infectious, with crowds singing “Harry and Meghan sitting in a tree, k-i-s-s-i-n-g.”Those thousands of well-wishers may not have been invited to the wedding reception, but you can be certain they carried on the party for many hours to come.Meghan and Harry were headed for St George’s Hall state room in Windsor Castle, where they treated 600 guests to a spread of canapes including Scottish langoustines and croquettes of Windsor lamb.Charles gave a speech praising how Harry had grown into “a big man with a big heart”, while Harry provoked cheers when he introduced Meghan as “my wife.”In a speech that had his guests in stitches, Harry gently ribbed the Americans by warning them not to steal the swords, and implored them to leave quietly so as “not to wake the neighbours”.Speaking from the heart, he praised Meghan for “navigating everything with such grace” and added: “We make such a great team.”Few would disagree with that sentiment.Later, a privileged 200 friends and family were invited to an evening reception compered by James Corden at nearby Frogmore Hall, on the grounds of the Windsor estate.Harry and Meghan were pure Hollywood glamour as they made their journey to the do in an open E-Type Jaguar, she in stunning Stella McCartney halter neck gown and he in sharp tuxedo.Their ride is said to be the world’s most sought-after car, a blue 1968 model that has been converted to electric.With the number plate E190518 — the date of their marriage — it was the perfect transport for the world’s most sought-after couple.There was one guest missing from the day who Harry will surely have longed to be there, but she made her presence known nonetheless.Princess Diana would have loved the deeply personal touches the couple brought to their wedding, and the way they breathed new life into centuries of tradition.When Diana married into The Firm, the monarchy was still living in the past, and she was suffocated by the pomposity and stuffiness.Her legacy was to leave her sons with the thirst to modernise and humanise the institution they were born into, and that desire was writ large across this unique Royal Wedding.On his engagement to Meghan, Harry said that his mother and his fiancee would have been “best friends.”She may not have been there to share his joy at marrying Meghan, but Diana was there in spirit. Meghan and Harry — now the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, thanks to new titles bestowed by the Queen — are back to reality tomorrow.They return to work undertaking their first royal engagement as man and wife, co-hosting a garden party at Buckingham Palace alongside Prince Charles.It may have been brief, but their wedding was the shining moment that we all needed amid the troubles and challenges of a world seemingly more divided than ever.For one glorious weekend we came together and felt good, celebrating the love and hope of two people at once so different to us, and so much the same.Across the country, on buses and in supermarket queues and in sunlit parks, it was all anyone could talk about.It was the same infectious cheerfulness and celebration of our common decency that Britain last experienced at the 2012 London Olympics.How strange that it took a royal wedding to prove that the values of tolerance and optimism are alive and well.Curry, ignoring his prepared text on the iPad in front of him, ploughed on undaunted.At one point he seemed to be coming to a close, saying “we’re gonna sit down, we gotta get y’all married” — before continuing for a further three minutes. Meghan liked it, though — she turned to Harry and mouthed: “Wow!”Just when you thought it couldn’t get less British, the address was followed by a spine-tingling rendition of Ben E King’s soul hit Stand by Me, by the London-based Kingdom Choir.The message was clear — Meghan and Harry intend to do things their way, and that includes looking forwards, and embracing Britain’s multicultural identity.Improbable as it may seem, Meghan and Harry are uniquely placed to do this. With Meghan, a proudly bi-racial woman, inside the fold, the Royal Family is finally starting to look a little more like the nation they represent.More than this, Meghan knows what it is to strive, to graft, to have a career and to have a marriage that doesn’t work, just like tens of thousands of Brits.Harry, while immensely privileged, is the most human face of the Windsors. He has known great personal tragedy but maintains his mother’s easy charm with ordinary folk.We’ve all watched him make very public mistakes — the booze, the hot-headed temper, the naked japes, the distasteful fancy dress.But it is precisely because of his flaws that Harry is our most beloved royal after the Queen — because it seems like he’s one of us.Together Meghan and Harry can make real changes — you need look no further than the rapt faces of the guests listening to the gospel choir to know this is true.Apart from former PM Sir John Major, who was appointed William and Harry’s special  after the death of Diana in 1997, and Winston Churchill’s grandson Sir Nicholas Soames — there on virtue of being a close family friend rather than his political career — there were no staid politicians in attendance.Instead, Harry and Meghan invited the representatives of causes they cared about, in a signal of what they plan to prioritise once they were married.Weve made a brand new Snapchat lens just for the big day!Unlock The Suns Royal Wedding lens on Snapchat here and send us your snaps to @TheSunUKThere was Karl Lokko, a former gang leader turned youth community activist, Suhani Jalota, whose Myna Mahila Foundation attempts to improve women’s menstrual health hygiene in India, and Dave Henson, who helped Harry build his Invictus Games.It is an exciting taste of things to come — and do not doubt the power of this extraordinary couple. When Harry publicly took an HIV test, self-testing increased by 500 per cent. The impact he and Meghan may have is boundless.But they are more than a power couple — they are starstruck lovers, too. Nowhere was this more apparent than at the moment they swapped wedding bands, when Harry tenderly stroked Meghan’s finger as he slipped a Welsh gold ring on it.The delight on their faces when the Archbishop finally pronounced them husband and wife would be familiar to giddy newlyweds everywhere.After Guide Me, O Thou Great Redeemer — Diana’s favourite hymn, which was played both at her funeral and at William and Kate’s wedding — Meghan and an emotional Prince Harry slipped off to sign the register.How they must have treasured those few private moments. All of us who had witnessed them unable to tear their eyes off each other were hoping they put the privacy to good use, by indulging in some passionate snogging.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Just look at once-rich Venezuela, where socialism resulted in the poor starving to death and there being no medicine for the sick.Madly, McDonnell yesterday claimed the South American country’s problem was that it was not socialist enough. He also said he wanted a “zero- tolerance” approach to anti-Semitism, yet defended Labour’s appointment of Martha Osamor to the House of Lords.That’s the same Martha Osamor who claimed the party’s anti-Semitism row was manufactured as “a tool to intimidate activists on the Left”.We wouldn’t expect anything less from McDonnell, a man who glorified the IRA, described London rioters as “the best of our movement” and joked about lynching a Tory minister.There are rumours the Government is insanely considering calling a snap election — risking handing this scary clown the keys to the country finances.The Tories would not just be gambling their future, but Britain’s.CULTURE Secretary Matt Hancock is right to get tough with the social media giants.For far too long Facebook and Google have shown no concern for the youngsters using their sites.Mr Hancock invited 14 of the internet giants to a consultation.

You have to be happy with who you are.”The Pope’s words signal a much more open and inclusive approach by the often restrictive faith – a move which will likely upset many conservative Catholics.The Vatican has neither confirmed nor denied the comments the Pontiff’s comments to Cruz.The Catholic Church teaches that gay sex – and all sex outside of heterosexual marriage – is a sin.This is not the first time Pope Francis’ comments have suggested a more open and tolerant attitude toward homosexuality.In July 2013, when responding to a reporter’s question about the existence of an alleged “gay lobby” within the Vatican, Pope Francis said: “If a person is gay and seeks God and has good will, who am I to judge?The Pontiff’s most recent remarks come as several high profile members of the clergy have sought to publicly make amends with gay Catholics, many of whom say they feel shunned an d unwelcome in the church.Juan Carlos Cruz was one of three former sex abuse victims from Chile who were summoned to Rome to receive an apology from the Pontiff for years of abuse endured by them as children.The victims described clerical sexual abuse as “an epidemic that has destroyed thousands of lives.”Initially, the Pope had been slow to realise the gravity of the crisis in Chile, at one point even coming to the defence of a controversial bishop linked to Father Karadima.However, he swiftly changed his stance after Vatican investigators presented him with a 2,300-page dossier documenting the sexual abuse of minors that had been covered up in Chile for decades.Last week, Chile’s 34 bishops offered to resign en masse over the abuse scandal, in an unprecedented move in the history of the Catholic Church."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000407683714.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"couple raffle off 3m six bed house that they cant sell for 25 a ticket","story":"Mark and Sharon Beresford put the six-bed riverfront home on the market two years ago.But managing director Mark, 61, said: “It just didn’t sell.It seems people don’t have £3million to spend on a house at the moment.”The Beresfords, whose three kids have now grown up, built the glass and wood home near Ringwood, Hants, 11 years ago with German firm Huf Haus.It has seven reception rooms, its own cinema and a parking block.There are 250,000 tickets available but if fewer than 130,000 are sold by the July 31 draw, a cash prize will be given.   Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Later, I went back with him after he had built a night school for the boys, and asked over a cup of tea: “Why are you doing this, Harry?”He replied: “This is the most important thing I do.”It tells you everything about who his mother was.Inside the Chapel, the hymn was Guide Me, O Thou Great Redeemer, which was played at Princess Diana’s funeral and one of her favourites.Di’s sister Lady Jane Fellowes delivered the only reading. Listening to it was Sarah, the Duchess of York, who had not been invited to other recent royal weddings.Inviting Fergie was a brilliant thing to do. During Diana’s troubled times every Sunday she would drive down to Berkshire to have lunch with Fergie, spending the afternoon talking about their divorces.Outside in the Chapel courtyard were 2,000 people from Harry and Meghan’s charities, including servicemen who have lost limbs.Harry is following Diana’s hugely successful campaign to stop landmines by working with those who have been wounded by IEDs.When Harry was flying back from one of his tours of Afghanistan he shared the plane with three soldiers who were in a coma.He realised these soldiers, if they recovered, would have limbs missing and facing a life of misery — which is why he inspired them with his support for the Invictus Games.And Harry and Meghan asked guests to make donations to the Children’s HIV Association.Harry has clearly never forgotten how his mother took the stigma out of Aids by embracing sufferers, including babies in Brazil.And then there was the ring. On Saturday night Meghan was wearing the emerald-cut aquamarine ring Diana first wore in 1996.Harry once told ITV’s Tom Bradby: “I wanted to do something that would make my mother proud.” He succeeded on Saturday.Want to celebrate Harry and Meghans wedding like a royal?Weve made a brand new Snapchat lens just for the big day!Unlock The Suns Royal Wedding lens on Snapchat here and send us your snaps to @TheSunUKOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I got the tattoo because that’s exactly how I feel.“Luckily I’m still here, I’m not number 23. It was horrific.”Piotr told how he was nearly killed as he texted wife Ewa, 46, and daughter Amelia, 12, while waiting to collect them at the end of the US star’s concert at Manchester Arena.He arrived at the venue around 10.30pm and stood next to a pillar on the right side of the exit foyer as concert goers began to filter out.Moments later, Abedi, 22, deton-ated his rucksack bomb packed with nuts and bolts — ripping holes in Piotr’s jeans and trainer.Piotr, who emigrated from Poland 13 years ago, said: “I sent a text to my wife saying ‘I’m here’. I was in the middle of texting where I was when suddenly, bang.“My phone shattered, I thought it had exploded. My first thought was ‘bloody phone’. Then my vision went in my eye a fraction of a second later — there was shrapnel flying everywhere.“I didn’t feel any pain, the first thing I did was hit the deck and crawled between the pillar and wall for safety. I was in the army in Poland and I was trained for this — it was instinct.”Piotr then recalled the harrowing aftermath as he drifted in and out of consciousness.He went on: “After the boom was silence. Then the screaming came and smoke and people running away and panic.“There were people lying all around me and nuts, bolts and metal everywhere. It was obvious it was a bomb.“I remember paramedics bringing a young girl on a spinal board.“They laid her on the ground and were pushing on her chest. There were people screaming her name and shouting ‘Come back’.“Then I saw the black bags, the body bags. It was horrific. I was really scared for my life because I’d started to feel pain in my stomach.“I was struggling to breathe — they had an oxygen mask on me. I was also worried about my family.“My phone was shattered, we weren’t in contact. All I could think was what had happened to my wife and daughter?”Security staff rushed to stricken victims’ aid and grabbed T-shirts to help stem the bleeding from Piotr’s left eye and body wounds.The maintenance engineer added: “I kept saying I couldn’t see out my eye, I thought it was just blood in it.“A police officer called John then turned up and said he could see it, he then stayed with me for a while.“Another cop Pete came and spoke to me to keep me conscious.I recognised the nuts because I work with them every day. I took one from my chest and kept hold of it. It turned out I had seven nuts in my body and legs.”Distraught Ewa and Amelia believed Piotr — also father to Kacper, 16, was dead before they were later reunited in hospital.He’d been moved to the entrance foyer where paramedics were triaging victims.He arrived in hospital at 2am — three-and-a-half hours after the explosion.He was whisked for an MRI scan but before cops took away a nut he was gripping on to.Piotr added: “I wanted to keep it but they said the police needed it.”He was rushed straight to theatre where his eye and wounds were operated on.Piotr had six operations on his eye, torso and legs during his month in hospital in Manchester.He also had numerous tests on his left eye but two weeks after the bomb, doctors broke the news that they couldn’t save it.He recalled: “That was the first time I felt sad. I felt a piece of me had been taken away.But I’ve always tried to think positively and I had a prosthetic eye put in.”WIFE Ewa revealed how she feared Piotr had been killed for an agonising 15 hours.The mum, 46, knew her hubby was waiting for her and daughter Amelia, 12, in the foyer where the explosion took place.And she was distraught at being unable to contact him — unaware his phone was shattered and he’d been taken to hospital.But she told of the amazing moment they were reunited.Ewa said: “I thought he was dead — we didn’t hear anything for 15 hours.I heard a bang at the end of the gig and someone said ‘this is a bomb attack’.“We weren’t able to get out the exit where Piotr was. At 2pm the next day, the police came to our hotel room and said I had to come to the hospital.“They took me into the ward and asked if this was Piotr.“I was so happy to see him, even though he was sleeping.”Piotr said he roused to see his wife, daughter and two pals who had draped a had a Scotland flag over his bed.He said: “I woke and they were all there. Bizarrely, the first thing I asked for was my nut, the one I’d taken out of myself.“We were only able to talk a short while before I was put in an induced coma for five days.”The dad still faces at least three operations on his jaw and injured eye in the coming months.And the attack has taken its toll emotionally on him and his wife.Piotr admitted: “When I hear a noise now, I’ll jump. I work in an industry where you hear bangs all the time, but it affects me now.“I’m not back at work yet but that’s because I still have operations to go. But my job is still there for me.My wife is suffering from PTSD so she is going through treatment. My daughter is okay though, she’s back to being a typical teenager.”Piotr revealed the harrowing events as he prepares to return to Manchester for a service where the 22 victims will be remembered.But in a sign of defiance he said: “Abedi tried to kill kids, including my own — but I don’t give him a second thought now. I ignore him.“I could hate him but it’s done, I’ve accepted what’s happened.

Hours after the former actress exchanged vows with Harry, the royal site had been updated to reflect its newest member. And a poignant quotation from Meghan takes centre stage - I am proud to be a woman and a feminist. The biography also highlights her lifelong commitment to a range of causes, including those promoting social justice and women\u0027s empowerment. It reflects on the royal bride\u0027s work aged just 11, when she successfully campaigned for the wording on a TV advert to be altered after it used sexist language to sell washing-up liquid.    Her Royal Highness also volunteered at a soup kitchen in Skid Row, Los Angeles from the age of 13-17, it adds. She continued to volunteer at the soup kitchen when she would return home to Los Angeles until the age of 22. Meghan\u0027s work with charities such as UN Women, for whom she became Women\u0027s Advocate for Women\u0027s Political Participation and Leadership in 2015, and as a Global Ambassador for World Vision are also noted. The newly married Duke and Duchess of Sussex will have little time to recover from their fairytale wedding as they head straight back to work this week. Unlike other newlyweds, Harry and Meghan will not be jetting off on a honeymoon straight away, and will instead be back on royal duty, carrying out their first official engagements as husband and wife.  The couple, who exchanged vows in a ceremony watched by millions across the world on Saturday, are due to attend a Buckingham Palace garden party on Tuesday as part of the Prince of Wales\u0027s 70th birthday celebrations. It will mark the beginning of a new life for former actress Meghan, who has already spoken of her desire to hit the ground running in her role as a full-time royal. Meghan is reported to have broken with tradition to give a speech of her own at the wedding reception. A visit to Australia is in the diary for October, for the 2018 Invictus Games, while other trips abroad this year are said to be in the pipeline. But despite their hectic schedules, the couple seized the opportunity to spend some time away from the public eye on Sunday.

But it reminded some of one of his grandfather\u0027s famous gaffes.  The 96-year-old Prince Philip, who is still recovering from a hip operation he underwent roughly six weeks ago, was at the ceremony at St George\u0027s Chapel to see Prince Harry marry Meghan Markle in a lavish and beautiful ceremony.  The Duke of Edinburgh is perhaps most famous for his history of gaffes and inappropriate remarks. Although he is thought to have been on his best behaviour alongside the Queen yesterday, that hasn\u0027t stopped one of his earlier remarks being dragged up again.  With Harry opening the door for the Duchess, politician turned comedian Gyles Brandreth reminded his followers on Twitter of what Prince Philip once reportedly said: If you see a man opening a car door for a woman, it means one of two things: it\u0027s either a new woman or a new car. In this case the woman was certainly a new wife and the car, while originally manufactured in 1968, has since been converted to electric power. The car is a concept model and the licence plate has a secret meaning.

The newlyweds will have a “mini-moon” celebration in the Republic of Ireland, according to sources, who say secret plans have been put in place. For Harry, 33, it will be his first visit to the Emerald isle - but Meghan, 36, has already visited as an ambassador for the One Young World summit in 2014. The itinerary for the planned visit in June or July is only in the early stages - but it is believed the new Duke and Duchess of Sussex will just stay for one night.   The trip could have added significance during a time of heightened tensions following Brexit negotiations and the UK’s relationship with Europe.  Meghan and Harry tied the knot in a dazzling wedding at St George\u0027s Chapel, Windsor Castle, yesterday, which was watched by millions globally. But unlike many other couples, they have chosen to forgo a traditional honeymoon - instead, immediately selflessly dedicating their time to royal duties. Together, they will throw themselves into a hectic schedule and follow through with Meghan’s vow to “hit the ground running” after the wedding. The Queen, who attended the ceremony in a lime green coat, is said to be delighted at how the public has taken the latest royal couple into their hearts.  Meanwhile, courtiers have devised plans to use the new \u0027power couple\u0027 - who revealed their engagement last November - as super-envoys across the world. The Mirror understands Harry and Meghan will undertake a Commonwealth tour in October, taking in Australia - where the prince will open his Invictus Games - and New Zealand, as well as the islands of Tonga and Fiji. But touchingly, their first official engagement as husband and wife will be in honour of Harry\u0027s dad Prince Charles\u0027s 70th birthday on Tuesday.  Meghan is said to have been overwhelmed with the Prince of Wales’s dedication to making both her and her mother, Doria Ragland , feel at ease during the lead-up to the wedding, and his earnest act of walking her up the aisle.   Kensington Palace announced the happy couple will attend the Buckingham Palace garden party to celebrate the heir to the throne\u0027s milestone birthday - which falls in November - by recognising his patronages and military affiliations as well as others involved in charities supported by the royal. Last night, Meghan and Harry partied with 200 of their closest friends and family in privacy at their \u0027festival-themed\u0027 wedding reception at Frogmore House. They were expected to head home to their cottage in Kensington Palace\u0027s grounds before attending the birthday patronage celebration for Charles. Today, while the Queen attended church, there was no sign of the newlyweds.   Inside Prince Harry and Meghan Markle\u0027s love affair with Africa   After the garden party, the couple will commit to a series of top level meetings with royal advisors to set out their plan for the coming year. The British Government, through the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, also hopes to cement ties with old friends and help smooth the path for trade. The pair - along with Charles and Camilla and William and Kate - will reportedly relish in their role to play a key role in “soft power”diplomacy for the UK. The destination of their official honeymoon is currently unknown.  However, some have predicted they might travel to Botswana, possibly to an exclusive safari camp which the couple visited in August last year.  Kensington Palace has always remained tight-lipped regarding the romantic break. But according to Reuters , Harry whisked Meghan away to the luxurious Mapula Lodge near the Okavango Delta to mark her 36th birthday in style.  There, the couple reportedly enjoyed a sunset cruise, early morning game drive and twilight dinner, with an onlooker telling the publication: They are like regular guys. They were just relaxed. You could see they were very happy together.  One royal source said countries like Botswana or Namibia - which also offers stunning wildlife and breathtaking scenery - could be top of the honeymoon list. Bookmakers Ladbrokes have seen a flurry of betting for the couple\u0027s honeymoon destination with Namibia emerging as the frontrunner at 2/1. Botswana - a close second at 4/1- is also a place the Duke loves and knows well. He even sourced the diamond in his bride\u0027s engagement ring from the country. Meghan and Harry\u0027s wedding, which was broadcast live on TV and captivated millions, blended ancient English ritual with African American culture.

The couple chose Whitney Houston’s hit I Wanna Dance With Somebody for their first jive. One of the 200 guests said of the \u0026shyreception: “It wasn’t \u0026shytraditional in the slightest. They went into a bit of a jive and a lindy hop.”  Another added: “As we walked in there were ladies dressed in black, serving us fizz and Pimms, as well as canapes from the palace staff. “That bit was a little formal with a bit of a line-up led by Charles and Camilla, with Wills and Kate to one side and Harry and Meghan in the middle of it all.” But the guest told how fun took over formalities once the party got into swing, adding: “It was informal and a lovely atmosphere. “The whole evening had a really chilled, festival vibe.”  Guest Suhani Jalota, who founded Mumbai charity Myna Mahila \u0026shyFoundation that Meghan visited last year, told Glamour \u0026shyMagazine: “I think everybody thought she looked beautiful. I got to speak to Meghan at the reception, when she and Prince Harry were meeting \u0026shyeverybody one by one. “Even after she has become the Duchess of Sussex, she hasn’t changed. I gave her a hug, I \u0026shycongratulated her.” There were Madame Tussauds waxworks of Meghan and Harry at the event, which followed an earlier reception for all 600 wedding guests. At that event, the prince moved them to tears by saying of his wife: “We make a great team.”  Evening reception guests included David and Victoria Beckham, tennis star Serena Williams, James Corden, Idris Elba, Amal Clooney and actress Priyanka Chopra. Brother and best man William was there with wife Kate as well as Fergie’s daughters Beatrice and Eugenie. Elba is reported to have turned DJ as the wedding group danced to 80s and 90s hits. A DJ who slipped his business card to Harry during a visit to Brixton in South London, hinted that it worked and he secured the commission to play at the do. Jevanni Letford posted a photo of Windsor with the caption: “Calm before the excitement.” In honour of Harry’s time in the forces, the evening was lubricated by cocktails with military names such as the Apache, the Brimstone, the Rapier and the Hellfire. Guests were given slippers to wear when their feet were tired from dancing. Actress Troian Bellisario, wife of Meghan’s former on-screen husband Patrick J Adams in Suits, posted on Instagram: “How amazing is this? “Because these shoes have come off. They have slippers for us. \u0026shySlippers! I’m so ready.” Harry’s ex Chelsy Davy, who had been spotted on TV looking glum as he tied the knot, appeared in a better mood at the party. She was all smiles and was even seen embracing Meghan, who wore \u0026shyPrincess Diana’s aquamarine ring. After Harry, 33, and Meghan, 36, left, guests were thought to have gone to an “after after party” at London’s Chiltern Firehouse. An insider said: “Harry and Meghan went about midnight, \u0026shyshattered and madly in love.”  But there was still time for a prank by William, who attached a ladder to the couple’s car. The guest said: “Apparently Harry fell off a ladder recently while changing a light bulb for Meghan and hurt his arm. So Wills tied a ladder to the back of the car, which nearly floored a few people.” Proud dad Charles gave a speech at the earlier reception at St George’s Hall in Windsor Castle. Talking about the man his son had become, he said: “My darling old Harry, I’m so happy for you.” "},{"url":null,"title":"meghan markle prince harry to","story":"NewsMeghan Markle and Prince Harry \u0027to fly to Mexico to visit to her dad\u0027 Thomas following major heart surgeryThomas Markle Snr had three stents fitted after suffering a heart attack in the run up to Meghan\u0027s royal wedding to Prince Harry in Windsor on Saturday\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByCharlotte Neal09:45, 21 MAY 2018Updated09:47, 21 MAY 2018NewsVideo LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in 8CancelPlay now\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThe newlywed Duke and Duchess of Sussex are planning to fly to Mexico to visit Thomas Markle Snr as he recovers from major heart surgery, according to reports. The 73-year-old couldn\u0027t walk his daughter Meghan down the aisle of St George\u0027s Chapel on Saturday due to ill health.  He suffered a heart attack in the week prior to the royal wedding amid speculation over his attendance and intensifying tensions between the bride and her Markle relatives, notably outspoken half-sister Samantha.   Kensington Palace released a statement from Meghan days before she tied the knot to Prince Harry, in which she said she has \u0027always cared for\u0027 her father.  Sadly my father will not be attending our wedding, she said.  I have always cared for my father and hope he can be given the space he needs to focus on his health. I would like to thank everyone who has offered generous messages of support.  Harry and Meghan have been in regular contact with Thomas Snr and are now discussing plans to visit him after their honeymoon, the Sun reports.  A family source told the paper the couple were devastated that he couldn\u0027t share their special day and have discussed seeing him soon as Meghan continues to worry about him and checks on him regularly.  They have been speaking all week, mostly by text, the source said. Thomas has told other family members he hopes and expects Meghan and Harry to come to see him.   The former Hollywood lighting director watched his daughter marry into the royal family from his bed in California, after having three stents fitted. He told US celebrity website TMZ: “I will always regret not being able to be there and not being able to hold my daughter’s hand.  “My baby girl is a duchess and I love her so much. “My baby looks beautiful and she looks very happy.” The father-of-the-bride claimed his heart attack was triggered by an open letter penned by his son Thomas Markle Jnr, who claimed Prince Harry was making the biggest mistake in royal history. He wrote: I\u0027m confused why you don\u0027t see the real Meghan that the whole world now sees. Meghan\u0027s attempt to act the part of a princess like a below C average Hollywood actress is getting old.

And her beloved beagle proved to be one of the highlights of the night as he entertained guests at the royal wedding evening reception.  The pet pooch had revellers in stitches as he caused chaos, running all over the place lapping up any spilled canap\u0026eacutes. Meghan, the new Duchess of Sussex, brought Guy to Britain with her last year when she relocated from her home in Toronto.  The decision was heartbreaking for Meghan as her other dog, Labrador-shepherd cross Bogart, was deemed too old to travel and had to be left behind. Meghan was also left devastated late last year when Guy reportedly suffered two broken legs. He was reportedly treated by TV supervet Professor Noel Fitzpatrick.  Prince Harry and Meghan told their closest friends of their love for one another at the late reception party after their spectacular wedding. Both of the newlyweds gave short informal speeches. Harry said how honoured he was to have such special people there with him. And he added: “You are the people that make me me in my Harry life, which as you know is the backbone to Prince Harry.” Then he gave way to his bride Meghan with the words “now I’m going to hand over to my far better half.”  An excited Meghan spoke for about four minutes about the big day, before she ended with the most emotional words of the night, telling her guests: “I have found my prince.” Guests arrived at 6pm for the most relaxed event of the night. One guest who was there said: “As we walked in there were ladies dressed in black, serving us fizz and Pimms, as well as canap\u0026eacutes from the palace staff. “That bit was a little formal with a bit of a line-up led by Charles and Camilla, with Wills and Kate to one side and Harry and Meghan in the middle of it all.” But after that, the party became a lot more relaxed. The guest said: “It was all very very informal, and had a lovely atmosphere. The whole evening had a really chilled, festival vibe.” The newlywed couple took to the dance floor inside Frogmore House for the first dance to Meghan’s favourite - Whitney Houston’s classic I Wanna Dance With Somebody. “It wasn’t traditional in the slightest,” said the guest. “They went into a bit of a jive and a lindy hop.”  But Harry was not the most popular dance partner... that was one of the sexiest men on the planet, Hollywood star George Clooney who danced with both bride Meghan and her new sister-in-law Kate. But to the amusement of many guests, the very first woman George asked to dance, Fergie, the Duchess of York, turned him down. Meanwhile some of Harry’s closest friends including ex-Para Jaco van Gass who suffered life-changing injuries in Afghanistan and became a Paralympics cyclist, along with guests such as Emily Sheffield - former Prime Minister David Cameron’s sister-in-law, hardly left the dance floor. Many TV viewers had remarked during the day on a sour expression on the face of Harry’s former girlfriend Chelsy Davy as she watched him tie the knot with Meghan. But at the party, she was all smiles and even seen embracing Meghan.  Big names like James Corden and Idris Elba happily chatted to fans but the guest said David and Victoria Beckham were “really aloof”. In honour of Harry’s time in the armed forces, the evening was lubricated by cocktails with military names such as the Apache, the Brimstone, the Rapier and the Hellfire. To the amusement of guests Madame Tussaud’s waxworks of Meghan and Harry were on display in a side room which caused all kinds of hilarity and mistaken identity as the night went on.

But despite her fancy new name, the American actress won\u0027t actually be a British citizen for several years. Meghan has been granted Leave to Remain, an immigration status which means there\u0027s no time limit on her stay in the country and she\u0027s allowed to work and study without any restrictions. However getting citizenship is a bit more complicated.  Kensington Palace has said Meghan will go through the normal visa process like everyone else. A spokesman said: Ms. Markle has taken full legal advice on her right to remain in the UK and will be fully compliant with all requirements at all times. She will go through the normal visa process. Ms. Markle intends to become a British citizen going through the normal process, which will take a number of years. The palace would not comment on whether Meghan is being given any special treatment because she is now a royal.  According to the government\u0027s website, there are a number of criteria you must meet in order to apply to become a citizen. These include:  You must be over 18 You must be of good character You\u0027ll have to continue living in the UK You\u0027ll have to prove you have a good knowledge of English You must have lived in the UK for five years before the Home Office gets your application. You can\u0027t have spent more than 450 days outside of the UK in those five years You must not have broken any immigration laws while you were in the UK.    Meghan has given up her job as an actress and will take up royal duties alongside her new husband.  Like her sister-in-law Kate, she will probably do lots of charity work with causes close to her heart. Meghan officially became a member of the royal family on Saturday when she married Prince Harry at St George\u0027s Chapel in Windsor Castle.

The presiding bishop of the American Episcopal Church, was entitled The Power of Love and was a meditation on love for individuals, family and the world. It had a variety of themes including civil rights, social justice, and the transforming power of love in politics and life. He also looked at the role of bride and groom, who are set to serve their country and family. He told guests that they must harness the redemptive power of love in order to right the world\u0027s wrongs. Bishop Curry asked guests to think how governments, countries and businesses could change when love is the way. He also quoted controversial Jesuit and Roman Catholic theologian Pierre Teilhard de Chardin, who said in his 1934 book The Evolution of Chastity that if human beings ever harness the energies of love, then for the second time in the history of the world, we will have discovered fire.    Here\u0027s the full transcript “The Power of Love” by the Most Rev. Michael B Curry for The Marriage of HRH Prince Henry of Wales \u0026amp Ms. Meghan Markle Saturday, May 19, 2018 Set me as a seal upon your heart, as a seal upon your arm for love is strong as death, passion fierce as the grave. Its flashes are flashes of fire, a raging flame. Many waters cannot quench love, neither can floods drown it. SONG OF SONGS 8:6-7  I. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. once said: “We must discover the power of love, the redemptive power of love. And when we discover that, we will be able to make of this old world a new world. Love is the only way.” There’s power in love. Do not underestimate it. Anyone who has ever fallen in love, knows what I mean. But think about love in any form or experience of it. It actually feels good to be loved, and to express love. There is something right about it. And there’s a reason. An old medieval poem says it: “Where true love is found, God himself is there.” The Bible, 1 John 4 says it this way: “Beloved, let us love one another because love is from God Everyone who loves is born of God. Whoever does not love does not know God For God is love.” (1John 4:4-8) There’s power in love. Love can help and heal when nothing else can. Love can lift up and liberate for living when nothing else will. And the love that brings two people together is the same love that can bind them together, Whether on mountaintops of happiness and through valleys of hardship. Love is strong as death It’s flashes are flashes of fire. Many waters cannot quench love Love can see you through! There’s power in love.  II But the love of which we speak is not only for couples getting married or just for interpersonal relationships. Jesus of Nazareth taught us that the way of love is the way to a real relationship with the God who created all of us, and the way to true relationship with each other as children of that one God, as brothers and sisters in God’s human family. One scholar said it this way: Jesus had founded the most revolutionary movement in human history: a movement built on the unconditional love of God for the world and the mandate to live that love. (Charles Marsh\u0027s The Beloved Community) And in so doing, to change lives and the world itself! There’s a reason. An old spiritual may suggest why: “If you cannot preach like Peter, And you cannot pray like Paul, You can tell the love of Jesus, How he died to save us all There is a balm in Gilead To make the wounded whole There is a balm in Gilead To heal the sin sick soul” “Just tell the love of Jesus, how he died to save us all.” He didn’t sacrifice his life for himself, or anything he could get out of it, He did it for others, for the other, for the good and well being of others, That’s love How does St. Paul say it? Love is not jealous, rude, or boastful. Love does not insist on its own way. Love is unselfish, sacrificial, kind and just. Love seeks the good and the well-being of the other. Love makes room and space for the other to be. (See 1 Corinthians 13:4-7) "},{"url":null,"title":"newcastle could europes biggest observation","story":"NewsNewcastle could get Europe\u0027s biggest observation wheel at 460ft high - dubbed the \u0027Whey Aye\u0027Standing beside the River Tyne, developers say it will be 16ft taller than the London Eye, and will create up to 550 jobs and see more than £100 million invested in the city\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByTom Wilkinson08:58, 21 MAY 2018Updated09:03, 21 MAY 2018NewsAn artist\u0027s impression supplied by World Wheel Company of plans for a new observation wheel in Newcastle Upon Tyne (Image: PA)\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailPlans have been announced to build Europe\u0027s biggest observation wheel in Newcastle - dubbed the Whey Aye.

The wheel will include a 11,960 square yards (10,000 sq m) LED digital screen in the middle, which will be used to communicate information about local culture and events as well as adverts. The proposed site is at the east end of the Quayside, on the site of the former Spillers\u0027 Flour Mill. Artist\u0027s impressions show the wheel standing far higher than other famous landmarks such as the Tyne Bridge and the Angel of the North.  Included in the experience would be bars and restaurants and a visitor attraction called Giants of the North, which would celebrate the achievements of the region\u0027s sports stars and business people through history. The plans were announced by the World Wheel Company, which has built and operated giant observation wheels and family entertainment centres around the globe. It said visitors would be taken on a 30-minute flight on the Whey Aye - the company\u0027s phonetic rendering of the enthusiastic Geordie phrase why aye. It hopes to attract 800,000 visitors in the first year. A detailed planning application will be submitted later this year.

Rhian Monteith’s simple idea could save the NHS tens of millions of pounds and bosses want it to go UK-wide. The 39-year-old drew up a list of 23 “frequent callers”– many lonely or with mental health problems – who had visited A\u0026ampE 703 times in three months. After a coffee meeting she mentored them, getting them to call her not 999. This cut their A\u0026ampE visits and ambulance call-outs in Blackpool by 90% and Rhian said: “I’m incredibly proud to see how my idea has grown.  “It shows, if you are armed with a phone and a high level of emotional intelligence, the difference you can have to people who need a hand up in life. “Every individual is put in contact with a person who cares about them, and stands with them in their time of need.” The High Intensity User scheme was scaled up to 300 patients in Blackpool over three years, saving \u0026pound2 million. It is now used in a fifth of the country and NHS England wants the rest to follow.

The hymn was his mother\u0027s favourite and the 33-year-old chose to include it as part of the ceremony as a tribute to Princess Diana , 21 years after it was sung at her funeral.   Prince Harry , who looked nervous as he walked into the chapel with his brother and best man Prince William , appeared to struggle with his emotions as his stunning bride walked up the aisle on her own - with her father too ill to attend.  But the new Duke of Sussex was again overcome with emotion as the touching hymn was sung. The song was performed at Diana\u0027s funeral at Westminster Abbey in 1997, when Prince Harry was just 12 years old.  Last year Harry admitted in a TV documentary he had only cried twice about his mother\u0027s death in a car crash in Paris, an event which shocked the world. He said: The first time I cried was at the funeral on the island, referring to Diana\u0027s private burial at Althorp. And only since then, maybe once more. There\u0027s a lot of grief that still needs to be... to be let out. By Nicola Small and Victoria Murphy Harry and Meghan made sure Princess Diana was not forgotten on their special day. From the flowers in Meghan’s bouquet to the music and the reading at the service, the couple ensured her presence was felt – 21 years after her crash death. The only reading was about the power of eternal love, with Diana’s sister Lady Jane Fellowes, 61, triggering tears as she said from the Old Testament Song of Solomon: “My beloved speaks and says to me, ‘Arise, my love, my fair one, and come away for now the winter is past, the rain is over and gone’.” She was joined at the service by Diana’s other sister, Lady Sarah McCorquodale, and her brother Earl Spencer, along with Harry’s Spencer family cousins. Also present was former Prime Minister John Major, who was appointed special  to Princes Harry and William, responsible for legal and administrative matters, when Diana died in the Paris underpass. No British or overseas dignitaries were invited to the wedding, so Mr Major’s presence was a reminder of the pivotal role he played in Harry’s life at a traumatic time. When Meghan arrived at St George’s Chapel, she was carrying a bouquet with Diana’s beloved forget-me-nots. The white petals of Diana’s favourite nestled among blooms picked from Kensington Palace gardens and myrtle sprigs, which are traditional in royal bouquets. Adorning the walls of the 500-year-old chapel were arches of flowers, including white roses, another of Diana’s favourites that were planted in her memory at the palace gardens over the summer. As soon as details of the wedding were announced, Harry said he wanted to “celebrate the memory of the late Princess on the wedding day”. Harry was emotional throughout the service and was particularly moved as the congregation sang the final hymn, Guide Me O Thou Great Redeemer, which was played at Diana’s 1997 funeral. William and Kate also included it their wedding. Given pride of place in the chapel was Diana’s close friend Julia Samuel, with her husband Michael. Julia is godmother to Prince George and has remained close to William and Harry following Diana’s death, with Meghan previously talking about how much she enjoyed meeting her. There were touching references to Harry\u0027s late mother throughout the ceremony. Meghan carried a bouquet containing forget-me-nots, specifically chosen as they were Diana\u0027s favourite flower.  A spokesperson for Kensington Palace said: The couple specifically chose them to be included in Ms Markle\u0027s bouquet to honour the memory of the late Princess on this special day. Diana\u0027s sister Lady Jane Fellowes gave the only reading of the service, the eighth chapter of the Song of Solomon: “My beloved speaks and says to me, ‘Arise, my love, my fair one, and come away for now the winter is past, the rain is over and gone’.” She was joined at the service by Diana’s other sister, Lady Sarah McCorquodale, and her brother Earl Spencer, along with Harry’s Spencer family cousins.

Dean David Conner said: “The gift of marriage brings husband and wife together in the delight and tenderness of sexual union and joyful commitment to the end of their lives. “It is given as the foundation of family life in which children are born and nurtured and in which each member of the family, in good times and in bad, may find strength, companionship and comfort, and grow to maturity in love.” As the word “children” was uttered, Harry, 33, turned to Meghan, 36, and smiled.  A Royal source said: “Harry was bursting with pride the whole ceremony but it was that reaction that caught the eye of those who know him best. It was beautiful and subtle nod to the hope they both have that they will become parents as soon as possible.” Royal biographer Andrew Morton, who researched the new Duchess of Sussex’s life while writing a book about her, also said he expected Harry and Meghan to bring a baby into the world soon. Predicting even more happy news for the couple, he said: “I think that even before Meghan has learned how to spell Leicester and Torquay she’ll be starting a family.  “She’s not really going to be available for working for the Royal Family on a full-time basis until she’s 40, I’m sure.” What\u0027s more, William\u0027s brother and Suits actress Meghan have both indicated they\u0027re very keen to start a family during past interviews. Harry said in 2015: “I’d love to have kids right now.” He added in his engagement interview: “One step at a time. Hopefully we’ll start a family in the near future.” Meghan also confided in ex-agent Gina Nelthorpe-Cowne, saying: “I’d absolutely love to have children, and I can’t wait to be a mother.” "},{"url":null,"title":"speculation mounts meghan markles mum","story":"NewsSpeculation mounts Meghan Markle\u0027s mum and \u0027rock\u0027 Doria will move from LA to UK to support daughterMother of the bride may ditch her life as a social worker and yoga teacher to come to Britain after her close bond with Meghan Markle shone through at wedding to Prince Harry\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByRachael Bletchly23:24, 20 MAY 2018Updated08:36, 21 MAY 2018NewsVideo LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in 8CancelPlay now\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailAs they turned on to the Long Walk, where the cheering crowds stood 50-deep, Doria Ragland gazed from the car window and gasped “Wow!” Radiant Meghan, waving at the cheering throng, missed the ripples of emotion that swept over her mother’s face in that moment. Joy, amazement, pride and excitement... but tinged with a hint of fear. Because as Doria, 61, accompanied her daughter on her final journey as a commoner, the \u0026shyenormity of the occasion hit home. She and Meg used to drive around Los Angeles in her car with the number plate Megnme. Now they were in a Rolls-Royce Phantom, heading to Windsor Castle amid all the pomp and ceremony the British monarchy could muster.  Every mother of the bride feels a twinge of sadness at “giving” their girl to their husband. But Doria must have felt a huge sense of loss. She was giving her “Flower” to a Prince, a royal family, a country and an entire Commonwealth. And she had to do so alone, in a foreign country, possibly still jet-lagged and with two billion people around the globe watching on TV. Doria was the only member of the Markle family to attend the wedding. The bride’s half brother and sister were snubbed along with other \u0026shyrelatives after criticising Meghan.  Her dad who’d been due to walk her down the aisle had to pull out for a heart op. Thomas Markle, 73, watched the nuptials on TV as he recovered in Rosarito, Mexico. He later said: “I’ll always regret not being able to be there to hold my daughter’s hand. “My baby girl is a Duchess and I love her so much. Now I pray that Harry and Meghan can go on a nice honeymoon... and all of my \u0026shyrelatives will just shut up.” But Doria conducted herself with such quiet dignity and strength that everyone realised why Meghan calls her: “My rock.” And her unconcealed emotion during the wedding service also won her huge affection.  Sitting opposite the Queen and other reserved royals – still wearing her trademark nose-stud – Doria, wept openly and appeared to live every moment with Meghan as she said her vows. At one point she sighed deeply and shook her head as if she couldn’t quite believe what was happening. And dreadlocked Doria, descended from African slaves who chose the surname “Wisdom”, listened intently as US preacher Michael Curry talked of the civil rights struggle. As he said: “When you’re loved, and know it, it feels right,” she mouthed: “That’s right!” The royal “firm” clearly warmed to Doria, with Prince Charles seeming particularly smitten.  He held her hand during the service as they went to sign the register, supported her as they left the chapel and was seen with his arm around Doria several times at the reception. Now royal watchers are wondering if Doria will give up her life as a yoga teacher and social worker in LA and move to the UK to support Meghan. One royal insider said Meghan has an incredibly close bond with Doria and values her wise counsel. The insider added: “When she and Harry start a family it’ll be incredibly hard if her mum is 5,500 miles away.” Doria’s whirlwind visit will probably seem like a fairy tale when she gets home, believed to be next week. She’ll hang up the elegant pistachio-coloured outfit by Oscar de la Renta and slip into her favourite yoga pants and sweatshirt before walking her dogs.  Then she will be back to work at the mental health services unit where she is a “free-spirited clinical therapist” working with geriatric clients. Doria’s work ethic has always inspired Meghan. After divorcing Thomas in 1987, she became an air stewardess but later returned to university and got a BA in psychology and a masters degree in social work. She also instilled Meghan’s social conscience and interest in charity work – taking her to visit disadvantaged children in Rwanda, see the slums of Jamaica and experience poverty in Mexico when she was 10.

In the first, 15-year-old Meghan sits on black painted railings outside Buckingham Palace. The grainy photograph shows Meghan in slip-on sandals and sunnies, smiling alongside a pal with her whole life ahead of her. In the second, she is a 36-year-old bride - marrying a prince in front of the whole world. Life is full of surprises, one royal fan wrote on Twitter. One day you\u0027re 15 and posing outside Buckingham Palace and 22 years later you\u0027re marrying the prince. What a love story - a true princess in waiting, another said.  Prince Harry and Meghan got married in a dazzling ceremony that blended ancient English ritual with African-American culture yesterday. The celebration, watched up close by royals and celebrities and from afar by a global TV audience of millions, has made history. The two photographs placed side-by-side serve as a reminder of the vast opportunities that stretch out before you age 15. And a love story is made all the better when it has a happy ending. Harry and Meghan were first introduced in London in July 2016 through mutual friends, but they did not start dating straight away. Meghan was still based in her adopted hometown of Toronto, where her US drama Suits is filmed.    They met while Harry was promoting the Invictus Games - an event he helped launch for disabled military personnel - in London, and Meghan shared a picture of herself visiting Buckingham Palace on July 5. She had also been spotted in the royal box at Wimbledon in late June, prompting speculation she was already well acquainted with Harry\u0027s family. Then, in October 2016, the first rumours surrounding their relationship began swirling when the pair were seen at a halloween-party-ideas-budget-2017-9116382\u0026gtHalloween party in Toronto. It was first thought they pair had been dating for around a month, but Meghan later told Vanity Fair they had managed to keep their romance under wraps for an impressive six months.      We were very quietly dating for about six months before it became news, and I was working during that whole time, and the only thing that changed was people\u0027s perception, she said in October 2017. Nothing about me changed. I\u0027m still the same person that I am, and I\u0027ve never defined myself by my relationship. Once the speculation started bubbling, it did not take long before their relationship was blown into the public sphere. Just two weeks after the news broke, Harry took the unprecedented step of blasting the media for prying into Meghan\u0027s private life - and even called out trolls for making racist comments about her. The statement was the first time Harry called Meghan his girlfriend in public as he warned the media to steer clear.    His girlfriend, Meghan Markle, has been subject to a wave of abuse and harassment, the statement read. Some of this has been very public - the smear on the front page of a national newspaper the racial undertones of comment pieces and the outright sexism and racism of social media trolls and web article comments. It went on: Prince Harry is worried about Ms. Markle’s safety and is deeply disappointed that he has not been able to protect her. It is not right that a few months into a relationship with him that Ms. Markle should be subjected to such a storm. He knows commentators will say this is ‘the price she has to pay’ and that ‘this is all part of the game’. He strongly disagrees. This is not a game - it is her life and his. He has asked for this statement to be issued in the hopes that those in the press who have been driving this story can pause and reflect before any further damage is done. He knows that it is unusual to issue a statement like this, but hopes that fair-minded people will understand why he has felt it necessary to speak publicly.  The pair fell love with Africa separately but it was their first trip together as a couple which sealed their romantic fate. Even before the pair met, they were both involved in various charity projects which saw them visiting the sun-soaked continent. Prince Harry often visited as part of his work for the royal\u0027s charity Sentebale and his role as patron for Rhino Conservation Botswana, while Meghan headed to Rwanda when she was a global ambassador for World Vision. However, it is Botswana that already sits at the forefront of their love story. Prince Harry whisked Meghan away for a luxury safari break just four weeks after their first date. Speaking to the BBC in their engagement interview, Harry said: I managed to persuade her to come and join me in Botswana. We camped out with each other under the stars. She came and joined me for five days out there, which was absolutely fantastic.  Meghan did a glossy covershoot and interview with Vanity Fair in October 2017, in which she repeatedly called the royal her boyfriend and gushed about their relationship. We\u0027re a couple. We\u0027re in love, she said. I\u0027m sure there will be a time when we will have to come forward and present ourselves and have stories to tell, but I hope what people will understand is that this is our time. This is for us. It\u0027s part of what makes it so special, that it\u0027s just ours. But we\u0027re happy. Personally, I love a great love story. I can tell you that at the end of the day I think it\u0027s really simple. We\u0027re two people who are really happy and in love. Just seven months after they met, Harry reportedly took Meghan to London to meet his brother Prince William and sister-in-law Kate Middleton - the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge.  He is also thought to have introduced his girlfriend to the Queen on Mother\u0027s Day, Sunday March 26 2017. She came with him to Kate\u0027s sister Pippa Middleton\u0027s wedding in May, carefully avoiding the cameras by getting Harry to pick her up after the church ceremony and just in time for the evening reception. The two were seen together at the Invictus Games in Toronto on September 25 2017. Dressed down in skinny ripped jeans, a white shirt and sunglasses, Meghan laughed and smiled as Harry whispered in her ear in full view of spectators. They cosied up together with lots of affectionate touches - and were even spotted kissing inside their private box where Meghan\u0027s mum Doria and her best friends Markus Anderson and Jessica Mulroney were given seats. Kensington Palace announced the couple were engaged on November 27 2017 following weeks of speculation. Later that day, they did an interview with BBC presenter Mishal Husain and revealed extra romantic details about the engagemet.  Meghan admitted it was sweet, natural and very romantic and just a standard typical night in for the pair. The actress admitted she barely let her husband-to-be finish proposing before she said: Can I say yes now? One of their first appearances was at Reprezent 107.3FM in Brixton, south London, in January. The pair later made a trip to Cardiff where Meghan was asked by sisters Anne and Judy Daley - who brought a veil, plastic tiara and bridal sash gift for Meghan - to ask if she would hold her hen party in Cardiff. The beaming actress told them: I bet that would be a lot of fun, before being led away by Prince Harry. In reality the star had a rather quieter hen do in the Cotswolds. Days before the wedding, the pair\u0027s plans were thrown into chaos after Meghan\u0027s father, Thomas Markle, pulled out of the ceremony.

The heir to the throne took on the job as Meghan Markle\u0027s own father was unable to attend because of poor health. And what he said to her proves that he was the right man for the job. As she walked into St George\u0027s Chapel in Windsor Castle, according to lip readers the prince said: You look lovely, are you OK? MirrorOnline reported yesterday how as Meghan appeared through the doors of the chapel, sunlight streamed in behind her and there were gasps from guests.  She initially walked alone, with one of her page boys caught by TV cameras stifling a yawn. Meghan was then met by Prince Charles at the organ screen, halfway down the chapel - who took her to her bridegroom Prince Harry. The groom told Meghan “you look amazing, I missed you” as he set on eyes on her for the first time on their fairytale wedding day. He was left open-mouthed when she saw his American bride walking down the aisle in her stunning British-designed dress. Harry also told Prince Charles “thank you pa” after he stepped in at the last minute to walk Megan part-way down the aisle.  Meghan and Harry are set to postpone their honeymoon so they can attend a birthday celebration for Charles this week. The newlyweds are expected to return to normal life and bid farewell to the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh after spending the night at Windsor Castle. Meghan has already spoken of her desire to hit the ground running as she becomes a full-time royal. On Tuesday the couple will join Charles and Camilla on the lawns of Buckingham Palace for a Prince of Wales 70th Birthday Patronage Celebration. The outdoor event marks the heir to the throne\u0027s milestone birthday - which falls in November - by recognising Charles\u0027 patronages and military affiliations as well as others involved in charities supported by the royal.  Now the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, the couple will not immediately leave for their honeymoon but remain in the UK for a period before taking the traditional break. Countries like Botswana - which offer stunning wildlife, breathtaking scenery and, importantly, privacy from prying eyes - could be top of the list.

Children “screamed” as oxygen masks came down and the plane dived rapidly.  The Onur Air Airbus 321 with 226 passengers and eight crew made a successful emergency landing at Volgograd airport in southern Russia. Some passengers needed medical and psychological help after the “horrible” incident, said an airport source.  The Turkish plane was en route from Antalya to Chelyabinsk in the Russian Urals region when it got into trouble. Unconfirmed reports said there was an engine failure. A woman passenger said: “It was so scary. People on board panicked. “Everyone was asleep when oxygen masks came down, children started to scream.” Another passenger said: “Flight Antalya to Chelyabinsk. Loss of cabin pressure.  “Descending from 10,000 metres to 500 metres within five minutes, very scary!!!” On one video, a man says to another“happy birthday!”, then turns to the camera saying: “This is horror”. In the second video a stewardess is believed to ask: “Are there doctors on board?” A woman says: ‘We have arrived.  The man filming the video looks into the camera and says: “That was horrible”. The airport in Volgograd - where England play their opening group stage match in the World Cup next month - confirmed the emergency landing. Passengers were ushered to an airport terminal. Those with children were taken to a hotel, said a source.

He initiated my passion for music,\u0026#8221 the 45 from Dundee said.\u0026#8220I started playing at just five years of age or so. My dad once overheard me playing simple tunes on a little toy tune percussion that I was given for my birthday.\u0026#8220My father found the musical talent in me and decided to buy me my own real accordion. My first melodies I learned through my dad were traditional Polish folk tunes.\u0026#8221Miroslaw, who was born in eastern Poland and moved to Dundee in 2007, represented Poland at the Eurovision Song Contest in 1998 and said his siblings also encouraged his passion as they were very musical themselves.\u0026#8220We would spend countless nights jamming along to music together as a family, and sometimes played a few melodies for guests here and there,\u0026#8221 he said.\u0026#8220I can recall one night I had to step in for a drummer that did not show up at my dad’s gig, petrified of messing up, though the encouragement from the crowd got me through it.\u0026#8220I was ecstatic at the applause I soon received and the thrill of live music. Still, to this day, I find it hard to believe I was actually able to do it. It was the overwhelming feeling that really appealed me to music.\u0026#8221Music was very connected to his Christian belief, Miroslaw said, and he often played piano or guitar and sung during prayer and worship.\u0026#8220Playing music for me is a very natural way of expressing myself to those around me,\u0026#8221 he said.\u0026#8220Music connects me with other people in a very unique way.\u0026#8220I met many friends and started relationships through my music.\u0026#8220I even met my wife, Monika, as a young adolescent in a music boarding school back in the 1990s.\u0026#8220Music is a unique, universal language and can be used as a tool to express our feelings or to put a message across that can influence others in various ways.\u0026#8220It definitely can be very therapeutic. I’ve experienced this when working with my young students with special needs or disability. This helped me to understand a different perspective on teaching and helping others.\u0026#8221Miroslaw, who is also known as MIREK, is one of 14 tutors at the newly-created Dundee Music Acadamy, which this weekend is offering free lessons in guitar, singing, bass, piano, keyboard, sitar, saxophone, flute, accordion and more.\u0026#8220I always wanted to share my music experiences, tips, knowledge, fancy chords, and how I managed to solve my own musical set backs with others,\u0026#8221 Miroslaw said.\u0026#8220I saw myself becoming a teacher the minute I left the music school, and was surrounded by others alike.\u0026#8220My accordion instructor, Mrs Śliwkiewicz-Cisak, set an example of how much a teacher can help and improve the musical experience for someone else.\u0026#8220It’s a treasure to have this kind of teacher who encourages you to become an independent learner and is able to motivate you to keep going in difficult times. She was the main factor that really pulled me into teaching others.\u0026#8220As a teacher or instructor I not only help students to progress in their musicianship or instrumental skills , but also have a huge impact on their personality and help to shape their character. Seeing my own student’s progress and a smile on their face is the biggest reward any teacher can get.\u0026#8221\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/05/5afc0004b7cc0-745x564.jpg ","title":"dundee people nurses across dundee and tayside celebrate international nurses day","story":"\t\t\t\t\tNursing staff across Tayside marked International Nurses Day.

they’re set to continue beyond the start of the season in July.So far no clues as to who’s on the wanted list have been forthcoming from Tannadice.But the Tele understands talks with at least two targets are at an advanced stage and deals could be struck over the weekend.Dunfermline pair Fraser Aird and Nicky Clark could be on the verge of joining up.While United have declined to confirm their interest in Clark, the 26-year-old’s proven scoring record at Championship level is something of which they are aware.And despite interest in him from the Premiership – St Mirren have also been linked – a determined effort to get him to Tannadice appears to be ongoing.Ex-Hamilton defender Ziggy Gordon is also on their radar and he could be fixed up soon.With other identified targets, the process could take longer.While the departures of 14 players means replacements are needed, and soon, as much time as is needed to ensure the right quality is obtained for next season will be taken.With the season just over, a number of players and agents are on their summer break and that will delay some business. In other cases, the calibre of those involved means United will battle with other clubs to get them.The fact they are remaining outside of the Premiership for a third season running makes that task harder – but it’s not being seen as an insurmountable one.And the number of players who’ve expressed an interest in hearing what the plans for the new-look squad are has been encouraging.There will be action at Tannadice tonight as Dave Bowman’s annual match to raise cash for skin cancer and dementia charities takes place.It will see a string of other past Tangerines greats turning out in the home ranks.“We’ve got the usual list of suspects and Sean Dillon and Jon Daly will be back in United strips as well,” said Bow.“We’ve even got your columnist in the Tele, big Lee Wilkie, playing. Before he agreed to turn out he did check we have XXXL shorts for him to wear.”The opposition is made up of fans who’ve bid to play against their past heroes.

the current Guinness World Record for the number of people wearing sunglasses in one location – using #SunnyDundee specs.Sizzling plans to put the current record in the shade have been backed by the campaign group.Organisers of Westfest approached the group about the idea of using the yellow sunglasses emblazed with #SunnyDundee.Campaign manager Jennifer Caswell, from Dundee – One City, Many Discoveries, said she would never have thought about making a record-breaking attempt when the campaign started in April.She said an estimated 5,000 #SunnyDundee glasses have already been

10,000 revellers on Sunday June 3, could be the ideal location for the record attempt.Jennifer added: “Westfest organisers approached us about the idea.“Given there are more than 5,000 shades out there, we would certainly encourage revellers who have a pair to bring them along.“The campaign has been incredible so far.“Dundee has really got on board with it, especially taking pictures and uploading them online.“We’ve seen pictures from Austria recently on social media.“Throughout the whole campaign, I would never have envisaged a record-breaking attempt.“I’ve been down to Westfest in

confirm we are investigating the possibility and are in the process of contacting Guinness World Records to find out the exact world record as it stands as we try to arrange an official

But the Courier understands the \u0026pound370,000 art installation, still branded by Highland Council as the Gathering Place, will be divided into two sections positioned on either side of the river. The installation is thought to be a mix of stone and wooden construction.There is great excitement among city councillors who have seen two-dimensional design work, and there is apparent consensus that it is aesthetically pleasing and will easily blend into the local, tranquil environment.The \"pier\" project, proposed for a spot by Eden Court, was aborted two years ago due to the scale of public objections to the design.The location for the new proposal is believed to be nearby, slightly further upriver, at the most shallow point on the edge of the Ness Islands.The council\u0027 Inverness city committee delegated powers of approval to the Inverness city arts working group. Its current chairwoman, councillor Isabelle MacKenzie, said she had closely scrutinised the fresh concept adding that it was \"within budget\".Giving little away, she added: \"I can see it appealing to the local community. It\u0027 innovative and there are a variety of ways to use it.\"The artwork is believed to be static and radically different from the previous offering.Fellow city councillor Duncan Macpherson said: \"The whole thing looks good.

It enhances a current meeting place and it\u0027 a natural walkway.\"It\u0027 a good design, in the right place and way better. It\u0027 a natural \u0026lsquogathering place\u0026rsquo unlike the previous design which was very modern. That may go on to be a great success in another city but it wasn\u0026rsquot for Inverness or the location.\"A two-day public consultation was held last December at the city\u0027 railway station and in the Eastgate Shopping Centre to gather opinions about the overall riverside arts project to consider \"how the river should connect with the people and community of Inverness\".The arts initiative has been plagued by complaints about design and costs.The council has consistently stressed that the overall \u0026pound759,000 project, featuring a range of different art installations, is publicly funded but largely through ring-fenced grants.They were \u0026ndash Creative Scotland (\u0026pound305,600), the Inverness Common Good Fund (\u0026pound281,000), the council\u0027 \"cities gateway\" initiative (\u0026pound66,000), Highlands and Islands Enterprise (\u0026pound66,000) and a further \u0026pound40,000 from the council. Backers also emphasised that if Inverness spurned the project the funding would simply go elsewhere in Scotland.The local authority\u0027 Inverness city manager David Haas said: \"It is in development and about to be revealed to the public.\"I\u0026rsquom confident the new proposal will prove a big hit for the city.
