They signed off on the plans on the basis that it could prevent hundreds of thousands of school absences.Bolton West MP Chris Green said in the Commons: \u0027In many ways we can objectively say we are through the worst of the pandemic and yet the more draconian or authoritarian measures are being introduced at this stage. It\u0027s perverse.\u0027  MP for Penistone and Stocksbridge Miriam Cates, who led the debate, questioned the logic behind the plans, adding: \u0027Children are not disease spreaders, they\u0027re not a buffer for our healthcare system and they\u0027re not an economic inconvenience.\u0027 And MP Derek Thomas added said the decision to override the JCVI\u0027s original advice \u0027undermined confidence in the very vaccine rollout programme\u0027.It came as separate reports today suggested scientists in the Chinese city where Covid first emerged had planned to alter coronaviruses and release them into bat caves 21 months before the pandemic began.Dr Peter Daszak, president of New York-based EcoHealth Alliance, proposed working with a group of scientists from the Wuhan Institute of Virology to carry out the research.The experts wanted to genetically enhance coronaviruses and release them among bats in Yunnan — around 1,240miles (2,000km) south west of Wuhan — in the hopes it would stop new viruses jumping from bats to humans.The proposals set out plans to release a bat coronavirus featuring \u0027novel chimeric spike proteins\u0027 — which are spotted on Covid — as part of a plan to inoculate them against the virus.They also wanted to create a genetically-enhanced virus that could infect humans easier, according to papers unearthed last night.Researchers asked the US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (Darpa) for $14.2million (£10.4million) cash to fund the project. But it turned the proposal down over concerns it would put \u0027local communities at risk\u0027.The documents, published by a team of academics investigating the origins of the pandemic, will add to growing suspicions that the coronavirus may have accidentally leaked from the high-level biosecurity laboratory in Wuhan.It comes after a whistleblower has sensationally claimed China deliberately spread Covid at a military tournament two months before the rest of the world knew about the deadly virus.Ex-Chinese Communist Party insider Wei Jingsheng said The World Military Games in October 2019 — two months before China told the World Health Organization about the first cases — could have acted as the virus\u0027 first super-spreader event.Since China originally alerted the world to a mysterious virus circulating in Wuhan in December 2019, debate has been raging over its true source.China has repeatedly insisted the virus spilled naturally into humans from bats, with some scientists agreeing Covid most likely had natural origins.But some say it\u0027s entirely possible the coronavirus leaked from the Wuhan Institute of Virology, where researchers were conducting controversial research on the world\u0027s most dangerous pathogens.The proposed project has fuelled the latter theory, with one expert saying scientists may have pressed ahead with the plans despite the US refusing to fund it.Responding to the leaked DEFUSE proposals, Professor Angus Dalgleish, a cancer expert St Georges Hospital Medical School London, said the Wuhan Institute of Virology had been carrying out \u0027gain of function\u0027 work for years before the Covid outbreak. "},{"url":null,"title":"All boys netball team dominate girls team 46 12 18s state final sparking backlash","story":"Share this article But others defended the inclusion of the Sun to encourage male participation, noting the ultimate point of the tournament was to select an all-girls\u0027 Queensland side. \u0027This comp isn\u0027t about the shield at the end.

Photograph: Alan Betson Next Monday’s planned easing of close contact rules for primary schools and childcare facilities should be delayed until more “reliable” data is available, the country’s biggest teachers’ union has warned.Under the changes, children under 13 who are close contacts of confirmed Covid-19 cases in schools or childcare will no longer be required to self-isolate from September 27th if they are symptom-free.The move will reduce disruption to schools and means thousands of children who have been forced to self-isolate will be able to return to the classroom.Chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan said the National Public Health Emergency Team was reassured that the reopening of schools has not led to an increase in transmission of Covid-19 among school-going children or more widely across the population. “This is good news for students, parents and all those involved in the education of our children,” he said.Public health sources believe an increase in detected cases among primary school earlier this month was linked to a four-fold increase in testing and say case numbers have stabilised over the last 10 days or so.TransmissionThe easing of close contact rules will not apply to children who are household close contacts of positive cases due to higher risks of disease transmission in these settings. They will still be required to restrict movements and get tested, regardless of symptomatic status. This includes children on a sleep-over, for example.Testing and tracing of close contacts in primary schools or childcare will be discontinued. Due to the enhanced risk to vulnerable students, existing rules will continue to apply to primary school students who attend special schools or special classes. Overall public health advice remains that any child aged 12 years or under who displays symptoms consistent with the virus should rapidly self-isolate and not attend school or to socialise until 48 hours after they are symptom free.However, the Irish National Teachers’ Organisation general secretary John Boyle said the changes should be deferred “until reliable data on outbreaks in primary schools is available”. He proposed that any change should be made from November 1st when the schools reopen after mid-term break. “This would allow time for better data to be obtained and sufficient time for considered analysis and to allow for the proposed changes to be implemented in an orderly fashion,” he said.Clarify adviceBy contrast, Fórsa, which represents about 14,000 school staff including special needs assistants, welcomed the changes on the basis that students in special education settings are excluded.It said the easing of measures in mainstream schools will reduce the large numbers of students without symptoms who are currently excluded from classes.The Department of Health reported 1,432 new cases of the virus with 30 deaths in the past week. There were 272 Covid-19 patients in hospital and 63 in ICU.Separately, health authorities have sought to clarify advice on whether a runny nose is a symptom of the virus.Department of Education advice lists a runny nose as an “uncommon” symptom of the disease, while HSE advice says it is “usually okay” to send a child with a runny nose or sneeze to schoolDr Colm Henry, the HSE’s chief clinical officer, said parents should be concerned if a child has a runny nose accompanied by other symptoms such as a fever, a new cough or shortness of breath.However, if a child only has a runny nose, they can continue to attend “under observation”.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"graduate","story":"Where do you start if you really want to change the direction of your career?"},{"url":null,"title":"a night of hunting the false widow spider they are everywhere in this area","story":"Venom expert Dr John Dunbar spends a night combing a Dublin housing estate for Ireland’s increasingly common false widow spider. Video: Kathleen Harris Dr John Dunbar with a noble false widow spider, steatoda nobilis. Although he has handled thousands, Dr Dunbar has never been bitten. Photograph: Photograph: Dara Mac DonaillWe should see plenty of action in an hour, Dr John Dunbar says assuredly via email, excited at the prospect. As a venom expert, many nights are spent combing the walls and railings of Dublin housing estates for Ireland’s highly-poisonous false widow spider.Alone in the dark, armed with extended tweezers and a headlamp, he carefully places each one inside long plastic tubes as the residents sleep inside, blissfully unaware.On a chilly evening thousands of such spiders are scattered just out of sight along Beech Park, a long quiet suburban road in Lucan lined with detached homes and webbed hedges. The noble false widow – or steatoda nobilis – first recorded in Ireland in 1999 is far more common than most people realise and its numbers are increasing alarmingly.Within two minutes Dr Dunbar is poking at a web string. He has spotted two long, thin protruding legs, inconspicuous to the passerby. It is the first trophy of 94 that night.Although he has handled thousands, Dr Dunbar has never been bitten. Twenty bites have been recorded in Ireland, he declares, and the bite is one to be avoided.In some cases victims have experienced severe bacterial infections, debilitating pain and body tremors.Steatoda nobilis is compared to the notorious black widow for a number of reasons including notable similarities in appearance, genetics and toxins. It is known as the “false widow” because in regions where they co-exist it can be difficult to tell them apart.Smaller than the native house spider, chocolate brown with a large bulbous abdomen and an intricate cream pattern sometimes resembling a skull, the false widow is easy to identify.Five or six years ago researchers would have had to look hard for one. Today, a single hunter can expect to bag between 100 and 150 in a few hours in any suburban estate.Thought to have originated in the Atlantic archipelagos of Madeira and the Canaries, it arrived in the United Kingdom and Europe on banana boats. Throughout the 20th century it established thriving populations throughout England and Wales, and later colonised parts of western Europe, California, Chile and the Middle East.Although found in Co Wicklow a little more than two decades ago, little was known about its presence here until more recently. A 2017 Royal Irish Academy study confirmed the species in at least 16 counties, but most significantly in the greater Dublin area where it is abundant in urban buildings and around street furniture.As Dr Dunbar walks slowly from suburban home to home, he identifies and scoops up the spiders from virtually every single driveway pillar he examines. His head torch illuminates the undersides of wall ledges, shrubs, gates, guttering, the back of ESB boxes. They are everywhere. After just a short while it seems other native species are relatively difficult to come by.Potent venom“But they do have a venom that’s a little bit more potent than what we’re used to. It’s very similar to the venom of black widows, not quite as potent, but still kind of getting there.”The risk posed are similar to ones posed by bees and wasps. Each spider can give about half of one microlitre of venom, about one thousandth of a millilitre. On his regular hunts Dr Dunbar tells the gardaí he will be prowling. The glow from his headlamp and his intricate inspection of neighbourhood walls are common, as are encounters with neighbours.Just as he is plucking a sample with his extended tweezers, a resident approaches with a fair idea of what is going on but curious all the same. “They are obviously everywhere in this area,” Colm Gallagher says resignedly. “I know what the implications are they have venom and whatever else. But they’re not terribly dangerous.”They do go inside houses, but not usually. Whether for the curious resident, the arachnophobe or the scientist, there is still a lot to learn about these creatures and a race to learn it.“They are here to stay, there is no way we’re going to get rid of them,” he says. “But we really need to monitor them while we can over the next years and see what happens. Now science must tell us what we are dealing with,” he said."},{"url":null,"title":"climate","story":"Chris Horn: Keeping the lights on as the grid stutters will become an all-consuming challengeTaoiseach to use Security Council presidency to mobilise international diplomacy on issueNew report calls for \u0026lsquotransformation to agroecology\u0026rsquo ahead of UN summit"},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"Birds still subjected to \u0026lsquopoisoning, persecution, collision or direct disturbance\u0026rsquoStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"covid 19 vaccine tracker how many people have been inoculated in ireland","story":"It has been over a year since the first case of Covid-19 was confirmed in the Republic of Ireland. Since then, over 300,000 people have been diagnosed in the State, and over 5,000 people have died.Globally, over 200 million people have been diagnosed and over 4\u0026nbspmillion have died since the virus was first identified in China in December 2019.Four of these have been authorised for use in the EU - one from AstraZeneca, one from BioNTech-Pfizer, one from Moderna and another from Johnson \u0026amp Johnson (Janssen).The EU has put in place purchase agreements with Sanofi-GSK\u0026nbspand Curevac, and\u0026nbsphas concluded exploratory talks with two other vaccine producers - Novavax and Valneva.Ireland, along with all other EU member states, will get a proportional amount of every vaccine that is approved for use by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) according to its population.But how do these other vaccines work, and when will they be approved for use here? Have there been any reported side effects? And when can you expect to receive a vaccine?The  Vaccine Tracker will be updated daily as the country embarks on the largest inoculation programme in the history of the State.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 70°C.EMA approval: Granted on December 21st.Overview: Developed by New York-based Pfizer and German company BioNTech this vaccine has a brand name of Comirnaty. It uses messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, which has instructions for producing a protein from Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. The person’s immune system recognises this protein as foreign and produces antibodies and activates T-cells (white blood cells) to attack it, giving them immunity. The vaccine will last for six months when stored at -70C, and five days when stored at between 2 and 8 degrees Celsius. The EU has approved the withdrawal of six doses from each vial.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, headache, muscle and joint pain, chills and fever. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 546,000 in April, 738,000 in May and\u0026nbsp844,000 doses in June, with 5.4 million doses in total expected by the end of 2021.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 20°C.EMA approval: Granted on January 6th.Overview: Developed by Boston-based company Moderna, this vaccine is manufactured for EU states at partner plants in Switzerland, France and Spain before being distributed across the continent. Like the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine, it uses mRNA technology to produce a Sars-CoV-2 protein, which the body then attacks to give immunity. It will last for up to six months when stored at - 20°C. The first Moderna vaccine was given in Ireland on January 16th.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, chills, fever, swollen or tender lymph nodes under the arm, headache, muscle and joint pain, nausea and vomiting. Less common was redness, hives and rash at the injection site. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 383,000 by June and 870,000 doses by the end of 2021.How many have been vaccinated here?Dose: Two doses, between 4 and 12 weeks apartEMA approval: Granted on January 29th.Overview: The OxfordAstraZeneca vaccine (also known as Vaxzevria) was thought of as a potential game-changer because it can be transported and stored at 2 degrees to 8 degrees for up to six months, making it much easier to move around and administer. It is also much cheaper, costing about $3-4 per shot, compared with $20 for the PfizerBioNTech jab, with the former being made on a not-for-profit basis for the duration of the pandemic.It is based on a harmless chimp cold virus that cannot grow inside human cells. Scientists have tweaked this virus so that it carries genetic material containing the instructions for a protein of the coronavirus. Once the vaccine has been administered, our bodies produce the coronavirus protein, triggering an immune response.During the trial, a dosing error led to the serendipitous finding that when clinical trial participants were given half a dose followed by a full dose, the vaccine had a higher efficacy than when participants were given two full doses, with 90 per cent efficacy in the former case and 62 per cent efficacy in the latter. This led AstraZeneca to announce in November a new global trial of the vaccine with the half dosefull dose regime.In January, a bitter row broke out between the European Union and AstraZeneca after the pharmaceutical company drastically revised downwards the number of doses it could deliver the bloc.\u0026nbspWhile the EMA approved the use of this vaccine for all ages, doubt was cast over its efficacy in the over 65s due to the lack of data from Astrazeneca’s clinical trials in this cohort. As a result, Germany, Austria, Sweden, Poland and Belgium have opted not to approve this product for their older population.Following suit, Ireland has also decided to use the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine for the over 70s where possible, not the AstraZeneca jab.It would not be the first time this jab led to a\u0026nbspsignificant reorganisation of our vaccination plans.Reports of serious blood clots, mostly in women aged under 60, led the\u0026nbspNational Immunisation Advisory Committee (Niac) to first defer the use of the vaccine on March 14th, before resuming it\u0027s use on March 20th.However, on April 12th, Niac\u0026nbsprecommended that AstraZeneca should not be given to people aged under 60, once again leading to a reorganisation of the rollout. This was revised to people aged over 50 on April 27th. On June 28th, Niac revised its advice again and said the vaccine could be given\u0026nbspto people aged under 40, although the mRNA shots were preferable for that age group.How many will Ireland get?\u0026nbspLatest projections are 224,000 in April, 262,000 in May and 327,000 in JuneStorage: Lasts for up to two years frozen at –20° C, and up to three months refrigerated at 2-8° C.EMA approval: Approved on March 11th.Overview: The EMA started a rolling review of this single dose vaccine from Janssen, the Belgium-based subsidiary of Johnson \u0026amp Johnson on December 1st.On January 29th the company announced the results of its Phase 3 trial: the vaccine had an efficacy of 72 per cent in the United States, 66 per cent in Latin America, and 57 per cent in South Africa.This vaccine uses double-stranded DNA to deliver a protein from the SARS-CoV-2 virus into the body, thereby creating immunity. It is different from others on the market in that it requires just one injection. The EU has agreed an initial contract for 200 million doses, with an option to buy 200 million more.On February 16th the company applied to the EMA for\u0026nbspseeking authorisation for its single-dose vaccine, and it was approved on March 11th.However, on April 13th the company paused deliveries of its vaccine in Europe pending an investigation of rare blood clot cases that have halted its rollout in the US. The blood clotting conditions reported in recipients of the Johnson \u0026amp Johnson vaccine in the US are the same rare condition linked to the AstraZeneca vaccine.On April 20th, the EMA\u0027s review of these issues found a possible link to very rare cases of unusual blood clots with low blood platelets, and agreed a warning should be included in the product information.\u0026nbspHowever, it concluded\u0026nbspthe overall benefits of the vaccine\u0026nbspin preventing Covid-19 outweigh the risks of side effects, and so Janssen announced it would resume deliveries to the EU. In Ireland,\u0026nbspNiac initially recommended that the jab be used only for people over the age of 50, but this was revised to include the under 40s on June 28th. Those aged 18-34 can apply to get the Janssen vaccine at pharmacies around the country.How many will Ireland get?\u0026nbsp2.2 million doses in total,\u0026nbsp600,000 between April and June.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: US company Novavax has developed a Covid-19 vaccine which stimulates an immune response by delivering spike proteins into the body. These spike-proteins are grown and harvested from insects. Similar technology is used in the production of vaccines for influenza and HPV. The European Commission has concluded exploratory talks with Novavax with a view to purchasing up to 200 million doses. The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 3rd.Overview: In September the EU signed a deal to purchase 300 million doses of this vaccine. It is based on the same technology as one of Sanofi’s seasonal influenza vaccines - more conventional than the mRNA used by Pfizer and Moderna - and it was thought it could play a big role in ending the pandemic. However, despite positive results from Phase 1 trials, news came in December that Phase 2 trial results showed an insufficient immune response in older adults. Phase III studies were expected to start in December, but the companies now plan to begin a phase 2b study in February with a different formulation of the vaccine. Even if their new formulation is successful, they do not expect the vaccine to be available until the end of 2021.Storage: Will last for at least 3 months at 2-8°C.Overview: The German company CureVac began its final Phase 3 trials in December, with results expected in the first quarter of 2021. It uses the same mRNA technology as the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines, but can be kept at normal refrigerator temperatures. The company has signed a deal with the EU to supply 405 million doses, pending regulatory approval.The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 12th.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: Valneva is a French company which has created a Covid-19 vaccine based on their Japanese encephalitis vaccine. It delivers a chemically inactivated coronavirus and uses an adjuvant (immunity booster) to create immunity. It entered clinical trials in December and reported positive results from these initial phase 1 and 2 trial in\u0026nbspApril 2021, while announcing it was entering\u0026nbspphase 3 trials on 4,000 people.On January 12th the European Commission concluded exploratory talks with the company for the supply of 30 million doses, with the option to buy a further 30 million.When might you be vaccinated?Over 80 per cent\u0026nbspof people in Ireland aged over 18 are now fully vaccinated, with over 90 per cent in receipt of at least one dose. Anyone over the age of 12 can\u0026nbsp now register for a vaccine.

Mr Coveney has since apologised for his handling of the planned appointment which Ms Zappone later declined and he faced down a Dáil motion of no confidence tabled by Sinn Féin.The Government has denied Opposition claims that the attempt to appoint Ms Zappone amounted to cronyism.Mr Coveney has denied that he effectively offered her the role before his officials carried out the work to create it and that Ms Zappone’s contacts with him amounted to lobbying for the job.He told the Oireachtas Committee on Foreign Affairs Ms Zappone was mistaken in her belief that she had been offered the job last March as implied by a text message she sent to him. Ms Zappone turned down an invitation to appear before the committee. Mr Coveney was asked if she should have agreed to appear.

Photograph: Don PollardCFRPA The threat posed to global security by climate change would be a permanent fixture on the agenda of the world’s leading powers if an Irish proposal for a United Nations Security Council resolution is agreed. Taoiseach Micheál Martin will on Thursday use Ireland’s presidency of the council to urge those at the top table in international diplomacy to take action on the growing links between climate change and conflict. The debate on climate and security will be the first time a taoiseach has chaired a meeting of the Security Council.He confirmed Ireland was working on a resolution that would see the issue routinely considered by the Security Council which includes permanent members the United States, Russia, China, United Kingdom and France. He said Ireland’s diplomats were “working very hard” to get agreement at the Security Council on accepting the concept of the link between climate and security.“We’ve achieved a lot of progress on that front. There are still some remaining member states we have to work on and work with to get a consensus on this and that work is ongoing,” Mr Martin said on Wednesday. “But our team are hopeful.” While 12 of the 15 members are believed to be supportive of the proposals, Russia, China and India remain sceptical amid concern over an extension of the mandate of the Security Council. Biden ‘boost’A German bid to get a similar proposal over the line was scuppered last year by former US president Donald Trump’s administration.The chances of progress to tackle the risk of climate-related conflict is believed to have received a “significant boost” due to the election of President Joe Biden last year.Successfully getting a resolution on climate change and security over the line would be seen as a key success of Ireland’s two-year term as a temporary member of the Security Council. However, Russia and China will have to be convinced that there is a role for the Security Council in the area. Their position has been that climate change should be dealt with through the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the COP meetings, the next of which is due to begin in Glasgow next month.India is also believed to be sceptical about anything it sees as an extension of mandate of the Security Council. Along with Niger, Ireland is co-chairing an expert group that is examining evidence that suggests climate change is causing or exacerbating conflicts in places like the Sahel region and the Horn of Africa. Africa and medicineMr Martin last night attended a meeting between EU and African heads of government to discuss issues from climate and security to the Covid-19 pandemic. “Europe is very anxious to build up capacity within the African continent around the production of medicines – particularly mRNA vaccines,” the Taoiseach said.He said “substantial funds” would be offered to South Africa and other African countries along with technology transfers so that they would have the capacity to produce their own vaccines and medicines into the future. Separately, Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney concluded his own programme of bilateral meetings at the UN General Assembly in New York with a meeting with Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov. He earlier attended an informal Security Council dialogue with the League of Arab Nations where issues like the conflicts in Yemen and Syria were due to be discussed. He also had meetings with representatives from Pakistan, Ethiopia, Egypt, Iran and Saudi Arabia.

Not the first time that’s happened, some would say. But surely only after midnight, when TDs are forced to abandon the bar for a late vote?But this was about trunks, not drunks.The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform identified a very large elephant in the middle of Leaders’ Questions. Michael McGrath, standing in for the Taoiseach who is on a different safari in America, was at a loss to understand how Róisín Shortall, seated nearby, could not see it.Perhaps it was because the Social Democrats co-leader was too busy firing a few uncomfortable “deliverables” back at him. This was Michael’s big word during a wishy-washy defence of the Government’s stewardship of the ambitious 10-year Sláintecare health programme, which is in danger of going off the rails.She warned him of the gravity of the situation, citing the recent resignation of the two senior managers hired to drive the reform, swiftly followed by the chair of one of the country’s largest hospital groups, who quit because “much-needed reform of the health services has not been delivered”.Róisín is in no doubt that the blueprint, wholeheartedly agreed on a cross-party basis in 2017, is running into the buffers because the Government has neither the will nor the backbone to “take on the vested interests” standing in the way of its implementation.It’s down to a lack of courage and leadership at the top, she reckons. Where is the political will to get Sláintecare done? The TD for Dublin North-West contrasted today’s faltering project with what happened a decade ago when Prof Tom Keane (one of the people who have just resigned) reformed cancer services in the face of huge controversy. He was able to do this because “he had the staunch support of the then minister for health, Mary Harney”.Where is that single-minded commitment now?But, but, but... insisted McGrath. Never mind the quality, feel the “deliverables”. The Government is throwing money at the problem and will be flinging even more cash at it in next month’s budget.‘Real funding’He sounded a bit hurt by what Róisín had to say, particularly as the “really significant manifestations of the Government’s commitment to Sláintecare is backed up with real funding”. As opposed to makey-uppey funding.Michael surveyed the chamber. “But what you didn’t even mention is the elephant in the room... you didn’t even feel it was worthy of a mention.”Let’s be reasonable here. The Government can only handle one elephant at a time and they have had their hands full with a wild bull called Covid and he’s been creating havoc for 18 months, Michael explained.But that’s only a Johnny-come-lately elephant, sighed Róisín. Sláintecare was on the scene well before Covid arrived. It’s a 10-year plan. The Coalition is “downplaying” the extent of the crisis because it hasn’t the nerve to face up to “serious institutional resistance” from within the HSE and Department of Health. This resistance is a really serious elephant.She could see it herself in the Dáil chamber. It’s huge.“Now, if you persist in refusing to acknowledge that elephant in the room, we’re not going to make any progress on this.”And while the Social Democrats will support what is likely to be a record injection of funding for the health service in the budget, – God knows, it’s needed – “the party does not believe in repeatedly pumping large amounts of public money into a dysfunctional health system. Money alone will not solve the endemic problems in our broken health service.”Strong political will is the key. Otherwise our banjaxed system will keep eating up the money. It’s like throwing buns at an elephant.No choiceFor starters, find out why the senior health officials felt they had no choice but to resign their roles heading up Sláintecare. It’s been nearly two full weeks since they walked and nobody in Government seems to know exactly why, and if they do, they aren’t saying. The Minister for Health had a telephone conversation with one on them, apparently.“Of course the Government acknowledges that the resignations were deeply disappointing. Of course we acknowledge that,” soothed Michael McGrath, 12 days after the event.“What are you doing about it?” shot back Róisín Shortall, not unreasonably. “The Government needs to stop ignoring the elephant in the room.”But it is. He neatly sidestepped the worrying charge of “institutional resistance” blocking reform, choosing to get the wrong end of the stick. “There is absolutely no resistance within Government at a political level to delivering on these reforms.”He was tackled on this again by the Independent TD for Galway West, Catherine Connolly, who also accused the Government of hiding behind the pandemic to excuse the delays in implementing the programme. She too reminded him of the timeline involved. Unless the Coalition is trying to backdate the pandemic, Sláintecare was a couple of years up and running before Covid struck.Brushed overBut all Michael McGrath could do was insist that they are doing everything they can to get the programme implemented. Again, he brushed over the real concerns about the delay: vested interests trying to scupper a meaningful overhaul of the health system for all members of society.He promised the removal of “any obstacles and any roadblocks that there are within the system – because they are not at a political level”. They have the “resources” to do this.If only resources were the solution. The Minister has clearly admitted that the blockage in delivering Sláintecare is not at the political end.If the radical blueprint to regenerate the health system is to succeed, it looks like the Government needs to find a Mary Harney-type figure to tackle the vested interests, bang heads together and demand results.Maybe straight-talking Robert Watt, the much-lauded new boss at the Department of Health, is the person do it.Could Watt be the new Mary Harney? Could that be the reason he was headhunted from the Department of Public Expenditure to Health?Maybe he might more than justify his €90,000 pay rise and earn his spurs by shooting the elephants his political masters are too scared to touch.That would be one deliverable worth boasting about."},{"url":null,"title":"wuhan scientists planned releaseskin penetrating nanoparticles","story":"Wuhan and US scientists were planning to release enhanced airborne coronavirus particles into Chinese bat populations to inoculate them against diseases that could jump to humans, leaked grant proposals dating from 2018 show.New documents show that just 18 months before the first Covid-19 cases appeared, researchers had submitted plans to release skin-penetrating nanoparticles and aerosols containing “novel chimeric spike proteins” of bat coronaviruses into cave bats in Yunnan, China.They also planned to create chimeric viruses, genetically enhanced to infect humans more easily, and requested $14million from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (Darpa) to fund the work.Papers, confirmed as genuine by a former member of the Trump administration, show they were hoping to introduce “human-specific cleavage sites” to bat coronaviruses which would make it easier for the virus to enter human cells. When Covid-19 was first genetically sequenced, scientists were puzzled about how the virus had evolved such a human-specific adaptation at the cleavage site on the spike protein, which is the reason it is so infectious.The documents were released by Drastic, the web-based investigations team set up by scientists from across the world to look into the origins of Covid-19.In a statement, Drastic said: “Given that we find in this proposal a discussion of the planned introduction of human-specific cleavage sites, a review by the wider scientific community of the plausibility of artificial insertion is warranted.”The proposal also included plans to mix high-risk natural coronavirus strains with more infectious but less dangerous varieties.The bid was submitted by British zoologist Peter Daszak of EcoHealth Alliance, the US-based organisation, which has worked closely with the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV) researching bat coronaviruses. Team members included Dr Shi Zhengli, the WIV researcher dubbed “bat woman”, pictured below, as well as US researchers from the University of North Carolina and the United States Geological Survey National Wildlife Health Centre.Darpa refused to fund the work, saying: “It is clear that the proposed project led by Peter Daszak could have put local communities at risk”, and warned that the team had not properly considered the dangers of enhancing the virus (gain of function research) or releasing a vaccine by air.Grant documents show that the team also had some concerns about the vaccine programme and said they would “conduct educational outreach … so that there is a public understanding of what we are doing and why we are doing it, particularly because of the practice of bat-consumption in the region”.Angus Dalgleish, Professor of Oncology at St Georges, University of London, who struggled to get work published showing that the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV) had been carrying out “gain of function” work for years before the pandemic, said the research may have gone ahead even without the funding.“This is clearly a gain of function, engineering the cleavage site and polishing the new viruses to enhance human cell infectibility in more than one cell line,” he said. Daszak was also behind a letter published in The Lancet last year which effectively shut down scientific debate into the origins of Covid-19.Viscount Ridley, who has co-authored a book on the origin of Covid-19, due for release in November, and who has frequently called for a further investigation into what caused the pandemic in the House of Lords, said: “For more than a year I tried repeatedly to ask questions of Peter Daszak with no response.“Now it turns out he had authored this vital piece of information about virus work in Wuhan but refused to share it with the world. I am furious. So should the world be. “Peter Daszak and the EcoHealth Alliance (EHA) proposed injecting deadly chimeric bat coronaviruses collected by the Wuhan Institute of Virology into humanised and ‘batified’ mice, and much, much more.”A Covid-19 researcher from the World Health Organisation (WHO), who wished to remain anonymous, said it was alarming that the grant proposal included plans to enhance the more deadly disease of Middle-East Respiratory Syndrome (Mers).“The scary part is they were making infectious chimeric Mers viruses,” the source said. “These viruses have a fatality rate over 30 per cent, which is at least an order of magnitude more deadly than Sars-CoV-2.“If one of their receptor replacements made Mers spread similarly, while maintaining its lethality, this pandemic would be nearly apocalyptic.”EcoHealth Alliance and the Wuhan Institute of Virology have been aproached for comment.More from NewsWhat are trade deals between countries – and why does the UK want one with the US?Number of children referred to mental health services has almost doubled since CovidClimate change could leave quarter of London stations at risk of floodingAnti-Christian zealots have a new tacticRichard Tice: The Conservatives?

Joe Biden was meant to be the anti-Trump, the saviour of Western multilateralism Emmanuel Macron was the poster boy for European centrism, the brilliant reformer who would rescue the continent from descent into populist turmoil. Yet both men have turned out to be calamitously bad, accelerating the disintegration of the West.It may not look like it at first, but Biden, America’s oldest president, and Macron, France’s youngest head of state since Napoleon Bonaparte, have much in common. They clashed in extraordinary fashion last week, with France withdrawing its ambassador over the Aukus pact, but this was a classic case of Coulomb’s Law: like charges repel one another.Both men are overrated accidental presidents who rose to the top because they were seen as the least terrible option both fancy themselves as great technocratic administrators, but are actually shockingly incompetent, as shown by the withdrawal from Afghanistan or France’s endless botched reforms both are hypocritical semi-nationalists who believe in their own nation’s power and sovereignty but not anybody else’s and both are presiding over the accelerating economic, social and moral declines of their countries.Perhaps most unfortunately, both are anti-British: they share a dislike of this country, or at least are ready to bash the UK for domestic political gain. Biden’s aversion stems in part from his support for Irish nationalism, and his typically American misunderstanding of the history and politics of the British Isles. His State Department also still loathes and misunderstands Brexit.Macron sees himself as a latter-day Charles de Gaulle, the leader of the Free French who never forgave Britain for harbouring him and allowing him to liberate Paris. Being served hand and foot at the Élysée Palace does tend to turn presidents into megalomaniacs, but the effect on Macron has been especially toxic. More prosaically, bashing Britain helps him in the polls and, he hopes, dissuades Eastern Europeans from leaving the EU.His attitude towards Britain since 2017 has been unforgivable. He spent the Brexit negotiations pushing the hardest possible position, deliberately seeking to undermine the City, helping to rule out a fuller, proper free trade deal that respected regulatory autonomy, and leveraging what should have been a resolvable technical question over the Irish border to permanently damage the UK. He later threatened to cut off electricity to Jersey, and wrongly cast aspersions on the AstraZeneca vaccine. His government has now hit fresh lows, dismissing Britain as America’s junior partner, and describing Boris Johnson as the “fifth wheel on the carriage”.Macron is treating Britain as an enemy to be contained, not a partner with which to navigate a treacherous world. Why? In a more rational and more truly Gaullist world, Brexit could have been accepted and followed by an Anglo-French partnership of equals, a new entente cordiale on matters of mutual interest. Instead, Macron’s miscalculations will guarantee more Australia-style rebuffs and an even faster fading of French influence. What a terrible, heart-wrenching waste.Biden’s behaviour has been just as appalling. He no longer has any genuine allies: he sees other countries merely as a means to execute American self-interest, as useful instruments in his foreign policy. There is no respect, let alone friendship or gratitude. Other denizens of the White House at least had the sense to pretend to care some, such as Ronald Reagan or George Bush, actually did, at least some of the time.While the French got their just deserts on the Aukus deal – their support of Australia was far inferior to the US-UK offer – the secretive, undiplomatic way Biden behaved was unbecoming. On such grounds at least, Macron was right to be annoyed, though his petulance was ludicrous.Biden’s treatment of Britain is especially egregious. If the Democrats now believe in free trade, they should be pining to reduce trade barriers towards the UK. Why, then, is a trade deal with the US impossible? Why couldn’t a narrow set of arrangements acceptable to both sides be realised? Or why couldn’t Biden invite us to join USMCA, the successor organisation to Nafta, a proposal mooted in Eurosceptic and Republican circles for as long as I can remember?Why seek to “punish” us (and, given that free trade is mutually advantageous, American consumers and business) for being a faithful ally to the US? Why endlessly misrepresent the Good Friday agreement? Why reduce the chance of peace in Northern Ireland? As with Macron, this is not the way to treat friends.The French president’s fury over Aukus will intensify his drive towards a European army, and an integrated EU foreign policy. This cannot end well.It makes sense for the world no longer to follow America blindly: almost all of Washington’s foreign policy decisions since the end of the Cold War have failed disastrously. But when the French talk of pursuing their own path, they refer at best to idioctic semi-colonial adventures in Africa, or at worst to being more supportive of just about every authoritarian regime.It was the French who sold the Osirak nuclear reactor to Iraq, who were most enthusiastic in signing deals with Iran after the ill-fated nuclear deal was inked, and Macron who secured a major deal for Airbus with the Chinese in 2019 in the wake of Sino-US tensions. France remains a Colbertiste nation, obsessed with mercantilism its statist economic policy at home guarantees stagnation, so deals with despots are its only hope. An integrated Franco-German foreign policy would be even worse – sucking up to Russia as well as China.The dream of European strategic autonomy – a European defence no longer reliant on America – will lead to disaster. Nobody wants to spend the cash, not least the semi-pacifist Germans. It will finish off Nato, and tear the EU apart. Who in Eastern Europe would trust a Paris-Berlin axis over Washington for their defence?The Left hailed Macron and Biden as the saviours of the liberal international order but both men have already done more to trash it than anything Donald Trump ever concocted.More from NewsWhat are trade deals between countries – and why does the UK want one with the US?Number of children referred to mental health services has almost doubled since CovidClimate change could leave quarter of London stations at risk of floodingAnti-Christian zealots have a new tacticRichard Tice: The Conservatives?

Russian voters will hardly have been surprised that the president’s United Russia party emerged victorious from the ballot last weekend, winning two thirds of the 450 seats in the country’s parliament. The contest, as is so often the case, was marred by reports of ballot boxes being stuffed with false slips as well as forced voting, while leading opposition candidates were banned from standing or, in the case of the prominent Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny, confined to a prison cell.Mr Putin’s obsessive pursuit of his adversaries, moreover, extends well beyond Russian borders, as demonstrated by the conclusions reached this week by two decisions relating to Kremlin-inspired attacks on Russian dissidents based in Britain.A ruling issued by the European Court of Human Rights concluded that Moscow was responsible for the murder in 2006 of Alexander Litvinenko, the dissident former Russian intelligence agent who died after drinking tea laced with polonium-210 at a London hotel. The court concluded there was a prima facie case that the murder was carried out by two Russian agents who “had been acting on the direction or control of the Russian authorities”.The judgment coincided with British counter-terrorism police charging a third Russian intelligence officer, Maj Gen Denis Sergeev, with involvement in the attempted murder of the former Russian spy Col Sergei Skripal in Salisbury in March 2018. The existence of a third Russian intelligence officer – first revealed by The Daily  – who oversaw the plot to murder Mr Skripal with the nerve agent Novichok highlighted the sophistication of the assassination attempt by Russia’s GRU intelligence operation to silence one of Mr Putin’s fiercest critics.Mr Putin’s well-documented history of tyrannical behaviour during his two decades in power has made it abundantly clear that he is singularly unsuited to hold any position that affords him any form of global responsibility. Yet, thanks to the increasing influence Moscow is able to exert over Europe’s energy market, he now finds himself able to hold his European neighbours to ransom over their energy requirements.Mr Putin may argue that he is not entirely to blame for the recent dramatic increases in global gas prices, which will result in households throughout Europe – especially Britain – facing higher energy bills this winter. A combination of factors, such as a sharp post-pandemic rise in demand in Asia, low gas storage stocks and a reduction in output from renewables such as wind, have certainly contributed to the astonishing 280 per cent increase in wholesale gas prices in Europe so far this year.Yet, as the International Energy Agency (IEA) made clear this week, the Kremlin is also contributing to Europe’s deepening fuel crisis by slowing down its normal flow of gas supplies to mainland Europe, with storage levels lower than normal heading into the winter months.In a rare public rebuke, the IEA pointed out that Russian exports to Europe were lower than in 2019, and called on Moscow to “demonstrate its credentials as a reliable supplier” and “do more to increase gas availability to Europe”.It is unlikely that assisting Europe in its hour of need will feature prominently in Mr Putin’s priorities as he assesses the potentially devastating impact that the energy crisis could have on Britain and the European Union’s economic recovery from the pandemic. Instead, the indications suggest that the Kremlin has been deliberately planning for just such an eventuality.Concerns about Mr Putin’s attempts to exert undue influence over the rest of Europe have been steadily growing since construction began five years ago on the £8 billion Nord Stream 2 subsea pipeline that runs from the Baltic to Germany. The project, which was completed this month, has been the focus of great controversy over claims it will further increase European dependence on Russian energy, which already accounts for about one third of its requirements. The project is also seen as a deliberate ploy by the Kremlin to isolate Ukraine, which is set to lose out on billions of dollars in gas transit fees.Washington has long regarded the Nord Stream 2 project as a blatant attempt by Moscow to establish a controlling interest over Europe’s energy needs, one that, once established, can be exploited to ransom European capitals into acceding to Moscow’s demands.These concerns have finally persuaded the EU to take a more sober assessment of Mr Putin’s motives in developing Nord Stream 2, which has created hesitancy in Brussels about giving its approval to the new pipeline. The problem Europe now faces is that, as the crisis over gas prices has highlighted, European leaders have woken up too late to the insidious threat Mr Putin poses to Europe’s energy needs.More from NewsWhat are trade deals between countries – and why does the UK want one with the US?Number of children referred to mental health services has almost doubled since CovidClimate change could leave quarter of London stations at risk of floodingAnti-Christian zealots have a new tacticRichard Tice: The Conservatives?

The Justice Secretary, who was standing in for Boris Johnson at Prime Ministeraposs Questions, was sacked as Foreign Secretary last week over his handling of the Afghanistan crisis.It followed widespread outrage for him staying at the plush Amirandes Hotel in Crete to top up his tan while the Taliban took Kabul. Ms Rayner took him to task over the cost of his stay, telling him ministers told Brits to work harder while hitting the pockets of working families by “cutting the income of a worker on £, a year by over £,” with tax rises. She said: “That is almost exactly the same as an average annual energy bill. Just as energy prices are ballooning they have chosen to take the money that could cover a year’s worth of bills out of the pockets of working people.  “The Deputy Prime Minister has said the solution is for people to work harder. So, can he tell us how many days a worker on the minimum wage would have to work this year in order to afford a night at a luxury hotel, say in Crete ” Mr Raab replied the Government had previously cut income tax for the lowest paid and have boosted the minimum wage, but he was unable to answer her question about his plush sunshine break. Ms Rayner hit back, saying: “He talks about the economy, he doesn’t even know how much his own holiday cost. “So let me tell him. A worker on the minimum wage would need to work an extra  days to pay for a single night at his favourite resort, probably even morethe sea was open. The very same week that the Government is cutting Universal Credit, working people face soaring energy bills.” Keir Starmeraposs deputy then shamed the Justice Secretary over reports he is unhappy at having to share the grace and favour Chevening mansion with his successor as Foreign Secretary, Liz Truss.  The huge country residence is paid for by a charity, but is provided to Government ministers for no cost to them. Ms Rayner said the Conservatives do “not care about working people” before adding: “Families across the country are worried about heating their homes while he’s complaining about having to share his -room taxpayer-funded mansion with the Foreign Secretary – the truth hurts, doesn’t it  – just as his Government are making choices that are making working families’ lives harder. “A typical family is facing a tough winter this year: Universal Credit down a thousand quid rent up  quid gas bills up  quid taxes up and food prices are soaring. Working people will have to choose whether to feed their kids or heat their homes. “The choice for the Deputy Prime Minister is will he make their lives easier or harder  So what will he choose – will the Government cancel the Universal Credit cut ” Mr Raab replied: “She should check her facts as Chevening is funded by a charity, not a penny of taxpayers’ money.Most ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Energy billsFuel povertyMinimum wageThe economyPMQs\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Environment Secretary George Eustice admitted there were still challenges in the food supply chain but insisted that Brits would not face shortages in the run up to the festive period. Industry figures had warned that shoppers could begin to see empty shelves within days due to a shortage of CO, which is used in the production process for meat and some frozen goods. The crisis was triggered when a major US-owned fertiliser firm - which produces CO as a by-product - halted UK production following a surge in wholesale gas prices. The Government has brokered a deal with CF Industries to restart production, which means the taxpayer could potentially pay millions of pounds towards the firmaposs operating costs.  But the bailout will only last three weeks - with the Government pinning its hopes on the prospect of gas prices stabilising. Askedthe festive period was safe, Mr Eustice told LBC: Yes, it is. Christmas is safe, of course. But there are challenges in the food supply chain and I’m not denying that. So pressures on labour, lack of labour availability, pressures on logistics, all of these are causing some stresses. It does mean that in some areas the degree of choice in supermarkets is down slightly on what it would normally be, but we’re working with the industry to make sure that we get all the food that we need on the shelves for those all-important weeks running up to Christmas. Mr Eustice said the deal could run to tens of millions of pounds - but said the Government had to act. The truth is,we did not act, then by this weekend, or certainly by the early part of next week, some of the poultry processing plants would need to close, and then we would have animal welfare issues - because you would have lots of chickens on farms that couldnapost be slaughtered on time and would have to be euthanised on farms. We would have a similar situation with pigs, he told Sky News. There would have been a real animal welfare challenge here and a big disruption to the food supply chain, so we felt we needed to act. He insisted that increases in the price of CO would not hit food prices after fears that shoppers might suffer. The critical thing was to get production up and running expeditiously, thataposs why we have needed this Government intervention, he told the BBC. But we have had meetings with the food industry, they all recognise that the price of carbon dioxide is going to increase substantially. And when that price increases then the market signal will be there for these plants to continue producing.

By Johnson’s side in the US was Liz Truss - the woman who succeeded Raab as Foreign Secretary just seven days ago.It was a brutal illustration of Dom’s dumping that here he was at noon on Wednesday, answering MPs’ inquiries about seasonal agricultural workers, GP appointments and rail services in Dorset, rather than , miles across the Atlantic. Parliamentary convention dictates thatthe PM is absent from their weekly grilling, the Leader of the Opposition also steps aside. Keir Starmer gallantly gave way to his deputy Angela Rayner, who has more titles than a local library.  Brace yourself - Rayner is Shadow Minister for the Cabinet Office and Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, Shadow Secretary of State for the Future of Work and Deputy Leader of the Official Opposition. She’s also deputy Labour leader.She is also a natural Commons performer, utterly confident in her own skin and, let’s face it, always up for a scrap. Rayner ripped into Raab over the looming living standards crisis, his tussle with Truss for the keys to a luxury grace-and-favour mansion in Kent, and his Greek holiday as Afghanistan fell to the Taliban.He should “go back to his sunlounger and let me take over”, stormed Rayner.  She peppered her living standards attack with repeated use of the word “quid”: A typical family is facing a tough winter this year - Universal Credit down a thousand quid rent up  quid gas bills up  quid.” It sounded, and surely was, totally natural from her one could not imagine QC and knight of the realm Starmer sounding so comfortable deploying slang in the Commons. Raab appeared resigned to his mauling, smiling grimly at the ferocity, effectiveness and force of the onslaught. How he must have wanted to be in America.

Half-term holidays hang in the balance after Grant Shapps was unable to give a firm date when the need for double-jabbed Brits to take the ‘gold standard’ Covid tests will be scrapped. But in a hopeful sign he said the Department of Health is “aware” of half term, which runs in the week from October  in England. He said they will be helping to provide a firm date “as quickly as possible” and added: “Obviously, they wonapost come back on the nd.” Under changes from October , the amber list will be axed and countries will be split into either the red list or the rest of the world.  Unvaccinated people arriving from the rest of the world will have to isolate and take three tests including two PCRs. From late October, vaccinated people will only need to take two tests and neither will have to be an expensive PCR. Instead of the Day  PCR test, vaccinated Brits will be able to pay for a cheaperlateral flow test. Mr Shapps has already said his “aim” is to have the new testing system in time for when peoplefrom half-term holidays. His comments today suggest he is trying to change the system by then - but there is still no firm date, and families could only find out at short notice. Mr Shapps told the Commons Transport Committee: Itaposs clear the range of measures I introduced this week and last week are going to make a big dference and people will be able to travel much more freely. Part of that is the removal of the PCR test on day two and replacing it with a much simpler lateral flow test.

Mr McDonnell said Sir Keir, who was elected using the OMOV system  months ago, should go back to that electorate before making changes.Currently every Labour member and affiliate receives an equal vote on choosing a party leader, after Ed Miliband abolished the ‘electoral college’ which split the vote into blocks of unions, MPs and members. The system was widely credited with allowing the election of left-wing candidate Jeremy Corbyn, who scraped through on MPs’ nominations but then won support from a newly-enlarged Labour membership.Proposed reforms unveiled by Keir Starmer ’s office this week would bring back the electoral college.It would mean any election for a new leader would see the vote split three ways between MPs, trade unions and grassroots members of Constituency Labour Parties . Separately, the Labour leader is also proposing to signicantly raise the threshold for which MPs can face a deselection threat.As it stands,either a third of members or a third of affiliates want to block their MPsapos candidacy at the next general election, a race can be triggered.A Labour source said: The trigger system just isnapost working. It is forcing MPs to spend their time talking to the party rather than voters.  “Keir is serious about making this an outward facing party - not just talking about it. A Labour spokesman said: You saw Keiraposs words to the shadow cabinet yesterday. He set out why he thinks this is the right thing to do in terms of ensuring that the party focuses more on the country.We are putting ourselves in a position to win a general election and he sees these reforms as an important part of that. AskedLabour was facing inwards ahead of its annual conference, the spokesman said: I donapost see that as being an issue. Askedit would overshadow conference, the spokesman said: No. But the plans - which emerged in a surprise move days before the party conference - enraged the Labour left and prompted a backlash among unions. New Unite general secretary Sharon Graham told the Mirror she was bemused and disappointed by the eleventh-hour plan to switch rules, saying: I wasnapost even angry, I was bemused. Itaposs sort of felt like theyaposve lost touch with reality. Who thinks this is a good idea  Itaposs just strange. She said: Why are we discussing this trivia at this present moment in time  Put in a box and talk about this later. Weaposre in crisis. Mr Starmer told his shadow cabinet on Tuesday: Our rules as they are right now, focus us inwards to spend too much time talking to and about ourselves and they weaken the link with our unions. He added: These rules won’t be presented on a take it or leave it basis. I am prepared to take suggestions and ideas and have a conversation and to try and build consensus. But the principles are important to me. “I hope TULO will support me, I believe these changes are good for their members and they strengthen our link. I know that this is dficult - change always is - but I think these changes are vital for our party’s future. “I have said I will make the Labour Party the party of working people, I am determined that the Labour party I lead focuses on the country, on the concerns of voters, so we need party reforms that better connect us with working people re-orient us toward the voters who can take us to power.” But Labour MPs spoke out against the plan on social media. One, Alex Sobel, tweeted: “MPs already have the privilege of casting the qualying nominations for Labour Leader to ensure the confidence of the PLP. “We must then trust our members and union affiliated supporters to vote for the best candidate by OMOV. “The Electoral College just looks like a fix for MPs” Zarah Sultana said: “The Labour leadership wants to abolish aposOne Member, One Voteapos and instead hoard power in the hands of a Westminster elite. “This power grab must be resisted by everyone who believes in a progressive, democratic Labour Party.”Most ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON WestminsterLabour PartyRadio Electoral CollegeEd MilibandJohn McDonnellJeremy CorbynR TodayEducationSchoolsPolitics\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The Labour leaderaposs much-trailed ,-word essay aposThe Road Aheadapos hits back at criticism he has failed to outline a plan for power in the  months since he seized the helm. It was published by the Fabian Society as MPs, campaigners and activists gear up for the partyaposs conference in Brighton. Here is what we have learned from the Labour leaderaposs y treatise.Starmer set out aposten principlesapos for a aposcontribution societyaposThe former Director of Public Prosecutions sets out ten principles for what he calls a contribution society in which everyone has a part to play but people are rewarded for putting in. These principles are:We will always put hard-working families and their priorities first If you work hard and play by the rules, you should be rewarded fairly People and businesses are expected to contribute to society, as well as receive Your chances in le should not be defined by the circumstances of your birth – hard work and how you contribute should matter Families, communities and the things that bring us together must once again be put above inidualism The economy should work for citizens and communities. It is not good enough to just surrender to market forces The role of government is to be a partner to private enterprise, not stle it The government should treat taxpayer money asit were its own. The current levels of waste are unacceptable The government must play its role in restoring honesty, decency and transparency in public le We are proudly patriotic but we reject the isiveness of nationalismStarmer sees the Covid pandemic as a turning pointThe Labour leader sees Covid- as a major turning point for Britain, akin to that of the recovery from World War .Starmer tells a tale of two pandemics, saying lockdown was a more dficult, damaging experience for poorer people than it was for the more affluent. The burden fell on those who couldn’t work from home and those who were already struggling, he says.He goes on to say people want to emerge from lockdown into something better, as Brits did when they emerged from the Second World War, adding: I believe we are living through a time when the inidualism that prioritises personal entitlement, moral superiority and self-interest is receding in society’s rear-view mirror.  He says: “Britain under the next Labour government will no longer be trampled by the tyranny of low expectations. “If we are to reimagine what is possible, we will need to demand high standards. “If we are to unlock the vast reserves of potential and productivity in this country, we will need to be restless. “If we are to overcome cynicism, we will need to be the party of practical action.”Labour is pro-business and will aposfixapos the Brexit dealBoris Johnson once reportedly said f*** business when told firms feared Brexit would damage the economy. Trade barriers have added an extra £m in cost since Britain left the EU and there is a growing frustration over red tape, staff shortagesand empty supermarket shelves. Starmer underlines he sees business as a force for good and pledges to fix the holes in the shoddy Brexit deal and rebuild ties with Europe. He says: We have seen from the government’s failure to properly manage our departure from the European Union what happens when the expertise and concerns of business are ignored. The sight of empty shelves in our supermarkets should be embarrassing to ministers who failed to understand the complex supply chains and streamlined logistics that British businesses rely upon. By creating unnecessary red tape and bureaucracy, the government has cost both businesses and consumers. The Labour leader has very little to say on immigration, however, saying only that the idea that the immigration and social security systems are a free-for-all has been fertile territory for populist politicians, who have sowed mistrust. Starmer will refuse to fight the culture wars Many claim Boris Johnsonaposs Tories are keen to fight the next election on the culture wars and woke issues, as campaigners raise questions on Britainaposs history, and racial, gender and social equality. Starmer calls the Tories war on woke an increasingly bizarre obsession and makes clear that he sees the battleground dferently. Rather, he thinks Labour should not wade into every row and instead focus on opposing the conspiracy theories, crankery, misinformation and hatred allowed to flourish, often as part of the debate.  He says the Government has many slogans, such as levelling up, but adds: In the absence of a defining economic project or plan, theTories have instead plunged headfirst into the murky depths of the so-called ‘culture wars’. Building bonds between fellow citizens has never been more crucial, he later adds. But rather than take on these challenges, the Conservatives have tried to exploit isions, leading to an increasingly bizarre obsession with what happens on university campuses, a crime bill that offers statues of slavers more protection than women walking down the street, and McCarthyite accusations of Marxist plots against everyone from teachers to those protesting racism. But Starmer has some fighting talk for the SNP Rather than the culture wars, Starmer sees the SNPaposs push for independence and what he calls the rise of the multi-headed hydra of nationalism as a more immediate threat.Hinting at how Labour might make the case for the Union in any second independence referendum north of the border, he claims the SNP and Scottish Tories feed off ision.He says: Both the SNP and the Conservatives use culture to distract and deflect, creating ision between people of these islands. The business of effective governance and improving people’s lives comes second to ideology. Both use nationalism freely to whip up fear of the other.  He adds: Nationalists like to portray themselves as patriots. But patriotism and nationalism are not the same. In fact, they are opposites. Nationalism represents an attempt to ide people from one another patriotism is an attempt to unite people of dferent backgrounds. Nationalism is about the casting out of the other patriotism is about finding common ground. Nationalism is the flag as a threat. Patriotism is the flag as a celebration. These are lines which will be highly contested by Nicola Sturgeon and other pro-independence figures. The Corbyn era and Labour aposnavel gazingapos is officially over Frustration at Corbynaposs rejection of Blairaposs years in power run through the treatise, with Starmer fuming that in recent years the party has been squabbling over its own past, rather than one focused on the future. He contrasts Labouraposs towering achievement in government with long periods of self-doubt and navel-gazing and lambasts his predecessor, saying: We had moved from being the party of ‘white heat’ to the party of sepia-tinged nostalgia. He adds: In recent decades, the legacy of the  Labour government has become contested to the extent that the party has at times felt like separate families living under one roof. This has been harmful and alienating. It has not progressed the cause of achieving a Labour government and has been damaging to our country. Jeremy Corbyn is not mentioned once in the document Boris Johnsonwhile the word aposfutureapos crops up some  times.Tony Blair is back in fashion In , Blair gave the  anniversary lecture for the Fabian Society, and he called it Let Us Face The Future. In Starmeraposs essay, for the same think tank, the Labour leader appears to directly reference Blairaposs critique of his party in , writing We must take inspiration from  – but that cannot mean dwelling on the past. Instead, we must face the future. He adds: “It is impossible to live in this moment and not feel the winds of changes blowing, just as they did in  and .”  He also mirrors some of New Labouraposs language, calling for a new settlement between the government, business and working people, a new deal for working people and an effective partnership of state and private sector, which sees Starmer distance himself from Corbynaposs policies of renationalising services like utilities and rail. Throughout, Starmer holds up Blairaposs, and Gordon Brownaposs successes and ambition for the country in opposition to the Toriesapos record. Starmer backs new laws to tackle racial inequality - but is less clear on trans rights Starmer pledges a new Race Equality Act and his view to tackle complex structural racism which exists in Britain. This follows the vile racism faced by England stars such as Marcus Rashford after they took the knee at games and outcry over a highly-criticised Government-commission report which claimed to have found no evidence of systemic racism in the UK. The Labour leader writes: When people across the world come together to say that black lives matter, when England footballers take the knee before the biggest games of their lives and when black people chant ‘we can’t breathe’,they aren’t asking for more nice words or inquiries – they are demanding real progress. We would introduce a new Race Equality Act in the UK, aimed at tackling the complex structural racism that holds back people from every community. While Labour has said separately that it backs reforming Gender Recognition Act and self-declaration for trans people, Starmeraposs essay makes no mention of trans rights.Mental health waiting list targets Starmer said, as Blair set his Government waiting NHS waiting list targets in , he would back similar targets for mental health services. This follows reports that people needing support for mental health problems ranging from depression and anxiety to psychosis and eating disorders are left waiting months and in some cases years for help. He said: The  Labour government set ambitious targets for waiting lists in the NHS and they worked: the next Labour government will set ourselves the same challenge on mental health. The mental health charity Mind suggest that just one in eight adults with a mental health problem are currently getting treatment  and waiting lists are soaring. Starmer plans to stick around... and for a long time  Perhaps most revealing were the final words of Starmeraposs treatise, in which he makes clear he in post for the long haul. It comes amid speculation he could face a challenge from the Left of his party and critics pointing out that Labour has yet to catch up with the Tories in the polls while an election could come as early as . Starmer says: To anyone who believes in a better future, based on these principles, I say: join us. The road ahead will be long. The journey will not always be simple. But the choices are clear and the prize at the end great. At this historic moment, Labour has a chance to once again build a better country for working people. This is the path we have chosen: let us take it together.

The most eyebrow-raising move from the leadership proposes switching back to the electoral college system for leadership elections. It would mean that any election for a new leader would see the vote split three ways between MPs, trade unions and grassroots members of Constituency Labour Parties . This would be a big sht away from the aposone member one voteapos system, which Ed Miliband brought in to dilute union influence and gave all votes equal weight.  Mr Starmer also wants to cut the number of motions put to Labour Party conference delegates.Thirdly, he wants to raise the threshold by which MPs can face a deselection threat. As it stands,a third of members or a third of affiliates want to block their candidacy at the next general election, they can trigger a contest.Trade unions asked for more time after the TULO meeting, with Unite calling for the plans to be delayed and put to a special conference organised at a later date. Mr Starmer needs backing from at least some of the partyaposs major affiliated unions - GMB, Unison, Usdaw and Unite being the largest - to get delegates at Labouraposs conference in Brighton next week to vote the plan through. A source said Mr Starmer left the meeting saying he needed time to reflect on his next move. If he refuses to back down and ditch or dilute the plans, it sets the stage for a showdown at a meeting of Labouraposs ruling National Executive Committee- a group made up of MPs, union and other senior figures - who, on Friday, could be asked to vote to press ahead and put the plan to delegates regardless. Without backing from a number of unions, and amid reports Deputy Leader Angela Rayner is sceptical of the plans, it is not guaranteed the NEC will agree.  The leadershipaposs plan would raise the bar for a selection challenge to half of both members and affiliates. The TSSA union has called the sht back to the electoral college the sort of thing associated with Victorian Tories”, while Unite boss Sharon Graham has strongly made the case for Labour to ditch old wars between Left and Right amid Covid. Former shadow chancellor John McDonnell, meanwhile, called it an attempt to bounce through new rules which disenfranchise members with a grubby stitch-up deal with unions. While GMB figures were not thought to have been at the TULO meeting, Unison, a strong supporter of Mr Starmeraposs, was said to be among those calling for more time. While some of the movementaposs more Left wing unions, including CWU, TSSA and the FBU were unlikely to back the leadership, those close to Mr Starmer will be anxiously awaiting news from the GMB, Unison and Usdaw. More broadly, the row will be seen as a key test of whether Jeremy Corbynaposs successor has control over his party. When Mr Starmer chaired a meeting of his shadow cabinet on Tuesday, he said the plans would not be presented on a take it or leave it basis. He said: Iaposm prepared to take suggestions and ideas and to have a conversation and try to build consensus but the principles are important to me. “I hope TULO will support me, I believe these changes are good for their members and they strengthen our link.

There was broad consensus on the need to refocus the Labour party on the country and concerns of working people.Discussions will continue.

The Labour leader, who heads to Brighton this weekend for the party’s autumn conference, should carve out policies designed to appeal to proud English people, according to former Communities Secretary John Denham. The -year-old is director of the English Labour Network, which was set up in  to “bring together party activists at every level to make Labour’s case for England to English voters”. He believes the party’s route back to power lies in trumpeting English identity in the same way the Welsh and Scots are proud of their heritage.  “When I talk about the English I think about ‘we’ and ‘us’,” said Mr Denham. “Some people in the Labour Party talk about the English as ‘they’ and ‘them’. “Until people in the Labour Party are comfortable talking about ‘we’ and ‘us’, we are going to have a problem.” Mr Denham was MP for Southampton Itchen from  until  and it is exactly the type of seat Labour must win toto power. Since , and apart from , when Mr Denham claimed a  majority, whoever wins the constituency wins No. “The balance of power here is held by that group of voters who would identy as English, who are former Labour voters or are from families of former Labour voters who were in working class jobs that no longer exist,” he said. “They have swung decisively against the Labour Party. It’s the national picture.”  His , majority in Labour’s  landslide fell at every subsequent election and the Tories seized the constituency in , winning by , votes. At the December  poll, they increased their majority to ,. The result was the culmination of years of drt to the Conservatives, fuelled by industrial decline, mass migration and a growing sense of unfairness among Labour supporters, according to Mr Denham. Standing on the ft-high Itchen Toll Bridge, he pointed downstream to the Spitfire Court apartment block, named after the Battle of Britain aircraft Supermarine built on the site, and the disused waste ground once occupied by Vosper Thorneycroft’s Woolston shipyard, which specialised in frigates and employed , workers. It closed in  after orders dwindled following the end of the Cold War. Four miles away, in Swaythling, was Ford’s Transit van factory which produced , vehicles a year - half for export. It shut in  when production switched to Turkey.  Mr Denham said the “big economic changes that have taken place” were partly responsible for firing people’s sense of identity and community - and Labour failed to gauge voters’ feelings. “Lots of the parts of le which went with industry - with lots of families working in the same places, with trade unions that not only looked after people’s interests at work but, for quite a few people who hadn’t necessarily done well at school, were routes to education, training and success - that whole picture is vastly reduced and the way of le that went with it,” he said. “When these changes were taking place, people became less sure that Labour was speaking for them anymore. “They may still have voted Labour but the sense of loss they had wasn’t being properly represented.  It was like, ‘This is globalisation, you have to lump it’.” He cited Tony Blair’s  Labour conference speech where the then Prime Minister claimed: “I hear people say we have to stop and debate globalisation. You might as well debate whether autumn should follow summer.” Mr Denham said: “Whatyour experience of globalisation has been lost ”Mass migration from eastern Europe also hit Labouraposs relationship with traditional voters. “As a policy, the Government didn’t anticipate correctly how many people would come,” said Mr Denham. “What really went wrong is that nobody in government would talk about these huge changes in the labour market.” Together, they paved the way for Brexit and Labour’s ongoing exile from government. “The real mistake was not admitting this was having a big impact,” said Mr Denham. “There was this sense of, ‘We’ve lost our heavy industry, you’re not really reflecting our values on things like welfare and now these big changes are taking place and you’re not even talking about it’.”  People believed Labour were “not really people like us any more, you don’t speak for people like us”, he said. “Though I am immensely proud of what we did when we were in government, there were things about New Labour that started the problem.” Key to reversing the tide is speaking about Englishness, said Mr Denham. “The past  years is the story of Labour losing its support amongst voters who have a clear English identity,” he said. “They’re not English nationalists, they don’t want English independence. But they have these views about England being properly represented.” Cricket-loving Mr Denham, who is also a regular at Southampton FC, urged Labour to “talk about England” and “don’t, as the Labour Party does all the time, say ‘Britain’ when you mean ‘England’.” He pointed to Labour’s success in Wales as an example of “fusing what is a genuinely radical and competent Labour government with the idea of Welshness”.  “Everybody in the Labour Party should be talking to Wales and trying to learn from that,” he insisted. “They have handled questions of identity in the Labour Party much more successfully.” Mr Denham urged Labour’s UK leadership to develop a “consistent message about wanting to represent the people of England” - and Mr Starmer to address English identity. “He’s not really engaging with the English question yet,” he said. “Patriotism gets you into the debate but ultimately your alignment with patriotism - which is a necessary - has got to become a compelling story about the future of the nation or nations.  “That, it’s fair to say, is a work in progress.” He called for “progressive patriotism - the ability to present Labour policies within a patriotic view of the future of the nation”. The English Labour Network hosts a conference fringe on Sunday, covering identity, campaigning tactics and how the party should “tailor its politics through this progressive, patriotic prism”. “Talking about England and Englishness is part of the signal you send to voters that we get it, we know who you are and we want to speak for you,” warned Mr Denham. “It’s not just ‘you have a St George Cross, you win the election’ - it’s a symbol of the determination to speak for people who feel they don’t have a voice.”Most ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Labour PartyJohn DenhamTony BlairPoliticsKeir Starmer\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The Department for Educationtoday announces it has expanded its Glasses in Classes scheme to reach more than , pupils in at least  schools in England. It was trialled in Bradford and will now be expanded to Doncaster, Derby, Durham, Norwich and Breckland, and the North Yorkshire Coast. Children identied as needing glasses will receive one pair for home and one for school to help improve reading and writing skills. Children can already get free eye tests and vouchers for glasses but experts fear many poorer pupils do not have sight problems spotted in time. Under the scheme, pupils receive support from a vision co-ordinator, usually a teaching assistant, to attend follow-up eye examinations, get their prescription glasses and wear them regularly.  Schools do not usually get the results of vision screenings that pupils take in reception. But during the pilot, these results were shared with staff in schools so they knew which pupils and families to support. The scheme, first piloted at  primary schools in Bradford, aims to prevent disadvantaged pupils from being left behind because of poor eyesight. It will now be adapted for five disadvantaged areas in England under the DfEaposs Opportunity Areas programme - where the Government has targeted more resources at  social mobility cold spots. Speaking on National Eye Health Week, Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi said: As a young boy shortly after arriving in this country, I sat at the back of the classroom with poor language skills and low confidence, struggling to engage with my lessons. Back then, I could never have dreamt of the opportunities this country would give me and I am determined to help every young person overcome obstacles, just as I was supported. Too many children still struggle with the literacy skills they need to make the most of their education. Simple steps like providing free glasses to those that need them so they can clearly see words on a page, for example, can help close the literacy gap and foster a love of learning. Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders , said: This novel scheme focuses on young people whose learning is hampered by poor eyesight and whose circumstances mean they have either not been to see an optician or do not have the glasses they need. It is refreshing to see the Government reacting positively to a local initiative that has seen results in Bradford and extending it to a further five disadvantaged areas in the north of the country. It would be greatit could eventually be rolled out on a national basis to bring the same benefits to all young people. Paul Whiteman, general secretary of school leadersapos union NAHT, said: It is essential that the Government invests more in education and young people, and does so without delay. Programmes like this are encouraging but what the education sector is crying out for is a fully funded strategy for education recovery which meets the needs of all pupils in all areas of the country. Thereaposs no time to waste, particularly because the Comprehensive Spending Review will be delivered next month.Most ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Paul WhitemanNadhim ZahawiEducationSchools\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Today two power firms collapsed, leaving , customers facing higher bills. Other smaller providers are also expected to fail. The impact is not just being felt in domestic fuel bills. The sharp increase in energy prices is hurting business, disrupting supplies to stores and upping the cost of the weekly shop. It is no use ministers wringing their hands and blaming the global rise in wholesale prices. They were warned years ago that Britain required a more secure energy supply. Do you agree  Have your say in the comment section  Other nations are weathering the storm as they invested in gas storage and ersied their sources of power. The Tories placed their faith in a broken system of market forces. We are now paying the price for their complacency. Millions of households are now set for a stark winter of soaring energy bills, higher taxes and rising inflation. The Government are blind to the economic hardship facing so many families. At least they could cancel cutting Universal Credit, which will put more people into poverty. PM all hot air Boris Johnson appealed to world leaders to join together to tackle global warming. His call comes as Britain prepares to host next month’s COP summit, where nations will be asked to commit to reducing emissions. It is crucial the meeting succeeds in its aims. Get all the latest news straight to your inbox.to one of the Mirroraposs newslettersMr Johnson is right to champion this cause. But he does himself no favours by lecturing other states about backing developing nations when his own Government has cut its ­international aid budget. Britain is also failing to meet its own targets on cutting carbon output. The Prime Minister needs to start practising what he preaches.

But he has so far failed to define what it actually meansByAletha Adu:,  Sep | comments Towns need five-year guaranteed cash pots to hit one of Boris Johnson ’s key manesto promises, a report says today .The UK’s official infrastructure advisers say areas with poor transport connections will need around £ billion per year in order to ‘level up’ their local infrastructure. A report published by the National Infrastructure Commission says councils are currently “competing against each other” for investment which “burns up staff time”. Instead experts have called for a “dual track” approach of devolved, flexible budgets based on population and local network size which will help areas with poor transport connections and develop others where new industries could spring up. The report warns: “Failure to empower local authorities to deliver local infrastructure will lead the Government to fail in its levelling up goals.”  Calls for powers to be devolved to local councils have been backed by the International Trade Committee. Todaythe Committee urges the Government to set out exactly how funding will support its wider levelling-up goals. In a separate report titled aposInward Foreign Direct Investmentapos the Committee said the Governmentaposs levelling up White Paper should reference policy on infrastructure, skills, higher education, integrating with Global Value Chains and further devolution of powers in the English regions. Commissioner Bridget Rosewell says: “Levelling up cannot be done from Whitehall. “Every English town faces a dferent set of challenges and opportunities and local leaders are best placed to develop strategies to address these. “Competing against other councils for multiple pots of cash creates a focus on the short term, continual uncertainty, and burns up staff time.  “Local councils need to be empowered to deliver transformational plans for the future and held accountable for doing so.” Councillor David Renard, economy spokesperson for the Local Government Association, said: “Reducing and simplying the number of funding streams available to councils and providing long-term certainty will help councils plan and deliver better transport and connectivity across the country.” The findings come after the Government asked the commission in March to review how infrastructure investment can best support the needs of dferent town-sized settlements.

Mr Johnson had previously insisted the UK would be first in line for a free trade deal - which was touted by some Brexiteers as one of the major benefits of leaving the EU.  But attempts to kickstart trade talks on his first trip to the US since becoming PM appeared to fizzle out. Government insiders suggested Britain would look at other options including asking to join the the existing US-Mexico-Canada agreementinstead. A diplomatic source said: There are a iety of dferent ways to do this. The question is whether the US administration is ready. The ball is in the USaposs court. It takes two to tango. But a spokesman for the PM dismissed the comments on Wednesday in a briefing for Westminster reporters. Thataposs not an approach we are currently taking, the spokesman said.Our focus is on trying to negotiate a bilateral deal with the US, which is in the interests of Britain.Ex-President Donald Trump, who oversaw the USMCA pact, was more enthusiastic over the prospect of a free trade deal with Britain which he said would be fantastic and big.But the PM has sought to dampen expectations of an imminent agreement with Mr Biden. Environment Secretary George Eustice struck a downbeat note over the hopes of an UK-UK trade deal. He said that the UK still very much hope to be able to put together an agreement with the United States but itaposs just not a priority for the Biden administration.Mr Eustice also risked a row with the US when he said Mr Biden was wrong over Brexit.The President, who is proud of his Irish roots, had raised concerns about the impact of part of Mr Johnsonaposs EU trade deal on peace on the island of Ireland.  The Northern Ireland protocol, a key part of the deal, has created a trade border in the Irish Sea by effectively keeping it in the EUaposs single market for goods. During his White House summit with the PM, Mr Biden said he felt very strongly about any issues to the peace process. And I would not at all like to see - nor, I might add, would many of my Republican colleagues like to see - a change in the Irish accords, the end result having a closed border in Ireland, he said. Mr Johnson said thataposs absolutely right, adding: On that point, Joe, weaposre completely at one, nobody wants to see anything that interrupts or unbalances the Belfast Good Friday Agreement. But back in the UK, Mr Eustice said the President is probably at the moment just reading the headlines. He told Sky News: We think he is wrong because the truth is that unless we have a sustainable solution that enables trade to continue between GB and Northern Ireland then we are going to have issues, and that itself would become a challenge to the Belfast Agreement. We will obviously explain to the United States effectively it is tantamount to saying that potatoes grown in one part of the United States canapost be sold in another part of the United States. When you explain some of those provisions in detail, it is understood by the US government that that clearly does not make any sense and therefore should be revisited. Mr Eustice said the protocol was very complicated and Iaposm not sure hedoes fully appreciate all of that.

Top Tory Kwasi Kwarteng said he feared recent spikes in wholesale costs which have driven cost surges for power firms could persist. And the spiralling prices are set to filter down to higher household bills. Mr Kwarteng told the Commons Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Select Committee: I think apostemporaryapos means that itaposs a position where the price has spiked considerably... I think it has quadrupled in the last six months, seven months. You would expect normally that the price would revert to the mean, itaposs not something that we think is going to be sustainable. But, of course, we have to prepare for longer-term high prices. He did not, however, rule out introducing a windfall tax on firms which have benefited from the soaring gas prices. Darren Jones, chairman of the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Select Committee, said Spain had imposed a levy on “the generators and traders who are making very signicant profits” to fund protections for consumers. Askedthat was a possibility here, Mr Kwarteng said: “We are looking at all options. “What they are doing in Spain is recognising that it’s an entire system – the energy system is an entire system. “I am in discussion with Ofgem and other officials, looking at all options.”The warning comes as the Tories prepare to slash £ a week from the household budgets of the poorer families when the temporary Universal Credit hike is scrapped next month.He later told the Committee consumers have to be protected from exorbitant [energy] prices, especially vulnerable customers. Mr Kwarteng admitted on Tuesday that the families face a dficult winter as the UC cut coincides with rising energy bills. Giving evidence to the Committee, he acknowledged the high correlation between people on pre-payment meters and people on UC before adding, that’s why I want to protect them in this energy squeeze. Tens of millions of pounds of taxpayersapos cash could be spent funding the operating costs of a major US-owned fertiliser firm, which produces huge amounts of carbon dioxide as a by-product. CF Industries halted operations at its plants in Cheshire and Teesside due to soaring global gas prices. Mr Kwarteng brokered a deal with the firm for a three-week bailout to prevent shortages of food, as suppliers of meat and frozen food use CO in the packaging process. Earlier, MPs heard that the Government and Ofgem that the sector was fragile at least two years ago. Energy UK chief executive Emma Pinchbeck said a short-term crisis as gas prices spike has exposed some fault lines in the UK market and warned that even well-run suppliers might go bust. I took this job a year ago. When I was hired, the chairman of Energy UK said that your biggest challenge is going to be the vulnerability of the retail market, she told MPs on the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Committee. And I know that for a year or more before that my team had been making the case to the regulator and the Government that the sector is fragile. Thereaposs a short-term crisis here, which is in some ways out of our control - itaposs to do with the gas prices - but itaposs been exacerbated and arguably caused by our regulatory design. And that is a resilience and security of supply risk in the future. Itaposs terrible news for customers in the long run. The Business Secretary believes the best way to avoid future crises is to ensure the UK has a ersity of supply. A ersity of supply will keep us safe from shocks to the system including any changes to Putinaposs regime.

news politics universal-credit-top-tory-links-\"Universal Credit: George Eustice discusses cutsByBen GlazeDeputy Political EditorDan BloomOnline Political Editor:,  Sep Updated:,  Sep | commentsA top Cabinet Minister has claimed he is “comfortable” with hitting six million poor Brits with a £-a-week cut - despite the energy price crisis.Environment Secretary George Eustice, who is “a trustee of a family discretionary will trust which owns shares” in a -acre Cornish fruit and veg farm, backed stripping £, a year from households on Universal Credit.Asked by the BBChe felt “comfortable” with going ahead with the welfare cut, he admitted: “You have to look at all of these things in context and yes, the answer is I do. “Because we are seeing prices rise, yes, that is putting some pressure on household incomes. “But more importantly we are also seeing wages rise, particularly for the lowest paid. “It is a very tight labour market at the moment - there are over a million job vacancies at the moment, so those who want to work are finding it easy to find work.”  It comes despite more than million households on Universal Credit facing an energy bills hike of more than £ a year from October  - within weeks of the benefit being cut. Some .million of those households are estimated to be on the most expensive pre-payment meters and could end up paying £ more per year. Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng was due to be grilled by MPs this morning over the soaring gas prices that are set to hammer family budgets at the same time as benefit cut. The Cabinet Minister appears before the Commons Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Select Committee amid mounting fears of blackouts and spiralling costs. Mr Kwarteng has ruled out nationalisation and is prepared to let dozens of smaller firms fail. But he has suggested taxpayer-backed loans could be offered to larger companies which take on customers of suppliers which go bust. Last night ministers handed over tens millions of pounds in taxpayersapos cash to resolve the carbon dioxideshortage that has hit food supplies. Industry figures had warned that shoppers could begin to see empty shelves within days due to a shortage of CO, which is used in the production process for meat and some frozen goods. The crisis was triggered when a major US-owned fertiliser firm - which produces CO as a by-product - halted UK production following a surge in wholesale gas prices. The Government has brokered a deal with CF Industries to restart production. Taxpayers will fund the firm’s operating costs for up to three weeks and the money won’t have to be repaid.  Environment Secretary George Eustice admitted there were still challenges in the food supply chain but insisted that Brits would not face shortages in the run up to the festive period. Despite the deal ending  weeks before Christmas he said today: “Christmas is safe, of course.” Universal Credit’s own architect, Baroness Philippa Stroud, has warned it will hit more than , people who are teetering on the poverty line. Yet Work and Pensions Secretary Therese Coffey previously said she was “entirely happy” with slashing the benefit.Asked earlier this month are you entirely happy with this , Ms Coffey told Sky News: Yes. We made this decision earlier this year, the Chancellor announced it in the Budget.And thataposs why we’re building the update to the plan for jobs to make sure as we see the end of the furlough scheme, the support that’s happened there, as we see the end of the other support schemes... that we accelerate our plan for jobs.Comment MORE ON Conservative PartyCF Industries Inc.Universal Credit\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Professor Chris Whitty told MPs that young people between  and -years-old are currently driving Covid transmission, with infection rates highest in this age group. All children aged  to -years-old are now being offered a single dose of the Pfizer jab after the UKaposs Chief Medical Officers backed the move. The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisationhad stopped short of recommending this on medical grounds alone, effectively handing the decision to the CMOs. At a hearing of the Education Committee, Prof Whitty explained that the UKaposs top medics decided to recommend mass vaccination of jabs for under-s partly to prevent disruption in schools.  Prof Whitty said the comparison was between a child being vaccinated against a near certainty that child will get Covid. He said fewer school days would be lost due to being vaccinated compared to children getting the virus, as pupils with Covid would be off school - and some will have signicant symptoms. Asked about modelling for days lost due to short-term disruption by Tory chairman Robert Halfon, Prof Whitty said: “Our view is firmly that people who have an infection are likely to be off school for longer than people who have a vaccine, on average. “Therefore since virtually any child, unvaccinated, is likely to get an infection at some point between  and , that is the correct comparison, not against nothing. Children currently have the highest transmission rates of any age group, he said. Prof Whitty told MPs: There is definitely substantial transmission happening in this age group. In fact, the age group weaposre talking about is the one in which the highest rate of transmission is currently occurring, as far as we can tell.  But he said that vaccination will reduce that risk. Asked what how many youngsters have already had Covid, Prof Whitty said: It ies by age and it does also y by setting, but I thinkwe go for roughly half I think that is a reasonable stab at this. Thataposs half over the period of the entire epidemic to date, and weaposve got quite a way to run. Weaposre running into winter so thereaposs still quite a lot of damage that could be done in terms of disruption. Deputy chief medical officer Professor Jonathan Van-Tam told MPs that the Delta iant is so infectious it was not a theoretical risk. He said: I think it is really quite inevitable that they will be so at some point. Prof Van-Tam said it would be extremely inconvenient to be laid low with a cough, fever, and respiratory symptoms for pupils sitting GCSEs and A-Levels. Pupils in England began being offered their Covid vaccine in schools this week. The rollout is being managed by the School Age Immunisation Service , which already does inoculations for flu and HPV in schools. Parents are being asked to give consent for their children to be vaccinated. But children can overrule their parentsthey are deemed competent to make the decision through a legal precedent known as a Gillick competence.

Joan Laplana is hoping to beat the Guinness World Record for the fastest man to run a marathon dressed in a pint of beer costume. The dad-of-three took up running after he was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder earlier this year. Since running Joan says he has become fitter, his mood swings and anxiety have improved and he no longer needs medication. But it hasn’t been an easy journey for Joan, who is still haunted by the faces of Covid- patients who died. Joan, , says: “People were dying daily from Covid, I used to think to myself, I could potentially get the virus and die.”  Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here. Joan, who has been a nurse for  years, was working as lead nurse for NHS Digital Transformation, which looks at ways to improve the delivery of care. He volunteered to go back to the frontline for both waves and said it was one of his “most proudest moments”. But his mental health suffered when he lost a patient, who was the same age as him. “One of the hardest shts was probably when I lost a Covid patient, who was the same age as me, with daughters the same age as mine and he had no underlying health conditions”, says Joan. He adds: “On paper he should have survived but he didn’t. Just half an hour before he passed away, his daughters told him they loved him on FaceTime. “I was in pieces, that image stayed with me. I couldn’t even walk into the ward for my next sht the next day, and that is when I knew I needed help.” Joan went back to his job at NHS Digital Transformation in between the first and second wave.  But despite suffering from panic attacks and anxiety, Joan still wanted to continue his work in ICU when the second wave hit the country. Joan, who lives in Chesterfield, says: “It was my choice to go back to the frontline during the second wave, partly out of anger, because I was angry that the Government had reopened the country near Christmas. “But I fell to pieces during the second wave and in March I was diagnosed with PTSD. “I was destroying my marriage, my job and my relationship with those around me.” Joan says he would get into “silly arguments over little things” with his we, his mood would often change very quickly and he hadn’t slept through the night for  months. But a heart-breaking conversation with his we made Joan realise he needed help urgently. He says: “She sat me down and said, ‘I’m afraid of you and I am considering moving out’. “That stuck in my heart, the person I love the most in the world, was afraid of me. She was afraid of my mood swings, it broke my heart, that was the lowest point for me.” Joan then started getting counselling from a psychologist and he was encouraged to write down his thoughts. Joan, who is Spanish, says there is a “macho culture” in his country and it is harder for men to express their feelings. He adds: “The pandemic took a strain on my mental health, the fear and anxiety got worse and I became very lonely. It was a very bleak and dark time. “I wanted to protect my family during the pandemic, so when my we asked how my day was, I didn’t tell her the truth. “In the car before going inside the house, I would pull myself into one piece and put this wall up around me, it was my mistake to handle it like this.” Joan has now started a new job at NHS Education England, as a project choice area manager. Since his new fitness regime, Joan says he isn’t taking medication anymore and has finally started sleeping through the night for the first time in  months.  He says: “In March I joined a running club and it has been building up from there. On days when I can’t motivate myself, my friends from the club will message me at :am. “I knew I had to get serious about my running when I got an email to say I got a place for the London Marathon. I am very proud of myself after everything that I have been through. “Running has improved my mental health, I’ve lost three stone and it has helped with my anxiety, reduced my panic attacks and improved my mood swings.” In July, Joan climbed to the top of Mount Snowden dressed as a pint of beer for charity and he now hopes to beat the Guinness World Record for the fastest man to run a marathon dressed as a pint of beer. He has named his challenge #PintCavell and he hopes to raise £, for the Cavell Trust, who support the welfare of nurses, midwives and healthcare assistants. The week before the marathon on October , Joan will also be running the Sheffield Half Marathon.To make donation towards Joan’s #PintCavell challenge page.

David had to spend a week in intensive care after contracting the disease which affects just around  people a year in the UKBBC presenter David Garmston ended up in intensive care after catching rare disease on holiday Image: BBCByEstel Farell RoigSophie Corcoran:,  Sep | commentsA BBC presenter caught a rare disease while on holiday in Majorca and ended up spending a week in intensive care. Points West presenter David Garmston said that while he had a lovely family holiday on the Spanish island in August, he started to feel unwell when he ed home in August. David had contracted legonnairesapos disease while on holiday. The disease affects just  people in the UK a year and is a severe form of pneumonia, usually caused by infection. BristolLive reports that the broadcaster said at first he thought it was just anxiety caused by all the additional stresses of going abroad during the pandemic, such as forms and covid tests.Apart from feeling very anxious, Mr Garmston said he was also coughing and couldnapost breathe very well so he took a couple of lateral flow tests and they came back negative.  He ended up passing out on the bed, with his family calling an ambulance at this point. Describing finding out he had legionnairesapos disease as a shock, the -year-old said: It turned out that I was incubating this rather nasty disease. The next thing I remember an ambulance arrived, although I can barely remember that, and then I woke up in hospital. I just put it down to being a bit anxious about things, but I was obviously quite ill at that time and didnapost realise it. Mr Garmston said that when he arrived at the Bristol Royal Infirmary he was asked where he had been on holiday and, telling them he had been to Spain, they checked him for legionnairesapos disease. He said the disease is very rare, with only around  people a year contracting it in the UK. The TV presenter said he was put on antibiotics and, as he was still having dficulties breathing, he was moved from a respiratory ward to the intensive care unitas a precaution in case he needed to be ventilated. He spent a week in ICU, he said, and wished to thank all the staff at the hospital. Mr Garmston added: The nurses held my hand for a week - day and night. I just can not thank them enough, they were magnicent and so were all the staff, I was very well looked after. The tea ladies in particular were amazing, they brought me so many cuppas and custard creams and gave us a laugh every day. That is one of my memories, I just looked forward to seeing them. I was just really humbled by the care I got. I owe them my le and I shall be forever grateful.  Mr Garmston - who has been at Points West since  and has been a regular presenter for many years - said he didnapost need to be ventilated in the end, but that he was on oxygen during the two weeks he spent in hospital. The TV presenter added he doesnapost think his le was ever in danger but that it was frightening, particularly for his family. Mr Garmston said it was a nasty scare and warned people travelling abroad to be careful with air conditioning as that is where he thinks it may have come from, even though PHE were not able to find the source. He is still feeling a bit tired, he continued, but is now feeling pretty much back to normal and is hoping to go back to work soon.  Mr Garmston, who lives in central Bristol, said: The viewers have been amazing, they have written in asking where I am. I didnapost think anyone would notice I was off, but they have and I am incredibly grateful. It is a real boost that they have noticed and that they have cared. He added: Everyone in the Points West family has been great as well, they have been really nice - more than I deserve. When they said people were writing in, I didnapost believe them. I thought they were just saying it to make me feel better, but it is a wonderful feeling actually that people had missed me. I feel very close to viewers, I feel they are part of the family really so I am really grateful.

The snake was bleeding from its jaw and seen coughing up blood opposite a layby on the B near Roden on Friday. RSPCA were called to attend the scene after the constrictor was discovered with a broken jaw by two motorists. Officers were able to safely contain the reptile in a large duvet cover using a specialist pole with a hook. The snake was taken to a vets and given pain relief but died later that night. The body of another long-deceased snake of a similar size was then found nearby, prompting fears that the road is being used as a place to dump unwanted exotic pets. Following an investigation, the local RSPCA said it believed both reptiles were deliberately abandoned in the area.  A spokesperson for the organisation said: “Normally when we get a call like this we find the snake has been misidentied and itaposs actually a small native species, so we were very surprised when we arrived and saw a six-foot boa constrictor on the road. ”Itaposs very sad that this beautul creatureaposs le ended like this. Sadly we think this snake was probably abandoned as itaposs a very isolated location and there are no houses around for at least a mile. The discovery of the body of another snake close by also leads us to believe that someone has deliberately left them.” Locals have described the findings as the “stuff of nightmares” and expressed fears for the safety of the neighbourhood and their children and pets. One person wrote on social media: Is it just me or is this freaking anybody  out  I donapost want live ft snakes slithering around the village.” Another added: This is literally the stuff of my nightmares. My skin is crawling just thinking about it.” A third person added: “You’ve got to think about these poor reptiles too, they won’t last long in our weather without the proper care.”In response, someone wrote: “Exactly, they will be hungry. And that’s why I don’t want to let my pet out. These animals can be brutal killers and would target something small.” Although non-venomous, boa constrictors are said to “eat almost anything” they can catch in the wild and their jaws can stretch wide enough to swallow large prey whole.  The RSPCA inspector said these sorts of incidents were “not unusual”, adding: “We receive hundreds of calls every year relating to reptiles, and some of these have either escaped or may have been abandoned by their owners. “Sadly snakes and lizards often end up in our care as some owners don’t realise the commitment that is involved in meeting their needs.

Liz King from Abergavenny, south Wales, stepped forward to trial the Novavax vaccine last year saying she felt guilty as a retired nurse about not being there to help her colleagues during the first wave of the pandemicLiz was originally told thatany other approved vaccines came on the market she would be able to drop out of the study to take it up, reports Wales Online. She said: “I’m a retired nurse and felt incredibly guilty in the Spring of  that I wasn’t able to help my ex colleagues during the first wave of Covid-. So when I had the chance to volunteer for a vaccine trial I went for it.” “This was November before any vaccines were approved,” she said. “The saidan approved vaccine came on the market we could drop out of a trial, that was in the consent form but I also asked it verbally at my first appointment. “It was a blind trial and % of the participants had Novavax and % had saline [a placebo]. I thought I had had saline because I had no side effects at all, not even a sore arm. I had the first one in November and the second at the beginning of December.”  There Liz was asked to sign an updated consent for which was  pages long. She scanned through it and signed. Upon closer reading she realised that there was a small but signicant change. She said: “It said we would be discouraged from having an approved vaccine because using it with Pfizer or AstraZeneca hadn’t yet been tested. I wasnapost worried about it because we were being assured that because the vaccine had done well in phase one and phase two trials and that approval was imminent - in a couple of months at least. I was offered both Pfizer in January and AstraZeneca in April but I was happy to stay on the trial because I had been told by this point I knew I had had the vaccine not the placebo and it appeared it would be approved.” Fast forward to now and it seems likely thatthe Novavax vaccine is approved it won’t be until . Liz has tried to get another vaccine such as Pfizer but is now not allowed.  “I had been emailing the health board for a month trying to get a response and they never came back to me,” she said. “Then I rang and I was told they would call me back and they never called me back. So on Saturday I went to the walk-in centre in Newport and after waiting an hour while they had several discussions they eventually said no because I had been given the trial vaccine - when they said no I just burst into tears.” Liz is able to get a Covid pass because the NHS app acknowledges that she has had a vaccine. But because the vaccine is not approved she is facing the following problems: She cannot travel abroad anywhere which requires a vaccine. She has no ideathe vaccine she took actually offers her full protection because the final results are not out. Evenshe is protected she doesn’t knowthis immunity will wane. She is unable to get any booster jabs. “I am trapped,” she said. “It really is like something from Kafka. It is exactly what it is like. Itaposs not just me. There were , of us all across the UK but now some of them have jumped ship. I think some of them lied to get a dferent vaccine. Good on them, I wish I had. I donapost know how many of us are left but there must be thousands of us in this situation.” One of the frustrating things about this is that Liz took a risk to help develop the vaccines, but now is being affected to her detriment for doing so. She even volunteered at a vaccination centre this year. “Iaposve administered lots of other peopleaposs vaccines,” she said. “At the end of clinics sometimes we would have three or four doses left and we would be scrambling around to try and use up the remaining doses. I never once asked for one because I was committed to the trial I was doing.  “Now we are just stuck in this limbo. Last year they were all happy for us to take a jab and happy for us to do it. But now the nanny state is making decisions for me about whether or not Iaposm allowed a booster. “Iaposm not speaking out for me, Iaposm doing it for all of us who were on that trial. I want to have to approve vaccines and I want to be in the same position as the rest of the population. “I donapost want thanks butpeople like me hadn’t volunteered we wouldnapost have vaccines. At the very least I shouldnapost be inconvenienced after having volunteered. “I feel abandoned and so let down by the system. It is grossly unfair that people who volunteered to trial an experimental vaccine are at a disadvantage and have less rights and liberties than the general population. I will never volunteer again and will advise others not to.” Liz is very keen to point out that she has no problem with the Novavax vaccine itself and doesn’t want to do anything to suggest it isn’t effective. “I absolutely donapost want to cast any doubt on the Novavax vaccine,” she said. “The science will tell us how good it is or not and I donapost want to give any ammunition to anti-vaxxers. Iaposm not criticizing the vaccine in anyway - itaposs kept me safe for -  months.” A Health and Care Research Wales spokeswoman said: We really appreciate the hard work and involvement of all participants in Covid- vaccine clinical trials. Anyone participating in the Novavax trial should have had two active doses of vaccine and have protection against Covid-. We are aware of the issue affecting some participants having additional vaccinations and are awaiting the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisationto advise further on this.” Comment MORE ON Newport CorporationAstraZeneca plcPfizer Inc.NHSNovavax Inc.Apps\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

A lack of lorry drivers and Covid restrictions mean that the usual deliveries of the festive trees could be affected said Chris Bonnett, the founder of Gardening Express. He’s also expecting a surge in demand after last yearaposs muted celebrations, as families and friends celebrate the festivities together. Lorry driver shortages in Denmark are expected to impact imports to the UK with any Covid related restrictions further adding to the problems. Denmark is a major producer of live Christmas trees with around % of its crop exported to other European nations. Last year it faced problems after it halted exports in an attempt to control a Coronavirus mutation found on mink farms.Now the shortage of drivers in Denmark could affect the distribution of Christmas trees across Europe. With fewer than  days until Christmas, Bonnett is already seeing a jump in the number of customers searching for Christmas trees on his site despite the festive range not yet fully live. He’s urging customers to order early to ensure they’re able to secure a tree ahead of the big day. It comes as the public have also been warned to prepare for a shortage of turkeys due to a lack of available CO, while there could also be empty shelves in supermarkets due to other delivery problems. Chris said: “The last few years have played havoc with the Christmas tree market. Mild winters in Scandinavian countries have made it more complicated to fell trees. Add in the Covid restrictions in place last year and the current shortage of lorry drivers and you can see why we’re concerned that there could be a shortage of trees. “A Christmas tree is an essential part of the festivities, not just on Christmas Day but in the run up - picking the tree, squeezing it into the car and decorating ahead of the celebrations. “This year it’ll mean even more after the locked down restrictions of last year which is why we’re already seeing a surge in the number of customers searching for Christmas trees. “Hopefully between now and December, things will improve.” Bonnett added: “We are seeing issues with disruption across the retail sector, from food and drink to gts and clothing. “For Britons really wanting to go all out to celebrate this year, the best advice is to plan ahead and get all the essentials pre-ordered so you can enjoy the festivities without the stress.”Comment MORE ON ChristmasChristmas treesCoronavirus\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Join the Secret Elves for celebration inspiration - and brilliant gt ideas and reviewsSpread the cheer!Invalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Dame Sarahaposs comments were echoed by Professor David Matthews, Professor of Virology at Bristolaposs School of Cellular and Molecular Medicine. He told the Mirror: Babies born today will probably catch it, bat it away, and by the time theyaposre   -years-old theyaposll have fought the virus and won dozens of times.  This virus is probably not a killer in that it doesnapost kill babies, where as things like flu do. It will settle down to just a common cold. Despite the worldaposs reliance on the Covid vaccines to manage the pandemic, including the Oxford jab, Dame Sarah went on to tell the crowd that she is struggling to get funding to help prevent future pandemics. She said urgent investment was needed to prevent other infectious diseases spreading around the world.Weaposre still trying to raise funds to develop other vaccines that we were working on before the pandemic, against diseases that have caused outbreaks in the past and will cause outbreaks in the future, the scientist added, the Daily Mail reported. We are being financially supported for our ongoing work against Covid... but when we try toto projects we were working on before coronavirus weaposre still trying to get funding. As Dame Sarah looked to the virusapos longer term future, on Wednesday Englandaposs chief medical officer warned of the risk to children from coronavirus over the coming months, particularly those who are not vaccinated. Professor Chris Whitty said that about half of children have already had Covid- and the rest are more likely to get it without a vaccine.  He warned that quite a lot of damage could still occur over the winter months. Speaking as the jab was rolled out to  to -year-olds, he told MPs: Letaposs make an assumption that the great majority of children whoaposve not currently had Covid- are going to get it at some point over the next period. It wonapost be necessarily in the next two or three months but they will get it sooner or later. But addressing the Commons education committee, Prof Whitty added: Vaccination will reduce that risk. Englandaposs chief medical officer was facing questions from MPs about the inclusion of children in the Governmentaposs Covid- vaccination programme. When asked what proportion of children had already had Covid-, he replied: It ies by age and it does also y by setting, but I thinkwe go for roughly half I think that is a reasonable stab at this.  Thataposs half over the period of the entire epidemic to date, and weaposve got quite a way to run. Weaposre running into winter so thereaposs still quite a lot of damage that could be done in terms of disruption. Englandaposs deputy chief medical officer Professor Jonathan Van-Tam added that because the Delta iant is so infectious we are not looking at a theoretical risk of children aged  to  becoming infected. He said: I think it is really quite inevitable that they will be so at some point. Prof Van-Tam warned that these pupils could become infected during their GCSEs and A-levels when it is extremely inconvenient to be laid low with a cough, fever, and respiratory symptoms. Addressing MPs, Prof Whitty added: There is definitely substantial transmission happening in this age group. In fact, the age group weaposre talking about is the one in which the highest rate of transmission is currently occurring as far as we can tell.  Asked about modelling for school days lost due to short-term disruption as a result of the vaccine rollout, Prof Whitty said: You are not comparing a child being vaccinated against nothing happening. You are comparing a child being vaccinated against a near certainty that child will get Covid-. He added: Our view is firmly that people who have an infection are likely to be off school for longer than people who have a vaccination on average. Therefore since virtually any child, unvaccinated, is likely to get an infection at some point between  and , that is the correct comparison, not against nothing. His comments came in the week that the Covid- jab is being rolled out to three million eligible youngsters aged between  and  across the UK. It is expected to be delivered primarily within schools, and guidance has been issued to headteachers to contact policethey believe protests could be held outside their buildings. Prof Whitty added that the views of families should be respected and children who refuse to get the vaccine should not be stigmatised. Prof Van-Tam said he had never once heard of children being discriminated against because they had chosen not to have an influenza vaccine in school. He said: I believe Iaposm extremely reassured personally by the extreme competence of the system to have avoided that for at least a decade in terms of influenza immunisation. Consent letters are being sent out to parents with information on the Covid- vaccination. But parental consent will not be neededthe child is considered competent to make a decision by themselves. Prof Whitty told MPs: In general terms, the younger the child the more the absolute assumption would be thatthere is a disagreement actually the parents will be the right people to actually turn to for this But the two ends of the spectrum in a sense are once you get to  thereaposs a general assumption, and once you get to  thereaposs an absolute assumption, that the person themselves will make a decision. He added: There is a bit of a sliding scale but in practice itaposs actually very, very rare that, particularly at the lower age ranges, that this is relevant at all because almost certainly there will be agreement either way and weaposre not trying to push this agreement between parents and children.

The black cat was left to die in a plastic box in a park in Derby on Sunday September .According to Derbyshire Live, he was found soaked in his own urine and barely able to breath.The feline was skinny, had diarrhoea, infested with fleas and all its teeth had fallen out or were rotten. A passer-by alerted the RSPCA who took the elderly cat to a nearby vets straight away, but sadly they were unable to do anything and he had to be put down. Now the RSPCA is appealing to try and find the person who dumped the cat when it was at its most vulnerable. Pamela Bird, the animal rescuer who was sent to the scene, said: This poor elderly cat was in a neglected state, it’s heartbreaking that he was dumped at the side of the road when he deserved to have been surrounded by love and affection at the end of his le. I am keen to find out more about what happened and am hoping someone may have seen something suspicious or who may recognise the cat and can identy his owner. The cat carrier was broken at the front opening and he was lying on a copy of the Derbydated July , . I want to remind people that there are many charities that are willing to help people who have fallen on hard times and can’t look after their animals anymore and vets often offer payment plans to spread the costs of treatment. I would always urge people to call for help rather than abandoning an animal in this way. An owner has a responsibility to keep their animals safe from harm and pets deserve better.” Anyone with information should contact the RSPCA appeals line on    Comment MORE ON RSPCACatsAnimals\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Charlie Gentaposs little girl Connie Gent was one of four people found dead at a house on Chandos Crescent on Sunday morning. Thirty-five-year-old Terri Harris, her -year-old daughter Lacey Bennett and -year-old son John Paul Bennett all died, as well as Lacey’s friend Connie, also . Their bodies were found by officers who were responding to a call which came in at .am on Sunday. Damien Bendall, , has since been charged with the murders. He will appear at Southern Derbyshire Magistrates’ Court later today. Chris Gent described his niece Connie as the “happiest girl in the world” after the horrying tragedy.Chris, who is the older brother of Connie’s dad Charlie Gent, told The Sun: “Our entire family is destroyed.No parent or anyone should ever have to go through such a horric ordeal. “Charlie is totally broken. He is devastated. He can’t believe he will never see his daughter again.” Police were seen scouring bins and a nearby park on Monday as they tried to piece together the killing. Terri, John and Lacey are said to have not lived in Killamarsh for long, having moved from Sheffield. Neighbours said they had only lived there for a few months. More tributes were left at the scene on Tuesday as mourners continued to pay their respects.  Detective Chief Inspector Sally Blaiklock who is leading the investigation said previously: “Our thoughts remain with the families of Terri, John Paul, Lacey and Connie – as well as the communities that have been affected by this most tragic of incidents. “A large scene remains in place on Chandos Crescent and local residents will see an increased police presence in the area over the coming days, including patrols by officers in the local area. “I would urge anyone who is concerned about the incident to speak to officers in the area or use the online reporting tool to pass information in confidence. “Myself and the team of the detectives are particularly keen to hear from anyone who was in Chandos Crescent between pm on Saturday  September and am on Sunday  September, as well as anyone who may have video footage of the street. “That can include dashcam, mobile phone footage, CCTV or video doorbells.”Most ReadFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON Derbyshire PoliceMurder\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The couple sat down for a tell-all chat with the talk show host in March and made several claims against the royal family. They alleged that there had been conversations about how dark son Archieaposs skin would be, and Meghan claimed she was denied help for her mental health despite having suicidal thoughts. The interview was nominated for a prestigious Emmy award in the Outstanding Hosted Nonfiction Series or Special category, but it was pipped to the post by the documentary Stanley Tucci: Searching for Italy. Speaking to the Daily Star, royal expert and film critic Richard Fitzwilliams said he had originally thought it had a very good chance” of winning after it was screened in  countries and had Oprah fronting it.But he added: They were given too easy a le - there wasn’t a single point that Oprah pushed them on.

Following the airing of the chat earlier in the year, Buckingham Palace issued a statement saying the Queen was saddened by the allegations made by Harry and Meghan, but added that some recollections may y. However, in Finding Freedom, an unauthorised biography of the couple, friends of Harry and Meghan claim the Queen has not taken full ownership of the issues they raised during the Oprah interview.The authors of the updated book also say the statement did not go unnoticed.Meanwhile, Harry is set to appear on TV tonight in a BBC documentary that pays tribute to his late grandfather Prince Philip.The special programme, which also features the Duke of Cambridge, Prince Andrew and Prince Charles, was originally arranged to mark the Dukeaposs th birthday in June, but he sadly died two months before his centenary. Interviews with the royals were recorded both before and after Philipaposs death, with Harryaposs tributes filmed in Calornia where he now lives after quitting the UK. In one clip, Harry talks about his grandfather and grandmotheraposs relationship, calling them the most adorable couple. He says: The two of them together were just the most adorable couple. To me knowing the cheekiness of him and knowing that behind what the world sees you have two iniduals who were very much in love and both, from a very young age, have dedicated their le to service... that is an incredible bond between two people.

We had to de-clutter and get rid of a lot of things, but that process has been going on for a while now. With regards to toys, we have had a one in, one out system for some time, so for every new toy that comes in they donate an old one to charity.  Due to lockdowns people assume homeschooling means not mixing with other children but in my experience, it is actually more sociable than mainstream school. We have a really busy schedule, staying in campsites run by other home educators and doing activities and things with other children and families all the time.  It definitely gives the kids a deeper connection with themselves and also with nature and the community too. They arenapost learning about history from a text book, instead we go to visit the castle itself and learn that way. Cooking has become much more basic, itaposs all one pot meals really but we also have an outdoor fire pit which is useful. Of course, we miss our friends and family back home but they do come to visit.

I’ve lost count of the times he’s told me that school’s “boooorring” and he wants to go to video game school which would be way more fun. If I’m honest, it’s an ­ambition I’d half hoped he’d grow out of, but after attending a tech event this week, I realise he’s more clued up about the future of work than I am.London Tech Week brings together some of the biggest players in the digital field to discuss the state of the industry. The question that kept coming up again and again was what is the UK going to do about its chronic digital skills shortage Do you agree  Have your say in the comment section  The industry agrees immediate and drastic attention is needed. And a recent report by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport revealed there are almost , UK jobs currently vacant that require data skills. There was also an unanimous plea for the education system to put technology at the heart of the curriculum. From where I’m sitting, that certainly doesn’t appear to be happening. My eldest son took and then quickly dropped out of GCSE computing while courses to teach my video game enthusiast to code or to get into tech are ludicrously expensive. If the pandemic taught us anything, it’s that the future will be all about the tech sector, and at the moment, we are woefully under preparing our children for what lies ahead. Tech has its own PR problem. Too many young people think tech is only for kids that are good at maths and science. The technologists I met on Monday assured me that is far from the truth. There are jobs for people with so many dferent skill sets and the sooner young people are introduced to the sector the easier it will be for them to land one. The UK is by no means the only country facing challenges in this area, but it’s lagging behind countries like the US, Singapore, Sweden and Denmark. Coincidentally Sebastian Siemiatkowski, the Swedish founder of tech firm Klarna, revealed he got his first computer from a government scheme. Before he was dumped as education secretary, Gavin Williamson decided one of his key ­objectives to help make society more equal for state school children was to learn Latin. He even sank £million into a pilot scheme for  UK schools. Doesn’t this show just how out of touch our education system is on this  There was certainly consensus from industry movers and shakers that schools and teachers must adapt to the needs of the tech industry. If not, the repercussions for future generations don’t bear thinking about.

At the consultation, Mrs Wright said the GP, whom they had not seen before, referred Annabel to a dermatologist at Harrogate District Hospital, something the family had not asked for. The mum said they had not expected it as the teenaposs skin looked to be getting better, but they were pleased to be potentially coming off antibiotics. A letter from the GP - read out in the inquest - stated Annabelaposs skin was not improving, something her mum did not agree with but she took her for the hospital appointment on October   regardless. The consultant said she wanted the teenager on Roaccutane before she got any scarring, explained Mrs Wright. She was only  and it panicked her, she said. The family were given a leaflet which Annabel ticked boxes on and her mother signed. There was a warning that a number of side effects may occur but there are extremely rare. Mrs Wright said: There is nothing in there about suicide. Annabel was not depressed. I was told only children depressed about their skin might take their own lives.  When you sit opposite an expert in their field and they say aposYes, but it could be argued that these children were depressed about their acne - it sways you. I was not aware that sudden suicidal impulses could overcome a perfectly normal person. At the end of January , Mrs Wright noticed scratches on her daughteraposs wrists and she admitted she had begun self-harming. She said she just felt low. She could not explain why, her mum added. Mr Wright, , told the court he gave her a stern talking to about the risks of self-harming, followed by some love and affection. There were no other signs anything was wrong, the court heard. Mrs Wright agreed with the hospital reports that Annabelaposs treatment was progressing well and she hardly had any spots at all except while on monthly cycle. It was discussed that Annabel could switch to hyfication, a surgical procedure for removing lesions, but this never happened and her mother never asked why. On May , , at the final consultation before her death the same day, Annabel was told the treatment had been so successful her dosage would be reduced the next day. She was concerned this might cause the acne to , but she was reassured by her mum. The same evening, Annabel had a normal meal with her family before going up to her room to revise for a Spanish test. Her mother, grandmother, and  year old brother then went off to a young farmeraposs do. They asked Annabelshe wanted to come but she declined. Mr Wright came home later that evening and chatted to his daughter before she went to her room. He said: I would have noticedshe was crying or upset. It was just a nothing. When the rest of the family came home, Annabelaposs grandmother went upstairs to check on her and immediately called for Mr Wright. He said: I knew something was wrong. I ran upstairs. She was hanging there. I tried my best to resuscitate her. My son who was  at the time helped me. Askedthey believed there was a link between the acne medication and the daughteraposs death, both parents were convinced there was. Mrs Wright said: Absolutely. Normal, happy people do not just commit suicide without any sign or lead up to it. I have also been in touch with several other families who have lost children to this drug. There were no other injuries and toxicology tests for drugs and alcohol proved negative, the corners court in Northallerton, North Yorkshire, was told.

A home on the remote Isle of Eigg,  miles off the coast of Scotland, is a single room building needing a new occupant who is willing to fully immerse themselves in island le, alongside the  other residents. The converted shepherdaposs building, named Sandamhor Bothy, will need a lot of TLC and some extensive renovations, but is currently on the market for £, and comes with some land to boot. The island is owned by the Isle of Eigg Heritage Trust who have managed it since a community buyout in . Ownership of Eigg was transferred to the islanders in a deal that saw £.m in funds raised.  The Trust has responsibility for stewardship of the island, its buildings and natural heritage, and for supporting future development. Prospective buyers have now been offered viewings of the bothy and a chance to live on Eigg on a full time basis. A sales brochure says: The plot enjoys easterly views across the seascape towards the Scottish mainland. Access is via a shared unsurfaced and rough access track. The building is stone built and contains a single room ided by a low wall. Water is supplied to an inside sink and outside toilet. There is currently a cast iron wood-burning stove installed in the property. The plot is subject to rules stopping it being used as a holiday or second home. Applications to buy the bothy will be closed on November . About five miles long by three miles wide, Eigg lies  miles off the Scottish west coast, south of the Isle of Skye. The island has a fascinating history, superb wildle and a vibrant community. The main industries on Eigg are tourism, agriculture, public services, construction and the creative industries. More than  years ago, every resident of Eigg, barring one elderly woman, was killed during a clan feud. Islanders, who were members of the Macdonald clan, were murdered by a raiding party of Macleods from Skye. The islanders had been hiding in a cave for three days when they were discovered. Macleods blocked the narrow entrance to their hideout with heather and other vegetation before setting the material alight. The Macdonalds were suffocated by smoke and their bodies left in the cave. It is believed that the massacre happened in or around the year .

As we continue to recover from the coronavirus pandemic, the NHS insist it is important for people to remain vigilant in the face of the disease and the booster is an important way of fighting it. Similar to the flu booster, the jab will help make immunity to catching or suffering the effects of Covid- far less likely. The NHS say currently that around four in five adults in England have received both doses of the vaccine, with  million doses administered overall since Maggie Keenan received the first dose outside a clinical trial in December .

Border Collie Dave never puts a foot wrong and can even navigate around puddles despite his blindness - leaving vets completely baffled by his condition. Owner Jane Downes, , said that Dave always comes when called and will happily play with other dogs despite his retinas being completely undeveloped - making him even more remarkable. A top UK vet has declared Dave a medical mystery after confirming that the pooch - believed to be between five to seven years old - is fully blind. Jane, who owned Dave for almost a year before making the discovery, said: No oneaposs got any answers. Itaposs just a conundrum. Itaposs just really strange. Heaposs a blind dog that can see. Maybe itaposs a sixth sense, who knows  He had everyone fooled - even me as his owner I was fooled for nine months. Jane bought Dave from an animal rescue centre in February , when no issues were raised regarding his sight - even after a check-up at the local vet. Jane, from Waterbeach, Cambs, added: He jumped into the back of the car and I brought him home. A couple of people said he had funny eyes but I just thought heaposs got beautul eyes. On a couple of occasions he walked into things but I put that down to him being a sheepdog who more than likely lived in a barn rather than a house. He wouldnapost put a foot wrong. He would come back when you called him.  But in December, Dave stumbled over a step at a pet shop in Cambridge, where the owner suggested to Jane that her dog might be blind. She took Dave to a specialist vet, where they finally discovered that he was totally blind and his retinas had never developed, meaning he was sightless from birth. After the revelation, Jane called on the help of Cambridge Universityaposs David Williams, a top veterinary ophthalmologist, who organised two obstacle course challenges for Dave and a retina test, which confirmed the diagnosis. He told a local newspaper: I see a lot of blind dogs and they all bump into objects in a way that Dave didnapost - so at present he is a medical mystery! Just because Iaposve been doing this for  years, it doesnapost mean Iaposve seen everything, and this I canapost explain.  In le you like to think you know everything, but thataposs not always the case. Dave now enjoys running around at home with his new brother Sammy, a two-year-old Border Collie, who joined the family in October last year. Jane, who lives with husband Mick, , said that Dave lives a happy and full le. She explained: He goes straight to his food. He chases other dogs around even though he canapost see them. He can jump into the boot of my car. He walks around puddles. On the very rare occasion, he walks into something he just shrugs it off and carries on. Daveaposs only limit is his fear of going into the sea - but Dave doesnapost knowthis is due to his blindness or a possible traumatic experience as a puppy.

Image: Triangle NewsByLottie Tiplady-BishopKate Buck:,  Sep Updated:,  Sep Unsettling pictures of a perfectly preserved -year-old house have been shared, sparking questions as to who left it behind. The home lies in the picturesque setting of Tallington, Lincolnshire, but was abandoned over  years ago - leaving nature to slowly reclaim the building. Ivy now grows up the walls and covers almost the entire property, blanketing what was left inside in a shroud of mystery. The super-tidy house is rumoured to have once been home to a little girl known only as Lucy, and clues to her name have been left all over place. However there are no clues as to why the home has been left empty for so long. It still has beds neatly made up, lights left on and lonely looking toys in its nursery. Previous urban explorers who have visited the home have reported the electric toothbrushes still having charge. One visitor, who wished to remain anonymous, explained: Lucyaposs house is sort of an urban legend, hardly anyone has ever gotten inside as itaposs hidden and watched by angry neighbours. Itaposs rumoured that it was once a happy family home to Lucy and her parents until her mother vanished one night and never came home. Lucy remained in the house with her dad until they too just left one day and never came back. There are still clothes hanging up in the wardrobe and toothbrushes in the bathroom. Parts are starting to decay and fall down but itaposs a real mystery. What happened to Lucy  Itaposs bizarre stuff. The haunting snaps show rows of shirts neatly hung up in the wardrobe and an articial plant neatly positioned in the once spotless conservatory - which is now water-stained and rotting. In what may once have been Lucyaposs bedroom, twin beds are neatly made up with cute pink sheets and a framed picture of teddies and toys adorn the polka-dot walls. In the corner, a forlorn-looking teddy bear stares longingly out of the window, perching on a rocking chair that hasnapost moved in a decade. In the family bathroom, toothbrushes, a razor and deodorant can be seen left somewhat haphazardly around the sink, which is still sparkling clean, save for a thin layer of dust. An ancient computer sits in the messy study, and in another bedroom a row of sad-looking teddies sit, alone, in an empty cot. A trendy black ball gown hangs on the back of one of the bedroom doors, never to be worn again. Family photos adorn the mantlepiece of the property, alongside a wooden ornament fashioned into the word aposLucyapos. The outside of the home has been overgrown with trees and shrubbery, with nature forcing its way through some of the homeaposs windows where ivy can be seen creeping across sills and down walls.Most ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON ViralHome Tour\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

An urban explorer, known as Urbex Muse, revealed her findings after wandering the home which she has dubbed “grandma’s house”.Items appear to be perfectly preserved despite being left to collect dust for decades, with books still left on the shelves and an old TV in seemingly perfect condition, according to the Daily Star. On the coffee table, there appears to be a tray with cutlery and a plate left out assomeone had just finished their dinner before the house was abandoned.A suitcase containing black and white photos of what appears to be weddings and servicemen from around World War One were also shown on Urbex Muse’s Instagram page. One photo appears to be of a triple wedding while another shows a handsome headshot of a man in a soldier’s unorm. The man in the unorm can also be seen in other pictures with a young woman, leading viewers to speculate he was the husband of the previous owner of the house. There also appears to be packets of unprocessed camera film left inside the suitcase.  This home was once bursting at the seams with memories of the old couple that resided here, Urbex Muse wrote in a caption alongside the images of the home. These reminders lingered in every corner, from the nicknacks they collected to the priceless antiques left behind. We even stumbled across grandmas original zucchini bread recipe, which I ended up making and can confirm is amazing.”  Social media users described the atmosphere of the home as “peaceful” and “heart-breaking”. One person commented: “The vibes in these abandoned granny houses is always so peaceful, you can feel the love and good memories tinged with the sadness that the family has left it all behind for whatever reason.” Another added: It kind of broke my heart to see everything left like that. Frozen in time. Like what happened  One event led up to them just leaving their home like that. Defiantly very cool. Thank you for respecting their home.”  A third said: It breaks my heart to think of the history and people that lived in these houses, home is something, like so intimate and full of personality, and then when the person is gone it turns into nothing, just a bunch of pieces in time and space.” Others askedthe explorer could try and find out what happened to the owners of the property. One person wrote: “Are you allowed to take things from abandoned places. like all those pics to find the right owner of them ” Another added: This is so sad, I have tons of pictures from my family even though I never met any of them, but we try to keep the stories that go to each picture so that it be passed down.

The celebrity judge was hearing a case which saw Layla bring her friend, Louise, to court to claim money owed for a chihuahua she sold to her. Louise had agreed to pay £, for Rolo the chihuahua, but failed to do so, resulting in a breakdown in the friendship. They appeared in Judge Rinderaposs courtroom on the show on Monday, where the case was outlined. The puppy had been a gt to Layla from her boyfriend, James, but after realising the amount of time and attention the pup needed, alongside caring for a newborn, she decided to rehome him.  The -year-old said: “People who don’t have dogs might not really understand it, but when you’ve emotionally bonded with an animal and you decide that it’s not working, to let them go, what’s that like ” Layla described it like giving up a child and was determined to find him a home he deserved, selling him to friend Louise for £,. Judge Rinder was introduced to Rolo and gave him a cuddle, saying: “I can see why you fell in love. He’s charming, he doesn’t answer back, he’s always affectionate and I suspect he’s more rational than most partners.” He went on to askhis French bulldog Rocco could offer his opinion on the chihuahua, and had a member of the team bring his pet from his chambers into the courtroom.

As Judge Rinder bent down to pull Rocco onto his lap, he exclaimed: “Oh dear, he’s just farted terribly.” The comment sent the audience into a fit of giggles as he added: “It’s where I get it from, I can smell a liar like a fart in a kennel.” He went on to explain that he oversees numerous court cases which include dogs, which are classed as property in law. He said: “The idea that anyone who owns a pet and is a good pet owner feels about their dog as property is a very stupid thing.” Meanwhile, Rocco let out a yawn to which his owner asked: “Am I boring you ” The Frenchie sat on the judges lap waiting patiently for a verdict, wearing his own court bib.  Louise was ordered to pay Layla the £, for Rolo the chihuahua and said: “£,, which is cheap for the price of friendship, isn’t that right ” Rocco let out a small grunt much to the courtaposs amusement as Judge Rinder and Rocco made their way back to chambers. But it wasn’t the first time that Rocco has showed up his dog dad on set. In fact, on spin-off show Judge Rinder’s Kids Courtroom, Rocco even pooped in the judges lap.As he listened to a pair of brothers argue over a bad snoring habit, the judge fell silent before erupting into laughter at- the fact Rocco, who had an upset stomach, had done a poo on his lap.Comment MORE ON TeamDogsAnimals\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Calling all dog lovers!to TeamDogs for your weekly dose of dog news, pictures and stories.Invalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Thirushika Sathialingam, known as Thiru to her friends, was found dead on Margate seafront in the early hours of Saturday September . She is understood to have gone swimming with colleagues, who sounded the alarm after noticing she was missing when they ed to their accommodation. A major search was launched at am involving leboat crews, police, firefighters and a coastguard rescue helicopter, and her body was discovered by RNLI volunteers a few hours later. Thiru, , had been working at the Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother Hospitalalongside her brother, Kaushaliyan, who is also a junior doctor. Kaushaliyan said: I donapost think many siblings were as close as we were. We did almost everything together.  She was a fantastic doctor. I donapost think she realised how good she was, but it came naturally to her. She was able to think outside the box to get things done for her patients, and she loved that medicine was such a complex subject. She was interested in anaesthetics because she enjoyed the scientic approach to it. She wanted to be able to do procedures that would make a real dference to people. Thiru was aspiring to follow in her father’s footsteps and become a consultant anaesthetist at the hospital.  Her father Sathialingam, who retired from the hospital in July, said she was “passionate” about her work and “always had time to listen to people”. He said: “During the second wave of Covid she was on a respiratory ward with people who had the virus and she would sit and talk to them, holding their hands to give them comfort.” She was also a talented dancer, performing classical Indian routines at charity events and teaching others. She loved travelling and would meticulously plan trips around the world and the UK. Her boyfriend, Peter Speilbichler, who she had met while studying medicine at Riga Stradins University in Latvia, said: I have had calls from my friendsapos parents who only met her once or twice, saying how amazing she was and how she lit up the room and made everyone welcome. If there was someone who was not part of a group, she would make sure she spoke to them and that they were included and felt comfortable. She could get on with everyone and she was always kind and smiling. I never heard anything malicious come out of her mouth, evenshe was angry. The time we spent together was amazing and I loved everything about her. East Kent Hospitalsapos chief executive Susan Acott said her death as a huge loss to the Trust, adding that she was a “real shining star” who was known for her “caring nature” and passion for her patients. She continued: “It is clear she would have had a bright future ahead of her and I have no doubt she had the potential to achieve anything she set her heart on.” Comment MORE ON IlfordQueen Elizabeth The Queen MotherHospitalsRoyal FamilyMental health\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Louise Carter, , from Gilberdyke, East Yorkshire, says she begged doctors to test her for sepsis after self-diagnosing her symptoms on Google.The mum-of-three had been experiencing back pain, which she dismissed as discomfort from sitting on the sofa to type during lockdown. But, in August last year she was rushed to Scunthorpe General Hospital when she could no longer handle the searing pain. She was unable to urinate and soon started vomiting, hallucinating, and running a high fever. After several days without answers, the social worker Googled her symptoms and became convinced she had sepsis. The le-threatening ailment is caused by the immune system damaging body tissue while trying to react to an infection. Despite crying and begging doctors to test her for blood poisoning, she claims they refused and denied any possibility of her having the illness. Fearing she survived a close call with death, Louise has spoken out to alert others to sepsis symptoms, and to urge people to follow their gutthey think they have it. She said: I had really bad back pain and thought it was because of working from home during the pandemic and sitting on the sofa typing all day. I could barely move because of the pain and couldnapost go to the toilet either so I rang my doctor and he told me to ring an ambulance. They took me to AE in Scunthorpe Hospital. I was really poorly and out of it. After a couple of days of being in hospital I started projectile vomiting, having hallucinations and was shivering but sweating at the same time. I told the doctor I think itaposs sepsis and she said itaposs not, she said my blood pressure was normal but I asked her to check my stats again.I was furious and crying because I knew something was wrong. I had to push for them to test me for sepsis and keep telling them that I had all the symptoms. They did more bloods and the next morning two doctors came to see me and said it was sepsis. The mum-of-three spent two and a half weeks in hospital fighting the deadly condition and dealing with terrying symptoms. Thinking she was on her death bed, she asked for her three children Connor, , Kiah, , and Kadi,  to be allowed to visit despite Covid- restrictions on visitors at the time.  Louise said: When I went to AE they just put a catheter in because they thought it was something wrong with my bladder as I couldnapost wee. I started being sick and didnapost eat or drink for a few days. Iaposm not ever sick even when Iaposve drank too much. I have an iron stomach, so I knew something wasnapost right. Then I started having hallucinations - I saw one of my dead friends and a nurse peeping round the curtains in the room but the healthcare worker kept telling me no one was there. It was really scary. I was crying and askingsomething was wrong with me. They shouldaposve recognised that I had the symptoms and done a blood culture test straight away.  When they told me I had sepsis I askedit was a good idea to get my family to visit me because I know how serious sepsis is and they said yes - I thought it must be badthey will let me have visitors during the pandemic. Louise made a full recovery after being treated with antibiotics but fears it could have turned out dferentlyshe hadnapost pushed doctors to test her. She had to use a Zimmer frame for a week after leaving hospital because of struggling to walk from the back pain she suffered but this soon passed once she fully recovered from her ordeal. The mum now hopes to raise awareness about the deadly condition and to encourage more people to speak up when they believe their symptoms arenapost being acknowledged. Louise said: I feel really lucky to have not even lost a fingertip or anything because people pass away or lose limbs from sepsis. Itaposs really important to raise awareness about sepsis because it affects so many people but thereaposs not much out there about it. Iaposm nearly  and I didnapost know the symptoms until I Googled them and realised I had it. If you believe you have sepsis you need to push to get blood cultures done. A spokesperson for the Northern Lincolnshire and Goole NHS Foundation Trust said: “Timely treatment of patients with Sepsis is vital so we make sure all patients showing symptoms are screened. In cases like this where patients are staying in hospital they are monitored regularly and,any changes are noted, our staff can take action quickly to start treatment so they can recover fully. We would invite this patient to contact our PALS teamthey have any concerns about their care and treatment so we can discuss it directly with them.

That’s why one mum has considered getting her children dressed for the day ahead before they go to bed, but she’s worried her thought process is “mad”.According to the Liverpool Echo, the mum posted to Mumsnet about her dilemma, where she explained she has four children – two of whom have additional needs – and that getting them all ready for school each morning is a nightmare.She wrote: “I have four children. Oldest two have additional needs, so need a lot of help with dressing in the mornings, which can take a long time. Younger two just need help due to their age.  Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here. “The mornings are hectic, and between getting myself and the four of them ready, it can take a very long time to get out of the house! “We also need to get a bus, so we miss it sometimes when we haven’t got out on time .” To try and help with her plight, the woman referred to a news article she had read about another mum who dresses her children the night before, and said she considered following that woman’s advice. She added: “I read a news article a little while ago about a woman who says she dresses her children for school the night before! Now I know people will just say go to bed earlier, but my oldest doesn’t sleep at night so we are currently awaiting a referral for a paediatrician. “Am I being unreasonable to consider what this woman does  Would anyone do this  Or am I mad to consider it ” The mum was met with hundreds of responses from other Mumsnet users, many of whom told her it was “gross” to send her kids to school in clothes they had slept in. One person wrote: “No. Theyaposd be so uncomfortable to start with. They will also smell. Not washing in the morning or changing out of clothes they may have sweated in overnight. “It just isn’t a solution. You need to get up earlier.” While another said: No, normal people donapost do this. Iaposm afraid this is definitely not the solution to your morning problems . Someone  tried to be more helpful with their comment, as they wrote: What do you already do - what’s the routine  Posters can help troubleshoot. “I don’t think I could send my children to school in slept-in clothes and I think it doesn’t give them good habits to build off for the future - plusthey mentioned sleeping in their clothes I’m sure school would log that as a concern. And after reading through some comments, the mum insisted she wouldn’t be going through with the plan to send her kids to bed fully clothed. She said: I’m not going to do it, I was just desperate to make the mornings easier but I will try some of these ideas. “Thanks for the supportive comments I am reading them and taking the advice on board. “The oldest is  and she does not sleep till  or am most nights. She shouts, screams, gets out of bed and wonders around – my youngest cannot share a room with her because she is aggressive, so my four-year-old is still in my bed. “None of us get much sleep because she keeps the other ones up with her noise, so my other children aren’t going to bed till late either as they are repeatedly being woken up. She doesn’t struggle to get out of bed, she seems to cope fine on her limited sleep, but it’s the others who struggle where they have been kept up all night.

But after ditching the daily lunch dates, she has dropped seven dress sizes and now weighs st lbAmy has dropped seven dress sizes since embarking on her health kick Image: @amys_sw_journeyx   CATERS NEWSByCally Brooks:,  Sep Updated:,  Sep | commentsA new mum whose weight ballooned after she consumed , calories a day on lunch dates has dropped seven dress sizes. Amy Greaves, , started piling on extra weight after giving birth to her daughter Maia in April . The mum, from Gedling, Nottingham, started meeting other parents for lunch dates while she was on maternity leave, a habit which set her back £-a-month and also caused her waistline to increase. Amy weighed st lb at her heaviest, and went from a size  to a size  in a matter of months. But after ditching the daily lunch dates, she has dropped seven dress sizes and now weighs st lb. Amy, who works as a freelance dance teacher, said it was important for her to look and feel healthy in order to do her job.  Iaposve never been on the smaller side but after giving birth and losing my dad, I turned to food for comfort and would eat my way through maternity,” she said. In January , I decided enough was enough - I was having surgery in March  and I was scared that being overweight would put me at risk of complications. After having Maia, I started going on group playdates with other mums daily and we would eat pub lunches, skip breakfast and have a cake and a coffee in the morning, snack on crisps and chocolate and I made a habit out of eating badly when I was on the go.  She lived in black leggings and baggy t-shirts or jumpers that covered everything up. But one day, she said it clicked. I wanted to be here to see my daughter grow up andI carried on the way I was going, I wouldnapost have been around, she said. The realisation prompted her to join Slimming World and make healthier choices, she said.  Amy has always struggled with her body image after training to be a dancer during her teenage years. She has a history of dieting and putting pressure on herself to look a certain way. You have a warped opinion of yourself - I wish I could go back now and respect my body more and do my training again,” she mused. Now, Amy said she feels like a dferent person much more confident and happier in herself. Iaposm still going to the playdates but I have a completely dferent mindset and donapost need to snack while Iaposm there,” she said. If I get hungry, I make sure to pack some healthy snacks to bring with me rather than eating out.The Mirror is committed to more hopeful news.

A summary of the case outlines the timeline of ‘Miss A’s’ pregnancy, from when she found out she was pregnant whilst in police custody, in February of  to when she was remanded to HMP Bronzefield, on  August . Shortly after her arrival in the cells a midwe in prison determined that Ms A was  weeks pregnant, which would make her expected delivery date from  September to  October.  While this was earlier than originally expected, the midwe did not recalculate this. Ms A was said to have engaged “minimally or not at all” with the midwe team and all antenatal care, including refusing to attend appointments for scans. In September, Ms A told a nurse that she would kill herself or someone her baby was taken away from her after birth a comment that prompted the nurse to discuss with an officer on duty whether it would be necessary to begin Prison Service suicide and self-harm monitoring. While they decided against this, Ms A was put on ‘extended observationsapos by the deputy head of healthcare on September . This meant she should have been checked by a nurse a minimum of twice during the day and twice at night. However, this did not happen. Ms A rang her cell bell shortly after pm that evening and asked for a nurse, though she did not say why. The officer who took the call handed over the information to a colleague, who spoke to Ms A on the phone but cannot remember the conversation.  “No nurse was called for Ms A. . Ms A pressed her cell bell again at .pm. The call was not answered on the house block and was erted to the permanently staffed communications room,” the report continued. “At .pm the call was connected and immediately disconnected. Ms A did not press her cell bell again.” Ms A’s cell was checked twice over the course of the night, but neither of the officers who carried out these checks noticed anything untoward, including blood, in her cell. It wasn’t until .am the next morning that an officer investigated and discovered Ms A had given birth during the night. Shortly after am paramedics confirmed her baby had died. Ms A was taken by ambulance to ASPH and ed to the prison that evening, where she was placed in the prison’s inpatient unit. The pathologist was unable to determine whether Baby A was born alive or was stillborn. The report outlined how the teenager “appeared to have been regarded as dficult and having a ‘bad attitude’ rather than as a vulnerable -year-old, frightened that her baby would be taken away”. Prisons and Probation ombudsman Sue McAllister told thethat Ms A should never have been left in a position where she was forced to give birth alone without medical assistance. The director of HMP Bronzefield called the incident “tragic and extremely sad”. “We are deeply sorry that this happened and our thoughts throughout have been with the family. In the two years which have passed, we have cooperated fully with the PPO investigation,” she said.Dr Kate Paradine, CEO of the charity Women in Prison,in  pleaded thatall mothers should have the right to give birth in dignity.She said: “But time and time again, we hear of situations where this isn’t happening, with mothers regularly being denied access to the vital health and maternity care necessary to give birth safely. This has devastating consequences not only for the baby and mother, but also for the rest of the family they are separated from. She added: Many mothers are imprisoned for being homeless, not having money to pay their bills and not having access to adequate mental health care and substance misuse support. Instead of sending these women to prison, the government needs to urgently prioritise investment in community support services like women’s centres, housing and health care.  Deputy prime minister and justice secretary, Dominic Raab also commented on the incident, which he said was “harrowing and unacceptable”. “We have already implemented the recommendation in the Prisons and Probation Ombudsman’s report. We have put in place important improvements to the care received by women in custody, and across government we must make sure that expectant mothers in prison get the same support as those in the community,” he said.Publication of the report has prompted the organisation of apetitionby organisations Level Up, Women In Prison and Birth Companions, calling for an end to the imprisonment of pregnant women. The groups’ calls have been echoed by the Royal College of Midwives and academics in the field.

The Duke of York now officially has  days to respond to legal documents which accuse him of having sex with Virginia Giuffre. The alleged sexual assaults took place at the behest of infamous billionaire paedophile Jeffrey Epstein at properties in London, New York, and the US Virgin Islands. Ms Giuffreaposs lawyer, David Boies, says the prince - who is the Queenaposs second son - has accepted he is in possession of the papers.  The next legal step for the Duke is to ask for a reasonable extension of time to respond to Ms Giuffreaposs complaint. Mr Boies told the Daily Mail: Andrewaposs counsel have agreed that service has been made. Theoretically the clock is now ticking. However, it would be normal for them to ask for, and for us to agree to, a reasonable extension of time to respond to the complaint. A legal filing seen by the US publication also confirmed the documents had been served to the princeaposs lawyer, Andrew Brettler in Los Angeles.A source close to Andrew has claimed that despite his inner circle’s “deep reservations” that his “wall of silence” legal strategy was not working, he has decided to “keep faith and stay loyal” to his UK lawyer Gary Bloxsome of Blackfords.Royal insiders claimed that although the Duke has been stressed and worried over his predicament after Ms Giuffre accused him of sexually assaulting her three times in , the serving of legal papers effectively meant he had run out of time to change course. However, his newly appointed US attorney Andrew Brettler has now taken over the Duke’s case after being appointed just weeks ago. A source claimed the US team were “astonished” at the long held strategy of “no comment” employed by the Duke and his team as he became engulfed in sex abuse allegations by alleged former Jeffrey Epstein sex slave Virginia Giuffre. Another source close to Andrew said: “The Duke remains confident in his legal team and its strategy and is perfectly content to continue to follow their advice.”Most ReadFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON Prince Andrew, Duke of YorkRoyal Family\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

He now has  days to file a response, or risk a judgement by defaultJudge Kaplan considers the evidence brought by Giuffre compels him to do so in the absence of the princeaposs own evidence.As the case is now live, the massive immediate impact of the prince’s acceptance of the suit is not on the prince himself, however. If he contests the suit - which now seems very likely given his army of legal retainers - some experts have said the suit may take five years to reach a conclusion. That’s a long way off, and Andrew has already been living for almost two years behind palace gates with his spoiled dog.Its real weight now bears on the Palace, and particularly the long shadow of five years of legal skirmishes in the headlines. Is it proper for a member of the Royal Family to continue to retain their HRH title while a lawsuit proceeds against them  This is uncharted territory at best, as the prince is adamant that he has no case to answer and has consistently and strenuously denied Giuffreaposs accusations for as long as she has made them. Even so, appearing in court to contest an allegation is a grave matter in its own right. The Queen as head of state must surely rise above any reproach, and doubtless so should all HRHs in the Royal Family. Now that both sides in the suit agree papers have been served, it is dficult to see how the Palace can fail to insist that the prince relinquishes his HRH title to avoid any appearance of the monarchyaposs entanglement with a private matter that affects the prince only.

She added she disliked how the Duke of Sussex is has continued to speak about his family despite leaving the institution. Ms Widdecombe did not hold her feelings back about the royal couple.She told Express : On a more serious note, I think Harry is very damaging to the royals, he must be personally very hurtful to the Queen.And I think they should keep quiet, I mean they are privileged beyond belief and they moan that they were cut off financially.  Learn all about the secretive personal lives and history of the Royal Family as youaposve never seen them before in Amazonaposs best selling Royal Historical Biographies SEE THE DEALS HERE What a joke, million Calornia mansion, and itaposs just unbelievable. They are privileged, they are professional victims, they are professional whingers and having said that they wanted privacy theyaposve done nothing except publicise every last detail of le.It comes as reports have suggested the Sussexes are keen to visit the UK after quitting as senior royals and moving to Calornia early last year.Harry has only ed to the UK twice since the move, while Meghan and two-year-old Archie have not been back so far.Meanwhile, Harry and Meghanaposs newborn daughter Lilibet has not been to the UK after being born in Calornia in June and is yet to meet her great-grandmother the Queen or her grandfather Prince Charles.And according to Katie Nicholl, a royal expert and author of Harry And Meghan: Le, Loss, And Love told Closer magazine : Christmas is being looked at as an opportunity. There may be a softening, which could pave the way for a healing of the family rt.It’s certainly what the Queen wants. Prince Charles would like to see his grandchildren. A meet-up suggests they hope to move on and sort things out. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex spoke to Oprah Winfrey in March and made a series of claims about the family - including one member reportedly speculating about what colour Archieaposs skin would be and how the palace allegedly failed to support Meghan when she struggled with her mental health. Since then, Harry has done his own interviews where he has spoken about his struggles growing up as a member of the Royal Family. In early , Harry and Meghan stepped down as senior royals and moved to Canada before settling in Calornia where they are now raising their two children - Archie and Lilibet.The royal brothers have only reunited a few times this year, at Prince Philipaposs funeral and at the unveiling of a statue to their mum, Princess Diana, at Kensington Palace on what would have been her th birthday.Comment MORE ON Ann WiddecombePrince HarryPrince Philip, Duke of EdinburghOprah WinfreyPrincess DianaPrince Charles, Prince of WalesKensington PalaceLoveRoyal FamilyMental healthPoliticsChristmas party\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Claire Stephanie Riley, , spent just £ to complete the magical look. The Royal Mail cleaner had help from her partner Jamie, , as they embarked on the project to make the home they bought two years ago about the things we love. Just like Hogwarts, the tiny bathroom features magical knick-knacks from top-to-bottom. It showcases the Marauderaposs Map on the walls to ensure occupants get their mischief managed. Claire, who also owns a dog grooming business, also displays her collection of wands, newspaper clippings from the movie franchise and miniature buildings from the fantasy world.  Even the soap and hand towels are Harry Potter-themed, with cuddly Harry and Hedwig toys looking back at you from the heated towel rail. Claire, from Wigan, said: I have always loved Harry Potter from the beginning. Itaposs just so magical it takes you to another world. Bogwarts came about when I found the Harry Potter wallpaper in BM. Not only is our downstairs loo done in Harry Potter but also our hallway that leads to it.  “My partner Jamie and I moved in around two years ago and we decided to make our home about things we love. “We donapost have any children, this is all for us... but when my friends come they love it… say itaposs their favourite place to go to the loo in. “We were having the house completely done up and we just thought for the downstairs loo and hallway it would be fun and we just came up with the name Bogwarts. “Lots more have been added over the months, more wands and other bits... itaposs something you can add on to as you go along.”  Claire also decoupaged her toilet roll holder with a dferent Harry Potter wallpaper and playing cards that she had lying around the home. Additionally, she put together a D collage of film memorabilia, including a Howler and a dark mark sign from hama beads, which is glued to the sink unit. Those with arachnophobia may want to avoid Bogwarts though, as thereaposs also a giant model of the filmaposs spider Aragog.  Claire added: “I made the toilet roll holder from bits of wallpaper we had left and Harry Potter playing cards and a few Harry Potter bits I had collected along the way. “I also made the D Harry Potter collage that hangs in the bathroom. The shelves are from IKEA and are great for putting things on and hanging other bits off. “The rest of the bits are what I have picked up and found along the way.” It isnapost the only room in the house with a theme. Other rooms are decorated with inspiration from Disney, Game of Thrones, and s cartoons.

People are horrible and hungry people are worse Image: Newcastle ChronicleopinionByShaun Staff:,  Sep | commentsIn  I hung up my hairnet for the final time after four years working for Greggs. I’ve never been back. And given you’re never more than . miles from a Greggs in any UK city centre, that’s some feat. For most people, when hunger strikes and you need food fast, the UK’s most accessible outlet is the perfect cure. Not for me. Though my heart yearns for a steak bake my head puts on the steak brakes. I saw too much. And I’m here to give you a glimpse behind the counter and reveal the secrets of working in Greggs.  You are being judged If you have ever visited the same Greggs twice, you’ve probably got a nickname based on your order,you’re lucky, or your appearance,you’re not. Two sausage rolls and a Dr Pepper, is it  How very predictable, Dr Pork. Sometimes harmless fun but often cruel and unforgiving, the servers have noticed your imperfections and they’re quietly talking about them from the moment you enter. They donapost want to serve you anyway Greggs staff arrive a couple of hours before opening, allowing  minutes to prep the food and  to argue about who has to serve it. Working the till is the least favourite job, for good reason. People are horrible and hungry people are worse. Strategies employed to avoid human interaction include slow trips upstairs to replenish stock, fake bouts of dizziness, extreme thirstand ducking down. If you’ve ever walked into an empty Greggs, you are probably not alone. The coffee machine is not broken But they won’t tell you that. If you order a black coffee at the exact moment one of the staff are about to make one for themselves, the machine might just spring into le. Any other time don’t ask. If your order is much more than a sausage roll you are officially annoying. Exceptions are made for friends, family, and the homeless in winter.  % friends and family discounts While the staff discount is generous, giving away food from Greggs is not allowed, presenting the perfect opportunity to get creative and innovate new ways to feed friends and family for free. “Here is that coffee you ordered, sir.” It’s a sausage roll wedged into a paper cup. The competition was fierce and ultimately cancelled when a hollowed out loaf loaded with cakes was intercepted by management. Your food may have been used as a weapon If you’ve ever been slapped in the face by a wet tomato, you’ll know how much it hurts. If you’ve ever slapped someone with a wet tomato, you’ll know how satisfying it is. Making  sandwiches is no fun unless you create it – and it’s a fact that baguettes make excellent swords. There is a likelihood any food you order has previously been used for violence – but at least the perpetrator was wearing gloves and a hairnet. There’s more to be fearful of – the ongoing civil war between weekend and weekday staff, the mythical beard net, and the inevitable three-stone weight gain for all employees. I won’t judge you for visiting Greggs, but I’m  years clean and will never eat there again.Most ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Greggs\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Hayley Legge had taken her Staffy, Diesel, to Harlech Beach, near Porthmadog, Wales, for a run around when she got tired of throwing his ball in a game of fetch.In a video shared to theStaffies UK Facebook page, Hayley put Diesel’s ball in the back of a remote controlled car before zooming it across the sand with the eight-year-old dog chasing after it. She toldTeamDogs: “My other half was playing with his car on the beach and I was throwing Diesel’s ball. Then I said to Adam ‘Wouldn’t it be funnywe can put his ball on the car to save me throwing it’, so we did and it worked well. It gave my arm a rest!” In the minute long video, which has received over , likes in the private group, Hayley and Adam can be heard giggling at the dog behind the camera as he runs after the Traxxas Unlimited Desert Racer. Adam quipped: “He’s not giving up is he ” as Diesel is hot on the heels of the car wheels. One commenter dubbed the idea ‘genius’, with another adding: “That’s got to be the best way to walk a dog, ever.” TeamDogs is a community for dog lovers who want to get the most out of their relationship with their best pal.

Following the end of the concert, Olivia entered the City Room at .pm just seconds before the bomb went off, the inquiry heard. She was approximately five metres from Abedi at the moment of detonation. Footage showed her body did not move during the period after the bomb went off.

A post-mortem examination concluded that Olivia had died of head and neck injuries while a  of experts appointed by the inquiry said her injuries were “unsurvivable”.

Her mother, Charlotte Hodgson, told the inquiry that Olivia was “a beautul young girl who packed so much in her  years”, who loved sports, singing and make-up.  She said of her daughter: “She didnapost come into a room - she would make an entrance. She was always making people laugh and anything she did she could make it fun”.

Emma Campbell, , has been living in her council flat since she was just -years-old. In that time, she was able to buy the flat for herself and has given it a dream makeover. She decided to transform her flat while in lockdown, and was able to achieve everything she wanted on a small budget. The digital marketing trainer said: It was awful when I first moved in. Whoever lived here before had really odd taste. In the kitchen, they had these hand-painted footprints going along the wall.  It wasnapost nice at all. She had been able to do some minor decorating when she first moved in, but it was when lockdown hit that she make the decision to give her flat a complete makeover. Most of the furniture is thrted, or just freebies I found on the side of the road, and lots of up-cycling, Emma explains.  I saved a lot of money in the bedroom and the living room because I had a go at plastering it myself.I got a lot of stuff, like the dining table, off Facebook Marketplace.She had initially asked a friend to install the bathroom, but it did not go quite to plan. He kind of left the job unfinished, so I had to try and do a lot of it myself.  I also tiled and painted the kitchen myself. I spend quite a lot of time in the kitchen so I wanted it to look really nice. Emma says that her friends could not believe the transformation, who have seen first hand the state of the flat initially. I was quite embarrassed by it at first, she said. I was sleeping on a futon, and my TV was just on a chair, it looked like something out of trainspotting.  Now, they canapost believe itaposs the same place. During lockdown just having to stay in the same space, and kind of hating it, is what gave me the motivation to make some changes. Working from home, at first I was just spending all my time in my bedroom. She added: Then, for my birthday my mum asked me what I wanted for my birthday and I just said aposhelpapos. So she came down and helped to motivate me, and help me move furniture around, and everything.  She spent a total of £, on the makeover, the most expensive being £, for a new kitchen. She had some new wooden floors put in for £, and bought a sofa for £.

That looks like my garden, the -year-old thought after spotting the grainy snap containing the mysterious creature, dubbed the aposCastleford Crocapos.It had been taken by exhausted nurse Sarah Jayne Ellis after her overnight sht at the hospital.

Leighane Redmond, , had been suffering from psychosis when she and Melsadie Parris died at Taplow Station, on  February .British Transport Police said at the time they were treating the case as murder-suicide and the results of their investigations were expected to be revealed when the full inquest takes place,Bucks Free Press reports.At a pre-inquest review hearing held at Beaconsfield Coroners’ Court today, Buckinghamshire Senior Coroner Crispin Butler agreed to requests from lawyers for Melsadie’s father Leroy Parris and her mother Yvette Redmond to adjourn the full inquest hearing. The hearing was due to last four weeks from November . No new date for the full inquest was set, but there will be a pre-trial review on November .  The court today heard of how the death of Ms Redmond and her daughter could have been the result of inadequate fencing and hoardings at Taplow Station. Ms Redmond’s mother wants to invite a rail expert to help establish whether her daughter was let down by rail and contractor firms that were operating at the station on the day of her death. Yvette Redmond’s lawyer, Caoilfhionn Gallagher QC, told the court she was concerned the other parties would “mark their own homework” when assessing what happened on the day of the tragedy. “It is essential to have an expert,” Ms Gallagher said.  “There are ious standards on the railway. Without expert assistance, it will not be possible to knowthe interested parties adhered to their responsibilities.” The lawyer said it was crucial to have an independent assessment. The comments come after the family of the victims raised concerns over the fencing and hoardings at Taplow Station, which was undergoing construction works when the incident took place. Questions were also raised at a previous pre-inquest review as to why station staff did not interfere when Ms Redmond, who had struggled with mental health issues, had been standing with her daughter on the  for more than an hour. Ben Compton QC, representing MTR Elizabeth Line raised questioned over whether there was a need for a rail expert in the matter. “I just question how much a pure rail expert can really help in this case. The question is how Leighane and Melisade were able to access the high-speed  in Taplow Station,” he said. The hearing had been adjourned after around two hours. Another pre-inquest review was expected to take place ahead of the full four-week inquest later this year.  The Samaritans is available  you need to talk.

Victoria said: “It was always my dream to create my own wedding dress, I got to make it to my own specications, and it was super comfortable.  I was inspired by a few dferent crochet artists but I made the dress entirely by hand, I didn’t have a pattern for it. “With the off-cuts left over from the yarn, I managed to make myself some barefoot sandals for the day, my husband’s tie and pocket square. I also upcycled an old umbrella I had and got some yarn for that at a thrt store.”  Victoria was quoted more than £ for flowers and catering, and with dress prices in New York averaging out at thousands of pounds, she decided to put her skills to the test to slash the overall costs.

The town of Rockport in Utah, US, disappeared completely in  - five years after the White House green lit the construction of the Wanship Dam.At the time, a total of  families still lived in the once thriving little town, located in a narrow part of Weber Valley at the mouth of Three Mile Canyon, reports the Daily Star. The remaining residents protested against the development but the government went ahead and purchased the entire valley, and in preparation for the dam, created the Rockport Reservoir, quickly submerging the whole community.Last week, drone test pilot Devon Dewey shared incredible snaps on Twitter following a serious drought which revealed the foundations of the old town. Do you have any drone images to rival Devonaposs  Let us know at webnews@mirrorHe told KSL News : It was really interesting to be standing at an overlook for the reservoir and to see faint traces of foundations of old homes and a road all below where the water would normally be. The whole area is pretty flat and unorm, so even though the foundations are old and mostly gone, you can still see them clearlyyou know where to look.Using a drone to get a higher perspective helped to see where structures once stood over  years ago.  The town was first settled in . After the government purchased the land nearly a hundred years later, some of the buildings were removed so that they could be preserved for history. They were moved to Pioneer Village at Lagoon Amusement Park in Farmington. Following this year’s drought, only small boats and personal watercraft are allowed to launch, although officials have advised people to do so “at your own risk”. Even though water levels have declined, the ground may be muddy from years of being underwater, so officials have advised people to be cautious and use dronesthey want to see the remnants of the ‘ghost town’.

That was her very first video posted. That was the start of her whole YouTube journey. aposShe just fell in love with that lestyle and wanted to take journeys. She was a free spirit.

Known only as LJ, the woman said that often she will talk to other members of the cabin crew about passengers that she finds attractive, but she does it in secret.She said that the code she uses is universally understood, and others in the know will reply in kind to comment their opinion - and all the while the passengers are in the dark, as the Daily Star reports.LJ said she will refer to passengers as food, asking others aposwhat do you want to have for dinner tonightapos, and the other member of the cabin crew will say whether they would eat that food too. Speaking on the Confessions on the Fly podcast, flight attendant LJ said: I’ve picked up a dude on an aircraft, on my way to Austin four years ago. He was really cute. We had a couple of fun dates.My co-worker and I had this code ‘what do you want to have for dinner tonight ’ And you would say Italian or this or that. But we were really talking about the dudes coming on the aircraft. So we would have a code of like ‘no, I’m not really hungry for that’ or when somebody hot was coming on I’d be like, ‘oh yeah I’ll definitely go out for that tonight’. When somebody came on who was really really cute, I was like ‘oh yeah I definitely want whatever it was – Italian – for the night’. LJ then explained in further detail how she and her flight attendant friend Tony had employed their secret code to successfully get a passengers’ number. I bought him a drink on the aircraft and then when he came to the back of the aircraft to go to the restroom, my co-worker started talking to him, just warming him up or whatever, she continued. And then I jumped in and Tony casually walks to the front of the aircraft and gives us time to chat… and then I got his number. On the podcast episode, LJ also shared some tips for passengers who might want to make a move on cabin crew. Her main piece of advice, she noted, was that passengers should not try it on while attendants are doing service. That’s very awkward... If you want to grab our attention, being nice and courteous is rule number one, she added. Saying please and thank yous…you ask me how my day is or anything like that, I am so totally thrown off guard, because nobody talks to me other than to ask for a diet coke or whatever. So that, number one, perks me up and makes me actually look at you and pay attention.Do you have a story to share  Weaposd love to hear all about it.

Maxaposs favourite song is the iconic romantic tune ‘I Will Always Love You’, and even he simply can’t resist the urge to join in the famous long note that begins at the ballad’s chorus.The funny clip, which was posted by the TikTok user @nautiescape, begins with Max and his owner cruising on a boat together, as his human counterpart explains just how much his dog loves the song.He says that any time it comes on, Max can’t help but start howling and singing along. He then presses play and shows us just how talented his dog is.  As soon as the chorus of the track begins, Max instantly begins to howl along, really stretching his vocal chords as he threatens to give Whitney a run for her money. Viewers were clearly impressed by Max’s songbird abilities, with one commenting: “So much soul coming through that whooooo! Love it.” Another commenter wrote: “This is the cutest thing I’ve seen all day! Adorable!” A third added: “Whitney channelling through him… adorable.” Comment MORE ON Whitney HoustonLoveViralTeamDogsDogs\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Calling all dog lovers!to TeamDogs for your weekly dose of dog news, pictures and stories.Invalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Ashley Estrada had been out with her cousin when all of a sudden her iPhone detected a nearby Apple AirTag, so the pair tried to find out.To their surprise, it was on Ashleyaposs car - hidden behind the licence plate - and whoever placed it there would have been able to track Ashleyaposs movements, as the Daily Star reports.Ashley, from Los Angeles, US, said she had no idea who had placed the device there - and shared a video of the discovery to spread awareness of just how easy it is to track people.What do you think about Ashleyaposs shocking discovery  Let us know in the comments...In the video, Ashley said: I’m literally f***ing shaking – look what I just found on my car. Her cousin then shows the app on her phone which reveals the device has tracked the car’s every stop. In a later video, Ashley explained she discovered the tracker after her cousin’s girlfriend got a notication that an AirTag had been detected nearby. I was hanging out with my cousinaposs girlfriend, and next thing you know she gets a notication on her phone, which is how we found out because it told us.

The ball of space rock flew through the air towards southern Slovenia on February  , and scientists launched a year-long mission to discover it to unlock secrets about the solar system. Researchers used dashcam footage of the incident from Slovenia, Croatia, Italy, Austria and Hungary to try to track where it landed. Dr Denis Vida of the University of Western Ontario presented the preliminary results of the hunt for space rocks and subsequent study at the aposEuroplanet Science Congressapos virtual meeting, which is being held this week. The meteorite, which has been named aposNovo Mestoapos after a nearby Slovenian city, was caught on tape in several countries by dashcams and security cameras. According to the study, the meteorite created a loud explosion and a powerful flash that lasted for . seconds. As it fell, the rock experienced  million pascals, equivalent to  times the pressure of a car tyre, one of the highest measurements recorded for a space rock.  The immense pressure and scalding heat broke the space rock, which would have weighed an estimated four metric tons before entering the earthaposs atmosphere, into  small fragments. Experts were able to recover three of the rock fragments weighing  grammes , which have been sent to laboratories for analysis. Despite the successful recovery of these three fragments, the hunt is still on for a huge -kilogrammefragment, which experts are concerned may have landed in a muddy field and been ploughed over by a farmer.  According to the study, the space rock is an aposordinary chondriteapos meteorite, which is by far the most numerous group and comprises about  per cent of all meteorite finds on earth. Despite being aposordinaryapos, researchers believe that the rock is linked to the Solar System region where Near-Earth Objects exist, and its examination could reveal new information about our solar systemaposs origins.  According to the statement: Rocks from space provide opportunities to understand the history of our Solar System and are important in studies of how le arose on Earth. However, fall locations often remain unknown or hidden and the space rocksapos scientic messages are then lost. Vida said: By combining observations from several cameras around  kilometres apart, a fireballaposs position can be pinpointed to within  metres, and itaposs usually fairly easy to compute its atmospheric trajectory and pre-atmospheric orbit this way. He added: The fireballaposs path is in a volume of the worldaposs sky among the most densely observed by specialist night-operating cameras. Its path would have been caught by at least it happened just a few hours earlier.  However, as the meteorite crashed into the earth during the day, it was only recorded by car dashcams, forcing the experts to get creative with their attempt to locate the space rock fragments. The team said in the statement: To help create D models, local people were asked to take several photographs from known locations of buildings, telephone posts, distant mountains, and other landmarks visible in the dashcam videos.  It added: The images enabled triangulation of exact locations accurate to within a few centimetres. Analysis of the Novo Mesto space rock is ongoing as scientists hope to gain valuable information from it about our solar system. The hunt for the lost giant fragment continues.Most ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON University of Western OntarioMeteors\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Revonni Adams, , went to the doctor complaining of severe indigestion, without realising the real cause was her advanced pregnancy. The trainee accountant, from Windhoek, Namibia, had been taking acid indigestion medication for some time, but made the appointment after it stopped working. With visible abs and no missing periods, Revonni never expected the doctor to tell her that she was in fact eight months pregnant. She said: As I laid down for the doctor to do the check-up, the last thing either of us was expecting was to hear aposyouaposre pregnantapos. I was in so much shock that I was arguing with a professional on why it seemed impossible for me to be pregnant. I looked at my partner and he was dead silent. I was lowkey happy but I didnapost want to seem excited or get my hopes up because, in my mind, the doctor definitely made a mistake. The drive home was absolutely silent, we were both in our minds just trying to wrap our heads around the fact that in a few weeks, I would actually be giving birth to a whole person.  But eventually my partner disrupted the silence by laughing and saying that my barbecue wings and peanut butter cravings now all made sense. The possibility of pregnancy hadnapost even crossed my mind because I wasnapost missing my period and I literally still had abs. I had absolutely no signs at all, I never missed my period, I had no morning sickness, weight gain or even tummy growth. Nothing at all. So you could understand my reasoning for arguing with the doctor after that revelation. Revonni and her -year-old partner, who she doesnapost wish to name, are both fitness fanatics and love to spend time in the gym. Her partner is also her personal trainer, and helped her achieve chiselled abs that were visible until the last few weeks of her pregnancy. She added: For about three years now, Iaposve been on acid indigestion medication, so every time I consume carbonated drinks or spicy foods, I experience nausea, severe cramps, extreme bloating and basic loss of appetite.  As a result of this, I became so ill- fatigue, nausea, bloating and severe cramps. I decided to go to the doctor and renew my prescription for my acid indigestion medication. I lay on the bed debriefing my symptoms to the doctors and as sheaposs feeling my tummy she tells me aposNo no dear, youaposre pregnant.apos My immediate reaction was to laugh and start giving her all my reasons for why that seemed impossible. She insisted that the head was already facing down and explained I could give birth any minute now. She first said I was around  weeks, but after an ultrasound to confirm we found out that I was  weeks pregnant. I was in denial. Imagine going to the doctor for an acid problem and being told youaposre actually about to give birth to a stranger. As soon as I found out I was expecting a baby, I swear my bump began to aggressively pop over the remaining few weeks of my pregnancy. Revonni and her partner have been together for two years and regularly joke about having five children together, however, they didnapost expect it would happen so soon. She says that theyaposre both still young and that their careers are only just commencing, so they werenapost expecting to have a family until further into the future. Revonni added: Our only concern was the adjustments that we had to start making, in terms of finance, health, and our professional careers. What my family would say was never a concern for me, I have the most loving and supportive mum. I called her the day we found out and sheaposs been buying baby stuff ever since. I am so excited now, to be honest. I cannot wait to meet my little human. Iaposm past my due date now so weaposre expecting our little acid reflux baby any day now. Obviously it took a minute to settle into the idea of having sleepless nights and losing my very toned abs but I can honestly say that thereaposs never been any feeling of regret or shame since I found out. Iaposm nervous yes, but definitely more excited.Most ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON BabiesPregnancyGiving birthPersonal trainerPrescriptionsFitnessMorning sicknessPeriods\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Appearing on Monday in front of a courtroom in the Swiss town of Lugano, in the Ticino region, Dirk W. told the court of how he was having sex with -year-old Anna Florence Reed on their bathroom floor when he put a hand towel around her neck. “Then I pressed on it with my hands, as we had done a hundred times before. Suddenly she stopped moving, her tongue was sticking out. I tried to resuscitate her,” he said. Ms Reed, from North Yorkshire, was found dead at Hotel La Palma au Lac, a four-star lakeside hotel in the southern Swiss municipality of Muralto on April  .The defendant, who has also been named as Marc Schatzle, or Marc S during some coverage of the case, maintains her death was the result of a sex game gone wrong.The prosecution believes he murdered the young woman to appropriate her fortune.  Her credit card, which was missing at the time of her death, was found in the ceiling of the hotel lt four months after the alleged crime. The defendant told the court he placed it there as a prank after his girlfriend complained about always paying for everything. The court heard how the pair had consumed alcohol and cocaine and had argued on the night before her death. During the court case, he was asked detailed questions by the judge, about their sex le on the date Ms Reed died and how did it come to pass that they played the strangulation game.  However, the defendant was unable to answer many of the questions because of the time distance involved, and also because he was very drunk on that date. His lack of recall over the events of the night, paired with his lestyle sleeping with hundreds of women over the years and living a VIP lestyle without worrying about his obligations to his two children, were key points considered in the case. However, the court also criticised the prosecutoraposs case in particular over failures of the investigators to ascertain the precise time of death of the young woman when called to the crime scene. The court case continues.Most ReadFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON Court caseCredit cardsCrimeCelebrity love livesCocaine\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our money-saving tips and top offers direct to your inbox with the Mirror Money newsletterInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The pair of suspected gang associates were flagged down as they travelled from Hamilton, about  miles south of Auckland, police said. When officers searched their car, they discovered three buckets of fried chicken,  tubs of coleslaw and numerous boxes of fries, as well as £, in cash. The two men, aged  and , are due to appear in court and face a fine of more than £, or six months of prisonfound guilty of breaking public health rules. Their arrest came amid a shutdown of Auckland, New Zealand’s largest city, that has been in place since  August.  Under the level four shutdown restrictions, all restaurants and cafes – including take-away services are closed. A breach of the Covid- Public Health Response Act can result in imprisonment for up to six months or a large fine. After nearly five weeks, Auckland moved out of its highest setting on Monday. Police said further charges are likely and an investigation is ongoing. A police spokesperson said officers made the arrest after noticing a suspicious-looking vehicle travelling on the outskirts of the city.  They said: “Upon seeing the police car, the vehicle did a u-turn and sped off trying to evade police. “The vehicle was searched and police located the cash, alongside empty ounce bags and a large amount of takeaways. Last week, a -year-old man was charged after he posted a TikTok video showing him leaving Auckland and purchasing a large meal from McDonaldaposs.  It comes as New Zealand says it may not get back to having no coronavirus cases in the community again as the Delta iant spreads.New Zealand eliminated Covid- last year and had been largely virus-free until the latest outbreak of the Delta iant erupted in August, prompting Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern to order a nationwide lockdown.Ashley Bloomfield, the director general of health told Radio New Zealand: We may not get back to zero but the important thing is we are going to keep finding any infections and basically continue to contact trace, test and isolate people so that we stop the virus circulating in the community... thataposs the aim. Bloomfield said the aim now was to try and get on top of the outbreak while also ramping up vaccination rates after a delayed start, with nearly % of the population now fully vaccinated.

Officers searching the isle of Krk found the woman’s backpack and purse on Tuesday, about  metres from where she was first rescued on  September.A police source told the local news site sata that the purse had no documents or money . Photographs have also emerged showing a rescue team lting her onto a stretcher and taking her to an ambulance. The woman - believed to be in her s - was originally spotted waving at a fisherman from a jagged outcrop of rock off the island.  He then called for help, and a team of  people used xs and walked two miles across jagged rocks on the isle to rescue her. The woman, who speaks English like a professor”, was covered in blood and had no idea how she came to be on the rock, nor could she remember her own name. She was not carrying a passport, papers, or phone and was reportedly dehydrated and emaciated. Officials said she was so weak she could barely take a sip of water. Local authorities have said no one has come forward to identy her. On Sunday, police released the woman’s details and photograph after spending a week trying without success to identy her. She has been described by local officials as being ft in with shoulder- hair, wearing a pink hat, striped top and dark trousers.  A police spokesperson said: “Various methods have been tried to establish her identity but so far none have proved successful.” Experts say she had managed to survive several nights, despite terrying wildle, including bears, prowling the island. One person told Sata: Itaposs weird that she was looking in the area at all. It is an extremely inaccessible part of the bay with terribly sharp rocks - literally razors that cut the rubber on your shoes. “There is no le or animals except maybe wild boars or bears which know how to swim to here in search of food, but this is a rarity because there is no food, nothing. A woman that age certainly could not swim that distance, it needs exceptional strength. A local of Soline, the small village from where the woman was discovered said the woman had not been staying in the village because she would have been recognised. Another, from neighbouring Klimno, suggested she may have “strayed while walking, fell, and lost her memory due to a blow to the head.” Krk is a popular holiday destination particularly with holidaymakers from southern Germany, Austria, Italy and Hungary.

programme now under way, we#ve put together a collection of Covid vaccine tracker charts to monitor the progress of the Covid- vaccine rollout across the UK.How many people have been vaccinated How many people have received the vaccine in my area Which demographics have received the vaccine What is the uptake like during pregnancy The Covid vaccine tracker below shows an at-a-glance view of the current proportion of the Scottish population who have received the first and second dose of either the Oxford AstraZaneca or the Pfizer BioNTech vaccination so far.Data on the number of people vaccinated was initially provided in a weekly report from Public Health Scotland, however there was immense pressure to keep the public more regularly informed so on January  the statistics began to be provided each day.The chart below shows the daily numbers of first and second doses provided.The chart below shows the cumulative number of people who have received each dose since the vaccination programme began on December .It#s also helpful to look at this data as a proportion of the Scottish population so you can see how the percentage of people vaccinated grows over time.The chart below shows the progress for each UK country.On January , Public Health Scotland provided this data broken down by vaccine type which is shown in the chart below.The map below shows the available data on the regional rollout of the vaccination programme.January  saw the release of data by local authority area for the first time, which is shown in the map below.Regional data was originally available on a weekly basis but moved to a daily upload on February . The chart below contains data on the daily number of doses provided and the population covered. Use the drop down box to select your area and the buttons to move between daily vaccinations, cumulative vaccinations and the percentage of the population who have received first doses.Similarly to the regional data, data by demographics were originally provided in the weekly PHS report # however on February  they moved to a daily publication schedule.The chart below shows the daily number of people who have had first doses in each age range as well as the percentage of that population covered.There is limited data available on vaccinations in pregnancy, however we do have monthly data on the number of people vaccinated by pregnancy trimester.Coronavirus in Scotland # track the spread with these charts\" title\"#Coronavirus in Scotland # track the spread with these charts# # Evening Express\" src\"https:www.eveningexpress fp news specials coronavirus-in-scotland-track-the-spread-in-these-charts-and-maps embed # secretanuYMBbtv\" data-secret\"anuYMBbtv\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"Coronavirus in Scotland – here are the key demographics\" title\"#Coronavirus in Scotland – here are the key demographics# # Evening Express\" src\"https:www.eveningexpress fp news specials coronavirus-in-scotland-here-are-the-key-demographics embed # secretbLHWrhpUp\" data-secret\"bLHWrhpUp\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"Let us knowthere is something  you think we should be tracking by emailing lkelly@dctmediaFor as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor august 27 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Sir,Last Sunday I was burning some garden waste in a garden incinerator when the fire brigade arrived at my home in Lochgilphead.I have done this almost weekly for many years and it has never caused any problems. The incinerator is metal, sitting on a stone base with a lid and I am always in attendance. There#s even a hose nearby.Anyone could see what it was.If the person who called the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service did so by mistake, that#s fine.Butit was a joke, it failed miserably. Andit was done with malicious intent as a hoax call, that#s another thing entirely.What would have happenedour firefighters were needed for an actual emergency while attending my bonfire of weeds Name and address suppliedSir,Scotland must seize the opportunity to rapidly increase planting of productive forestry to offset the full impact of future timber supply stocks.The UK as a whole # which currently imports  per cent of its annual timber requirement # is far too vulnerable to fluctuations in the global market.Home-grown timber makes up only around  per cent of the UK market and while we are largely self-sufficient in fencing, there is signicant unmet domestic demand for more structural timber and also pallet wood.Scottish-based timber manufacturers could potentially triple production to meet current and anticipated future demand and produce a greater share of the remaining  per cent of the market which is currently imported, predominantly from Scandinavia, Latvia and Germany.There is also signicant potential to expand Scotland’s one fth of forested land area so that we can be more self-reliant in our requirements for timber.Sawmills in Scotland and UK produce high quantities of pallet and fencing products but mainly produce construction timber # kiln dried carcassing that is used for roof battens, floor joists and studwork for partitioned walls.Already this year prices have risen  per cent as house builders and related industries struggle to secure supplies due to a huge increase in building activity, post lockdown.This is even noticeable in the DIY stores when trying to get timber for home projects.Transport and energy costs will increase emerging economies around the world will demand more timber and timber-producing countries may be required to use more of their own timber at home as they seek to meet stricter climate protocols and net zero targets.Sweden is recording the lowest stock levels in  years and this trend is likely to be further exacerbated as current issues like wildfires, tree diseases and pests, exert additional worldwide pressures on the supply of timber.The UK can attempt to compete for diminishing supplies on the world market against growing economies such as China and India or do something to mitigate its exposure to these forces, by planting more commercial forestry now so that we are more self-sufficient in the future.Mick Bottomley, head of marketing and sales, Forestry and Land ScotlandSir,Anyone turning  years old in the near future shouldn#t hold their breath for much of a state pension increase.As I approach my big birthday, I have been informed I will receive just p more per week. That won#t buy me a couple of slices of bread or a pint of milk. I couldn#t even buy half a second class stamp with it.I have worked all my le, including more than  years for the NHS, until  years ago and this is my reward.I#ve never felt more insulted it#s worse than a slap in the face.Quite frankly, it#s a disgrace.Rachel S Grant, CarradaleSir,As part of their newly announced agreement with the SNP government, the Scottish Greens have sold out the Highlands and Islands in their quest for power.Within the new agreement, announced last week, the Scottish Greens have managed to retain their ability to disagree with their SNP colleagues on certain issues, however have specically said that with regard to Highlands and Islands aviation and HIAL they will follow the SNP’s lead.Given the ongoing issues with Air Traffic Control management proposals in the Highlands and Islands this exemption would appear to be aimed at ensuring the Scottish Government can force through controversial changes that would see jobs centralised in Inverness and a signicant loss of local knowledge.The fact that this issue is specied in the document not only indicates that the SNP is very aware of the anger, resentment and damage that HIAL’s proposals are causing to the affected communities, but that they don’t care and have every intention of forcing through the proposals no matter what engagement they get from stakeholders.By allowing this as an exemption, the Scottish Greens have indicated that they too are now aware but aren’t particularly concerned with issues affecting the Highlands and Islands of Scotland, but are willing to sell out a huge swathe of the countryit means they can get the SNP’s scraps.Of further concern is what this indicates about the Scottish Government’s level of respect for parliamentary process.A petition from local communities asking the Air Traffic Management Scheme to be halted while independent assessments are undertaken is currently before the petitions committee.By including the Highlands and Islands as an exemption whereby the Greens must fall in line, Scottish Government are indicating that they know a contentious decision is on the horizon and want to be able to shepherd it through despite any and all logical and well-informed protests.It is clear that the Scottish Greens have no intention of properly vetting policies in relation to the Highlands and Islands and are happy to allow the SNP to run roughshod over the communities there.Rhoda Grant, Labour MSP for the Highlands and Islands"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column september 3 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.The response from the Scottish Ambulance to Councillor Philand#s earlier approach has encouraging aspects, and others which leave room for concern.The recruitment of more ambulance personnel is good news, and let#s hope they are trained and on the front line before too long.

Many of these are linked to previous and devastating trauma and are only made worse by the circumstances they are forced to live in.Part of our work at Crisis is to ensure our clients have the psychological support they need to establish a le away from homelessness. Keeping this going through the pandemic has been a real challenge and Crisis staff have been finding all sorts of creative solutions.In the early days of the pandemic our coaches worked rapidly to provide phones, tablets, laptops and data to our clients who needed it and adapted our services, including our psychological support, so we could provide a continued leline over the phone and online.With lockdown and restrictions now eased, it is a relief for our clients to feel less of the added mental pressure that we#ve had from the circumstances of the last year and for face-to-face support to be more of an option again.Whether in person or online, all our work is only made possible by the fantastic people and organisations who support us, meaning we can continue to help people across the country to leave homelessness behind for good.On behalf of Crisis and the thousands of people we support each year, we would particularly like to thank the players of People’s Postcode Lottery, across Scotland and where, who have helped fund the vital work of our clinical psychologists in such dficult times.Peter Oakes, lead clinical psychologist at CrisisSir,Recent disruptions with our ferry service from Islay to the mainland have once again shown us just how much we depend on a fit-for-purpose service with reliable, newer vessels in operation.Unfortunately this is currently not the case as our ferry fleet has been underfunded for many years,not decades, as a result of decisions made by urban-centric central government.Our frontline CalMac ferry crews and port staff are hard-working and an asset to our island and mainland communities, however they can only work with the tools they have at hand.The -year-old MV Hebridean Isles is one of the oldest in the state-owned fleet and while it was no doubt good in its day that day has passed a long time ago. Problems with our Islay ferry service have also been exacerbated with the continued poaching of one of our ferries in the summer months for other areas that CalMac operates in.On numerous occasions, distillers on Islay said they were facing major problems in transporting whisky to the Scottish mainland because of a capacity crisis on the ferry links.The feeling amongst many of my constituents is that it is we on Islay, Jura and Colonsay who always end up getting a raw deal.This simply cannot be allowed to continue.Councillor Alastair Redman, Kintyre and the Islands ward Sir,Thanks to funding from the Scottish Power Foundation, an Argyll and Bute scheme is offering young people a new route to gaining employment and skills in heritage.Heritage Horizons, run by the Culture, Heritage and Arts Assembly, Argyll and Isles , and Argyll and Bute Heritage and Museums Forum, aims to address the issue of an ageing workforce in the heritage and museums sectors by offering skill-building opportunities for young people.The project will work with Argyll heritage venues in areas of high unemployment, developing  accredited placements for young people.

Academics agree that a sustainable level of material use, which would still allow for a high quality of le, is about eight tonnes per person per year.Zero Waste Scotland is advocating for mindful shopping, encouraging Scots to buy smarter and adopt reuse, repair and renting behaviours as well as embracing second-hand shopping.When finished with an item, it is calling on people to dispose of items responsibly by donating, reselling or recycling.With global climate change discussions at an all-time high and COP coming to Glasgow this November, the topic of responsible consumption in relation to the climate crisis has never been more timely.Everything we buy has a carbon cost and we are urging Scots to think dferently about what we buy and how we consume.Changing our own consumption habits is the single biggest thing we can all do to play our part in tackling climate change.Now is the time for action and we want people to bin less and buy better, seeking out items which will last longer.Responsible consumption isn’t on the COP agenda so we wanted to ensure it is top of the consumer agenda.To learn more about the campaign, please visit www.howtowasteless for further details.Iain Gulland, chief executive, Zero Waste Scotland"},{"url":null,"title":"science matters does genetic tolerance aid wild swimmers","story":"Dorothy H CrawfordUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Subscribe NowWild swimming has become increasingly popular during lockdown, but in general people are ided into those who love swimming in cold water and those who think that it’s complete madness.Now scientists have found a possible explanation for this ision related to a muscle protein called alpha-actinin- .We have two types of muscle fibres # type  and type .Type  fibres provide fatigue resistance important for prolonged, submaximal activity like marathon running, while type  fibres produce a rapid and powerful force for short-burst, vigorous activities such as sprinting.The two types of fibres respond dferently to cold exposure # type  fibres produce an involuntary, low-intensity, continuous increase in muscle tone, while type  fibres give bursts of high-intensity activity causing overt shivering.ACTN is only active in type  muscle fibres, and deficiency of this protein is caused by a non-ing ACTN gene.This occurs in - per cent of the world’s population, around . billion people, and is most common in Europe and Asia.These people lack type  muscle fibre activity and although this is compensated by having larger type  fibres, it adversely affects muscle , impacting on athletic performance, particularly in sprint and power activities.Now scientists have investigated the role of ACTN in cold tolerance .Male participants,  with ing and  with non-ing ACTN, were immersed in water at °C for -minute periods interspersed with -minute rest periods at room temperature .The ordeal ended either after a maximum of six immersions or when participants’ body temperature dropped to .°C.The scientists found improved cold tolerance in those with non-ing ACTN, some  per cent of whom maintained body temperature above .°C compared to  per cent of those with al ACTN.So those lacking al type  fibres had better cold tolerance, suggesting that cold-induced increased muscle tone is more efficient at generating heat than overt shivering.Improved cold tolerance probably gave our ancestors an evolutionary survival advantage after their migration from Africa to colder climes in Eurasia, so explaining the high frequency of non-ing ACTN in today’s northern populations.It would be interesting to investigate how many Scottish wild swimmers carry this genetic iant.

It also provides guidance for mums and dads on testing, self-isolation, and vaccination.Read the letter in full, below. Dear parents and carers,With schools having been back for nearly four weeks, I want to commend the care, commitment and courage shown by everyone in playing their part in keeping our communities safe. The number of cases of COVID- across Orkney have been rising of late and have affected a small proportion of adults and young people who attend at some of our schools.On Monday this week, there were  positive cases linked to Stromness Academy and we now also see six positive cases at Kirkwall Grammar School.We have worked closely with Public Health colleagues in Orkney and, together, we have managed local clusters very effectively. This was only successful thanks to the diligence of parents, pupils and staff in following the mitigations in place and for managing these situations positively but cautiously.Whilst so much has changed over the past  months, the fundamentals within our schools have remained the same. Children and young people still come to school to learn, play and socialise with their friends.The easing of restrictions has left some relieved and others anxious. I want to reassure you all that staff are doing everything they can to make your child’s experience a positive one, in particular by implementing Scottish Government guidance to keep us all as safe as possible.I do understand that there will be a level of nervousness among some of you with regard to the recent transmission rates, on this basis, the Education team felt it may be helpful to share the following information with you: Mitigating measures include:• Distancing between adults and between pupils when required.A detailed list of the mitigations is published below.There has also been some confusion around testing and the dference between PCR and LFD tests. Only request a PCR test :• You are contacted by Test  ProtectLateral Flow Device Tests:• Please ensure that you log the results of your Lateral Flow Devicetest onlineyou test positive or negative, this helps give an indication of whether or not the virus is spreading. Parents who are concerned their children might have contracted Covid can complete a self-help guide on NHS Inform that will help them determinethis is the case.If you develop symptoms or you have a positive LFD test, then you must request a PCR test through the COVID Assessment Centre . To request a vaccination call:   . The COVID Assessment Centre opens at .am and closes at pm . After a positive LFD you must isolate until your PCR test confirms you are negative. If your PCR is positive there will be isolation protocols that you will have to follow the NHS Orkney team will help folk every step of the way.Unless exempt, current mitigations are:•Hygiene, Ventilation and Face Coverings • All hand and respiratory hygiene mitigations will continue to be encouraged, and an enhanced cleaning regime will continue to apply in buildings and vehicles.• Windows should continue to be opened regularly to maximise ventilation.• Face coverings will continue to be a requirement at all times for all staff and learners in secondary schools.• In primary school, all other establishments, adults will be expected to wear a face covering whenever they cannot maintain physical distance from other adults, children or young people.• In nurseries, adults will be expected to wear a face covering whenever they cannot maintain physical distance from other adults, including parents.• In primary schools, adults will also need to wear a face covering whenever they are moving around communal areas of the school, including corridors.• Only pupils aged  and over will be required to wear a face covering when travelling on dedicated school transport. Groupings and Distancing• The grouping of pupils and adults into discrete bubbles will no longer be required, but assemblies and other large gatherings will continue to be kept on hold for the time being.• There will be no requirement for children and young people to maintain physical distancing between each other, although this will continue to be encouraged in secondary schools.• The distance that adults are required to maintain from other adults, children and young people has formally been reduced to one metre, however schools will continue to encourage pupils and staff to maintain two metre distancing wherever possible. Nursery children are not required to keep a distance from adults or children in the setting.• Pupils using dedicated school transport will not be expected to maintain distancing between each other, but there will remain an expectation that drivers remain at least one metre distance from all passengers.• Parents and carers will continue to be discouraged from attending school premises except in cases where this is agreed with the school as being absolutely necessary. Vaccination, Testing and Self-Isolation• Adults and secondary pupils will be encouraged to take twice-weekly LFD tests and to record their results online.• Any adult, child or young person who develops the symptoms of COVID-, or who test positive must self-isolate immediately in line with NHS Guidance, and noty their school.• Anyone who is fully vaccinated identied by Test and Protect as a close contact of a positive case should self-isolate immediately and book a PCR Test. If the test result is negative and they remain without symptoms then they mayto school, whilst remaining vigilant.• Any young person aged between  years and  years four months, who is not yet fully vaccinated and who is identied by Test and Protect as a close contact of a positive case should self-isolate immediately and book a PCR Test. If the test result is negative and they remain without symptoms then they mayto school, whilst remaining vigilant.• Any adult aged over  years four months, who is not fully vaccinated and who is identied by Test and Protect as a close contact of a positive case should self-isolate immediately and seek a PCR test.  They should continue to self-isolate for ten days from onset of symptoms eventhe test result is negative. • Children and young people aged from five to  will no longer be subject to a blanket requirement to self-isolate for ten daysthey are identied as a close contact by Test and Protect. Instead, they should self-isolate immediately and book a PCR Test. If the test result is negative and they remain without symptoms then they mayto school, whilst remaining vigilant. Children aged under  will be exempt from this testing.• Schools and Early Learning Childcare settings will not be required to stand down classes in the event of a positive case being identied.  They will, instead, send parents and staff a #warn and inform# letter advising them of the facts and reminding them that there is no need to self-isolate unless contacted by Test and Protect and advised otherwise.• The Chief Medical Officer advises that children and young people on the highest risk list can now follow that same advice as the rest of the population.

quick world recognition of Afghanistanrsquos new rulers even as the World Health Organisation raised the alarm of an impending health care disaster in the war-wracked country.The humanitarian crisis is one of the many challenges the Taliban face since their takeover of Afghanistan last month, including renewed threats from the militant Islamic State group, which recently stepped up its attacks, targeting members of the Taliban in its stronghold in the countryrsquos east.In an emergency measure, the UN aid coordinator Martin Grfiths released  million US dollars in le-saving support for Afghanistan from the world bodyrsquos emergency fund.The World Health Organisation said Afghanistanrsquos health system is on the brink of collapse and that urgent action is needed.The statement followed a recent visit to Kabul by a WHO team led by the agencyrsquos director-general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, who also met with Taliban leaders and others.ldquoThe country faces an imminent humanitarian catastrophe, WHO said, adding that thousands of health facilities are without funding for medical supplies and salaries for health staff.ldquoMany of these facilities have now reduced operations or shut down, forcing health providers to make hard decisions on who to save and who to let die, WHO said and also emphasised ldquothe need for women to maintain access to education, health care, and to the health workforce.Felipe Diana AP\" data-title\"Afghanistan\" data--holder\"AP\" data--notice\"AP Press Association Images\" data-credit\"Felipe Dana\" data-usage-terms\"UK only\"

fighters sit on the back of a pickup truck as they stop on a hillside in Kabul, Afghanistan Felipe Diana APMr Grfiths warned that ldquoallowing Afghanistanrsquos health-care delivery system to fall apart would be disastrous.People across Afghanistan, he added, ldquowould be denied access to primary health care such as emergency Caesarian sections and trauma care.Earlier, the Taliban had written to the United Nations announcing that Suhail Shaheen, a former peace negotiator and spokesman for the Taliban political office, is their new UN representative.They requested that Mr Shaheen be allowed to address the UN General Assembly under way in New York.ldquoWe have all the requirements needed for recognition of a government.ldquoSo we hope the UN, as a neutral world body, recognise the current government of Afghanistan, Mr Shaheen said.Afghanistan is listed as the final speaker of the ministerial meeting on Monday, andno world recognition of the Taliban comes by then, Afghan ambassador Ghulam Isaczai will give the address.Mr Isaczai is currently recognised as his countryrsquos UN ambassador but the Taliban, who overran most of Afghanistan last month as the US and Nato forces were in the final stages of their chaotic withdrawal from the country, argue that they are now in charge and have the right to appoint ambassadors. vw,vw,px, px\"Afghan drivers and passengers stuck in a traffic jam look at Taliban fighters Since they swept to power and Afghan President Ashraf Ghani fled the country, the Taliban have appointed an all-male cabinet made up mostly of hardliners from when they previously ruled Afghanistan in the late s, including several people on the UN sanctions list.Among those on the so called UN ldquoblack list is Amir Khan Mutaqqi, the Taliban foreign minister and the author of the letter to the UN, requesting Mr Shaheen address the General Assembly.The decision rests with a UN committee that generally meets in November and will issue a ruling ldquoin due course, the General Assemblyrsquos spokeswoman Monica Grayley said.Meanwhile, attackers hit vehicles with Taliban fighters in eastern Afghanistan, witnesses said, killing at least two fighters and three civilians.In one attack, gunmen opened fire on a Taliban vehicle at a local gas station in the provincial capital of Jalalabad, killing two fighters, a gas station attendant and a child.A second child was killed and two Taliban fighters were wounded in a bombing of another Taliban vehicle.A third attack, also a bombing of a Taliban vehicle in Jalalabad, wounded a person nearby but it was unclearthat person was a Taliban member or a civilian.No one claimed immediate responsibility for Wednesdayrsquos attacks, although the so-called Islamic State group, which is headquartered in eastern Afghanistan, has said it was behind similar attacks in Jalalabad last week that killed eight people.The Taliban and IS are enemies, and the attacks have raised the spectre of a wider conflict between the long-time rivals.We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

We have a training session for an hour and a half, and we have games with the under-s. I play right wing, striker, or in midfield.#It is really exciting.#Beth mum#s Shona said her daughter#s passion for football began when she started primary school.#Even though she had other hobbies, it has always been football.#She had never played with girls before — she has been with boys all the way through, but we were wary that at some point the boys will get bigger and stronger and that it might have put her off or stopped her from wanting to play.#She had asked before Easter about a girls team but I thought there wasn#t anything like that about. But she did her research and that#s how we found out about this.She added: #The club is really accommodating and aware of the distance we have to travel. Initially, they said to us, just come through whenever you can.#The training is run by a PE teacher from Invergordon, and on the same night you have under-s, under-s, and under-s.“They train in Invergordon as they were previously Invergordon girls — but they came under the umbrella of Ross County around Christmas time.”Earlier this month Beth was part of the Ross County under- girls team that competed in an international youth football tournament for the Edinburgh Cup.Ross County finished top of their group with wins over more seasoned clubs # East Fe, Spartans and Hibernian.They then played Northern Irish side Linfield in the quarter-finals which ended in a - draw in normal time but County prevailed - on penalties — with Beth converting one of the spot-kicks which earned their victory.The Staggies’ adventure came to an end in the last four against a strong Irish select, but the team surpassed expectations with their performances.As well as travelling through to Invergordon to play, Beth has also been involved with the local set-up with Portree’s under-s.Youth coach Phil McCaherty said: “We#ve had Beth in our under-s set-up for a good few years now.#She is a very talented player with a high skill level and she guarantees  per cent in all that we ask her to do on a football pitch.#We are delighted to see Beth progress with Ross County and wish her well.#At present Beth is playing for County in the North Under- Rachel McLachlan League which also features Strathspey, Thistle Girls, and Brora Rangers.County#s most recent fixture against Strathspey was postponed due to Covid concerns, but the team have already made a strong start to the campaign having recorded a - victory against Brora in their opening game.Beth scored five goals in that win including an excellent strike from a free-kick.Commenting on her time so far with the club, she told the Free Press: #They are really nice, and have been very welcoming.Touching on her style as a player she said: #Whenever I have a chance for a shot on goal I#ll take it, unless someone has a better chance then I#ll pass it to them.#I like watching Erin Cuthbert at Cha, but I would like to play for Rangers and Scotland one day.#Shona added: #I don#t care which team she plays for, as long as she#s happy wherever she goes.#It is about taking part, the girls are really good fun and she#s really enjoying it.”"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/HOUSING-LACHIE-MACDONALD-1.jpg","title":"from four homes to 800 lochalsh and skye housing chief calls time after 35","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineMr MacDonald officially retired on st September having overseen the growth of the organisation from a minute quota of just four houses in Glendale to a portfolio approaching  affordable rental properties across the Lochalsh and Skye area. this week, Lachie spoke passionately about the development of the association, praised his colleagues and the board for their innovative approach, and expressed his desire to spend a lot more time with his family following his departure from the CEO position..#You know within yourself when it is time to move on and hand over the reins to fresh blood — because we always need new ideas and experiences from people to move the organisation forward.#The Lochalsh and Skye Housing Association was established on st March .

None of this is down to me, it is down to working as a team.“In that I include the board which over the years has been absolutely fantastic in supporting ideas.#If the board didn#t think that taking on a handy person project or setting up care and repair, or energy advice service was good, these things wouldn#t have happened — they have been very open about the role that the association could play as a community anchor.”He added: #Some of the things that we do I think are fantastic and have been copied where in Scotland # because the notion that we would have handyperson employees installing telecom devices in people#s homes throughout the whole of the Highlands just wouldn#t have been thought of.#I have been really lucky with the quality and flexibility of the people I have worked with # both the board and the staff members.#Commenting on his successor, he went on to say: #Neil Clapperton was until recently the chief executive of Grampian Housing Association through in Aberdeen # so it is a relief to be able to hand over to an experienced person rather than someone from another discipline to be trained up by the existing staff and board.#I think with the senior management now led by Neil and with keeping the same people such as Iain McIvor as director of investment, and our new director of finance services, Graeme Coull, and of course Angus MacLennan as our technical manager — that#s a really powerful team to take the organisation forward.#I#ll miss the people, they are absolutely splendid.#Reflecting on his time, Lachie said: #The housing system in the Highlands and Islands has never been in a better position.“My ambition was to wipe out homelessness in Skye and Lochalsh before I retired, and while I have not quite achieved that we have made huge strides towards dealing with that dficult issue.#I am quite optimistic that I am leaving the sector in a good position and ready to meet the challenges that they have ahead.#Looking ahead to retired le, Lachie said:#My three children and my grandchildren are all resident in and around Glasgow, they are all busy people but I want to spend signicantly more time with them, and also my family from Uist # I have sisters and lots of relatives over there so I#ll have a lot more time to visit them.“And I want to carry on my work as a board member with Am Fasgadh .#The only bit of advice I#ve had about retirement that someone said to me was #When you retire do nothing, and then do something’.

She died on Good Friday in  in the Sacred Heart Hospital in Daliburgh, South Uist. I was born six months later in the same hospital.I’ve always felt a special connection to her because I was named after her, although this almost didn’t happen.My motherthought she would name me ‘Fiona’. However, when our doctor, the highly regarded Dr Alasdair MacLean , asked what I was to be called and was told, he replied abruptly and conclusively declared that I was instead to be named after my grandmother. And that was that!It is a joy for me to be able to listen to my grandmother’s recordings. Her singing voice is quite similar to my mother’s, and through listening, I get a sense of the person she was..!Flòraidh was certainly hardy, like many women in those days.She gave birth to  children and my mother was the youngest of the ten that survived. She described her eleventh child as “gille mòr snog” . He was stillborn, and very little mention was made of him after his birth. until he was carried out by my grandfather who, with the other children in the family, took him to the cemetery in Baile, Eriskay.Already grateful for the opportunity to hear these recordings of my grandmother, I was truly amazed when I found recordings of her mother – my great grandmother, Mary Johnston.Although attempts had been made by family members over the years to locate these recordings of her, no one had succeeded until I happened upon them quite by accident.She was recorded in , shortly before she died, by Father Angus John MacQueen who was collaborating with John Lorne Campbell at the time and helping to build what now constitutes the ‘Canna Collection’.Mary Johnstonor ‘a Nì’ as she was known to her family, was born in Barra in  and was the daughter of Michael MacNeil of Castlebay and Anne Steele of Boisdale, South Uist.At the age of around four her mother passed away and she was taken to Uist to live with her auntie, whilst her father worked at sea..She tells how after her grandfather’s death her father was given an ultimatum:home to the family croft on Bernerayor it would be handed over to someone .Michael ed, promptly re-married, and Nì was sent back to live with him and her new stepmother..What isn’t mentioned in the recordings is that she was sent to the recently founded Orphanage for Roman Catholic Children in Bute where she trained as a cook.On herto Barra she met Ronald Johnston from Eriskay who was working in a shop in Castlebay and soon after they eloped to Glasgow. The fact that they were of a similar age to one another was considered undesirable at the time more conventionally, women tended to marry men a fair bit older than them.They had eight children together four girls and four boys – two of whom were killed in the Great War.The German aristocrat and photographer Werner Kissling took two marvellous photos of Nì during his famous filming trip to Eriskay in . The photos somehow manage to at once capture conflicting expressions of happiness, sadness, restlessness and contentment. A neat and handsome lady, she nevertheless seems considerably older than the  years she had already lived when Kissling visited.She is remembered as a kind woman who spoke often of le in Barra and the Barra Head islands, though she never set foot on any of them again after her marriage.It means a lot to me that I can listen to recordings of these two women on Tobar an Dualchais. Hearing their voices and listening to them sing songs and give descriptions of the places they lived gives me a stronger sense of who I am.are women, women’s voices are so proportionately under-represented. No one is to blame for this it is just a reflection of the time in history when so much of this material was collected.Looking at the present and to the future, I can see that there is a precious opportunity to speak with my own mother about her le, about themes more related to women, and to motherhood in particular.She herself gave birth to seven children in the s whilst working part-time as a physiotherapist. She was straddling a very traditional world while also trying meet the growing, and often conflicting, expectations of a modern professional woman.She, like so many other women of her generation, has an important story to tell and important insights to give."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG-20210918-WA0002-1.jpg","title":"glory game kinlochshiel lift shintys camanachd cup for the first","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineKeith MacRae struck a hat-trick to seal a deserved victory in front of a bumper crowd # the bulk of whom had made the journey from the west.It might have been Shiel#s first Camanachd final in  years, but their players rose to the challenge in all areas of the pitch to edge out a Lovat team who were making their fourth appearance in the sport#s showcase in six years.After a cagey opening the west-coasters seized the initiative in the th minute # MacRae lashing home on the backhand from  yards after his brother John had pounced on a shanked hit-in from Lovat#s Drew Howie.Shiel grew in confidence after the opener and it took a magnicent ing save from goalkeeper Stuart Macdonald to deny John MacRae a second before Lovat rallied towards the end of the half.And with the interval fast approaching Greg Matheson found space on the left to send a rasping finish high beyond Josh Grant, the Shiel keeper, to square the match.The Kiltarlity side pressed hard in the early stages of the second period, but Shiel#s defence stood firm.And on the hour mark they broke swtly to restore the advantage.

The idea that we can rank our children in a way that has a signicant impact on their lives at the age of  is appalling.“This new single transfer test cannot simply be ato the -plus,” he said. “It’s cruel that our children are forced to sit these tests and it has to change.”Plans would see a new company — the Schools’ Entrance Assessment Group— set up to run the test, with proposals drawn up by  current and former grammar principals.It is believed the majority of grammar schools have signed up to the proposal, which would see two tests in English and Maths, although a minority is still opposed.The deadline for schools to sign up to the plan is believed to be pm on September .“There will be a mixture of multiple choice and free response items,” the document revealed.It’s suggested there would be an administration payment by parents of £ per pupil, with pupils who can claim a Free School Meal entitlement not charged.Children’s Commissioner Koulla Yiasouma said the plan is no more than a tinkering around the edges of a system that needs a complete overhaul.“I am on record as being utterly opposed to any system that so profoundly selects our  and  year olds,” she said.“For some children these plans will reduce the number of tests they would sit, which in itself is welcome. However, it does very little to remove the deep seated inequalities that academic selection perpetuates, and could be viewed as smacking of desperation after the debacle of last year.“Our education system needs a root and branch reform, not a further sticking plaster and tinkering around the edges.”Jayne Thompson, Head of Parentkind in Northern Ireland, said there needs to be an end to the confusion faced by parents.“Clear communication for parents is needed,” she said. “Parents have repeatedly told us about their concerns for their child being prepared for the transfer tests. That is why we call on this new body to give clarity to parents.”Sinn Fein MLA Pat Sheehan has said he was concerned at the report, adding that the transfer test should be scrapped not combined.His view was echoed by the Irish National Teachers’ Organisation. “INTO remains totally opposed to academic selection by whatever means the grammar schools and their allies come up with,” said Northern Secretary Gerry Murphy..app-box.app-box h.app-box a.app-box img Download the BelfastAppGet quick and easy access to the latest Northern Ireland news, sport, business and opinion with the BelfastApp.Related topicsDepartment of EducationDaniel McCrossanPat SheehanMore On Department of Education PremiumMark BainOpinionSelection gamble: Bold strategy needs buy-in from all grammars to be a success PremiumMale teachers more likely to progress to principal rolesParents of pupils put pressure on Education Minister to act over Covid failures in schools PremiumViewpointOpinionMore men needed in the classroom PremiumCall for culture change as it’s revealed less than quarter of teachers here are maleMost ReadI gave mum Covid ...

That’s the simplest way of looking at the proposals for a single transfer test across all grammars. The plan would see the end of the dual running of tests by the AQE and the PPTC.In some respects, it’s a breaching of the religious ide, with the PPTC used mainly by Catholic grammars and the AQE by others. But it can also be looked at as a circling of the wagons to protect the future of academic selection — one of the most hotly contested debates in Northern Ireland education over the past  years. Daily Headlines Newsletter  EveningNewsletter Receive todays headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.  Enter email address   This field is required  Sign Up      The plan would see a new company, the Schools’ Entrance Assessment Group, established to run the transfer test, carrying on a tradition for the selection of pupils to post-primary schools that was started in .The proposals have been drawn up by a group of  current and former grammar principals, referred to as “the implementation and the negotiating teams.”In a week’s time, we’ll know whether all grammar schools have bought in to the concept, though the early indications are that the majority are in favour of taking matters into their own hands.The removal of the -plus in  by the Education Minister muddied the waters. It was expected to herald a new dawn in education, but instead grammar schools remained defiant and went their own separate ways, mainly along religious lines.Where there was a single test, two replaced it. And for the full range of choice, pupils were left to sit up to five test papers.The conversation happening now between grammar schools should probably have been had more than a decade ago.In April this year, the DUP — strong defenders of the right to academic selection and parental choice — accused Sinn Fein and the SDLP of trying to destroy grammar schools following a heated Assembly debate on the transfer test.While the Sinn Fein motion — featuring an SDLP amendment calling on the Education Minister to end the transfer test system — was passed  votes to , that didn’t really change things. What it did do, however, was earmark a direction of future travelthe political landscape changes in Stormont.If opinion polls are correct about the future make-up of the Assembly, change might not be too far down the road.What the proposal won’t do is change the opinion of many who believe academic selection is wrong, labels a child with failure at an early age and is a barrier to those who are socially disadvantaged.What it will do is cement the belief of grammar schools that academic selection is the best format for selection, whether that plays into the hands of anti-elitism campaigners or not.United, grammar schools will be in a much stronger position to protect what they believe in.It’s a bold move. To be successful, it will need a complete buy-in from all grammars, lest the dual transfer test system that has been struggling along these past dozen years morphs into a multiverse of confusing selection processes any Marvel movie would be proud of.Otherwise, what may have been intended as a circling of the wagons could quickly turn into Custer’s Last Stand..app-box.app-box h.app-box a.app-box img Download the BelfastAppGet quick and easy access to the latest Northern Ireland news, sport, business and opinion with the BelfastApp.Related topicsDepartment of EducationSDLPSinn FéinMore On Department of Education Premium‘Plan for new transfer test cannot be a revamp of archaic -plus’ PremiumMale teachers more likely to progress to principal rolesParents of pupils put pressure on Education Minister to act over Covid failures in schools PremiumViewpointOpinionMore men needed in the classroom PremiumCall for culture change as it’s revealed less than quarter of teachers here are maleMost ReadI gave mum Covid ...

Credit: Liam McBurney PASuzanne BreenTwitterEmailSeptember   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailThe SDLP has cancelled its annual conference next month due to the continuing high Covid- infection rates in Northern Ireland.The party said its first priority was the “health and well-being” of its members and the wider community.Some other parties are going ahead with their conferences. The Ulster Unionists will gather on October - in Belfast, and the Sinn Fein ard fheis will be held in Dublin three weeks later.The DUP and TUV have no current plans to hold a conference but haven’t ruled one out before the end of the year. Alliance is holding its annual gathering in the spring.Amidst increasing speculation about the DUP collapsing power-sharing and a January Assembly election being called, the annual conference is potentially more important to the parties now in terms of rallying their supporters and motivating their grassroots to canvass.But with over , Covid cases reported in Northern Ireland every day, and the health service under unprecedented pressure, the SDLP said it had decided to postpone its conference until next year.“We had hoped to hold our annual conference in Derry in the autumn,” a spokesman said.“But in light of the consistently high numbers of Covid- cases, and the pressure on frontline health services, the SDLP has taken the decision to delay the event until the New Year.“Our first responsibility is to the health and well-being of our members as well as exhibitors and guests who attend our conference and we take that very seriously.“We are continuing to encourage everyone to get both doses of their vaccine to help our health service cope during a dficult winter and protect all those around us.”Asked about their ard fheis plans, Sinn Fein said it would be “a mixture of people attending in person at a venue in Dublin and online” on October .Alliance said: “We are aiming to hold a conference in the spring. With the ongoing pandemic and Covid-related restrictions, we believe it would not be viable to hold an in-person event this year.”A TUV spokesman said: “We have had dficulties sourcing a venue that would be comfortable in hosting our conference in line with Covid restrictions.So we have no current plans for a party conference, but that might change.”The DUP said: “We are holding an event to mark the th anniversary of the party next week.We intend to hold a conference in coming months but will be reviewing in line with developments.”The UUP will gather on Friday fortnight with Doug Beattie due to address his first ever annual conference as leader on Saturday afternoon. The party said delegates will have to pre-register online. Along with journalists and exhibitors, they will have to provide proof of being double jabbed. Without evidence of vaccination, they will be asked to show a negative lateral flow test taken no more than  hours earlier.Iniduals could also gain entry by showing proof of natural Covid antibodies based upon a positive PCR test within  days of the conference, the UUP said.The party explained that it was asking everyone attending to take a lateral flow test and report the result two days after the conference. It said face masks will be mandatory and numbers at the conference will be “limited based on the latest Covid- regulations and guidance, and the event risk assessment.”In Britain, the parties have gone ahead with their annual conferences, although the Liberal Democrats opted for a virtual event which has just ended. Labour’s conference opens in Brighton on Saturday with the Tories annual gathering in Manchester on October -. Physical annual conferences were cancelled last year with the parties hosting virtual gatherings.There would be serious repercussions for a partytheir conference became a ‘super spreader’ event.Related topicsColum EastwoodSDLPAlliance PartySinn FéinUlster Unionist PartyTraditional Unionist VoiceDoug BeattieMore On Colum Eastwood PremiumMy friend Pat Hume played a crucial role in peace process, says Daphne Trimble PremiumTD calls for cross-border ‘John Hume University’ in north west but Department says ‘no need’ for it PremiumAlban MaginnessOpinionOmbudsman report shows why a light must stay on the past… Murder of innocent people cannot be wiped away by Troubles amnestyArdoyne murder probe: Womanremains under arrest, police confirm PremiumPoliticians echo NI public’s rejection of Government planMost ReadI gave mum Covid ...

Credit: Kevin Scott Belfast John BreslinSeptember   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailMillionaire broadcaster Stephen Nolan believes he is not a success in le because of a failure to manage his weight — and not having any children.In a candid interview, the television and radio presenter said he hated when people suggest he is a success because of his millionaire status.“I hate people suggesting I’m successful because I’m not,” the -year-old told the Sunday Times.“Being a millionaire is not a success to me. The two things I would consider successful would be to have a normal weight and children. I don’t have either.”As he ages, Nolan revealed he is more and more worried about his health. Several years ago, the presenter managed to reduce his weight from  stone to , but has since put most of it back on.“I’m a complete failure with my health. Weight has defeated me and continues to defeat me,” he said.“No matter how hard I drive myself in other things, I’m a total and absolute failure with my weight. It gets me down, it worries me. Now I’m getting older, it worries me even more. I can’t beat it. I cannot do it.” Daily Headlines Newsletter  EveningNewsletter Receive todays headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.

I don’t think people in London should just be on the BBC’s Top Ten earning list. You should be able to sit in Northern Ireland, or in any of the nations, and punch in big figures,” he said.He also revealed libel suits have been filed against two more iniduals he claims abused him online.Nolan, recently awarded large sums totalling more than £, after successful actions against two other internet “trolls”, vowed he will spend money going after people he believes are trying to destroy him.A writ has been issued in the High Court in Belfast against a Northern Ireland-based businesswoman, while the second claim will be in the High Court in Dublin against an estate agent based in the Republic of Ireland, Paul Tweed, his solicitor, told the Sunday Times.Mr Tweed also represented former First Minister Arlene Foster, who was awarded £, damages over a tweet by Christian Jessen, the presenter of Channel ’s Embarrassing Bodies“I don’t want to hurt people. I don’t want to be this rich guy going after people, but I’m as vulnerable as anyone ,” he said. “Rather than buy a new car I will spend my money going after somebody who has set out to destroy me.”He added: “I get a lot of abuse about my presentation style. That’s acceptable. I get a lot of abuse about my weight. I talk about it, so there we go.“But when someone threatens to put a bullet in your head ... I let that go for a while, then I thought, ‘No’. When there are people setting out to destroy me, and that is their sole aim ... In the past I would have turned a blind eye to that. I’m proactively going after them now.”His vow comes ahead of the second reading of a bill to update the law to bring it more into line with England, where reforms were introduced in  amid concerns London had become a libel destination for plaintfs from ious parts of the world. Nolan also made a revealing comment about the regularity of crises happening here.“For those of us who live in Northern Ireland it seems as though we’re always at a critical juncture.

The event has been organised by Concern Worldwide which has experienced a very dficult year due to the coronavirus pandemic. Covid- has restricted the activities of many voluntary groups and Concern is no exception. Mick Conway, from Concern, said: “We had to cancel last year’s walk due to the Covid restrictions. This was a big blow as the walk is our major fund raising event. Fortunately, our bookshop in Ferryquay Street has reopened and is being very well supported.” googletag.cmd.push The decision by the British Government to reduce its contribution to development aid from .% to .%. was a hammer blow to many of Concern’s programmes in the  countries in which they work. Local contributions have, therefore, gained greater signicance. Mr Conway added: “News bulletins make dficult to avoid the problems throughout the world. Afghanistan is just the latest example. Unimaginable problems quickly fade from our consciousness: earth- quakes and hurricanes in Haiti, war in Syria, religious persecution of the Rohingya in Bangladesh. “For the vast majority of people in these situations these disasters are beyond their control. In our more fortunate circumstances they are beyond our experience or imagination. With our help Concern can continue to support a wide iety of programmes helping many people throughout the world. “Concern prides itself on the efficient transfer of the money they raise to those in most need around the world. Concern has always placed huge emphasis on relieeing hunger. Hunger is an immediate problems but its long term affects have letime consequences for iniduals and whole societies. “In Chad, Niger and Bangladesh, food programmes tackle food insecurity. In Somalia, there is special emphasis in health education. Research is being funded in Sierra Leaone to improve the delivery of educaction in schools. In Kenya Concern is supporting a scheme to produce medical equipment suitable for local needs.     “Afghanistan is currently top of the news agenda. Concern has being working there for many years and continues with its work in spite of the dficulties. Donations to the current Afghanistan appeal can be made through the website: concern.org. uk or in our bookshop in Ferryquay Street. Urging support for Sundays walk, Mr Conway said: “You can make your own contribution by supporting our walk on September . The walk begins at the foot of Scalp Mountain above Burnfoot. Signposts will direct those taking part. Starting times are from . noon to .pm. Car parking is available. “Given the nature, of the event there should be minimum risk of Covid-. There is a good road to the summit and although steep the walk should take no more than an hour-and-a-half. There are spectacular views of Derry and Donegal all the way . “There is no guarantee as to the weather so suitable clothing is advised. Family groups are very welcome. There will be a voluntary collection of donations.”ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"--ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\".detachTo.detachTo   --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare  sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Emmette Dillon.Sadness as body of missing Derry man Emmette Dillon recovered overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Broken glass placed across County Derry road was ‘extremely dangerous’ overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry Death Notices - Wednesday, nd September,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Patrick OKane pictured inside his shop on New Row, Coleraine.Young butcher keeping the tradition going on County Derry street overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Plans to develop the Fort George site are set to get the green light.Green light for Derrys Fort George site overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Tributes paid to well-known County Derry car dealer overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Lyra McKee shot dead in Derry in April .Two men arrested in Derry in Lyra McKee murder probe overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Fteen men in court charged with taking part in illegal Derry parades overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Police seize drugs worth pound, in County Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Cllrs Adrian McQuillan, Cara McShane and William Duddy.

She co-founded successful online learning company Learning Pool in Derry in . Today, she works extensively with start-ups and scaling tech companies. She is one of the co-founders of cross-border social enterprise and female founder community AwakenHub and she is part of the EU’s flagship EIC Accelerator innovation team. googletag.cmd.push -------------------------------------------- A few weeks ago Digital DNA’s Simon Bailie asked me to write a short piece about Derry for DDNA’s Top Tech Companies in NIreport. Simon asked me to cover the Derry tech scene – how it’s altered in the almost  years I’ve been working in the city and perhaps more importantly, what the missing ingredients are that would make the Maiden City’s tech scene really sing. I enjoyed writing it and was surprised to find that no-one  has written about this. Here’s what I had to say in full. How much has the Derry tech scene changed  I began working in Derry in . I moved from Belfast where I’d been global CFO in one of QUB’s semiconductor IP spinouts.I’d spent a good bit of my time in the early noughties in Silicon Valley and Derry in  couldn’t have been further from San Jose. The only similarity was that the streets were completely deserted by .pm. When I told my friends in Belfast that I was taking a job in Derry they all tried to talk me out of it. I remember trying to recruit a team in  and talent was very thin on the ground. Most of the local workforce were lers in one of the FDIs or they commuted to tech jobs in either Belfast or Letterkenny.     The local tech scene back then was dominated by the prominent FDIs Seagate  Allstate , big fish Singularityand a never-ending raft of call centres and it was populated by revered avuncular middle-aged men like Bro McFerran and Dr Alan McClure. Anyone calling the HP or Expedia customer help lines back in the day would’ve been greeted by a Derry accent, way before it was trendy. We started Learning Pool in London in  and quickly moved the company to Derry because it was bootstrap-affordable and because of the ready talent graduating from Magee. We couldn’t afford to hire an experienced team so we recruited new graduates with the right attitude and trained them. We didn’t have an office so we took a few desks in theshockingly haphazard co-working space at the university. Even though the space was supposed to be reserved for new startups, a few companies had been renting in there forever so we ended up with desks dotted here and there in random parts of the floor. No-one in our team could sit together and the co-working space manager constantly shushed us whenever we took phone calls and harped on forever about the washing-up. We had a desktop PC in the corner with a paper notice sellotaped to the top of it which read DO NOT SWITCH OFF  Today there’s a stable of promising scaling tech companies choosing to base themselves in Derry. Established companies likeElemental Software  Newer entrants like medtech company Respiratory Analytics, cyber security companyITUSand caretech challenger startupInCharge. Many companies keep one foot in Derry and the other in Donegal, thus preserving their EU status for access to customers and funding. Catalyst Incopened its doors in  on the historic Fort George site just outside the city and has been a great formal addition to the fabric of the local ecosystem. Other active startup supports likeStartacusand new island of Ireland female founder community AwakenHubare anchored in Derry. Today, the local tech scene is younger, more female, less formal, more global, well educated and informed and definitely ambitious. A lot of newer founders have lived away from Ireland for a while but are electing tohome and settle down, build a business. Catalyst’s Co-Founders programme has uncovered some interesting nascent companies. Some of those new graduates that I recruited back in  or  have gone on to found their own startups. That’s how ecosystems work. The FDIs are still present but they’re less dominant today. They don’t have a lot of employee churn and just tick along in the background, largely behind closed doors. They bring employment to an area of Northern Ireland that badly needs it and they sponsor the odd event and programme. Many of the call centres seem to have been bought over and have disappeared. Innovation and all the interesting stuff happens in the smaller, agile companies around the edges and this is what we need more of. As well as the FDIs we now have the presence of indigenous scaleups like Kainosand FinTru. It would be great to see a few more like these moving in but high quality office space is an issue. Maybe not so important in the future we’re facing post-COVID. The traditional talent pool has extended from the Bann well into Donegal and in Derry I’ve worked beside people who’ve commuted daily from as far afield as Ballycastle and Creeslough. Missing Ingredients If it was Christmas morning and I could have three wishes to improve the tech sector ecosystem in the North West this is what I would wish for: - An ambitious cross-border university named after the late John Hume with campuses in both Derry and Donegaland strong links into the powerful North West diaspora that stretches from Philadelphia to London to Singapore. I’m always impressed by the vibrant startup scene that exists in Letterkenny as a result of the numerous overseas students and researchers who come to LYIT for academic reasons and end up staying. This new university to be fastened at the hip to a well funded and well resourced startup, student and alumni accelerator regime like Oxford University has withOxford Foundrywhich in turn connects firmly into sources of venture finance, a bit likeEDEMin the marina in Valencia - A Derry-Letterkenny- Sligo-Galway Economic Corridor along the Wild Atlantic Way to mirror the Belfast-Dublin corridor that was formally announced in the east of the island last month. This to connect the opportunities that will naturally flow from the new Magee Medical School to the vibrant medtech cluster of companies and investors in Galway and to link in with the newly reinvigorated Western Development Commissionand the string of Atlantic hubs the Irish State has invested in over recent years. I am encouraged by news of a new cross-border scaling hub led by Catalyst Inc  LYIT which will be built in the image of thePortershedGalway model - A focus placed on determining how Derry and indeed all of Northern Ireland can tangibly and quickly benefit from being so close to an EU border in the post-Brexit world. Can Derry compete with Belfast  This was a provocative question posed by Simon in his brief to me. In my view, this is not the right question and shouldn’t be part of anyone’s ambition. Any venture starting out in the new world should instead think about opportunities presented as a result of global changes that the past  months have fast tracked. It’s now genuinely possible to be a global company from Day  and utilise talent from any part of the globe. Barriers no longer exist. Cities and regions need to start thinking this way too. To ask Derry to compete only with Belfast would not be setting a big enough challenge. So, in conclusion,you’re looking for a friendly and affordable university city to start your tech business, where it’s possible to be in both the UK and the EU, an hour from London by air, where   of the population is aged - and is well educated, where government startup funding is readily available, close to some of Europe’s finest beaches, with top class local state schools and a long history and culture … then maybe you should take a look at Derry. And my final call to action, on  April  Jayne Brady started in a brand new post at Belfast City Council as Belfast’s Digital Innovation Commissioner. An engineer and former Venture Capital Partner, in the  months since Jayne started she’s made a massive dference and she represents Belfast at the digital and innovation negotiating tables in both Westminster and Dublin. In truth, although she works for Belfast City Council she does her very best to represent all of Northern Ireland. Isn’t it time we appointed a Digital Innovation Commissioner to do the same and really own this agenda for the NW region of Ireland and its citizens, present and future ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"--ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\".detachTo.detachTo   --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare  sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Emmette Dillon.Sadness as body of missing Derry man Emmette Dillon recovered overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Broken glass placed across County Derry road was ‘extremely dangerous’ overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry Death Notices - Wednesday, nd September,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Patrick OKane pictured inside his shop on New Row, Coleraine.Young butcher keeping the tradition going on County Derry street overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Plans to develop the Fort George site are set to get the green light.Green light for Derrys Fort George site overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Tributes paid to well-known County Derry car dealer overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Lyra McKee shot dead in Derry in April .Two men arrested in Derry in Lyra McKee murder probe overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Fteen men in court charged with taking part in illegal Derry parades overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Police seize drugs worth pound, in County Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Cllrs Adrian McQuillan, Cara McShane and William Duddy.

Mickey attended St Columbs College, as did many from the south Derry area in those days.Like his siblings, he had a keen interest in all things GAA but his playing career was cut short following a serious motorcycle accident at the age of  years leaving him in a coma for six weeks. On his recovery, he worked as a shop man in Ballinascreen and later in Dunloy so was well known to many in those areas. Mickey and his we Nan later ran the shop in Moydamlaght, Moneyneana.After a number of years living in Magherafelt, to facilitate work in Enkalon in Antrim, Mickey ed to his beloved we Nans roots in Tamnaherin where they continued to raise their family. At his funeral, Fr McDermott noted that the gospel message of modesty was very apt with how much pride and love he had for his family.He was the loving father of Marie, Brian, Martin and Carmel, father-in-law of Fiona and Bronagh, the much loved grandfather of Lorcan, Darragh, Conor, Kian and Shea, son of the late Thomas and Mary and dear brother of Patsy, Margaretand the late Tommy and John.Mickeys other love of GAA continued throughout his long le and he travelled the country to watch Ballinascreen, Slaughtmanus and his beloved Doire, often accompanied by family and friends. On hearing of his passing, a friend said Mickey was a wonderful character. A true Gael. He never forgot his Ballinascreen roots. We will all miss him.Like all Derry Gaels, his best memory was the countys  All-Ireland triumph.Slaughtmanus paid tribute to him saying Mickey was a letime member and stalwart supporter of the Slaughtmanus GAC club, he was very knowledgeable about all things Gaelic football. He would always stop to talk to any fellow Gael about weekly results and news from teams and clubs around the countyMickey is my wes uncle and I can vividly remember our first conversation, a Sunday evening call to check the days results, performances and talking points. It didnt take long to realise he had a photographic memory. No detail was ever missed.“What Mickey didnt know was not worth knowing. a great and interesting conversationalist,” commented local GAA writer Bernie Mullan to me.In his later years Mickey worked in the car parks in Derry City, a role that allowed him to chat to many people, often leading to a few queues at the exit.When Derry released a yearbook in the mid-eighties Mickey penned an article on his memory of attending the final in Dublin, entitled: ...and they even came from Tobermore. The detailed account of before and during the match captured the emotions of the day with even a horse and cart forming part of the journey. googletag.cmd.push An clipping of an article written by Mickey about the  All-Ireland Final.Coming out of Owenbeg on Sunday night, Ballinderry stalwart Pat McGuckin spoke of Mickeys memory and knowledge for GAA, informing me of how he could recite – by heart – the dates of birth of Derrys  team who reached the All-Ireland final.Mickeys self built garden sheds were a treasure trove of newspaper clippings, photos and video tapes of matches, encapsulating his love and passion of all things GAA.Mickey also had a love of gardening with the family home always in pristine condition, with lawns and hedges manicured to the last detail.His gardening skills were well utilised during his time working with Martin Dolan laying lawns and gardens on many new housing developments in the Eglinton area where his legacy will live on.His family will miss him dearly, but the memories and esteem in which he was held is a hand of comfort.A gentleman. A le well-lived, who is now, as Fr McDermott pointed out, walking through the garden of heaven.ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"--ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\".detachTo.detachTo   --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare  sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Emmette Dillon.Sadness as body of missing Derry man Emmette Dillon recovered overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Broken glass placed across County Derry road was ‘extremely dangerous’ overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry Death Notices - Wednesday, nd September,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Patrick OKane pictured inside his shop on New Row, Coleraine.Young butcher keeping the tradition going on County Derry street overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Plans to develop the Fort George site are set to get the green light.Green light for Derrys Fort George site overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Tributes paid to well-known County Derry car dealer overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Lyra McKee shot dead in Derry in April .Two men arrested in Derry in Lyra McKee murder probe overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Fteen men in court charged with taking part in illegal Derry parades overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Police seize drugs worth pound, in County Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Cllrs Adrian McQuillan, Cara McShane and William Duddy.

The financial support is helping firms across the nation to adapt, innovate and protect jobs. Here are two examples of how companies have been helped, and what support is available. googletag.cmd.push NORTHERN IRELAND IN NUMBERS , jobs furloughed through the Coronavirus Jobs Retention Scheme up to May  , claims amounting to pound million through the Self- Employment Income Support Scheme up to May  Across the whole UK  per cent of those eligible for SEISS made a claim. The average value of a claim is pound, Source: Her Majesty’s Treasury CASE STUDY  SHNUGGLE  Planning, forward-thinking and invaluable help from the UK Government has enabled a Northern Ireland firm to ersy and remain solvent. When Covid- struck, Newtownards baby product manufacturer Shnuggle’s owners Sinead and Adam Murphy were prepared thanks to advice from their export colleagues in China. Sinead said: “We reduced our out-goings, put on pause our marketing spend in the business. We just tried to protect the cash that we had. “The first impact was our customers that we sell to in Asia. They all went into lockdown so our orders and sales to them stopped. But also a lot of our production happens out in Asia so our factories went into lockdown. “Luckily we had bought a lot of stock beforehand. We were so relieved that we had, at least we could carry on trading with our UK and European customers.” With around half of the company’s sales in the UK and Ireland and half in the export business, Shnuggle had to rely on their local retail-base. Sinead continued: “Baby items were classed as essential goods which was a huge relief to us. This meant as long as we could socially distance within the warehouse we could continue trading and selling online. All of our business is supplying other retailers like John Lewis, Mamas and Papas, Amazon. But our online sales actually grew because everyone was at home and maybe an element of panic buying.”      CASH HELP: The Shnuggle team Shnuggle took advantage of the furlough and Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Schemeschemes. Sinead said: “We furloughed five out of our  team, and were able to access the Business Interruption loan through Ulster Bank. “We were relieved to get the money in quickly, so we weren’t worrying about paying wages or our biggest overhead was our suppliers in China who were calling in all of their debts. “That was our biggest headache and stress, we owed signicant amounts of money to them and we didn’t have the cash as we needed time to sell our products.” Shnuggle also received a pound, Small Business Grant. Adam said: “Furloughing was brilliant, and the CBILS was the one that was the best for us because it meant that we could keep all our suppliers happy. “So even though we had a temporary dip in our sales, and obviously the inventory was sitting there ready to sell, it just kept us solvent and the cash flow moving. It’s really going to help us trade out of it, andall goes well, we should be able to get back into a reasonably strong cash position within the next six to  months. The loans coming in helped us to sleep at night.” The Government schemes also gave Sinead and Adam the freedom to ersy into the PPE market and the development of HeroShield Ltd, enabling local firms to unite to develop a protective face covering for key workers. This non-profit company designs, produces and distributes reusable visors.   ‘It’s surprisingly easy and money arrives quickly’ CASE STUDY  Q-MASS An unprecedented package of UK Government financial support has helped firms like Q-Mass in East Kilbride weather the coronavirus crisis. Director Ronnie Robertson said lockdown hit his company’s order book, but the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme has been vital to help them hang on to their valued staff. Ronnie said: “Before this, we had quite a good order book, with three to four months of work planned, so we were pretty worried where it was going to take us.” At first, he was worried how he would keep Q-Mass’  staff on the payroll, but then the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme was announced. It offers UK Government support to pay  per cent of staff’s wages up to pound, a month, and the scheme has now been extended until the end of October. Q-Mass manufactures bespoke parts for the oil, gas and defence industry so staff training is important. Ronnie said: “Our staff are very highly skilled. We’ve gathered a bunch of people here and trained them up and taken on apprentices. We do a lot of training, we’ve got good people, we train them a lot and we want to hang on to them.” He found applying for the furlough scheme quick and straightforward. He said: “It was surprisingly easy and we were surprised that the money came through relatively quickly.” Now staff at the firm who’ve been furloughed are gradually ing to work, with strict safety measures in place. Ronnie said: “We’ve put a day sht back on and we’ve still got a few office people working at home, with quite a few still on furlough.  ‘SURPRISINGLY EASY’: Q-Mass director Ronnie Robertson praises the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme “We’re just ticking over. We’re trying to cover our costs every month, trying to break even, to stay still. We’re looking at it thatwe can stay still we’re doing very well.” And because of the size of the building, maintaining a two-metre distance hasn’t been a problem for ing staff. Ronnie said: “It’s been really easy. We’ve got a big workshop with wide corridors and we’ve got a lot of the doors propped open internally so no-one has to touch doors or handles. We’ve got a few toilet areas with restrictions on them and a couple of one-way corridors, but the offices are open plan, so there’s no real need for people to be near each other. The workshop’s a big, wide-open space and we have to keep cleaning things like photocopiers and touch screens, but it’s been quite straightforward.” Now Ronnie’s looking forward to a brighter future. He said: “I feel like we’re on the side of the valley and we’re looking across to the other side and it looks absolutely fantastic.” Money for business and staff Here are some examples of the support available for businesses and workers. middot The Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme has enabled businesses to put employees on a period of temporary leaveand apply for a UK Government grant to cover  per cent of those workers’ usual monthly wage costs, up to pound, a month. middot The Self-Employment Income Support Scheme will allow eligible self-employed iniduals to claim a taxable grant of  per cent of their average monthly profits, up to pound,. middot UK VAT-registered firms have been given the option to defer VAT payments until the end of June.

Cllr Heaney, who represents the Foyleside ward, hailed the decision as “an important move” in helping motorists to transition from traditional fossil fuels – such as petrol and diesel – towards electric power. googletag.cmd.push The Parking Strategy for Derry City and Strabane District identied the need to review the current electric charging infrastructure and quanty the council’s future needs as one of its proposed strategic options. It is hoped that by changing the electric vehicle charging infrastructure in its off-street car-parks, the council is removing any potential barrier to visit and stay in the city Cllr Heaney said: “At the council meeting, we agreed to explore further the possibility of getting new and improved electric charging points for electric motor vehicles into all council car-parks throughout our city and district. “It is an important move as the council plays its part in tackling the climate crisis as we encourage and incentivise as many motorists as possible to move away from fossil-fuelled cars and into electric cars. We want to see this progressing soon. “I was delighted to support this proposal at the council’s Business and Culture committee. Recent figures have revealed that only . per cent of electric vehicles in the north are owned by residents of our council area. “The lack of modern and efficient electric vehicle charging points within our council boundaries is clearly a factor influencing this low figure.     “Council officers have now been tasked with scoping out how charging points can be installed in all council car parks which will massively increase the charging infrastructure, encourage the purchase of more electric vehicles and further decrease the carbon footprint within our city and district.” ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"--ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\".detachTo.detachTo   --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare  sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Emmette Dillon.Sadness as body of missing Derry man Emmette Dillon recovered overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Broken glass placed across County Derry road was ‘extremely dangerous’ overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry Death Notices - Wednesday, nd September,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Patrick OKane pictured inside his shop on New Row, Coleraine.Young butcher keeping the tradition going on County Derry street overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Plans to develop the Fort George site are set to get the green light.Green light for Derrys Fort George site overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Tributes paid to well-known County Derry car dealer overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Lyra McKee shot dead in Derry in April .Two men arrested in Derry in Lyra McKee murder probe overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Fteen men in court charged with taking part in illegal Derry parades overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Police seize drugs worth pound, in County Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Cllrs Adrian McQuillan, Cara McShane and William Duddy.

At booking, those interested in attending must indicate whether they wish to make a representation to the Assistant Commissioner and provide an approximate preferable time slot. The Commissioner’s team will try and accommodate each request as best as possible, and the agreed running order will be announced at the beginning of each hearing.     If anyone requires simultaneous sign language interpretation, translation or interpretation in another language, these requests must be submitted to the Commissioner’s office no later than one week in advance of the relevant event, either online on the booking form or via email to:info@lgbc-ni.org.uk.

Figures published by DfC Minister Deirdre Hargey have outlined the current figures across NIs  constituencies. Of the Norths , applicants for Housing Executive properties, ,are based in the countys three parliamentary constituencies Mid Ulster, East Derry and Foyle. googletag.cmd.push County Derry is also home to , applicants who are deemed to be in housing stress where the cost of housing is high relative to household income. The figure represents % of the total figure for NI.   The constituency of Foyle has the highest number of housing applicants in all  areas, with ,, and also tops the list of those in housing stress with a figure of ,. Foyles figure alone makes up % of all housing applicants and % of those in housing stress. MLA for the area, Mark H Durkan, said the figures confirmed Northern Ireland was in the midst of a housing crisis. “The North is in the midst of a housing crisis, it has been clear for some time and these latest figures on social housing need only reinforce it,” he said. “My constituency office regularly hears from people who feel trapped in a cycle of homelessness they can never get free from. “It is staggering that in the Foyle constituency alone there are nearing five thousand applications for social housing.”   East Derry ranks sixth overall for total applicantsand th for those people in housing stress .     Causeway Coast and Glens councillor, Sean Bateson, said his party were engaging with the Housing Executive to highlight the areas needs. “Housing is a key priority for Sinn Feacutein and I am committed to ensuring housing provision locally,” he said. “We have been lobbying for some time now to have demand tests carried out in the local area I represent. “I welcome the Housing Executive plans to do these tests throughout Autumn of this year in Kilrea, Ballerin, Glenullin and Aghadowey. “These tests will help to identy the housing need especially in rural areas and will go some way to helping to deliver more social and affordable homes.” East Derry has experienced a rise in house prices over the last year and a half, something that has worsened the crisis in the area. Local MLA Claire Sugden said pressure needed to be exerted on landlords owning multiple properties. “Owners of multiple properties need to be incentivised to rent their houses out so that locals can find a place to live in their area,” she said. “With the demand for Housing Executive properties being as high as it is, this needs to happen as soon as possible. “A comprehensive housing strategy needs to be rolled out and implemented as a matter of priority and developers need to be supported in creating new houses.” The more rural constituency of Mid Ulster has the least amount of people on the applicant listand in housing stress . Sitting MLA for the area, Patsy McGlone, criticised current minister, Sinn Feacuteins Deirdre Hargey, for her handling of the housing crisis. “It is shocking to realise that in the last  years there was only one new social housing bungalow completed in Mid Ulster,” he said. “The rise in the number of applicants in Mid Ulster waiting for a home since  shows the Sinn Feacutein Minister has not been taking the housing crisis seriously despite the huge need for social housing. “There can be no more excuses, we need strategic action to address our housing crisis now.”  Durkan: Hargeys atrocious housing waiting lists failing Derrys public     GUEST COLUMN: Council can stand up for people of Mid Ulster region  A local planner accuses the Department of a Belfast First approach.

The search unearthed eight men and women who have become familiar faces on Boost Drinks social media channels as well as at numerous Boost events. “The stories that our final eight men and women shared with us outlined how they juggle their multiple passions, jobs, education and homele to inspire others to live their lives to the full. They’re all from dferent places, have dferent backgrounds and ages but they have one thing in common, they’re living their lives to the full. Boost Drinks is very proud to be working with these talented, committed and passionate people, she added. Edel, who has an Instagram page called Mumlewith, is a beautician and is training to become a nurse at Ulster University - Magee Campus. Just one of those things would be enough to keep most of us busy but she’s also a mum to six children, a we to joiner husband, Shane, and they have a Golden Retriever called Lucky.     Edelsaid le was pretty full on at home. Getting six kids washed, fed and dressed every morning teaches you the importance of a routine, she said. When I saw that Boost were looking for people with passions and a side hustle, I just knew I had to get involved. Marrying my two passions, photography and family, allowed me to share some snaps and people really responded to their honesty. Today I’ve got a really engaged community online and being part of the Boost Society allows me to share my le experiences with my followers to inspire them and show that you can pursue your passions despite what le throws at you.”  County Derry school girl stars in new film  Summerland is out in cinemas now.

Sinn Feacutein Benbradagh councillor Dermot Nicholl hit out at Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Council officials for allowing the report to come forward without a budget for an international air show planned in Portrush and Portstewart in . googletag.cmd.push A proposal to finalise the dates of the air show as September  and  next year, as well as confirm the location of the sight line came before the Leisure and Development Committee this evening. Cllr Nicholl also citicised the content of previous air shows, saying constituents who attended had claimed it was a military fest. I know people who have been at previous events and been very disappointed, he said. They would come out and say it was nearly like a military fest, rubbing your nose in it, and very uncomfortable. This was from both sides of the community, I might add. I dont see why people in our council area should be stumping up for something like this. There are groups out there looking for a few pound and we cant give them it. When are people going to wise up in this council  There are better ways of spending money. Im disappointed at the director letting that come to us tonight with the budget not confirmed. Mayor Richard Holmes also questioned the lack of specied budget in the report and raised concerns over road closures around the event.     Without a rant, I was going to ask roughly what sort of money we were budgeting for this  Do we have to actually close off the road for the event itself  There may be some costs around that, he said. Council officer Richard Baker said any budget included in the report would have been pure speculation and that there would be road restrictions in place rather than closures. There is a council decision here and the two fundamental points are the location, format and date of the event. We will build everything  around that, he said. If I had brought you a budget prior to tonight, it would have been pure speculation. Coleraine councillor Norman Hillis also had some concerns around the change in venue for the event from previous air shows, and askedit would be detrimental to the economic benefit seen by the area. In the past, the event was in Portrush, and we had the fireworks in the evening in Portstewart, so everyone was gaining, he said. We want everybody to benefit from all our events, but given the fact the event is in the middle of the area between Portrush and Portstewart, will there be a downturn for the coastal towns  Limavady councillor Aaron Callan, who has been involved in planning the event, said it was an exciting opportunity for the area. The new sight line will give a more impressive show and give spectators a better viewing point to observe the show, he told the Committee. Being close to the displays gives that wow factor that people want, and I think this does that. In due course, we will see more information as the working group develops this further. This is a positive for the area given the economic impact this has had in the past. It will benefit the whole Borough, not just the Ports, as it will attract people into Causeway Coast and Glens. The previous air show held in the area was run at a cost of pound,, and a report by Sheffield Hallam University in  reported a figure of pound. million of external money coming into the Borough as a result.

The figures, which were revealed via Assembly Question from the Department for Communities showed there to be  applicants in Foyle on the waiting list with another  experiencing housing stress. googletag.cmd.push That represents an increase of  during the course of the Covid pandemic . Across the north of Ireland, , applicants were still waiting for new accommodation as of June . Mr Durkan, who is the SDLPs Social Justice Spokesperson as well as an MLA for Foyle, said that action was needed now to get people into homes. He said: “These figures are startling but somewhat expected given the economic consequences of the pandemic resulting in more and more people experiencing housing stress. “It is staggering that in the Foyle constituency alone there are nearing five thousand applications for social housing. “The housing crisis pre-existed Covid although it’s clear that the crisis has deepened signicantly in the interim, as evidenced by the  per cent increase in applications in just  months. “It’s important to take stock of the lives behind these statistics to consider that behind each application are iniduals, families and many children waiting in anguish. The time for robust and honest conversations about tackling housing shortages has long past. “It is unforgivable that Foyle consistently top of the leagues it wants to be the bottom of and vice versa.     “Housing is an historic issue in Derry and it remains the case that so many families and their children are left without a place to call home or find themselves stuck in overcrowded properties, wholly unsuitable to their needs. “Housing is yet another example of the deprivation people in Derry have had to endure and while I welcome the incoming Housing Supply Strategy addressing housing need goes far beyond just building homes. “Regulation of the Private Sector under the Private Tenancies Bill again is welcome however affordability issues which have become more profound in recent months must be tackled to prevent homelessness in the time ahead. “Urgent action must be taken before more and more iniduals end up on the streets.” ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"--ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\".detachTo.detachTo   --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare  sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Emmette Dillon.Sadness as body of missing Derry man Emmette Dillon recovered overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Broken glass placed across County Derry road was ‘extremely dangerous’ overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry Death Notices - Wednesday, nd September,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Patrick OKane pictured inside his shop on New Row, Coleraine.Young butcher keeping the tradition going on County Derry street overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Plans to develop the Fort George site are set to get the green light.Green light for Derrys Fort George site overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Tributes paid to well-known County Derry car dealer overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Lyra McKee shot dead in Derry in April .Two men arrested in Derry in Lyra McKee murder probe overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Fteen men in court charged with taking part in illegal Derry parades overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Police seize drugs worth pound, in County Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Cllrs Adrian McQuillan, Cara McShane and William Duddy.

Opel’s ground-breaking powertrain technology and architecture means that the low, flat battery gives the Vio-e a stable centre of gravity and maximum cabin space. Designed from the ground up with both diesel and electric powertrains in mind, the Vio-e is based heavily on the Opel Corsa-e and its driveline fits comfortably between the chassis rails of the new Vio-e.     Power comes from a kW motor producing Nm of torque for smooth, swt and linear acceleration. The kWh battery is made up of  modules consisting of  inidual cells, while the larger kWh battery has  cells split over  modules.Cooling for the batteries comes from the van’s own in-cab cooling system, which Opel says helps to increase their range and letime. All Vio-e models come with three driving modes and switchable regenerative braking as standard.The standard on-board charger is a .kW single phase unit, while DC charging of up to kW is also supported.Trim and Body Options         Trim levels in the new Vio-e  van consist of Edition and Sportive models, both of which come with standard features such as driver and passenger airbags, electric parking brake, cruise control, full size spare wheel, .” colour dashboard display, remote central deadlocking, two side loading doors, electric front windows, electrically adjustable and heated door mirrors, -speaker audio with a USB inlet, Bluetooth, steering-column remote audio controls, and a DAB radio.Top-spec Sportive trim brings with it air-conditioning, ” colour touchscreen with smartphone projection, body coloured bumpers , LED daytime running lights, front fog lights, rear parking sensors, automatic lights and wipers, electrically folding door mirrors, acoustic windscreen and full-size wheel covers.Available with two body s and two roof heights, the Vio-e is just as flexible as a diesel van with a load volume of up to .m. Because the batteries are between the chassis rails, the total capacity of the load space is completely unchanged, allowing ,mm s in the L model and up to ,mm in the L when using the load-through bulkhead.Otherwise, the standard maximumcapacity of the van is ,mm for the L and ,mm for the L.Payloads are equally impressive, as replacing the engine and transmission with batteries and a motor doesn’t signicantly harm it’s capacities.All Vio-e vans have a gross vehicle weightof .-tonne, and depending on spec you can get a maximum ,kg payload out of a L standard roof height van with the kWh battery.Specying the larger kWh unit brings that figure down to ,kg.Those figures are just kg less than a diesel-engine Vio — a far cry from the disadvantage that battery electric vehicles used to have when compared to diesel-powered vans in the past.Test VanMy test van was a new Vio-e SportivekWh finished in stylish Moonstone Grey metallic paint. The three-seater Vio-e has storage under the passenger bench, while the driver’s seat comes with an adjustable armrest and -way seat adjustment. Being an electric van where the full amount of torque is available from just rpm all the way up to ,rpm, it is exceptionally quick off the mark.Unladen, the Vio-e accelerates with impressive urgency, and I have no doubt it would still prove fast even with a full payload on board.The top speed is limited to km h in order to preserve the battery range, but this is something that should not be of any concern to Vio-e drivers, as the van is more than capable of overtaking slower moving traffic with great ease.The regenerative braking system in the Vio-e is selected by pressing the ‘B mode’ button beside the gear selector, and this applies enough braking to activate the brake lights and slow the vehicle down before the driver presses the brake pedal.I loved the fact that the Vio-e is very car-like to drive, and the selectable Eco, Normal and Power driving modes ensure that there is a mode to suit every type of driver and every type of load. The Vio-e remains composed and comfortable when driven over rutted road surfaces, while body lean through bends is very well controlled.The Vio-e pulls away in silence, with just a hum from the on-board sound generator that is designed to warn others of your presence at low speeds, with just minimal levels of tyre and wind noise noticeable at higher speeds.Charging TimesCharging the Vio-efrom a domestic socket can take up to  hours, but this drops dramatically to . hours when charged from a .KW wall box charger .However, DC rapid charging from a kW sourcetakes just half an hour for the kWh battery and  minutes for the kWh version.Verdict  PricingOverall, the new Opel Vio-e is a genuinely impressive van to drive, easy to live with on a daily basis, offers fast-charging options and it is a good looking van too.In my opinion, this is the class-leading  van in the all-electric light commercial vehiclemarket right now, and deservedly so too.

The Formentor’s design inside and out is something quite dferent to what we have seen before, and brings with it a new dimension in style and sophistication. Being part of the Volkswagen Group means that Cupra has access to cutting-edge mechanicals and technology, and this has enabled the new Formentor compact SUV to hit the ground running, so to speak.  googletag.cmd.push   There is a lot of money and confidence behind the Cupra brand, and that is evident in the bold product plan promised by the company.Engine  Trim OptionsThe Formentor sits on the familiar MQB set of chassis components that also underpins other crossovers such as the Seat Ateca and VW Tiguan. Petrol engine options in the Formentor consist of a .-litre TSI with bhp and a .-litre TSI unit with a choice of ,  or bhp. The . TSI engine is available as a -speed manual or -speed DSG , while the . TSI comes with a DSG transmission as standard, with Cupra’s Drivesystem standard in bhp guise. A . TDIEVO engine is available with bhp and can be mated to a -speed manual or -speed DSG transmission, with the latter coming with Drive as standard.     Additionally, a .-litre e-Hybrid powertrain is available with a choice of bhp or bhp, both of which are mated to a -speed DSG transmission with promised fuel consumption as low as .l km on a combined WLTP driving cycle.There is a choice of two trim levels in CUPRA’s new compact SUV — Formentor and Formentor VZ — with the latter being the Cupra Formentor’s most powerful trim, named in reference to the Spanish word ‘Veloz’, meaning ‘fast’.The Formentor VZ trim offers high-performance powertrain options. Coming with ” alloy wheels, a ” Navigation system, autonomous assistance technology and performance bucket seats as standard.         Test CarMy test car was a Cupra Formentor . TSiDSGwhich was finished in stylish Graphene Grey Premium metallic paint with optional ” Exclusive Aero Black and Copper alloy wheels for an added dose of visual drama. Producing bhp and Nm of torque, the ,cc engine propels the Formentor from a standing start to km h in just .-seconds, on its way to a top speed of km h .Key standard features include full LED headlamps and Daytime Running Lights, rear ‘coast to coast’ light with welcome ceremony, front fog lamps with cornering , heat-insulated and tinted rear windows, leather-wrapped multi- heated sports steering wheel, dark aluminium glossy interior package, textile sport seats, keyless unlocking and ignition system, .” Digital Cockpit, ” Media System with DAB radio, Connect Online infotainment , rain and light sensor, heated front seats, adaptive cruise control, park assist, rear view camera, Drive Profile Selection, and auto high-beam assist, along with a suite of advanced safety systems.Optional extras fitted to my test car included premium metallic paint, black leather bucket seats, ” alloy wheels, hands-free electric tailgate, Dynamic Chassis Control, and Safe  Drive “L” . The sweet-revving petrol engine in my test car produces bhp and Nm of torque, enabling the car to sprint from -km h in .-seconds, with claimed fuel consumption as low as .-l km .As in other VW Group models, the .-litre engine is commendably quick to drop onto two cylinders to save fuel when cruising, and the process of cutting out and back in again is hard to detect. Composed and predictable handling is admirable, as is the Formentor’s ability to soak up road imperfections with ease.Impressive Sporty InteriorTake a seat behind the wheel of the CUPRA Formentor and you could be forgiven for thinking that you are in a hatchback rather than a compact SUV. The seating position is low, as is the base of the windscreen, so you feel like you sit much closer to the road — as you would in a performance-focused car.Selectable driving modes in the Formentor consist of Comfort, Sport, Cupra and Inidual, with each mode bringing a greater degree of aggression and engine noise that gets pumped through the cars speakers.Cabin space in the Formentor is excellent, with adults over six foot tall still able to sit comfortably in the rear seats. You could even sit three abreast thanks to the shallow transmission tunnel. The use of quality materials, with a grainy metal finish in the middle of the fascia, makes the cabin of the Formentor a pleasant and comfortable place to be, while bronze Cupra highlights on the air vents add a sense of occasion to every journey. The boot capacity of -litres in the Formentor . TSI can be expanded by dropping the rear seatbacks, allowing for even greater practicality when called upon.The Formentor scored a full five star rating in its Euro NCAP crash test, thanks in part to standard safety systems such as lane-keep assist, forward collision warning, predictive cruise control and driver alert warning.The new Cupra Formentor offers a more exclusive, contemporary vision of sportiness, which is instilled into an exquisitely sleek and bold design.

Speaking in Rome during a four-day official visit to the Italian capital, President Higgins said his problem was with the title of the event, which it was stated would “mark the centenaries of the partition of Ireland and the formation of Northern Ireland”. googletag.cmd.push President Higgins strongly denied any suggestion of a snub on Queen Elizabeth and that he declined on the grounds that it is political in nature and commemorates the centenary of the partition in Ireland, making it inappropriate for him as head of State to attend the event. “What [had started out as] an invitation to a religious service had in fact become a political statement,” he said. “I was also referred to as the President of the Republic of Ireland. I am the President of Ireland.” In a reference to Queen Elizabeth, he said: “There is no question of any snub intended to anybody. I am not snubbing anyone and I am not part of anyone’s boycott of any other events inNorthern Ireland. “I wish their service well but they understand that I have the right to exercise a discretion as to what I think is appropriate for my attendance.” The president also called DUP criticism of his decision not to attend a bit much “It’s a bit much, to be frank with you. I have gone up to Northern Ireland to take part in events.” “There often has not been a great deal of traffic down from the DUP people who are criticising me now,” he added.     The controversy has threatened to overshadow President Higgins’s audience withPope Francisin theVaticanon Friday morning as he said he would not be revisiting the decision despite further calls for the President to reconsider. DUP leaderJeffrey Donaldsonsaid he had written to Mr Higgins seeking an explanation and had “encouraged President Higgins to change his mind”. He also said it was “dficult not to conclude that there is politics at play here”. However, SDLP leaderColum Eastwooddefended Mr Higgins and his record on reconciliation, saying that people “should not read too much into this” and should “take him at his word when he says he can’t be there”. Minister for Foreign AffairsSimon Coveneyis due to attend an event marking the centenary of the creation of Northern Ireland later on Friday.ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"--ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\".detachTo.detachTo   --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare  sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Emmette Dillon.Sadness as body of missing Derry man Emmette Dillon recovered overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Broken glass placed across County Derry road was ‘extremely dangerous’ overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry Death Notices - Wednesday, nd September,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Patrick OKane pictured inside his shop on New Row, Coleraine.Young butcher keeping the tradition going on County Derry street overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Plans to develop the Fort George site are set to get the green light.Green light for Derrys Fort George site overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Tributes paid to well-known County Derry car dealer overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Lyra McKee shot dead in Derry in April .Two men arrested in Derry in Lyra McKee murder probe overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Fteen men in court charged with taking part in illegal Derry parades overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Police seize drugs worth pound, in County Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Cllrs Adrian McQuillan, Cara McShane and William Duddy.

The  Johnnies will explain and demysty each topic and the world it occupies, providing real insights for viewers at home by deconstructing the skills required to make it in this unfamiliar territory themselves. In taking on TikTok, the lads meet with some of the top TikTokkers in Ireland like Lauren Whelan whose TikToks have been viewed over  million times. They also learn some valuable TikTok tips from Dublin comedian Killian Sundermann. Killian’s bizarre interactions with hedges have amassed millions of views. Meanwhile, Matty the Viking from Wicklow has made a living from training and chopping wood in a nearby forest, prompting Johnny B to try his hand at chopping wood with the usual hilarious results. They also meet experts in social media and try to discover the magic formula to ensure your TikTok goes viral. Armed with this knowledge, the lads set out to become TikTok famous, with the aim of getting a million views whilst raising funds for their local GAA club. To do this they need to be able to dance - which they can’t - so who better to call upon than professional dancer Karen Byrne of Dancing With The Stars fame to help them out for their big TikTok takeover...      In another episode, the  Johnnies take on urban art. This episode stems from the  Johnnies meeting with Peter Tunney, who runs the Wynwood Walls project in Miami, who appeared on their showThe  Johnnies Take on America last year. Inspired by his art, the lads wonderthey could help create a special mural in their native Tipperary, and so ensues a whirlwind tour of Ireland where they take inspiration from urban art festival Waterford Walls who specialise in large scale street art, take a lesson from childhood legend Don Conroy, meet some final year art students and put on their very first art exhibition! In another episode, the pair attempt to find a sport to represent Ireland in. And in true  Johnniesstyle, they won’t be taking the most well-trodden route. First up it’s a cricket lesson from Irish International legend Kevin O’Brien. The lads then head off-piste to Kilternan, where they get to grips with the ski slopes. Over the course of this episode, they also try their hand at clay pigeon shooting and find themselves in uncharted waters at the National Aquatic Centre but will they take the plunge off a -metre ing board  Finally, the lads are taken on by a Cork American football team and manage to make the trials for the Irish Wolfhounds. In the final episode in the series, the  Johnnies take on E-Gaming. Gaming and e-sports are growing at a tremendous rate with gaming now an entertainment phenomenon grossing more than the biggest movies and consuming more leisure time from the average household than Netflix. In this episode, the lads want to find out more about this ever-evolving subculture of competitive gaming and e-sports. They meet top gamers, streamers and Twitchers, as well as the Munster Rugby e-sports team, play FIFA with the FAI and compete in an e-sports tournament, rounding up some hurling legends to help them on their way. The lads then try to further assimilate into the gaming world, designing and attempting to sell their own game, “Grand Theft Chicken Roll”.

I learnt very quickly to take everyday slowly and that my pain needed to be well managed, she explained.ldquoI kept a patient diary and found it useful for keeping track of pain levels or new symptoms so I didnrsquot get overwhelmed and it helped me to look back and realise how far Irsquod come by comparing previous weeks and months.She added: ldquoIt also helped inform the trauma team on my condition.Discussing Amberrsquos new role as an ambassador for TORC, consultant orthopaedic surgeon Owen Diamond, said that as a charity trustee, he is excited and grateful to welcome Amber as an ambassador for the charity.ldquoWe work to continue to improve the lives of all patients with musculoskeletal injury or disease in Northern Ireland, he explained.ldquoAmber is a great example of someone who had the determination and a great, positive attitude to appreciate that although they may have made her work hard at times, the trauma team were dedicated to helping restore her active le.For further information on TORC, visit their website on www.torcni.org or visit the TORC Facebook page at www.facebook torcni and on Twitter at: www torcni..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/15September2021-Bench.jpg","title":"Bench unveiling in memory of ‘Tina’  ","story":"PEOPLE gathered in Killyleagh last week to honour the late Martin Charters, who sadly passed away earlier this year aged .The World War Two veteran would have celebrated his th birthday last Tuesday and to mark the occasion a bench mdash positioned outside the townrsquos castle and adjacent to the war memorial mdash was dedicated in his memory.The bench, which featured a small inion on a brass plate, was bought by local councillor Billy Walker who was delighted that representatives from the veteranrsquos family, including his great nieces Nicola Donnan and Bridgeen Jackson, were in attendance for the short ceremony.The bench was formally dedicated by the Rev Dr Stanley Gamble.Known locally as lsquoTinarsquo, Mr Charters was held in high regard and Cllr Walker said he was pleased that so many people attended last weekrsquos poignant ceremony in memory of someone he was proud to call his friend.He said that due to Covid restrictions, the war veteran did not get the send off he thoroughly deserved when he sadly passed away last February.ldquoIt was a short but moving ceremony last week and in addition to Bridgeen speaking about her great uncle, Austin Cheevers from the Sloane History Group paid tribute to Tina and what he meant to the people of the town, Cllr Walker said.ldquoChris Hagan also said a few words on behalf of the Killyleagh group while, Mr Austin Cheevers made a presentation to Ms Zena McAllister for all her hard work on the grouprsquos behalf. Zena was supposed to travel to Westminster Abbey for an event to represent the people of Killyleagh several years ago but was sadly unable to make the trip.Thanking people for supporting last weekrsquos event, Cllr Walker said he was pleased to play a small role in keeping the war veteranrsquos memory alive, paying tribute to the bravery of all those who fought in two world wars.ldquoTina was loved and respected by the young and old alike, he continued. ldquoEveryone loved to hear his war time stories and he never tired of telling them. Tonight is a celebration of Tinarsquos le a le that he lived to the full. We should never forget the service he gave for others and the nation.ldquoMany people from Killyleagh and Shrigley who went to war never came back, but Martin did and we were all so proud of him. He always attended the annual Remembrance Sunday wreath-laying ceremony in Killyleagh to remember his fallen colleagues who fought alongside him.Cllr Walker added: ldquoWe are indebted to all our remaining war veterans for their service. Martin Charters is a man who was held in the highest regard by the people of the district. He served his country with distinction. We will never forget what he and others did, along with many others who went to war and made the ultimate sacrice.Seven years ago, the former Down Council held a civic reception for the Killyleagh war veteran who witnessed great social, economic and political change over the decades.Mr Charters joined the RAF and became a tail-gunner in a Lancaster bomber, taking part in countless dangerous bombing missions over Europe.In November , he was presented with a prestigious Bomber Command Clasp during a special presentation ceremony at the Downshire Civic Centre in Downpatrick, attended by RAF Air Vice Marshall David Niven and other invited guests.Mr Charters joined the RAF in  and during his remarkable service throughout the war he worked as a mechanic on Spitfires and later as rear gunner in a Halax bomber, seeing nearly  missions over Europe. He also trained rear gunners for Lancaster bombers.The Bomber Command Clasp was approved by the Queen for those who qualied with service to Bomber Command between  and  and who already held the - Star.Mr Charters was sent to train as a mechanic in Blackpool after joining the RAF, before he was deployed to St. Athens in South Wales.He initially trained on a Hawker Fury biplane, with his training lasting around  months before he was sent to Fighter Command  Group to work on Spitfires as a mechanic in early .The veteran, who was one of just a handful of surviving members of Bomber Command, was later moved to an army unit before being transferred to the legendary RAF unit in  and based in West Yorkshire with his operational training for bombing missions to Germany carried out in the Isle of Man.Following his service as gunner in a Lancaster squadron he worked in Australia and Canada before ing to settle in Killyleagh.He saw a lot of active service and was delighted to be a special guest at the international Festival of Flight in Newcastle a number of years ago to witness the distinctive Lancaster bomber soaring overhead.Cllr Walker said Mr Charters will live long in the memory of the people of Killyleagh and Shrigley and descried Conal Montgomeryrsquos rendition of ldquoWersquoll meet again during last Tuesday eveningrsquos short ceremony as ldquovery moving.He added: ldquoMartin left an indelible mark on all those whom he came into contact with him. It was my pleasure to know him. He certainly was one of Killyleaghrsquos most respected citizens and will be very sadly missed.Following the ceremony, many of those who were in attendance made their way to the nearby Sloane Centre which featured an exhibition chronicling the le of the war veteran which included memorabilia and photographs.Also on display was a silver poppy mounted on a mahogany base which was presented to Mr Charters by Newry, Mourne and Down Council.

Thereafter, the visitors posed some threat on the counter, but in the main it was the Saints who dominated proceedings.McCloskey and Childs both struck the bar in the first half as the Clonard goal led a charmed le.When the Saints did hit the target, the visitorsrsquo goalkeeper was equal to further attempts by Childs, Harpur and Barr in the second half.Ultimately, United secured the win and a welcome clean sheet, with the only frustration being that they didnrsquot add to the scoreline despite numerous opportunities to do so.Meanwhile Saintfield United seconds suffered away day blues as they went down to a - defeat to Queens Grads seconds in Belfast on Saturday.The Saints were led on a merry dance around the Dub before finding the actual pitch the match was being held on ndash they were then led on another one in the first half.The match started even enough with both sides creating half chances, but none of any real note and neither keeper was tested.However, in the th minute a straightforward long punt up field was falling nicely onto the head of Zach Doyle to clear, but unfortunately his teammate didnrsquot hear the call and in a desperate attempt to the ball only succeeded in chipping it over Zach and into the path of the Queens forward.Saintfieldrsquos number one had no chance in nets and Grads went - up.The Saints recomposed themselves and fought back, Alex Bookless sending a half volley just wide.But with nine changes from last weekrsquos squad communication was key and was again lacking in the th minute.A Grads midfield runner was allowed to go unchallenged to the edge of the box before his shot took a wicked deflection off a Saints defender and into the net.The lsquokeeper again left with no chance as he was left rooted to the spot by the deflection.Ten minutes later and it was -, again a runner from the middle of the park took advantage of some weak tackles and ran unopposed into the box to finish.After some words of encouragement at half time the Saints came out raring to go and did create a number of good chances, David Morrow going closest with a header from a Sam Donnan corner.But the goal didnrsquot come and that allowed Grads to see out the hard work from the first half and claim the three points with a - win.Saintfield United thirds began their NFU Mutual Bobby Dalzell Cup campaign with a home match against a newly formed Cloughey FC.The Saints started the first half with plenty of enthusiasm and energy and were rewarded with a goal after a dangerous ball was put into the box.After some bouncing about, the ball found its way to striker Cal Rowlandrsquos feet who neatly slotted past the lsquokeeper to put the Saints in the lead before the break after a half of very few chances.The second half saw even fewer chances for the Saints as Cloughey looked more secure at the back and provided more of an attacking threat.Just as the Saints thought they were going to see out a - win, Cloughey came up with a wonder strike just before the end of the  to draw the game level and take it to extra time.The Saints came out in the second half looking to end the game before penalties, but it took until the second half of extra time for them to take the lead once again.A poor ball into the Cloughey box was easily cleared before it was played back into the danger area where substitute Aaron Young improvised to hook the ball back over his head, lobbing over the lsquokeeper and into the back of the Cloughey net.The Saints thought the game was over, but Cloughey had other ideas as they again hit late after a dangerous cross was put in by a Saintfield defender to take the game all the way to penalties.The penalty shoot out saw veteran keeper Lee Young come out the hero as he saved two of the Cloughey penalties to see the Saints win - in the shoot-out.Saintfield United Clonard FC AMATEUR LEAGUE DIVISION C.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/15September2021-Eileen.jpg","title":"Eileen looks back on her 100 years  ","story":"CROSSGAR woman Eileen Sweeney celebrated her th birthday last week.The centenarian received a Papal blessing which was presented to her by the local parish priest, Fr Brendan Smyth, along with cards and flowers from her family and her carers from Trackars Home Care.Mrs Sweeney mdash who lived most of her le in Fermanagh before moving to be close to her family in the village in  mdash also received a card of congratulation from the Queen and a letter and cheque from Irish President Michael D Higgins.Having reached her th birthday, the local woman credited her long and happy le to good health and strong faith.Mrs Sweeney also advised: ldquoJust take one day at a time and try not to worry too much.

She then moved to Wellworths office in January  and was there doing the book keeping during the war years.She can also recall the American soldiers who came in to play their music on the shop floor and how well they looked in their smart unorms.Mrs Sweeney had her driving licence by this time, but did not have her own car.

senior consultant obstetrician based at the Downpatrick maternity unit has appealed to mothers to keep using the local hospital.The appeal by Mr Nixon Storey came during an address at a special meeting last week of the Down Community Health Committee.Mr Storey was joined by the unitrsquos other consultant obstetrician, Dr Lawrence Erskine, for the special meeting and made it clear that despite the speculation surrounding the future of the maternity hospital, it will not be closing within months.Mr Storey said the doors of the unit will remain open for at least another three years and hopes thatthe arguments being advanced to retain maternity services are taken on board by the Department of Health, there will be no loss of local provision.The senior consultant said it is important mothers across the area realise that the local unit is very much ldquoopen for business and that nothing is going to happen to it in the short term.The two consultants were invited to address last weekrsquos Health Committee meeting to help campaigners formulate their response to the Hayes report into the future of hospital services in the area.Mr Storey said while the Hayes report proposes the withdrawal of maternity services, there is no detail on how gynaecological and obstetric emergencies will be dealt withthe local unit closes.The senior consultant, who has been based at the Ardglass Road unit for over  years, said the report does not properly address gynae issues and suggested its proposal for mothers to have their babies in Belfast before ing for post-natal treatment in Downpatrick ldquois an issue which has not been thought through completely.CROSSGAR ndash The future of Crossgar Police Station is up for discussion during a meeting of the Police Authority later today.News that the station has been earmarked for closure was confirmed last month when the Police Authority revealed a major cost-cutting exercise which will include shutting down

be no closures untilthe matter is fullydiscussed.The issue is set to be examined during a meeting of Police Chief Constable Sir Ronnie Flanagan and Police Authority officials today.Meanwhile, Crossgar constable, Joe Embleton, said he was convinced that the police station should remain open.Crimes dealt with by the local unit in recent months have included car thefts, burglaries and drink driving and Mr Embleton said it was important for police in the village to maintain a visible presence.ldquoThis is a growing community and there are a lot of things happening here, he said.ldquoI like to think that we make a dference when we are here.NEWCASTLE ndash A new community group has been set up in Newcastle, which aims to tackle and address the needs of people living in the area.The Newcastle

welcoming the report, Cllr Curran said he hopes that work to deepen the harbour in Ardglass can get underway as soon as possible.He said it is great news that a committee will be established to deliver on the programme.But he also warned that the grouprsquos membership must include representation from the ious fishing associations who play key roles across the industry.Cllr Curran added: ldquoWe need to ensure that the voices of those in fish processing are heard as well. This will ensure that this new committee delivers on the needs of all our fishing ports. It is important that we have equality across our district..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/15September2021-Politicians.jpg","title":"Politicians awaiting report from consultants on Rock Pool repairs  ","story":"A MAJOR report on the detailed cost of repairing Newcastlersquos crumbling Rock Pool is still not available for local politicians to study, it has been confirmed.The consultantsrsquo report was expected to be with Newry, Mourne and Down Council in July, but over two months later it has yet to be published.This week, the local authority would only confirm that the report is expected to be with the organisation in ldquodue course and was unable to provide any definitive timescale.It is understood that when the report is forwarded to the local authority it will be discussed by the Active and Healthy Communities Committee. However, it has yet to be confirmedthe discussion will take place in public or mdash as a number of councillors suspect mdash behind closed doors.A council spokesman has confirmed to the Recorder that TetraTech were appointed as consultants for the Newcastle Rock Pool investigation.He explained that the consultants are currently assembling expert reports from ious consultant disciplines, including architectural, mechanical, electrical and structural specialisms, to provide overall cost estimates for the options available to the local authority.The spokesman added: ldquoThis final report will be submitted in due course to the Active and Healthy Communities Committee to make a recommendation on the preferred option available to Council and elected members.Consultants have been carrying out a microscopic investigation of the structural integrity of the outdoor pool at South Promenade.Earlier this year, it was suggested that the final repair bill for what is one of the last sea water swimming pools in Ireland could be in the region of poundm. And while this has yet to be confirmed, it is being suggested by some that the scale of the work required could cost several million pounds.Expected to determine the short and long term futures of the Rock Pool which requires signicant investment, the consultantsrsquo report will also be scrutinised by senior council officials given the potential cost of the repairs needed to make the pool safe for users and meet current health and safety regulations.Over the past few months, consultants have been involved in a painstaking examination of the outdoor seawater pool, examining every inch of the structure to determine the exact cost of bringing it back into public use.It has been reported that preliminary investigation work at the pool mdash which opened in the early s mdash revealed that there are a number of issues which require urgent attention and that considerable costs are involved.It has previously been reported that the outdoor poolrsquos concrete structure has extensively degraded, while the filtration system to filter sea water is almost unusable, with seawater pipes so corroded that rust is coming off them and contaminating the water being filtered.In addition, the pool is unable to retain water as a result of cracks in the concrete and has been described as ldquono longer fit-for-purpose, with one of the most signicant concerns for council officials that the pool does not comply with current health and safety standards, with suggestions that a complete rebuild may required.Once the consultantsrsquo report has been studied by councillors and officers, it is is expected that recommendations will be made to the full council on how to proceed and how the required work will be funded.The local authority has previously insisted that it remains committed to ldquoexploring all funding opportunities to assist with financing the repair costs at the outdoor pool, with some money to help finance the work included in the local authorityrsquos current budget.But a number of councillors believe that external funding will be required as the organisation may not be in a position to shoulder the full costs involved.They say they are conscious that in tandem with plans to redevelop the Newcastle Centre in the heart of the resort to provide a new leisure facility, ratepayers must not be burdened with the full cost of this project and the repairs to the outdoor pool..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/15September2021-Rory.jpg","title":"Rory’s charity walk to Mayo  ","story":"FORMER Ulster rugby star Rory Best is nearing the end of his  mile walk across Ireland after setting off from Daisy Lodge in Newcastle last week.The  year-old rugby legend mdash who also captained Ireland mdash set off on lsquoRoryrsquos Miles  Mayorsquo challenge last Wednesday in support of the Cancer Fund for Children charity.Rory walked from the charityrsquos base on the outskirts of the resort all the way to the site of a newly proposed Daisy Lodge facility in Co Mayo.The mammoth nine-day challenge has raised much-needed funds to support the charityrsquos services which include restorative breaks at the Newcastle facility at the foot of the Mourne Mountains.The aim of the breaks are to allow families to spend quality time together in a safe and nurturing environment, far removed from hospital wards and treatment regimes.Speaking before he set off from Newcastle, Rory revealed that his family and friends will affirm that he is not a fan of walking.ldquoWalking  miles in nine days will be tough, but nowhere near as tough as the challenges that families dealing with childhood cancer face, he said.Rory has taken on the challenge in a bid to raise pound, for the Cancer Fund for Children which last year provided emotional support to over , young people.ldquoIrsquom not only taking on this challenge to raise vital funds, but also awareness of the impact cancer has on the lives of children and young people, Rory explained.ldquoAlready an incredible pound, has been raised and I would like to thank our incredible sponsors, local schools, clubs and business for getting behind me. If you can, please donate to my challenge and cheer me on.The nine day challenge began last Wednesday, with now less than  hours left until Rory reaches his goal.Throughout his journey, the former British and Irish Lions players has been joined for short periods by families affected by cancer, as well as some notable names from the rugby and entertainment world.They include Tommy Bowe, Jacob Stockdale, Tadhg Furlong, Rob Kearney, Robert Balacoune, Bundee Aki, Conor Murray and well-known television chef and personality Neven Maguire.Once Roryrsquos challenge is completed, he will have walked from Newcastle to the site of a proposed second Daisy Lodge in Cong Co. Mayo, passing through Down, Armagh, Fermanagh, Leitrim, Sligo and Mayo, taking in over  towns and villages along the way.For every family Cancer Fund for Children can support across Ireland, there are another six they cannot.

Please try again later.Submitting...Mr Poots was talking more about anti vaxxer conspiracy theories and not about people whose opposition is based on religious grounds.But even so, his comments are influential because he is a former health minister and a Free Presbyterian.Some anti abortion campaigners are deeply concerned about the link between the developments of vaccines and aborted foetuses. But the vaccines on offer in Northern Ireland do not contain fetal cells. According to the Department of Health, their development has “involved the use of cell lines grown in labs, having been replicated from fetal cells obtained decades earlier” and thus “any link between any vaccine development and abortions is incidental and remote”.The debate about cell lines is a sensitive one. But the conspiracy concerns can be much more easily dismissed, with their grossly exaggerated claims about side effects of the treatments.The vaccines do not necessarily prevent infection with Covid but have been overwhelmingly successful in suppressing its impact on people who have been double jabbed.Many conspiracists are impervious to elementary statistical information on the value of getting vaccinated against coronavirus.As both Mr Eastwood and Mr Poots say, repeated lockdowns are not feasible as a response to Covid.

on Thursday, said Irish diplomats in Washington have taken every opportunity to brief the US administration on the situation in Northern Ireland.He also suggested that he was confident a solution could be found to the ongoing row between London and Brussels over the implementation of the Northern Ireland Protocol.The protocol means Northern Ireland is effectively in the EU’s single market for goods, to avoid a hard border with Ireland, which creates a trade barrier for products crossing the Irish Sea from Great Britain.“The focus has to switch now, for the UK Government, the Irish Government and the EU working in partnership to resolve these issues,” Mr Martin said.“I believe the European Union is up for a solution.“Where there’s a will there’s a way and these issues can be resolved.”At the Oval Office meeting, Mr Biden told reporters: “We’re going to talk a little bit about trade today and we’re going to have to work that through.”He said he felt “very strongly” about issues surrounding the peace process, as problems with the Northern Ireland Protocol persisted.“I would not at all like to see – nor, I might add, would many of my Republican colleagues like to see – a change in the Irish accords, the end result having a closed border in Ireland,” he said.Mr Johnson said “that’s absolutely right”, adding: “On that point, Joe, we’re completely at one, nobody wants to see anything that interrupts or unbalances the Belfast Good Friday Agreement.”Downing Street said the Prime Minister updated Mr Biden on developments with the protocol since they last met in June.“The leaders agreed on the importance of protecting peace in Northern Ireland.”The White House said Mr Biden “reiterated his longstanding support for a secure and prosperous Northern Ireland in which all communities have a voice and enjoy the gains of the hard-won peace”.  \"       \"  Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the

Firstly, a permanent resident within the property needs to be in receipt of one of the following benefits, such as:Armed Forces Independence PaymentAttendance AllowanceCarerrsquos AllowanceChild BenefitConstant Attendance AllowanceDisability Living AllowancePension Guarantee CreditIncome-related Employment and Support Allowance Income-based Jobseekerrsquos Allowance Income SupportIndustrial Injuries Disablement BenefitMobility SupplementPersonal Independence PaymentSevere Disablement AllowanceTax Credits Universal CreditWhat is EC  Funding The Energy Company Obligation or ECO is the name given to the UK Governments programme to make houses more energy efficient on a nationwide basis.The current ECO scheme, ECO, is scheduled to run until  March  and is focused exclusively on lower-income households, a wide range of benefit recipients qualy for improvements in their homes energy efficiency, with measures including new heating systems and boiler upgrades, external insulation, internal insulation and loft insulation as well as double glazing and more.What does the process involve First, fill in the Grant Eligibility Survey to seeyou qualy for the free boiler. Providing you are eligible, the team at First Choice Energy Ltd will speak to you on the phone and then come out and survey your home. This will include things like measuring your floor space, checking the thermostats on your radiators, identying the brand and model of your current gas boiler and asking some general questions regarding your property. A survey generally takes no longer than an hour.When itrsquos time to install a new boiler, your previous boiler will be replaced with a new gas-fired condensing boiler and the floor insulation will be fitted by a carpenter. Although the process sounds messy and time-consuming, on average it takes no longer than a day. And of course, the cost to install the boiler and install the floor insulation is covered by the grant.Will I need to pay any contributions Householders that are eligible for free boiler grants have no obligation to pay back any installments. Plus there are no terms and conditions to be met other than the basic qualying criteria.Why do I need a new boiler Your boiler may be on its way out, or not working properly, so now is the time to act. With energy bills more expensive than ever, your boiler needs to be heating your home for the lowest possible cost. A boiler installed around  years ago will most likely be around -% efficient. So, by upgrading this old boiler to a new one, the carbon savings will be signicant enough to warrant the cost and therefore will qualy under the free boiler scheme.Boilers installed in the UK are required to be condensing boilers. These are far more efficient than traditional boilers as they release gas at just  degrees Celsius , therefore requiring less energy to generate the same amount of heat.What happensI am not eligible The team at First Choice Energy may be able to help you with other grant schemes or offer advice and guidance on how to help with any problems you could face.For more information visit First Choice Energy Ltd or email: Firstchoiceenergylimited@gmail article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log Brought to you byFIRST CHOICE ENERGY s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"Comments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityRecent years have seen increasing numbers of the Grey seal population breeding in and around the lagoon and spotting them is an exciting wildle encounter that many visitors wonrsquot forget.However, the combination of the Blue Lagoons high visitor numbers, and its sheltered nature which makes it so attractive to seals, creates a situation where there is a high potential for disturbance to seals.The time seals spend resting on land is vital to their health and that of their pups as they are digesting a recent meal, socialising, and feeding their young.Blue Lagoon to closeIn order to provide them with a safe environment to raise their pups, National Trust Cymru will be closing the Blue Lagoon to visitors from September  through to November .Visitors will still be able to watch these wild creatures in their habitat from the coastal path and coasteering activity providers who have signed up to the National Trustrsquos Coasteering Agreement and undertaken specic training on how to operate around seals, will still have access to the lagoon with groups of visitors who have booked in advance.Mark Underhill, National Trust Cymrursquos Countryside Manager, Pembrokeshire said: ldquoThere are two species of seal that can be found in Britain the Common seal and the Grey seal. Only Grey seals occur regularly in Pembrokeshire, where they are present all year around.ldquoAbout half the worldrsquos population of Grey Seal breed on our coastline and the total number in West Wales, mostly Pembrokeshire, is estimated to be about ,, with some , pups being born each year.ldquoThe breeding season is vital for our seal colonies here in Pembrokeshire, and we ask that visitors do not access the Blue Lagoon and that they follow the guidelines laid out by the Seal Alliance and Pembrokeshire Marine Code when on the coastal path.Paul Renfro from the Pembrokeshire Coastal Forum said: ldquoThe Pembrokeshire Marine Code recommends remaining at least m away from the seals, though they can be disturbed at any distance so itrsquos important to be responsive to their behaviour.     ldquoIf a resting seal looks up or turns to looks at you then you are close enough at whatever distance you are at. Seals can be particularly sensitive to disturbance after periods of stormy weather and during the breeding season so we recommend giving them extra space at these times.How to avoid disturbing sealsTo avoid disturbing seals at this very important time of year, National Trust Cymru recommends adopting the following strategies:Sssh, stay quiet: Channel your inner David Attenborough and speak with a low voice and encourage your children to do the same. Noisy dogs can frighten seals soyour four-legged friend is a bit chatty, please leave them at home when you visit a seal breeding area.Donrsquot get too close: Ensure you stay at least  metres away from sealsand never come between a seal and her pup, or a seal and the sea. Doing so will cause distress to both the mother and pup.Keep dogs on a short lead: Keep your dog on a short lead. Do not allow them to run loose or play with balls, frisbees or sticks anywhere near a breeding colony as this will cause them distress.What to doyou see a seal in distressIf you spot a lone seal pup on a beach itrsquos probably not in distress. Seal pups are often left alone on the beach whilst its mum goes off to catch dinner.Never approach the seal. It will cause further distress and may be dangerous for you and the Seal.Look to see how many people there are about. In most cases when seals are in distress itrsquos due to contact with curious and well-meaning visitors.If you are still concerned, contact conservation group Welsh Marine Le Rescue   or   who will be able to offer you further guidance. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

Ruth worked for many years in Craigavon Area Hospital.Though challenged with deafness and blind, Ruth was incredibly inquisitive and determined to do things some thought impossible.Ruth Blevins was born in Portadown in October , the daughter of Norris and Maureen Blevins. Her mother had contracted Rubelladuring pregnancy and Ruth was born deaf and with very limited sight - she went completely blind later in le. She had four brothers: Harold, Derek, David and Stephen.Her childhood was ided between her home in Portadown and her school in Shrewsbury, Shropshire. Portadown native Ruth Blevins dancing with her mother Maureen dancing was in Spain on Ruths th birthday.She spent a short time at Jordanstown School for the Deaf outside Belfast but  years at Condover Hall School for the Deaf Blind in Shrewsbury, Shropshire. Her mother flew to England and back  times a year for  years to ensure Ruth was given every opportunity to succeed. At Condover, she learned a bespoke type of sign language for children who are both deaf and blind and excelled at every lesson and extra-curricular activity.Ruth worked as a Domestic Assistant in the Laundry and Estates Department of Craigavon Area Hospitalfor  years - an incredible achievement for someone without sight or hearing.Her boss described her as ‘a joy to be around’. COVID restrictions in the hospital prevented her from working for  months but she was determined toand did so just three months ago. She was a well-known character around the hospital.Portadown woman Ruth Blevins in a sign-language conversation with her brother David Blevins.Her brother David said: “Ruth had what I describe as a contagious joy. She laughed a lot and she made other people laugh wherever she went.“To describe her as inquisitive would be an understatement. When Mum stopped to talk to people, Ruth would immediately stick her hand out for Mum to sign who it was.“She had an exceptional memory, particularly for birthdays. She knew everyone’s birthday and, evenshe hadn’t seen them for years, would waken on their birthday and ask Mumshe had sent a card or a text message.”Ruth had a more active social le than her four brothers combined! She attended the Deaf Club, the Eagle Fellowship, the Disabled Christian Fellowship to name but a few.Portadown woman Ruth Blevins with her mother Maureen.She never missed Sunday worship at her church - Tandragee Methodist.She had a wide network around her - work colleagues, social workers, befrienders, etc. Her family is deeply grateful for the contribution each of them made to her le. Her funeral was restricted to  people but more than , people have watched it online.If one word could sum up Ruth, her family believe it is ‘determined’. She embodied the Helen Keller quotation: “While they were saying among themselves it cannot be done, it was done.” David said: “While we, as a family, were busy asking how Ruth would cope with school, with work and with le in general, Ruth just kept answering the question by accomplishing more than we ever imagined. When Ruth decided something had to be done and done in a certain way, there was no changing her mind.Ruth Blevins as a young child.“She had the kindest heart. Ruth used to help facilitate sign-language exams but when candidates forgot the vowel, she would lt the right finger to help them pass. Failure wasn’t in her vocabulary.”Ruth has been an inspiration to many and her family attributes it to her sense of joy.Her brother Stephen said: “People were inspired by her ability to converse on her hands, by her achievements at school and at work, by her active social le. “But among the many lovely memories they have shared with us since her passing, there is one word we have heard repeatedly: laugh. Even when she was telling her younger nieces and nephews off for messing up her bedroom, she would laugh. She just loved a bit of craic and it radiated from her.”He explained: “When Ruth was born, the doctors gave her little hope. They said she would never sit upright, never mind walk but a Methodist lay preacher prayed for her and the following morning, she sat upright for the first time.“She had begun to rewrite her story. She was one of Northern Ireland’s Young Deaf Achievers in , a bridesmaid at two weddings and enjoyed holidaying with relatives living in Spain and Scotland.”David recalled: “For Ruth’s th birthday, Mum and her travelled to my brother Derek’s home in Spain. What they didn’t know was that Ruth’s other three brothers - Harold, David and Stephen - had flown to Spain six hours behind them. When Mum and Ruth arrived at a hotel for Ruth’s birthday breakfast, we were all there to surprise her. Mum could not believe her eyes and Ruth did what Ruth always did - laughed and laughed.”David said: “Ruth was not just the centre of our family - the only daughter sister, with two older brothers and two younger brothers - she was the le and soul of it. “Our late father adored herand Mum devoted her entire le to Ruth. “Her brothers wanted to change the world for her but Ruth ended up changing the world for us in every positive sense. She totally enriched our lives.”At Ruth’s funeral her brothers paid a beautul tribute to both their sister and their mum. “Mum, we love you. A unique daughter needed a unique mother and God chose the very best for Ruth. You have devoted your le to her, been her rock in every sense and you’ll not have to leave her behind. God, in His grace, has taken her on ahead, waiting on the other side.”Ruth Ann Elizabeth Blevins, from Turnberry Green, Tandragee, died suddenly at home on September .She was the dearly loved daughter of Maureen and the late Norris and sister of Harold, Derek, David and Stephen.Her funeral was in Tandragee Methodist Church on Thursday th September  followed by interment at Killyman Parish Churchyard.The family has asked that donations in lieu of flowers can be made to Sense NI, c o George McNabb  Co,  Bridge Street, Portadown, BT AP.Teams from Craigavon, Newry and Belfast lined out for the Angela McCabe Tournament in aid of Southern Area HospiceEditor’s Message:Thank you for reading this article.

plan for Christmas eventsArmagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council’s plans for Christmas  have been approved by the local authority’s economic development and regeneration committee.By The NewsroomThursday, th September , : am  \"       \"  The matter was discussed at a meeting of the committee on Tuesday, February .Committee members were presented with a report that notes Christmas is a strong trading period for the business community and there is a need for Council and its partners to encourage residents to shop local during this period.The report also told members officers plan to see the urban centres of Banbridge, Dromore, Lurgan and Portadown animate their high streets across dferent weekends in November and December culminatingin the lights switch on in the respective towns.In Armagh, activity has focused on the planning and delivery of a Georgian Day and its associated programming.It is felt this approach will allow people to visit their urban centres throughout the afternoon and enjoy safe, family festive activities where numbers can be controlled, thereby animating the space, creating atmosphere and encouraging local shopping.The events are scheduled to take place in Lurgan on November , in Portadown on November , in Armagh City and Banbridge on November  and in Dromore on December .With regards to Craigavon, the report confirms officers are still in discussions with local schools to agree the best way to mark the festive season and switching on of the Christmas lights.Plans are also in place to hold virtual Christmas celebration events through social media and plans are underway for a bookable, safe, silent Christmas event so that every child and family will have the opportunity to feel part of the celebrations.Officers have also recommended free off-street parking on the three Saturdays in December prior to Christmas.It is also recommended that off-street parking in all council owned car parks is free for Banbridge, Lurgan and Portadown on their respective animation days and off-street car parking is free in all Armagh City council owned car parking for Georgian Day on November .It is anticipated offering free parking on these days could cost Council up to £, but the budget for this approach has been identiedwithin current budgets.Councillor Paul Greenfield thanked officers for the report and proposed the recommendations were adopted.Councillor Sam Nicholson said he was happy to second the report and stressed the importance of the shop local brand to help businesses recover from the pandemic.Alderman Stephen Moutray praised the report’s “balanced and sensible” approach to Christmas and described it as the best way to go forward.Councillor Thomas O’Hanlon asked about twilight markets to encourage people into smaller towns and villages at this time of year and askedthere was any reason the event were not being held.Council’s head of economic development, Nicola Wilson said Council continues to follow the advice from the Public Health Agency and having considered it, officers were not of the belief it was the best way forward.“We are convinced we should not be recommending twilight markets at the moment from a health and safety point of view,” she said.Cllr O’Hanlon expressed his disappointmentwith this response and claimed he was of the view this was “walking away from rural areas”.“If we cant’t have the markets then why are we operating market stalls in our town centres to me that just doesn’t make sense,” he said.“I would be keen that is teased out and brought back.”Alderman Sydney Anderson askedFriday, December , could be included as a day for free off-street parking in town centres and was told that would not be a problem.The committee then voiced its agreement with the proposal to approve the recommendations.Editor’s message:Thank you for reading this article.
