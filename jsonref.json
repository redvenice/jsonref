You\u0027re such a puritan.\u0027The conversation \u0027descended into a screaming match\u0027 before Andrew said: \u0027Leave me alone. Jeffrey\u0027s my friend. Being loyal to your friends is a virtue. And I\u0027m going to be loyal to him,\u0027 it was claimed.           The woman who stayed at Balmoral spent almost a year in Epstein\u0027s orbit, joining him on about a dozen trips. Epstein (above) gave her a place to live in New York, rent-free, and later paid for her to go to collegeMiss Roberts first landed her claim that she was a schoolgirl \u0027sex slave\u0027 in a US court in 2014. She claims she was forced to submit to abuse by rich and powerful men, all of whom deny wrongdoing.Last night Buckingham Palace said: \u0027This relates to proceedings in the United States, to which The Duke of York is not a party. Any suggestion of impropriety with underage minors is categorically untrue. It is emphatically denied that The Duke of York had any form of sexual contact or relationship with Virginia Roberts. Any claim to the contrary is false and without foundation.\u0027Miss Roberts claims she had been groomed for abuse since 15 by billionaire Epstein – said to be \u0027addicted\u0027 to molesting children – and his \u0027madame\u0027 Ghislaine Maxwell, the daughter of disgraced tycoon Robert Maxwell. Legal papers filed in Palm Beach, Florida, alleged that an underage Miss Roberts \u0027was forced to have sexual relations\u0027 with Andrew \u0027in three separate geographical locations: in London (at Ghislaine Maxwell\u0027s apartment), in New York, and on Epstein\u0027s private island in the US Virgin Islands.\u0027There has been no claim that Andrew was aware that Miss Roberts was acting under duress and he denies any such incidents happened at all. The flight logs for Epstein\u0027s luxury black Gulfstream jet are not publicly available \u0027at the request of the owner\u0027, but the Mail has obtained entries for March and April 2001, showing Miss Roberts being flown on a six-day whirlwind tour from Palm Beach to Canada, Paris, Grenada in Spain, Tangier in Morocco, and finally touching down at London\u0027s Luton airport on March 9.

A month later, on Monday April 9, the duke began an official visit to the US in his capacity as chairman of the trustees of the Outward Bound Trust.That day\u0027s Court Circular states he departed \u0027this morning\u0027 from London\u0027s Heathrow Airport, arriving in New York later that day. As it was an official trip, the flight was funded by British taxpayers.The same day, Miss Roberts also flew to New York. She and Epstein left his £8million mansion in Palm Beach, Florida, and the flight log shows they flew aboard his 22-seat Gulfstream –with its personalised licence code ending \u0027JE\u0027 – to New York via Atlantic City.Although Miss Roberts and the duke were both in New York, there is no information to suggest whether they met, and the Palace has declined to comment, beyond denying they had any \u0027relationship\u0027.The next morning, a Tuesday, the Duke flew to Boston for a series of royal engagements. According to Miss Roberts\u0027 claims in newspaper interviews, it was around this time – Easter – that she was ordered to Epstein\u0027s mansion in New York and met Andrew again. Yesterday the Palace was specifically asked if he met Miss Roberts at this time, and it declined to answer, other than to say he denies any sexual encounters with her.The next meeting she recounts was in the Caribbean. The flight logs show that Miss Roberts and Epstein left New York on April 11 aboard the jet for St Thomas, in the US Virgin Islands, for a boat transfer to Epstein\u0027s private island next door.The Court Circular does not state the duke\u0027s whereabouts for the next few days, but it appears he too flew south – because by Easter Sunday, April 15, he was reportedly \u0027in the Bahamas\u0027. He had been absent from the Queen\u0027s Easter service at Windsor Castle, and a royal courtier explained to the Daily Telegraph, which published the titbit, that he was on holiday in the Bahamas with ex-wife Sarah Ferguson and their daughters.It is unknown when the duke arrived in the Bahamas – about a two-hour flight from Epstein\u0027s island – or when he left. Yesterday the Mail asked Buckingham Palace whether Andrew stopped at Epstein\u0027s island en-route to the Bahamas. A spokesman again declined to confirm or deny the suggestion.According to Miss Roberts\u0027 claims, the duke was there for one night. She claimed she flew to the island with Epstein and Miss Maxwell – which is confirmed by the flight logs. The Mail asked the palace a series of questions about Prince Andrew\u0027s movements that week but none of them were answered.Miss Maxwell has strongly denied the allegations against her as salacious, spurious and untrue. Epstein, 66, hanged himself in his cell earlier this month."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/08/19/08/17436742-0-image-a-3_1566200768293.jpg","title":"MAX HASTINGS reveals hidden story Dambusters","story":"Share this article   Albert Speer, Hitler’s armaments supremo, was initially shocked by the havoc wreaked by ‘a mere 19 bombers’ but within days recovered his nerve and performed one of his accustomed feats of management and improvisation, to restore production and start upon repair of the dams.Just 18 weeks later, the Möhne was once more sealed, in time to catch the autumn rains — though at a cost that has been estimated as equivalent to £6 billion in modern money.For weeks after the flooding, affected areas reported disruption of production caused by water shortages at shaft mines, coking plants, smelting works, power stations and armament factories. Coal production fell. Workers also had to be erted from other key projects, such as fortifying Hitler’s Atlantic Wall, to repair the broken dams.But six weeks after the raid, the Ministry of Economic Warfare in London reported that, though the destruction was serious and would involve a large amount of repair work, ‘the Möhne damage did not touch the main industrial centres’. Decrypts by codebreakers at Bletchley Park showed the emergency was quickly controlled.Professor Sir Michael Howard dismissed Chastise in his official history of British Grand Strategy as ‘a spectacular feat of skill and courage, but one whose effect on the German war effort was, unfortunately, slight’.As for Barnes Wallis’s ‘bouncing bomb’, for all its wizardry, it was never used in action again. It proved to be a technological cul-de-sac, costly in lives and unusable in any other circumstances.There were other gains, however. Millions of Germans were obliged to confront the vulnerability of the Reich and the emptiness of repeated promises about their security made to them by Hitler, Goering, Goebbels.While the strategic air offensive failed to break the spirit of Hitler’s people, such a night’s work as that of 617 Squadron imposed a trauma which it seems foolish to understate.Britons, by contrast, were elated when the news broke. That spring of 1943, after nearly four years of austerity, unpalatable food, family separations and spasmodic terrors, the British people were weary.Chastise lifted their spirits and revived flagging confidence in their own nation’s powers, as had few events since the desert victory at El Alamein six months earlier. The marriage of technological brilliance with human courage and airmanship awed and thrilled them.As for the aircrew who executed it, whatever the moral ambiguities thrown up by the Dambusters raid, they will continue to deserve the admiration of their descendants.EXTRACTED from Chastise: The Dambusters Story 1943 by Max Hastings, to be published by William Collins on September 5 at £25. © Max Hastings 2019.

It’s part of a new series of images by the Bronx-born artist Elle Pérez called From Sun to Sun, which puts 16 photos on more than 100 bus stops in 13 neighborhoods in the city, from Harlem to Williamsburg.“There’s figures, portraits, the hands and environments like street scenes, fake flowers and bicycles,” said the Public Art Fund exhibition curator Katerina Stathopoulou. “Elle wanted to combine figurative work and street scenes to create a rhythm of daily life.”The photos detail Pérez’s experience growing up as a non-binary Puerto Rican in the Bronx, from flags to special meals, community leaders and pensive moments with city architecture.“It’s a decentered exhibit outside of a gallery or museum,” said Stathopoulou. “There’s something so powerful about Elle’s portraits and environments that is so engaging, which is apparent in their work.”The photo of the handshake credits its co-creators, Jay P Fury and Bryan Keith, friends of Pérez. “It’s a handshake specific to the Bronx,” said Stathopoulou. “The fist pump and the chest touch. It’s created in the punk scene, which Elle was involved with as a teenager. Elle incorporated images specific to their experience.”“Elle asked: ‘What is the daily rhythm of New York, what is the cyclical nature of life in New York?’” said Stathopoulou. “There’s a familiarity but also an abstraction in terms of the details of the city it has the presence and absence of people in New York. It’s meant to be a meditation on daily life in New York City.”The bus shelters are strategically placed in neighborhoods that are important to the artist – from the Bronx to East Harlem, East Williamsburg and Queens. “It’s not meant to represent New York as a whole but it’s Elle’s personal story of New York,” said Stathopoulou. “It’s to portray their experiences of growing up in New York, born in the Bronx and living in Brooklyn – the familiar people, the places they frequent and the experiences that Elle has daily.”The artist, who has previously documented the queer and Latinx communities of New York, told Art21 that their artwork has always been made collaboratively, “because my work has a raw, visceral relationship to emotional authenticity”, said Pérez. “People haven often recommended that I go into documentary, but I could never figure out the ethics of it.”Pérez’s photos look like they’re casually taken but they’re staged. One photo shows a woman and child gardening at school. The woman is Pérez’s sister, who is an outdoor educator in the Bronx, planting raspberries and evergreen shrubs with a student.There’s also a photo of an East Harlem middle school teacher named Brendan, seated wearing a tie. “As an educator at the school, he shaped the curriculum of what students learn, one of the reasons Elle wanted to include him in the series,” said Stathopoulou. “Education is another theme.”Another photo depicts a Dominican street food dish that Pérez has found in their Brooklyn neighborhood. “The people eating the dish in the photo are all close friends,” Stathopoulou said. “Elle wanted to capture this daily activity, this routine moment of sharing a meal among friends. Brooklyn and the Bronx are both important to Elle, personally and photographically.”One of the most poignant images is a portrait of a man with the Puerto Rican flag tattooed on his arm. It says “Mi orgullo”, which reads, in Spanish, “my pride”.“Elle wanted to shoot it in black and white as an opposition against the US government’s oversight of Puerto Rico and the control they have over their economy,” said Stathopoulou. “This is Elle’s way of showing solidarity to support Puerto Rico. It ties into Elle’s experience in now, in present day New York.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/033fb703620f38cf6db818a1a19f9ad85a8d13fc/696_337_5767_3460/master/5767.jpg?width=740\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=5479a3c36c0f85ae830a6527785fc5ed 1480w","title":"home post apartheid south africa thabiso sekgala in pictures","story":"Thabiso Sekgala’s solo show features work taken by the late South African photographer offering nuanced, alternative narratives about life in contemporary Africa.

Sales soared there after President Xi Jinping was pictured drinking a pint of the brew with then prime minister David Cameron during a state visit in 2015.The cash bid, which Greene King’s directors have advised shareholders to accept, values the company at £2.7bn, or £4.6bn including the debt that CKA will be taking on.CKA, a property business based in Hong Kong but incorporated in the Cayman Islands, said its bid was founded on its confidence in Britain’s enduring love of pubs.The number of pubs has been in long-term decline but the pace at which their numbers are declining has slowed in 2019.Greene King traces its history back to 1799, when it was founded in the sleepy Suffolk town of Bury-St-Edmunds by 19-year-old Benjamin Greene.By contrast, CKA is part of a vast empire of global business interests headed by Li Ka-shing, who is estimated to be worth $29.4bn, making him the world’s 30th richest man.CKA focuses on property and investments, owning a host of prestigious addresses and stakes in utility companies.Its properties include 5 Broadgate, the UK headquarters of Swiss bank UBS, the Chelsea Waterfront development and luxury London apartment blocks Belgravia Place and Royal Gate Kensington.“CKA’s strategy is to look for businesses with stable and resilient characteristics and strong cash flow generating capabilities,” said George Magnus, who chairs the takeover vehicle the Hong Kong firm is using to complete the deal.“The UK pub and brewing sector shares these characteristics and we believe that this sector will continue to be an important part of British culture in the long run.”Nick Mackenzie, chief executive of Greene King, said: “Greene King has a well-invested estate in prime locations, leading brands, a rich history and a talented team of 38,000 people serving millions of customers across the country every week.”Nik Antona, national chairman of the Campaign for Real Ale said the sale of Greene King was “very concerning for our beer scene”.He added: “We hope that Greene King will continue its operations as normal without any disappointing changes. We will be calling on the new owners to retain the current pub portfolio to safeguard thousands of pubs and jobs across the country.”British brewers have proved particularly attractive for foreign buyers, who have pounced on traditional family operations such as Greene King, as well as the newer breed of so-called “craft” breweries.Fuller, Smith \u0026amp Turner accepted a £250m offer for its entire drinks business from the Japanese beer group Asahi, including its flagship London Pride ale, earlier this year.The company, which had three relatives of the Victorian brewing barons John Fuller, Henry Smith and John Turner on its board at the time of the deal, said it had taken the decision to quit beer after 174 years to concentrate on running pubs and hotels.So-called “craft” brewers have also proved attractive to foreign buyers, particularly multinational drinks companies that have swooped on brands such as Camden Town, Beavertown and Meantime, capitalising on the growing popularity of smaller breweries.The trend has sparked concern within the beer industry that big companies are buying out independent competition, compromising the integrity of the so-called “craft revolution”.SAB Miller kicked off the trend in 2015 by buying London brewer Meantime for £120m . The brand later had to be sold to Asahi as a condition of SAB’s “Megabrew” takeover by AB InBev, which had bought north London brewer Camden Town for £85m in 2015.In 2017, Carlsberg snapped up London Fields Brewery, which was put up for sale after its founder was charged with tax fraud.Dutch multinational brewer Heineken paid £40m for a minority stake in fast-growing Tottenham brewery Beavertown last year.More recently, Australia’s Lion bought highly-rated Huddersfield-based brewer Magic Rock, a year after buying Bermondsey-based Fourpure, while Molson Coors bought Hop Stuff.Other beers clothed in craft branding, but owned by global firms, include Goose Island, Blue Point, Hop House 13, Blue Moon, Sharp’s Doom Bar and Lagunitas."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c3ccc790446464c05dca69d6e7c3ae7e775e1883/0_18_1503_901/master/1503.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=26251b7c8292839d94c87b3e763ddd5b","title":"national grid chief gets 1m pay rise for strong performance","story":"Windfall payout for John Pettigrew revealed days after UK’s worst blackout in a decadeLess than two weeks after Britain’s biggest blackout in a decade National Grid has revealed that it handed its chief executive a £1m pay rise over the last financial year to reward his “strong performance.”.The company’s annual report, published on Monday, shows that John Pettigrew was paid £4.56m for the last financial year, up from £3.65m the year before, for delivering value to shareholders.The pay-day windfall was revealed as National Grid prepares to publish an interim report on the 9 August blackout which left almost a million homes without electricity, and hundreds of thousands of people stranded in rush-hour travel disruption.

It’s important that the industry takes all possible steps to prevent this happening again.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a43e503c52840305996674feecdcee070c388e81/0_0_2549_1530/master/2549.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b43cc38d7ebbb9f72ccf90c00ac8d5c3","title":"brexit wont influence our friendship twinned towns","story":"From butchers to doctors to teachers, people in paired towns across Europe discuss daily life – and facing the big splitMy dad was a butcher in Faisalabad, Pakistan. He came to this country in 1959 and had his own butcher’s shop in Manchester. I was his apprentice. There were three of us – my older brother, me and my younger brother.I opened my business on 1 November 2001. My father was very proud parents like their children to follow in their footsteps. My dad had tremendous ability – I won’t bring myself to say I’m on the same level, but maybe I’m halfway there.It’s a family business now. My wife serves the customers, and my son has a takeaway next door I supply the meat to them. We work as a team. It’s a hard working life. I start at 7am preparing the meat for the counter, and we’re open 9am-9pm, seven days a week. I’m 51 and I’m still working away, but I’m making a living and I’m happy. When I retire, if I have the stamina, I’ll still do a few hours a day. I’ve always worked – I’m a working-class person.I love Manchester. I was born and bred here, and I would never go anywhere else. The Jilani name has been around for a long time – the mosques know us, the whole community knows us, and generations of people still come to buy halal meat from us.Manchester has always been a base for Asian people, from India and Pakistan. I don’t feel European at all I feel British, English. I’ve been to other countries in Europe, but England’s 10 times better.David Cameron made the wrong decision. I think it would have been better to stay in the EU for business reasons. I’m a small businessman – we’re all out to make a living. Whatever happens with Brexit, I hope the change is for the better.Benny Gränitz, 37, butcher in Chemnitz, GermanyMany people don’t want to pay extra for good-quality meat. But I am optimistic that is changing – it seems that fewer people are buying cut-price supermarket sausages. I like my job. We can influence the whole chain, from the farmer to the customer who eats our sausages.For me, being European has its advantages. It’s practical to be able to cross borders without issues. On the downside, there are lots of European rules and regulations that make my life difficult. Maybe we’d have to comply with similar rules even without the EU, but they are definitely a big factor, and they have forced some local butchers to close. We’ve had to invest a lot to meet their strict standards.I don’t foresee any big shift for our business after Brexit. A lot will depend on how Britain fares outside the EU. If things go well, maybe other countries will want to follow suit. If things go badly, I’m sure people will feel happy to stay.Twinning is a nice idea, but I didn’t know we were partnered with Manchester. The two cities are well suited they are both industrial places. We also have a Düsseldorf square in Chemnitz, named after our partner city in the former West Germany.Life in Chemnitz is quiet and pleasant. There’s not much going on. Sometimes it’s as if the streets have been emptied of people. Other places are livelier but I can’t imagine living anywhere else.Interview by Jess SmeePunam Krishan, 35, is a GP who lives in Glasgow with her husband and five-year-old sonI’m one of the very few GPs who still loves being a GP. People see us when they’re at a crossroads – with their health, wellbeing or personal situations. You get to be part of their big moments as well as their not-so-big moments.As a partner, I experienced stress and burnout. You work 12-hour days as a GP and then have to manage the business side, as well as juggling family life.It was encroaching on all my relationships, and I felt quite unhappy. I remember being on holiday in Turkey, ordering toilet roll for the health centre for my practice. I left my partnership in September 2017 and I’ve been a locum ever since.Although my heritage is Indian (my mum and dad are from Punjab) I was born and brought up in Glasgow. I’m very much part of two cultures. My mum used to take us to India every summer, and by week four I’d think: “I just want to go home.”I love being Glaswegian it’s such a multicultural, erse city. I didn’t appreciate it until I moved to London for a few years. In London you have pockets with, for example, a large Indian population or a Caribbean community. In Glasgow, the communities are a lot more integrated.Scotland didn’t want to leave the EU, so there is this sense of feeling hard done by, and the fact my son hasn’t had a choice in this saddens me. I want to keep him connected I’ll probably take him on more holidays to Europe after Brexit.I worry about what’s going to happen to my European friends and colleagues. If they leave, how will that affect our NHS, and our wider healthcare system? A lot of our machines and drugs come from Europe. If we don’t have a deal, how are we going to access these things?Although the idea of twinning towns predates the second world war, it was in its aftermath that the concept took hold as a way of promoting reconciliation and friendship between nations. Coventry, which suffered heavy bombing, was a pioneer. In 1942, women from the city sent a message of hope to the women of Stalingrad (now Volgograd), which had also been devastated. Two years later, the two cities agreed an official “bond of friendship”. Links with Kiel (1947) and Dresden (1956) followed.In the early 1970s, as the UK prepared to join the European Economic Community, the government offered funding to encourage twinning. “The idea was that new forms of trade would be more successful if British people were culturally competent in dealing with Europeans,” says Nick Clarke, associate professor of human geography at the University of Southampton. School exchanges and foreign language learning flourished.The 21st century, however, has seen some partnerships falter, with a number of UK towns “un-twinning” from their European counterparts. When Peter Davies became mayor of Doncaster in 2009 he scrapped its five town-twinning arrangements, as part of a series of cash-saving measures. “Only about a dozen people ever benefited from these trips,” he said. “I can see that it arose out of altruistic motives after the war, but it just became about junkets.” In 2011 the Tory-run town council in Bishop’s Stortford ended ties with Friedberg and Villiers-sur-Marne, after more than 46 years, blaming “lack of interest”. The Lib Dems argued it had more to do with Tory Euroscepticism.Antonio Barillà, 57, is a family doctor working in TurinI have been working as a family doctor in Turin and the wider Piedmont region for 26 years. Over the years the job has changed for the worse. There is a real lack of funding in the public sector. Bureaucracy slows us down. There are pharmaceutical and diagnostic rules that must be followed treatment protocols that are still printed on paper. If a worker takes a sick day, they still have to present their employer with a written affidavit from their family doctor. It is this sort of bureaucratic strain that causes burnout, and motivates Italian doctors to abandon the public sector.I don’t feel Turin is an important part of my identity. I was born in Reggio Calabria, in southern Italy, and came here for work. Hundreds of thousands of Italians moved from the south to Turin after the second world war. They left their cities and families to work here. Turin is a multicultural city, where Italian and foreign migrants coexist. You overcome these differences by seeking out what unites rather than ides us. My wife is Piedmontese, and we have two children. I am perfectly integrated culturally, socially and in my work.I am proudly Italian – we are a free, extraordinarily complex and unpredictable people. But I no longer recognise myself in the Europe of today, where nationalism is raging. The populism taking root in Italy is the expression of the failure of the political establishment over the past 25 years. Populist leaders are being asked to solve problems like insecurity and the decaying social fabric. People believe that European politicians have not regulated finance they have been at its service.Brexit is simply another way to ide us, and I don’t think it will bring benefits to the UK. I believe it will eventually be overturned by the people who oppose it.Interview by Lorenzo TondoBob Holderness, 48, is headteacher at The Parkside School, Norwich, a complex-needs schoolParkside is an urban school that takes pupils from the whole of Norfolk. All the specialist schools in Norfolk are heavily oversubscribed. We all face sustained pressure to admit more pupils to sites designed for far fewer pupils and staff. In the city centre we have the White Lion Cafe, where our pupils learn communication and interaction skills. It won a national award but we’ve had to make the decision to close it, as a direct result of our budget situation.I have been in education for 25 years. I have seen so many colleagues leave the profession, citing stress and burnout. It’s difficult to recruit people where we are geographically, flanked by the North Sea. However, at Parkside we have staff who have worked in the school for many years, including myself.Although I have lived in a number of other places, Norwich has always been my home. I was born in Sheffield – my dad was a history lecturer at Sheffield University he did some work on our family tree and we established that my mum’s family moved from Suffolk to Norwich in 1602. I feel a sense of belonging here.The original idea to twin communities after the second world war was to reduce the risk of future world conflict and promote cultural and economic links. Both of these ideas are still valid. The link between Norwich and Novi Sad in Serbia supported many joint education ventures. I recently got in contact with a former teacher who taught at Parkside in 1985, when the twinning first happened. A team went over, and they sent resources to a complex-needs school over there. When I arrived in 2002, that link had gone cold.From a historical and political perspective, I consider myself European. I have grave concerns over the ision of the country with Brexit. We need to work together to achieve a compromise.Violeta Strahinjevic, 47, is director of Milan Petrović School for children and young people with disabilities and special educational needs, in Novi Sad, SerbiaI became director of the school last year, but I’ve been working here for 22 years as a specialist teacher. One of the daily challenges we face is how to increase the acceptance of people with disabilities within the community. We try hard to include our children in local activities – the film festival, exhibitions, music festivals. It is essential for their social inclusion.We often collaborate with art students or professional artists – for our project Crossover they performed a stage musical in the city and surrounding villages. It is one of the many little steps we take to try to change attitudes. There is a long way to go, but I feel that in Novi Sad we are moving in the right direction.I feel equally a citizen of Novi Sad and a citizen of Europe. I think Britain should stay in the EU. It’s much more beneficial, not just for British people but for all of us, if Britain remains a member. But whatever happens, I am sure it won’t influence our friendship.Lisa Gunn, 44, is an artist who works in Coventry, and is involved in the CoventryDresden Arts ExchangeI was born in Walsgrave hospital in Coventry, and I grew up just outside the city. My father and his father were born here. Coventry is in our blood.I was in a road accident in April 1997, and the seatbelt broke my spine. I couldn’t do anything for four years I was in agonising pain. I was doing my art degree at Coventry University and my tutors were really supportive.My recent work is strongly connected with the ruins of Coventry cathedral and what they symbolise. It was devastated in the war – it’s like a skeleton – and I feel a metaphorical connection. We are both physically damaged, but we are still standing.I’ve only just become involved with the CoventryDresden Arts Exchange. I travelled to Dresden in February and took part in an exhibition called Condition Humaine, involving two artists from Coventry (including myself) and two from Dresden. It was organised around the anniversary of the bombing of Dresden in the second world war. We’ve all come from cities that rose from the ashes to create something new, and the work we’ve exhibited is inspired by that. The same show came to Coventry cathedral this summer.The Dresden trip was fantastic. My father came with me. Since I’ve been involved in this project, I’ve found out a lot about his early life. He was born under the living-room table in a Morrison shelter in an air raid on Coventry during the war.Everyone I met in Dresden was lovely – the artists and everyone connected with them. I made some great new friends. I invited them to come and stay with me.The economic impact of Brexit will definitely affect my work. Since the 2008 recession, people have become more careful about how they spend their money, and art is a luxury. I do sell work, but not as much as I used to.Kerstin Franke-Gneuss, 60, is an artist who lives and works in Dresden, and is involved in the CoventryDresden Arts ExchangeI have worked as a freelance artist in Dresden since 1984. I have a studio in the Künstlerhaus, the Artists’ House, which was built 120 years ago and is custom-designed for artists to live and work in. I make prints, and create big installations in public spaces. I can only make my art here in Dresden it is inspiring for me.The theme of this year’s exhibition of the CoventryDresden Arts Exchange is human existence in war and suffering, in reconciliation and peace. Twinning brings us closer to the “common European home” envisaged by Mikhail Gorbachev. This grand idea is being lost. Why would people want to have new borders? I come from the former GDR, and I know how small the world can be.With Brexit, there will be difficulties to overcome: new border controls, papers to fill in for customs clearance – a lot more hassle. This makes the connection and friendship between Coventry and Dresden all the more valuable.Milo Smith, 36, is general manager of Ninety-Nine Bar and Kitchen in AberdeenI’ve been general manager of an eclectic wee cocktail bar for five years, and I love it. Previously, I was an art teacher at a secondary school, but there was a lot of politics and paperwork, unnecessary stress, and too many hours. Believe it or not, when I became a bar manager I started working a lot less. I’ve worked in bars since I was 15, so it made sense to come back.The main challenge is the business rates, and how expensive everything’s getting. Taxes, and the cost of everything from sugar to alcohol to plastic, have gone up. The minimum wage is going up. The more you work to generate a profit, the harder it becomes.I think Brexit is a total farce. I’m someone who will roll my sleeves up and get on with whatever needs doing, but in this case we don’t know what to get on with. Most of the drinks we stock in our bar come from Europe. Our drinks suppliers import them, so any cost implications of crossing borders after Brexit will affect us.I was born in Aberdeen and I’ve lived here, on and off, for the better part of 35 years. I feel a strong identity with the city. It’s quite a close-knit community. Aberdonians are pretty stubborn, and we also like to have a good time. We’re the sort of people who will have a barbecue even if it starts to rain – we’ll just get the brollies out. We make the most of a bad situation.The last time I was in Stavanger was four years ago, for a friend’s stag do – he lives there. Both Aberdeen and Stavanger are oil and gas cities, and you can tell that as soon as you arrive. It has a similar feel, the same company names, the industrial-style buildings, trucks transporting goods.Kristine Ekeland, 26, and Steffen Rege, 28, are co-owners of Hygge bar in StavangerKristine I’ve been running the bar with my co-owner Steffen since March 2017. I imagine it’s a demanding job in any part of the world, but here you have different challenges: Stavanger is a small city – there are about 120,000 people living here. There is quite a good nightlife, but you’re fighting over the same customers.We designed the bar to create something unique. We have a gigantic wall of plants and a beer pong area. We’ve just renovated using wood from an old fishing boat. We get some tourists, but it’s mainly locals. We also get quite a few international students.Stavanger is home but my mum is from Brazil, so I can relate to both cultures. Steffen was born and raised in Stavanger. It’s only a small place, but there’s an aura here that always reels people back.Steffen The two cities have got oil in common – platforms in the North Sea. A plane goes to Aberdeen every day.I used to work for Halliburton in Aberdeen, and I thought the city was great, all the redbrick houses. The price of beer was a bit cheaper, but not much, and the food is different – a bit more greasy.I feel European. I’ve been to many places but I’ve never travelled outside of Europe. In terms of Brexit, there will be good or bad things whatever Britain does. It’s better to be able to do things yourself, than to be told what to do.Dr Steve Wharton, 56, is a senior lecturer in French and communication, and departmental Erasmus and assistantships director at the University of BathBeing an academic is one of the best jobs in the world. It gives you the chance to engage with young people, to help them to develop, and you get to do it alongside some pretty good colleagues.We do not live in an ivory tower, though. We face the same problems of pay, pensions and insecurity as any other profession. There was a national strike last year over changes to the pension scheme. I was on strike for 14 days.I’ve worked at the university and lived in Bath for half my life – I’m 56 now. I met my husband through the university. He now lives and works in Parma in Italy, so we travel backwards and forwards quite a lot. Brexit could affect that.I’m originally from Dorset, and I felt at home within about six months of moving here. Bath is a friendly place. If I’m at the bus stop I’ll talk to people and they won’t look sideways and move away, they will join in the conversation. There’s a remarkably international presence within the city, and that’s not just the students. It’s home to people from France, Spain, Italy, Germany… Being European is very much part of my identity – I’m a European Brit.When I was 21, I taught English at a school in Normandy for nine months. In the 90s, I taught at the Université Sorbonne Nouvelle in Paris, and I lived there when I was doing my PhD.The decision to leave the EU is a mistake the ridiculous mantra of taking back control of things we controlled already skewed the debate. I have colleagues who have broken down in tears because the website for registering an interest in remaining in the UK wasn’t working. As a UK citizen, I felt ashamed.The University of Bath has been proactive in contacting all of its international partners and saying it wants to continue working together. There is apparently a government promise to underwrite some kind of exchange programme. But quite what that will be is something none of us knows.Dr Mauve Carbonell, 40, is associate professor in history and director of the master’s programme in European and International Studies at Aix-Marseille University.Life as an academic in Aix is thrilling – and busy. In reality, I have two jobs: professor and researcher. I manage about 20 international cooperation agreements to encourage student and staff exchanges. The partnership with Bath is long-established and one of the most important and successful we have had.Every year we send six of our students to Bath and we welcome about six students from Bath on our master’s programme. Our students have an obligatory mobility period of six months in the spring semester and a lot of them decide to go to Bath. Erasmus agreements allow them to study abroad without paying additional fees to the host university to benefit from a grant, and to have their overseas study programme formally recognised.Aix-en-Provence is the city where I grew up as a teenager, where I studied 20 years ago and where I now work, after spending time elsewhere in France and Europe. It’s a part of my identity, but it has become a smaller part as my European identity has become stronger. First I got an Erasmus grant to attend the Humboldt University in Berlin. Then, for my PhD on European integration history, I travelled to European archive centres and met people involved in the birth of the European Community. I lived a truly European experience as a young researcher. I feel at home anywhere from Tallinn to Lisbon, from Galway to Athens.We fear Brexit will limit our students’ choices. Dismantling 70 years of economic and political ties is a sad and exasperating process.

But the deceit that led to the referendum result is a historic betrayalMonday 16 August 1819 was a beautiful summer’s day, when at least 60,000 people came in their Sunday best to St Peter’s Field in Manchester for the peaceful demonstration that turned so tragically into the bloody Peterloo massacre. On 16 August 2019, by contrast, there was a relentless downpour of the worst Mancunian variety. But the spirit of 200 years ago was not the least bit dampened by the torrential rain.In our complex world of lies and fake news and sinister manipulation, democracy is under threat on so many levels. And the radicals and reformers of two centuries ago have much to teach us – the lessons of Peterloo go far beyond the issue of universal suffrage. As John Thacker Saxton, a real-life radical played by John-Paul Hurley in my film, says: “Though we can easily forgive a child who is afraid of the dark, the real tragedy of life is when men are afraid of the light.”I was privileged to have been invited to take part in From the Crowd on the bicentenary, a lively community performance on the site of St Peter’s Field. It involved over 100 people from a wide range of backgrounds, including a number of descendants of victims of the massacre. The event was in fact not so much a conventional performance as a bold reflection on the history of protest, especially in the UK, and on the relevance of Peterloo to our contemporary world. At 1.30pm, the precise time the Manchester and Salford Yeomanry began their violent assault on the crowd at Peterloo, 18 of us read out in turn the names of those who died of their wounds on that fateful day. After the last name had been read out, we were to observe a minute’s silence and then the bells of Manchester town hall were supposed to chime 18 times. But, owing to a technical hitch, no bells sounded. This meant that the minute’s silence went on for several minutes.Nearly 4,000 people silently meditating in the pouring rain is a deeply moving experience. So many thoughts, feelings, ideas, memories, hopes, fears, all in those few precious minutes …The Midland hotel, right in front of us, was built on the site of the house from which the misguided magistrates watched the meeting, before so stupidly instructing their forces to attack. Suddenly, I felt a rare sense of connection to those events on this very spot. Odd, in a way, as I’d wandered about there so many times recently in the course of researching my film about the massacre. And I’d already known the area well, both from growing up in Salford, and as an adult, mostly ignorant about Peterloo, which was hardly mentioned in school.We were so close, too, to the spot where Henry “Orator” Hunt and the others stood on the hustings – two horse carts – by what is now the Radisson hotel, but was in my youth the Free Trade Hall concert venue. Like the nearby Central Library, where I saw my earliest plays in the tiny library theatre, and the town hall itself, Waterhouse’s gothic masterpiece. When we were kids, all these buildings were pitch black, which we thought was their natural colour. How surprising to see them revealed in their true beauty after the Clean Air Acts. What if the folk at Peterloo, who were fighting for the vote, could time-travel to 2019? Would they not be appalled and disgusted by the fact that we have the vote, yet so many people don’t use it? Would they not be astonished at the deceit of Brexit? At how working-class people still starve two centuries after the iniquitous Corn Laws? That last year there were 1.6 million recipients of emergency food parcels in the UK, half of the contents going to children?Nellie, the poor mother in my film played by Maxine Peake, referring to the Corn Laws, asks, “When has the government ever done anything to help us?” She would be astonished at the cost of living now that drives so many to despair, by the five-week wait for universal credit, by the likely rise in food bills of £190 per annum per person because of Brexit, by zero-hours contracts, and by a health minister who refuses to rule out deaths caused by lack of medicine if the UK leaves the EU with no deal.Brexit is the epitome of democracy under threat – indeed, of democracy gone wrong. To end this awful impasse we must have another referendum, one that is not afflicted with the lies and spin of 2016 – the People’s Vote. The spirit of Peterloo must endure.These thoughts and feelings, and many more, raced through my head and heart as I stood, wet and silent, with many kindred spirits."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c019c73ff01288932578ba9a6a7cd7f4c895daf0/188_225_4896_2937/master/4896.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b6758db9ef3af1a08d5a5dab31659f7a","title":"your pictures share your photos on the theme of appetite","story":"Wherever you are in the world, this week we’d like to see your pictures on the theme ‘appetite’The next theme for our weekly photography assignment, published in print in the Observer New Review is ‘appetite’.Share your photos of what appetite means to you – and tell us about your image in the description box.The closing date is Wednesday 21 August at 10am.

But these are young people wanting to make their way out into the world and you feel really pivotal to their next move. If they don’t get the results they want, it just breaks your heart and you can’t help but feel quite personally accountable.I never sleep the night before the results. As teachers, we’re judged on our performance, so part of my anxiety is my own sense of professional accountability, questioning whether I’ve delivered what my headteacher expects me to. But, most of all, there’s this feeling of so desperately wanting my students, who I’ve prepped and taught and supported for two years, to just nail it.My happiest memory is of a dyslexic young man who did just that. When he found out his result, he picked me up in his arms and twirled me around in front of everyone, saying: “Oh my God, I couldn’t have done it without you, Miss.”It’s such a nerve-racking and anxiety-inducing day. One minute, I’ll be shrieking and jumping up and down with celebrating students. The next, I’ll be in a quiet corner, comforting a devastated child who feels like nothing will be OK ever again.I am always rooting for the students who have a difficult home life or don’t find academic work easy. When they do well, it’s exhilarating. You know you’ve helped to shape that young person’s life. That’s why most of us go into teaching. It’s the best moment of your career.I’ll sleep badly for weeks before results day, especially if I know Ofsted will visit us within the next academic year and our results will be heavily scrutinised. In the past, it has made me quite ill. I’ll sit up thinking about different scenarios, wondering how my results will be treated publicly and the impact they will have on the school in general. Also, I still teach maths and the inidual results of that class are really important to my sense of self-worth, both as a teacher and as a head. If I’m telling other people what to do, I want them to know I can do it too.Once I get the actual results, my concerns become much more about the children again – which is obviously what I should have been thinking about all the time. I get angry with myself for worrying about anything else.Every year there will be certain kids you really want to see get their results. Usually it’s the ones who have battled against the odds. Out of the corner of your eye, you watch them get their brown envelope. You try not to stare but you look for their reaction.There are times kids work flat-out and still don’t get what they need. They’re the heartbreakers.One boy I taught a few years ago needed to pass maths to do electrical engineering at college. His predictions meant it would be an outside chance, but he and I both did all we could. In the end, he was a few marks off a C grade. He was devastated. He cried, and I cried. I told him to come up to my office. I wrote him a letter for his college, saying how hard he’d worked and that his maths was good enough for the course, and to please put him on it. I even phoned the principal and said: “He was so close, can you give him a go?” And she agreed. We sent off his exam for remarking but they let him start anyway.At the end of results day, I might crack open a cold beer. I’m still thinking about the children, wondering: what can I do to help them? There’s always a bit of leftover anxiety, hoping that the results they’ve got are what they need to take their next step in life. Then eventually I’ll disappear off home to fall asleep on the sofa.I privately broke down with happiness one year when I saw one of my students had got the results he needed to study marine biology. In our first lesson together, four years previously, he had told me it was his dream. I was excited to see him so happy on results day. He came to see me afterwards to thank me for helping him on his journey. I found that whole experience so validating.On results day, I see the transformative effect my school and the teachers can have on kids from disadvantaged backgrounds, and that really motivates me. One young man from a deprived area had spent most of his GCSE years in a pupil referral unit. He came to our school and absolutely thrived. He left with two A*s and an A and went on to a top university. When children do well, it makes you feel proud. I can’t wait to see the faces of those children and speak to their parents.The night before – I never sleep. I ruminate on the difficult decisions I’ve made throughout the year. As a senior leader, I invest a lot of my time making sure these children get good results. I have lots of difficult conversations with parents, children and teachers about why people are not progressing. It’s really important to me that, if I’m doing all the correct things, it’s reflected in the results.It’s rewarding to see the sheer joy and disbelief on children’s faces on results day. The hardest thing for me is when phenomenal students are a few marks off the top grades they need to get into a prestigious university. Some universities will keep them hanging for a few days and then refuse to let them in, which I think is really cruel. Those are the saddest cases for me. These students may be awarded a higher grade if they choose to get their paper remarked, but by then the university place they wanted may have gone. That feels really unfair. But there’s nothing I can say. The decision is totally out of my hands.On one memorable results day, I was pregnant. I had promised to email two boys their results – this was in the days everything was sent by post – and I went into labour prematurely at 6am. So I got my phone out on the way to the hospital and messaged the boys their results. My husband was like: what are you doing? But I was determined to let those kids know how well they had done. My daughter was born an hour later.• Interviews by Donna Ferguson"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/064b7b6aa2d279b557f9765810e756051c5a458c/0_1431_3984_2388/master/3984.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=96aa215027037b27e1a960e68597f142","title":"i dont blame any teacher for not coming out as gay","story":"I’d been a teacher for over 10 years before I felt comfortable enough to just be myself. I had settled into a rhythm. I wanted to be a great maths teacher – why did I have to face the burden of being a role model for LGBTQ students too?Some colleagues knew about my sexuality. If someone asked about my “husband”, I’d casually tell them the situation. And it was working OK. Then one day the stakes suddenly got bigger.I had an interview for an assistant headship in a comprehensive in a semi-rural area. I was the only candidate invited back for a second interview. My potential future boss spoke warmly about the ethos of the school and the importance of his Catholic faith. As a member of the senior team, I’d be working closely with this man. I suddenly thought: if he turns out to be a homophobe, this will be a problem. It seemed an important moment – for my future, and for his.That day, we’d moved house. I’d had to wiggle out of my jeans and into my interview dress in the car a couple of roads away from the school. I was a little flustered as well as having the usual interview nerves. I mentioned that I’d come straight from collecting the keys.“Oh, why the move?” he asked.“We need a bigger house now we have twins,” I said.He looked at me. I clearly didn’t look like somebody who had given birth to twins a month ago.“My partner had them – she’s at home with them now,” I said.And there, I had come out in my interview.There was a brief silence. “Oh, yes we have another teacher like you – she and her partner are going through IVF right now,” he said. And that was it.I know a handful of teachers and school leaders who are not out as LGBTQ at work in any way. The majority of the teachers I’ve known who were LGBTQ were out to staff but not to students. I can’t blame anybody in either group. For some it’s because they are not yet fully out in their personal lives. Others are from visible minority groups and don’t want to add something else that they feel will count against them in interviews or for promotions.Their fears are justified. Stonewall reports that LGBTQ staff across all workplaces who are BAME are more likely to lose their jobs than white LGBTQ colleagues. And for teachers who are single or currently in a heterosexual-looking relationship, being honest about their sexuality can feel like too much of a statement. Bisexual people are less likely than gay men or lesbians to be out.One school leader described her inner conflict to me: “I look at others, the confidence they have, the sense of complete ease and comfort, and I want to be involved. Then, days like today when I’m feeling overwhelmed and I’m not OK with it all, I certainly can’t be the ‘role model’. Where does that come from? Self-preservation? Protection? Shame?”In my lifetime, I’ve seen the advent of civil partnerships and same-sex marriages IVF rules have changed. In the wider commonwealth, homosexuality has been decriminalised – in India and Trinidad. But in England in 2019 there is transphobic hate crime and we’ve seen lesbian couples being assaulted on public transport in our capital city. Hundreds of parents have withdrawn their children from schools in Birmingham and protested because they didn’t want them to be taught about equality for LGBTQ people.In such a climate, I would not pass judgment on any teacher or school leader who decides not to come out. Sometimes they simply feel unsafe. How do people know they will be supported – by colleagues, by school leaders, by the government?In my own case, I had lingering memories of hearing that homosexuality was wrong and recurring thoughts of hell and damnation after a childhood of church on Sundays. And having been educated in the 80s and 90s, with the impact of section 28, which barred “promoting” homosexuality, added to my internalised homophobia. People my age, and especially those who are now teachers, are still living with the fallout from this.My journey to being open was a long one. Before I became a teacher I was a fleet engineer for a train operating company. None of my colleagues then knew about my sexuality. This was an almost entirely male environment. I split my time between the office and the train depot where pictures of page 3 pin-ups were standard. I didn’t fancy being the subject of banter.Deciding engineering wasn’t for me, in 2004 I enrolled in Teach First, the teacher training organisation. By now, fed up of being vague about my life outside work, I decided I would be out to my colleagues. It helped that I liked everyone and felt generally supported.In my early teaching jobs, my policy was to be out to other staff but not to students. This felt safe for me. I was teaching in a faith school. My colleagues were respectful, but I had nagging doubts: would the school leadership support me in the face of any comments from parents or students? I didn’t want it tested.As I became more comfortable with my sexuality in my private life – my family were mostly on my side – the same became true at work. It was easier when I went to work in a school where there were other openly gay teachers. One, a close friend, was also out to pupils and things were fine.Eventually, once I was an assistant headteacher, I came out to a Year 9 class I knew well, correcting them when they assumed I had a “husband”. They hadn’t expected me to be gay and asked a bit about if I’d always known, but the lesson carried on as normal. I thought it would be all around the school by the end of the day. But it wasn’t. I had taught for over 10 years by then. I’d been on a journey – through different schools and on a personal journey of my own acceptance.Being out has been hard at times. I’ve suffered homophobic abuse in public for nothing more than sitting next to my partner on a train or walking our dogs together. Being out is not an event, it’s an ongoing process. It’s daunting but it gets easier. For me, the journey has been worth it for my own mental health and wellbeing. But I don’t blame anyone for taking their time.The real onus should be on schools to create an environment that makes staff and students feel safe enough to be honest about their sexuality. I felt able to come out at my interview because the school had a Stonewall schools champion logo on its website. These gestures may seem small but LGBTQ people notice them and they matter.• Safety and health first. Look after yourself and don’t feel guilty if you aren’t ready to be a role model for others.• Find teachers in your school or wider network who you can be yourself with.• Coming out is a series of steps – don’t worry if you can’t take them all at once.• Get the support of your headteacher or, if you are a head, chair of governors before coming out to pupils.• If you don’t feel supported or valued as a teacher who is also LGBTQ, move to another school – check out their websites to get a feel for how they are with gender issues.• Coming out doesn’t have to be a big announcement in assembly or class. It can be casual and personal in the flow of conversation.Iesha Small is the author of The Unexpected Leader"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3ba035223efb46c316c9f0fdf240339b3ca6fe2d/10_197_1957_1173/master/1957.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=96354fc03418e2dcc18c141d9cf81439","title":"replace religious assembly in schools with a thought for the day","story":"Back in the early 1990s, a lone Pakistani boy appeared in my otherwise entirely white primary school class. If that wasn’t isolating enough for him, each week, as we went into the assembly hall for hymn practice, he would be quietly ushered away. An hour later, we were reunited – the rest of us with heightened voices, him with a box of freshly sharpened pencils, which he had laboured at while we were gone. Every week, for an hour a week, over four school years. That’s 156 hours of sharpening pencils on his own. Just for being Muslim, in a school that was supposed to cater for everyone.This bonkers situation occurred because of a rule passed in 1944 as part of the settlement that brought religious schools under the state’s jurisdiction. Every English school is legally required to have its children take part in “collective daily worship” every day. Even if the school is secular, even if the school is packed to the rafters with atheists.Happily, the rule is regularly flouted. My primary school did its weekly hymn-singing session instead of daily prayers. Around half of primary schools are thought to have no daily worship, and almost no secular secondary schools seem to bother. Ofsted, the schools inspectorate, declared in 2004 that it would stop even checking.But while half of secular primary schools completely ignore the rule, the other half don’t. Which is why two parents, Lee and Lizanne Harris, are taking a case to court in the autumn after their children were made to take part in Christian prayers during school assemblies even though Burford primary school is a community school with no religious character. They withdrew their children from the assemblies, but the Harris family say the children were then put in a room with an iPad and a supervisor. Better than sharpening pencils, but not by much.The Harrises believe their children should be provided with an alternative, inclusive assembly. If that sounds like a hippy impossibility, I can promise it’s not. See, there’s a further quirk in the law. If a school doesn’t want to do Christian daily worship, it can apply to the local authority to carry out – I kid you not – daily “worship” of a non-religious nature. The process is incredibly onerous but a few hundred schools have taken this step. I know this because the school where I first taught dug in, did the lengthy form-filling, and received the exemption. It is now one of the few secular secondary schools that really does complete daily worship – except, in its case, the children all take part in a “thought for the day” exercise during registration time, covering a plethora of topics including all major world religions and philosophies. Surely that’s 10 times better than mindlessly bashing out another verse of Make Me a Channel of Your Peace? Plus, every child can take part: no pencil-sharpening in sight.It would be shrewd to switch the rules, so that secular schools default to delivering non-religious “worship”, allowing them to retain the option to apply for an exemption if they want to have Christian worship after consultation with the local community. Doing this would mean many more schools would actually start following the rules. Children would learn more about religious ideas than they do right now – and no one would be excluded.

Not that my dad, a keen amateur wine lover, ever put it that way. As far as we knew, we were just going camping in various parts of France, Italy or Germany. It was only years later, as I caught the wine bug myself, that I realised how many of the campsites my parents picked – from Burgundy to the Rheingau – just happened to be in some of Europe’s most famous wine places.Luckily for my incurious teenage self, wine tourism in Europe in the 1980s didn’t amount to much. For many producers, especially in France, members of the public were about as welcome as a tax inspector. I remember a trip to somewhere in, I think, the Loire where we saw a wobbly VHS film of vines in sunlight with a grandiose voiceover going on incomprehensibly about “nature’s handmaidens and Bacchus and patrimony”. But that was pretty much it. My dad was mostly just happy to be near some famous vineyards, drinking the absurdly cheap wines in almost-always-beautiful situ.That would still be my favoured style of wine holiday: one of afternoons spent lazing around in a pool among the vines in, say, Portugal’s Douro valley, still for me the most beautiful wine country in the world. And of evenings getting to understand, in detail, how the local wines combine with the local food (autumnal Piedmont or Tuscany would win on this score).Wine tourism is no longer the ramshackle affair it was. All over the world, wine companies have realised there’s money to be made and, equally importantly, valuable PR to be communicated to attract visitors in increasingly slick and varied ways.Just how far along the path from farm to tourist attraction some wineries have come can be seen in the inaugural list, announced earlier this month, of the world’s 50 best vineyards. A spin-off of the 50 best restaurants jamboree, it attempts to identify the best wine-tourism destinations. It’s a list that leans towards the spectacular larger producer: a combination of starchitect-designed cellar and fine-dining restaurant is the formula taken by most of the winners, including the number one, Zuccardi, at the foot of the Andes in the Uco valley in Argentina.These places can be fun to visit, in a Grand Designsadult theme park kind of way. But they’re not enough to sustain a wine holiday itinerary on their own. To really get under the skin of a wine region you need a cluster of small, welcoming producers offering free tastings, a range of accommodation, restaurants, bars and other (non-vinous) cultural attractions, and good, easily available local information and maps.The best places for this that I’ve come across are California (preferably in a Saab convertible, Sideways-style) Alsace (France’s best-developed wine route is perfect for cyclists) or the Alpine-vine gorgeousness of Switzerland’s Valais (the one for walkers). In their different ways, they are all easy pleasures to tour, no matter how serious your interest in wine, even if you have truculent kids in tow.Zuccardi Serie A Bonarda, Mendoza Argentina 2017 (from £13.99, cambridgewine henningswine oxfordwine)The recently named world’s best vineyard has a stunning, site-sensitive piece of architecture at its heart, some 1,100 metres above sea level in the Uco valley.

In the end they departed with a solitary point, some encouragement and some regrets, most obviously a missed penalty by Paul Pogba after Rúben Neves had cancelled out Anthony Martial’s fine first-half goal.For Ole Gunnar Solskjær most of the positives came in that first half. His team were dynamic and enterprising and they deserved the lead when Martial gave it to them by applying an emphatic finish to a sharp move. But Wolves’ equaliser was equally merited, Neves plundering a spectacular reward for a thrilling second-half turnaround by Nuno Espírito Santo’s team, who were given new thrust by a half-time substitute, Adama Traoré.Both sides created chances to win after that but Pogba claimed the clearest one. He won the opportunity himself, in fairness, after being tripped by Conor Coady following a snappy one-two with Jesse Lingard. Marcus Rashford, who has an impeccable penalty taking record, seemed to offer to take the spot-kick but Pogba pulled rank. He struck the penalty with power but not enough accuracy to beat Rui Patrício, who batted it away.A draw against this impressive Wolves side, who tend to be particularly troublesome to strong teams, is no disgrace. But winning would have done United a power of good given the way they floundered here last season, when they arrived a week after producing a sensational Champions League comeback against Paris Saint-Germain but wound up ousted by Wolves from the FA Cup and then beaten again a fortnight later. They have not won an away match against anyone since then.But at least they performed better this time. Solskjær deployed all his new tools, starting all three of his summer recruits. Harry Maguire and Aaron Wan-Bissaka were obvious selections, but Daniel James’ inclusion intrigued. It was the young winger’s first start since his arrival from Swansea, his goal-scoring appearance off the bench against Chelsea apparently earning him a promotion. No doubt he hoped James’ speed might help curb the offensive enthusiasm of Wolves’ left wing-back, Jonny.United began by dominating possession, controlling play without being able to prise apart Wolves’ supremely well organised defence. The action was tight and intense.The hosts were the first to threaten, albeit without mustering a shot in the eighth minute after Raul Jiménez tricked and bullied his way past three defenders before feeding Matt Doherty, whose cross was turned behind for a corner.United, though full of energy and bold intent, did not really disturb their hosts until the 18th minute. Pogba released Rashford with a smart pass from midfield, then Rashford toyed with Ryan Bennett on the left before pinging over a wicked cross towards Martial. With two defenders challenging him, the striker was unable to finish from close range.Still, Solskjær could take heart from his youthful’s side vigour. James, though, had to accept a lesson in the 24th minute when he was booked for simulation after nudging the ball past João Moutinho and taking a tumble. Maybe that was borne of the youngster’s frustration at being unable to get much involved in the game. Soon, however, United came up with something more admirably inventive. And Wolves had no answer.In the 27th minute Scott McTominay and Lingard combined sharply before Rashford slipped a cute pass through to Martial, who raced away from Willy Boly and rammed a first-time shot high into the net. Patrício had no chance.Now United had the home team where they wanted them. Wolves would have to open up more, at some point. But, deprived of the ball, Wolves’ first thought was to avoid suffering more damage as United’s passing and movement grew even more confident. In the 35th minute Coady had to step in to make a vital tackle on Martial after the forward wriggled past Bennett in the box. Moments later Boly had to strain to intercept a clever looped pass by Pogba towards Martial. Just before half-time Boly had to charge to the rescue again to thwart Martial after the increasingly troublesome striker forced Bennett into a mistake at the edge of the box. Wolves welcomed half-time when it came.Nuno made shrewd use of the pause, replacing Doherty with Traoré, who used his exhilarating pace to push United backwards and spread alarm in United’s defence.After a free-kick won by Traoré and delivered by Moutinho, Jiménez glanced a header against a post. One minute later Wolves drew level in brilliant style.After a short corner on the right, Moutinho pulled the ball back to Neves at the edge of the area. The younger Portuguese took a touch and then swept a wonderful curling shot into the net via the crossbar. The home crowd rejoiced and hoped VAR would not make them look silly VAR kept them on tenterhooks for two minutes before confirming there had been no offside in the buildup.Pogba led United’s attempt to regain a grip on the game. He gained an ideal chance to restore their lead when he was tripped by Coady following a one-two with Lingard. Patricio read his powerfully struck spot-kick and batted it away.At least United did not unravel the way they did here in April when, after taking a lead, they collapsed to a 2-1 defeat. But Traoré, in particular, continued to worry them. One superb run and cross from him in the 82nd minute led to Jonny forcing a save from David De Gea."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bf8bd11975656b9cd9477b819823f8caeeffea74/0_208_2685_1611/master/2685.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=35621dece01e9a5b4699af0a6946d3e2","title":"vicente moreno mallorca eibar la liga","story":"Dani Rodríguez had been a first ision footballer for three minutes and 19 seconds when the ball dropped at his feet by the centre spot and the pitch and a whole new world opened up, inviting him in. High in the stand at Son Moix, a Mallorca director edged forward and, he later admitted, thought: “Run, Forrest, run!” All around, 15,127 fans had pretty much the same idea. Down below, Dani did too. So he ran: fast and straight. “I set off like mad it felt like a whole herd chasing me,” he said with a grin – and he got away, reaching the edge of the area before anyone from Eibar could catch him: 40 metres, four seconds, four touches. A fifth and the ball was in the net.Rodríguez carried on running but this time the herd heading after him were his own players: primera. Fists were in the air, supporters leaping into each others’ arms, released at last, footballers tumbling and shouting. Mallorca were 1-0 up on the opening night. Only, the referee had his finger in his ear. Guadalupe Porras, his female assistant, the first in La Liga history, stopped and then they all did, as if someone had pressed pause. “You must have thought: ‘Hostia, bloody hell, don’t take this off me’,” Rodríguez was asked afterwards. “Yeah, and in those words,” he replied, “I didn’t even know what they were looking at: there was nothing wrong with it.”What they were looking at was Real Mallorca’s first goal in the first ision since 2013 and Rodríguez was right: there was nothing wrong with it. Just a lot that was right. Mallorca had been to hell and back, dropping from first ision to second and then to second B, down where pitches are far from perfect, municipal sports centres for homes, some worrying that their very survival was in doubt. But on Saturday night here they were, back again. Consecutive promotions, both via the play-offs – only the second team ever to do so after Granada in 2011 – had returned them to the top flight and they had scored within four minutes. It had been fast, even if it did not feel like it to some fans, and so perhaps another minute waiting for the VAR would not matter much. They had already waited six years after all.In a way his story was all of theirs a bunch of football players that probably never expected to be here but were not going to hold back now, 1-0 up and dominating, tearing into their opponents. Ante Budimir put one over from four yards. And while Eibar recovered, Fabián Orellana outstanding and Paulo Oliveira equalising, Mallorca did not fold. Instead they got the winner when Joan Sastre’s cross was deflected by Oliveira and looped in with 15 minutes left to make it 2-1, a result met at the end by a huge roar. It was, Diario de Mallorca said, a “first-class victory”. “A triumphant return,” Ultima Hora called it. “A sweet awakening.”“I could never have imagined this in my wildest dreams,” Salva Sevilla had said when Mallorca were promoted back to the first ision in June and he spoke for all of them there on Saturday. When Mallorca-born Xisco Campos, the club captain at 37, came on with four minutes to go to a huge cheer, it was his first top-flight game since the 2004-05 season and he played only three ever. “I was especially happy for him on his ‘re-debut’, and in his home,” the manager, Vicente Moreno, said.The day Salva Sevilla left Eyol, it was to join Mallorca in Segunda B. One could call it Spain’s third tier but, organised in four 20-team regional groups, usually excluded when people here talk about “fútbol profesional”, it is anything from third tier to seventh and known as “the well”. It is easy enough to fall into but almost impossible to climb out of again. Relegated from the first ision to the second in 2012-13, after 16 consecutive seasons there, Mallorca had been relegated again, falling into the well at the end of 2016-17.It was not supposed to be this way: Mallorca had been bought by Robert Sarver, owner of the Phoenix Suns, in January 2016, when he spent €20.62m on shares. His president is the former tennis player, Andrew Kohlberg. Steve Nash, the former basketball player, is on the board. So is Graeme Le Saux. And the CEO is Maheta Molango, a lawyer who scored 12 seconds into his debut at Brighton and also played for Lincoln, Oldham, Wrexham and Grays Athletic.Mallorca had come out of administration in 2012, with a payment plan that obliged them to return €40m over 10 years. The arrival of Sarver and Nash brought stability and promised the end of the bitter civil war that had crippled the club for so long. But as the Spanish phrase goes: if the ball does not want to go in … “Mallorca are a first ision club who happen to be in the second ision,” Sarver had said but by the end of the 2016-17 season they were not even that. For the first time in 36 years they found themselves out of “professional football”. “Everything that could go wrong did,” Molango said. “We’ve made mistakes and we’re sorry.” Javier Recio, the sporting director, vowed to “give back what we’ve taken away”.They did not throw it all away. There was patience and a plan. That summer they brought in the new coach Moreno, who had previously won promotion from Segunda B with Nastic. They approached some players with three-year contracts, not the usual single year, promising they were building to return, and constructed a team for Segunda B but also for beyond. Sevilla was their first signing, dropping from first to third tier. Others followed.He, Moreno and the rest made their debuts at Peralada, in a municipal ground that holds 1,500 against a team that had been taken over by Girona to be their B team. By the end of the season they had been promoted. By the end of the following season they had been promoted again. On Saturday first ision football returned to the island.“I never thought I was leaving the elite behind,” Sevilla insisted, but truthfully he never thought this either. None of them did. And even if they imagined Mallorca getting there, many would not have imagined getting there with them. Most teams, when they get to the first ision, obsessed by “experience” there, change almost the entire team, denying them the reward they fought for. Some ditch the manager too.Like Saturday’s opponents Eibar, a model for most to follow, Mallorca have not. Of the starting XI only Febas and Lumor Agbenyenu were new: five had played in Segunda B with them and four in the second ision (including Iddrisu Baba, from the youth team). It is true they have signed nine players and want four more before 2 September it is true, too, that they know it will be hard to survive and insist on humility – acting “as if we were the shittest of the shit” – aware that, at €29m, they have the ision’s smallest operating budget. It is also true that they won promotion on 23 June, a month after everyone else had finished, denying them preparation time. They know they will have to wait to see which players are left. But Saturday’s line-up was not just circumstantial nor was the result. It is the way they want it.As one beaming director put it after the game, long after everyone had gone: “I really, really like my team.”So does Moreno, although he is pushing for more players. Already revered on the island, he was making his first ision coaching debut at the same ground as he had made his first ision playing debut for Xérez a decade before. “Seven of those who played with us in Segunda B got on the pitch tonight. What sometimes looks like a handicap can be an advantage,” he said afterwards. “Having players from before allows our ideas to be put into practice more quickly.” Then he added something that, at least at some level, is even more important: “And this is a group of players who deserve to enjoy this opportunity because they’re the ones who brought us here.”On Saturday night Mallorca’s players did. They had earned it, nobody else. And they took it. Fast. It was early when Dani Rodríguez set off running and late by the time he left, walking out of Son Moix with his son, “Papá 14” printed on the back of a mini-Mallorca shirt. “Life can be wonderful,” he said as he went.• You are 38 and a half, you are beginning your last ever season, time almost up, you go on with two minutes left, not long enough to do anything, and your opponents are Barcelona. Yeah. And? Erm. And you are Aritz Aduriz, so you do what you do, of course. The strange case of the man who gets better as he gets older and who took that penalty got even more stupidly brilliant when he scored a ludicrous overhead kick to defeat Barcelona and send San Mamés wild. “He’s an animal,” Athletic Bilbao’s manager, Gaizka Garitano, said. “I have coached a lot of players but no one quite like him.” So, could the season’s best goal end up being its first?• 21 July: Zinedine Zidane says the sooner Gareth Bale leaves, “the better”. 17 August: Bale starts Real Madrid’s opening game of the season, provides the superb assist for the opening goal in a 3-1 win at Celta – meaning Madrid are ahead of Barcelona and top for the first time in 818 days – and heads home post-game having heard his manager say: “He’s staying.”• Another Briton, another assist. On a very impressive debut, Kieran Trippier produced a wonderful ball for the only goal for Atlético against Getafe. That said, a moment from João Félix eclipsed everything else. Somehow, he went 70 metres, past three, getting kicked, pushed and pulled, all the way up the other end, part power, part quality, part sheer bloodymindedness, all genius, to win a penalty. Which Álvaro Morata missed.• Chimy Ávila belter. Three words that vont tres bien ensemble. The scorer of last season’s best goal did it again – and on the opening day once more.• And, yes, the refereeing could even have got worse. Which is pretty impressive.• Full Monchi. Sevilla had seven new signings in their side and a new manager, too. Julen Lopetegui ’s team beat Eyol 2-0.• It was a good weekend for the new teams: Mallorca won, Osasuna won (somehow) and Granada scored four but did not win. Which leads us to … • Always go to Villarreal. Well, obviously: Santi Cazorla’s there. And he scored this weekend. As did Roberto Soldado on his return to Spain. But there is more, as Spain’s premier soccer statistician Mr Chip noted this weekend after a 4-4 draw with Granada: there have been 7,076 games this century and only 10 4-4 draws. Four of those have been at the Madrigal."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/30ccb84c22fc89462fe415eba880600d91c1e134/0_53_960_576/master/960.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9f09031270a40c5a98534e53786f4972","title":"how we met when i saw his profile picture i thought what have i agreed to go on a date with","story":"Charlotte and Jack Cook live in Cambridgeshire. Charlotte, 25, is a teaching assistant for children with special educational needs. Jack, 31, is a land agentThe first time Charlotte and Jack met – as her first shift at a clothes shop ended and his began – they talked for about 15 minutes and Charlotte went home with a giddy feeling. “I was like: ‘Mum, there’s this guy at work and he’s so cute and he seems really nice,’” she says. “I was thinking about him all week, because we were going to be on the same shift the following Saturday, and I was so excited. When I got there I said: ‘Hi, how’s it going?’ And he said: ‘I’m Jack, nice to meet you.’ I was so crushed.”Jack laughs. “I don’t remember us meeting. But that second time we met, I was very taken with Charlotte.” They chatted throughout their shift. “It was long hours,” he says. “We talked about everything from where we went to school to what type of food we liked. The manager pulled me to one side and said I needed to stop talking to Charlotte because I was distracting her from her work.” And did he? “No.”It was November 2011. Jack had finished university that summer and was working in the shop, and Charlotte, still at sixth form, had taken a Saturday job there for the Christmas period. After working that shift together, they exchanged numbers and agreed to go out on a date. “Then he added me on Facebook,” says Charlotte. “I took one look at your profile picture and I thought: ‘What have I agreed to go on a date with?’ Because it was so cringe – you had one leg cocked and your collar up, leaning against the door frame.” Jack laughs. “I obviously thought it was a good one.”They went out anyway, to the cinema, where they watched a terrible film. “It gave us lots to talk about,” says Jack. On their second date, they took a picnic to a local stately home and walked up to the folly (it would be the location where, five years later, Jack would propose to Charlotte). “I think we were official quite quickly,” says Charlotte.What did she like about him? “I thought he was quite cheeky. Jack is the sort of person who will go up to anyone and talk to them and instantly make them feel really comfortable. He’s just very cheerful.” Jack says: “She was very attractive but very down to earth, quirky, a bit of a bookworm.”Charlotte went to university in Liverpool after finishing school, and the relationship survived the distance and time apart between visits. “I came back from university …” says Charlotte. “I remember the date,” says Jack. Charlotte says: “I had a year when I lived with my mum and dad, and you lived with your mum and dad.”They got engaged in March 2016, and moved in together in August that year. “We never lived together until we bought a house together,” says Jack.Why does it work? “I think we balance each other out in a lot of things,” says Charlotte. “Our values are quite similar. However, our likes and personalities are quite different.” Whereas Jack is practical and methodical, Charlotte says she is “the complete opposite. I’m quite chaotic and maybe don’t think about things in the most straightforward way. Which is good, because sometimes you do something and I think: ‘I never would have thought of that, but it makes life so much easier.’ We both make each other think of things differently.” Jack says: “It’s good to be with someone who surprises you. Our approaches are quite different but I like to think we share a lot of goals.”They married in July 2017 and their son, Arthur, was born last year. They also have a dog and an allotment. “We knew that at some point the thing we would like was to live somewhere rural and have a family and quite a simple life,” says Charlotte, and they have made it happen.Want to share your story?

I am definitely thinking it today. My warrior II would have been discharged from military service. My eagle pose looks like a cheese plait. It is not even clear I can lie on the floor properly. Sweating, shaking, constantly on the verge of toppling over, at least here I can partially blame the fact that the room keeps changing hue.That is because I am trying a 90-minute Spectrum yoga and meditation session, conducted in a special colour-shifting studio in Whitechapel, east London (available via a MoveGB membership, £19.99 a week). On the wall at the front of the class are panels of large bulbs, emitting bright light. It is very Sunday Night at the London Palladium. I feel as if I am dying, but at least I am in good company.This variety of yoga was created by Mandy Jhamat, my tutor today, who developed the concept with Pierre Van Obberghen, a “colour expert”. The class is based on vinyasa flow, incorporating salutations, standing poses and balances – or, in my case, a blancmange of all three.We start with the room full of white light (which contains all the colours of the spectrum) before moving into aquarium turquoise, buttery yellow and breakdown-at-the-nuclear-plant red.The flicker-free, deep-colour immersion is striking: it is as if I am in a music video or a Tate Modern installation. It is pretty cool – or would be if I could remove my knees from my ears. I am not sure the colours are aiding me, but I am too all over the place to be sensitive to it.The connection between colour and energy is plausible, though. Colour has a biochemical, psychological, emotional effect on us. Think about food, or art, or the eyes of your beloved. The inside of McDonald’s isn’t bright red and yellow because it was designed by a clown it is because those colours make us feel hungry and eat quickly, encouraging a high turnaround. (Actually, the seating these days is soft green and lower-lit. Nudging our minds to believe they are in Starbucks, perhaps? Why are you so stupid, mind?)After the yoga, there is a 25-minute guided meditation, in which we lie on the floor. This will, I think, be a better way for me to experience the vibrational potentialities of colour and focus on Jhamat’s concept. We are offered the option of a blanket or a weighted eye mask, the latter of which surely defeats the point of bathing yourself in a colour field. Jhamat leads us through a guided meditation exploring our chakras, each of which – according to tantra – has a corresponding colour. We start bathed in red, the root chakra, before the bulbs soften into the orange of the sacral chakra and lighten into the yellow of the solar plexus chakra, the best chakra. “Team Plexus for the win!” I chuckle inside my head, because I have difficulty controlling my stupid thoughts.Meanwhile, Jhamat is having trouble controlling the lights. They are meant to move through the spectrum, but are stuck on the green of the heart chakra. She is talking about the blue of the throat, the purple of the crown, but it doesn’t match the mossy light filling the room. It is like being inside a faulty traffic light. Imagine if all traffic lights were stuck on green, I think, struggling to focus on “the indigo of my third eye”. That would be the same as having no traffic lights. I see cars piling up on one another twisted metal. This is not the class’s intended effect.I peek to see Jhamat fiddling with the control box, then turning one of the light panels off and on, then giving up. I feel for her. She continues to talk to the class in a measured way, as if nothing is wrong. Behind me, someone is snoring. It has been an excellent yoga class, followed by a strange meditation experience with some gorgeous nu-rave colours. But I am not sure how much can be said for Spectrum, at least when the equipment isn’t working properly. I am not convinced. Perhaps someone greenlit this too soon.Studies have indicated that if we got rid of traffic lights, there would be fewer accidents.Yellow? Is it me you’re looking for? No. 25"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/48205f60c3e5f8224c41c6b1cab3c71725fe974e/0_300_5811_3488/master/5811.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b8de91736e2d29d6a1aa84444269a1be","title":"do not feed the pigeons and nine other unwritten rules about london","story":"London is a city with its own quirks and customs, but this Londoner’s guide will help you avoid any sticky situations when visiting the capital ...The tubeFor something that has the sole aim of getting people from A to B, the tube is fraught with potential faux pas. One main rule is that you should always stand on the right on escalators. If you dare to break this, you’ll be met with a lot of muttering and eye-rolls, although no one will dare to berate you personally. You must also never, ever make eye contact with a stranger on the tube, or, worse, smile at them. This invades the Londoner’s sense of private space, even if you’re standing in a different carriage.Pigeons come sprinkled with a touch of glamour when they’re gathered en masse in St Mark’s Square in Venice not so much when they’re in Trafalgar Square on a drizzly Tuesday. Do not feed them, do not encourage them to come near you, and do not interact with them at all. They say ‘beware the flying rats’ for a reason.London may not quite be New York – although we’re certainly trying to keep up the skyscraper count – but it still loves its bagels. A fierce rivalry exists between the city’s two classic purveyors on Brick Lane in-the-know purists head to Beigel Bake at number 159 for its hot salt beef with mustard, while its neighbour at number 155, Beigel Shop, does a mean smoked salmon with cream cheese. Beigel Shop has been here since 1855, while upstart Beigel Bake only started in 1974, but both are open 24 hours – and, boy, the service only gets better from two in the morning.Oxford StreetTo outsiders, it’s still seen as a shopping nirvana: over a mile of high-street stores and the odd independent boutique. Londoners, however, know there are better options nearby for the shopper uninterested in souvenir stores (although hats off to Selfridges, a true gem). Try Spitalfields for an East End market buzz, or Dover Street in the West End for high fashion and price tags to match.The Tower of LondonNot many Londoners have actually ever been inside this, but they do know that it’s brimming over with history, stuffed with ravens, and there are some rather nice crown jewels inside. Oh, and that there are a couple of princes still stuck in the actual tower, although we’re not exactly sure what they’re doing there.Crossing the riverOnce you are friends with a Londoner, your allegiance is not only to him or her, but to the area north or south of the river where they live. If you are loyal to someone from the north, you must never go south, and vice versa. Crossing the river is something Londoners only do in an emergency (or for work, if their job happens to be on the opposite side of the Thames from where they live), and weekends must be spent not only in one’s designated compass point, but also bad-mouthing the other.A Londoner will raise his or her head from theirs only if he or she is literally about to be run over by a bus. Otherwise, forget it. Walking down a London street is a bit like playing a game of Frogger, only you’re on a pavement, and the “cars” are phone-obsessed pedestrians. Don’t expect anyone to come and help if you’re looking lost, or start chatting if you’re in a pub everyone will be on their phone, browsing Tinder, booking an Uber, or playing whatever the modern version of Frogger is.One of London’s finest traditions is the illustrious black cab, immediately recognisable by their yellow illuminated signs, shuddering, noisy diesel engines, and adorably knowledgeable drivers, who love nothing better than to get into a debate about their favourite football team, and the performances of its starting eleven over the weekend – you can bank on the fact that each one would have played better if the driver himself was their manager, of course. It’s up to you whether you get involved in the conversation, although this may also depend on how many pints you have sampled at that other Great British institution, the pub.PubsLondon pubs tend to be full of history this also sometimes means they are full of threadbare carpet, peeling wallpaper, and musty cellars. Don’t let that stop you buying a pint of possibly overpriced lager, however, because that atmosphere does not just contain damp it also contains the breath of a thousand London icons – actors Peter O’Toole and Diana Dors, painters Francis Bacon and Lucian Freud, gangsters such as the Kray Twins, and musicians from Dizzee Rascal to David Bowie.Sometimes it’s nice to leaveAs cosmopolitan and fascinating as London is, sometimes it’s nice to explore beyond it.

He played me Andy Williams’s version of Everything I Own, and said: “Ken, when you get back home to Jamaica, make sure you do this song.” In those days, you needed 10 or more songs to complete an album. So in 1974, when we were in Federal studios in Kingston searching for a 10th song, I remembered Everything I Own.The producer wasn’t keen because he liked to keep control and suggest the songs, but when I started singing “You sheltered me from harm …” everyone’s eyes lit up. At the time, there was a lot of violence in Jamaica, so the words meant something to us. The studio owner came in and said: “If that song isn’t a hit, I’m going to sell the whole studio complex.”I loved the song so much and wanted to bring something to it that people would remember, so I reached inside myself for the vocal. It became a Jamaican No 1 and the Trojan label picked it up for the UK. I was at home when the postman brought a telegram telling me the BBC wanted me on Top of the Pops.I didn’t have time to go to London because I was playing shows, and we didn’t have a video, so the BBC put a guy at a window with a shadow covering his face, miming to the song – everybody thought it was me. A couple of weeks later I did Top of the Pops for real. I was on the programme 14 times in all with this song and its follow-up Crying Over You, appearing alongside people like Elton John and Hot Chocolate. When the song became a British No 1, Bob Marley called to congratulate me. There were a lot of Jamaican songs in the British charts in that period. It was a happy time for reggae.After it was a hit, I found out that Trojan were going bankrupt. I flew to London and there was nobody in the office, just record covers strewn everywhere. I hadn’t received my royalties and my career went down the drain for a while – I lost everything I own, just like in the song, but I never gave up on music. I’ve done a lot of songs but I’m always very grateful to David Gates, who wrote it. I’ve just done a new acoustic version for the film Inna De Yard. Today, whenever I sing it live, the entire audience sings it with me.My father was kind and gentle and revered by everyone. He told me: “People will do what you do, not what you say.” He always had time for me and taught me to read and write music, play various instruments and introduced me to classical music, my foundation. One year I sent my mom an orchid for her birthday, which I could scarcely afford. She was so touched – my dad wrote to tell me I could have had “anything she owned” in return.My father died in 1963 and I wanted to write a song in memory of him. He did live to see some of my early progress towards success, but not the major songs or stardom with Bread. As with all my songs, the music led and the words tried to keep up, but they came pretty quickly. I wrote the lyrics – “I would give everything I own just to have you back again” – so that they could be interpreted as a love song, but when I played it for my wife, she knew right away that it was about my father. She cried.Years after it was written, I started to reveal to audiences what it was about. The song is an opportunity to feel very strong emotions for the loss of a time with someone you loved. I’ve been fortunate to watch it have such an impact on so many people.• Inna De Yard premieres at the Film4 Summer Screen at Somerset House, London, on 21 August and is released in cinemas on 30 August."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/730237ffa2cfeaf63b98492517e36edb839bf5b1/0_10_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=90e514ce9a8b88fcd1b3eb4ac12fff4c","title":"mmr vaccine one in seven five year olds in england may not be immunised","story":"Public Health England issues warning as UK loses measles-free status and PM pledges action on social media firmsOne in seven five-year-olds may not be up to date with their MMR immunisation, Public Health England has warned, rising to one in four in London.Measles cases have been rising across Europe, where many families have been on holiday. There have already been 230 cases in England in the first quarter of the year. Doubts about the jab, fuelled by anti-vaxxers, have spread across social media. The World Health Organization has withdrawn the UK’s measles-free status because of the outbreaks.PHE has revealed that about 30,000 children are starting primary school next month with no protection against measles, mumps and rubella, while 90,000 have had only the first of the two vaccines necessary for protection. It follows the prime minister’s announcement that he will urge social media companies to do more to combat misinformation disseminated across the internet about vaccine safety.Boris Johnson is not backing compulsory immunisation before primary school, however, which has been adopted in a number of European countries including France and Italy. But the health secretary, Matt Hancock, has said it is something that should not be ruled out. The prime minister instead wants GP practices to promote catch-up vaccinations for children who have missed the routine MMR jab at 12 months and the pre-school booster.“The UK generally has a great record on fighting measles, but for the first time we’re suddenly going in the wrong direction,” Johnson said on a visit to a hospital in Truro.“I’m afraid people have just been listening to that superstitious mumbo-jumbo on the internet, all that anti-vax stuff, and thinking that the MMR vaccine is a bad idea. That’s wrong. Please get your kids vaccinated.”“It’s not just the right thing for them, but also of course it’s the right thing for the whole population,” Johnson said. “It might not be your kid that gets it. It could be somebody else’s.”The numbers of children having the four-in-one booster against diphtheria, whooping cough, tetanus and polio has also fallen. About 100,000 (around one in eight) five-year-olds in England are thought not to have had the jab, which is normally given at about three years and four months, said PHE.Dr Mary Ramsay, head of immunisation at PHE, urged parents to check their children had had the full set of vaccinations. “It’s a real concern that so many young children – as many as a quarter of a reception class in some areas – could be starting school without the full protection that the NHS childhood immunisation programme offers for free. We know that parents want the best protection for their children and so many may be unaware that their child is not up to date,” she said.“We’re particularly concerned about children being at greater risk of measles. We’re continuing to see outbreaks of the disease occurring in communities across the country, many linked to visiting European countries over the summer holidays. It’s crucial that children have maximum protection as they begin to mix with other children at the start of their school journey.”More than half a million children in the UK were not vaccinated against measles between 2010 and 2017, according to a recent report by Unicef.“I applaud the prime minister’s initiative and his recognition that this is not only a matter of service delivery, but also restoring vaccine confidence.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d19df985060b01b2aa77af69e64d0686de3432ab/0_52_5166_3100/master/5166.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c4c61a12dddafe4eb697a446fdf0307b","title":"helping nine year old eating disorder recovery podcast","story":"We hear about the importance of early intervention in rare cases of pre-teen eating disorders.

With the pace of play in the spotlight following the antics of Bryson DeChambeau, the move means attention will also fall on what steps the PGA Tour in the US will take.Starting from late November, a player on the European Tour will incur a one-shot penalty for two bad times in a single round. Fines for those who are consistently needing to be timed – known as being “on the clock” – will be increased significantly. A player who is timed 15 times next season will be fined £26,000 compared with £9,000 now.The tour will also reduce field sizes where possible, a factor considered integral to the pace of play. Its members will be offered educational sessions as part of the detailed, four-point action plan.The tour insists this is not a reaction to DeChambeau’s slow play during the Northern Trust event in New Jersey. The world No 9’s glacial approach led to him being criticised by fellow players, including Brooks Koepka and Justin Thomas, while the PGA Tour promised to review pace-of-play guidelines.In Europe, the tour was approached by players on its tournament committee in May with a view to putting a plan in place for next season.Rory McIlroy, a European Tour member who spends the majority of his time on the PGA Tour, supports stroke penalties as the best way to counter slow play.A European Tour statement said: “When players are out of position and either being monitored or timed, a one-shot penalty will be incurred after two bad times – currently a player would be ‘monitored’ and if he breaches the time allowance (50 seconds for first to play, 40 seconds for second or third to play) he will then be ‘officially timed’ and would then have to breach twice more before being given a one-shot penalty. Players will, however, have the option to request one time extension per round, giving an additional 40 seconds to hit a shot on this request.”Referees will be told to be proactive in targeting known slow players with regards being in position to play.Keith Pelley, the chief executive of the European Tour, said: “We are already at the forefront of pace of play management in the professional game, but after being mandated by our tournament committee to be even firmer in dealing with this issue, the time was right to take these additional steps.“I believe the plan we are implementing for the 2020 season will bring about meaningful change that will make golf even more enjoyable for the players and our fans, whether they are at the course in person or watching on television.”A statement from the tour added: “All players will now be required to pass an interactive rules test as part of their conditions of membership, while new members will be allocated a dedicated referee to educate them on pace of play policies at the start of their European Tour career.”A trial of technology dedicated to pace of play will be undertaken at the BMW PGA Championship at Wentworth on 18-22 September. Larger gaps between start times in the third and fourth rounds of tournaments will be implemented."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/44cb8cb62935222e0c81409711fce289a62446d4/0_0_3529_2118/master/3529.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c3d8b493ebf6ccf309c5ee871527c22d","title":"three years in the nfl wilderness what colin kaepernick lost and won","story":"It’s difficult to know exactly how Kaepernick views his time in the NFL wilderness. Nevertheless, it’s worth asking: after three years, what has he accomplished – and at what cost?Over the last three years, Kenny Stills has not stuck to sports.Instead, the Miami Dolphins receiver has kneeled during the national anthem before games to protest racial injustice. Taken an off-season road trip through the American south to visit community activists and civil rights movement landmarks. Publicly called out his own boss, Dolphins owner Stephen Ross, for the seeming incongruity of founding a nonprofit dedicated to racial equality – while also hosting a recent reelection fundraiser for US president Donald Trump.The timeframe of his activism, Stills said, is hardly coincidental.“Colin Kaepernick has played a really big part in helping open my eyes,” Stills said. “He’s influenced me and everything I’ve done from the time I first took a knee on September 11, 2016, to now.”Last week marked three years since Kaepernick first brought attention to police brutality against people of color by sitting during the national anthem, a protest that ultimately led to the former San Francisco 49ers quarterback’s athletic exile.Since then, Kaepernick has been awarded Amnesty International’s top honor. He has drawn Trump’s ire. He has inspired athletes like Stills, and been labeled a “traitor” by a NFL executive. He has served as the face of a multimillion-dollar Nike marketing campaign, and donated $1m to community charities. He has accused league owners of colluding to keep him out of football, and kept himself ready to play again.A persona non grata in his sport, Kaepernick stands as a symbol of conscience outside of it. Yet for the most part, the quarterback has maintained radio silence, choosing to communicate with the media and public by sharing other people’s words on Twitter.As such, it’s difficult to know exactly how Kaepernick views his time in the NFL wilderness. Nevertheless, it’s worth asking: after three years, what has he accomplished – and at what cost?“Colin is a pioneer,” said Andrew Brandt, a former NFL front office executive who now writes about the league and is a sports law professor at Villanova University. “He is a beacon for other athletes. We can all talk about his impact. But he’s also not getting to do what he wants, which is play football. He has been ostracized.”For now, at least, the answers depend on where you look.When Kaepernick first began protesting during the 2016 NFL preseason, he understood his actions would be controversial – and that he was taking a career risk.“I am not looking for approval,” he said at the time. “If they take football away, my endorsements from me, I know that I stood up for what is right.”Before Kaepernick sat, athletes ranging from WNBA players to the five members of the Los Angeles Rams to the NBA’s LeBron James, Carmelo Anthony, Chris Paul, and Dwayne Wade had taken public stances against the racial injustice and police violence that spurred the formation of the Black Lives Matter movement and protests in places such as Ferguson, Missouri.After meeting with former NFL player and US Army veteran Nate Boyer, Kaepernick switched from sitting during the anthem to kneeling, the better to “show more respect for the men and women who fight for the country.”Nevertheless, then-Republican presidential nominee Trump said that Kaepernick should “find a country that works better for him”. Supreme Court justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg labeled the quarterback’s actions “dumb and disrespectful”.Meanwhile, conservative talk radio host Rush Limbaugh echoed a critique made by some football fans, lamenting that Kaepernick’s protests reflected the “politicization of everything”.Within the NFL, reaction to Kaepernick was mixed – and largely split along racial and labor-management lines.Then-49ers safety Eric Reid and other teammates joined the quarterback’s protests. Over the course of the season, African-American players for other teams followed suit, including Malcom Jenkins, Arian Foster, and Stills.By contrast, seven anonymous league executives told journalist Mike Freeman that they wouldn’t sign Kaepernick to their teams. One called the quarterback a “traitor”. Another stated, “he has no respect for our country. Fuck that guy.”“In my career,” a NFL general manger told Freeman, “I have never seen a guy so hated by front office guys as Kaepernick.”Kaepernick entered free agency in the 2017 offseason as an accomplished performer at a position of perpetual league need. Over six seasons, the quarterback had thrown for 12,271 yards and 72 touchdown passes with just 30 interceptions rushed for 2,300 yards and 13 touchdowns and led the 49ers to a Super Bowl appearance.He also had appeared on the cover of the popular Madden NFL video game.Despite that resume, Kaepernick went unsigned by the NFL’s 32 teams. In June 2017, league commissioner Roger Goodell suggested that his absence was purely the result of “football decisions”.As NFL teams subsequently hired a series of less-accomplished signal callers – including Zac Dysert, Josh Woodrum, and the immortal Matt Simms – Goodell’s assertion appeared increasingly dubious. In October 2017, Kaepernick filed a grievance against the league, accusing team owners of colluding to keep him from being signed because of his “advocacy for equality and social justice”.Last February, Kaepernick and the NFL reached a confidential settlement of the case reportedly worth less than $10m. A few weeks earlier, an anonymous survey of 85 NFL defensive players by the Athletic found that 81 believed he deserved a roster spot in the league.Today, however, Kaepernick remains a quarterback without a team – a former Pro Bowl performer whose most recent touchdown pass to a NFL player came in a March charity game.“You’ve had people who have gotten DUIs coming back to the league,” said Lou Moore, a history professor at Grand Valley State University and author of We Will Win the Day: The Civil Rights Movement, the Black Athlete, and the Quest for Equality. “Michael Vick came back to the league after dogfighting.Before Kaepernick’s first protest, Stills said, he wasn’t particularly interested in politics. He had never voted. He paid more attention to video games than to news. He didn’t know a lot about American history.“It isn’t something we talked about much in my household,” he said.Kaepernick sparked a change. Stills decided to vote in the 2016 election. He began keeping up with current events. He had long discussions with Foster, then his teammate on the Dolphins, who encouraged Stills to read and educate himself.Stills started with The New Jim Crow: Mass Incarceration in the Age of Colorblindness, a critique of systemic racial discrimination in the justice system, then moved on to the works of African-American literary giant James Baldwin and civil rights leader John Lewis.Stills shared what he was learning with family and friends. He organized his community service road trip. He began protesting during the anthem and also working with South Florida police, children, and community groups.“People definitely ask me to stick to sports, and I totally understand where they are coming from. You want to be entertained, and get away from all the things that are happening. But that is also coming from a place of privilege.“How do you think people feel who have lost kids to police brutality? Don’t you think they want to live their lives and be entertained like something never happened to them? I still catch passes and touchdowns and the games still go on – but these things are happening to human beings. It shouldn’t be hard to have a little bit of empathy.”Stills isn’t alone. Soccer star Megan Rapinoe took a knee during the anthem in 2016 – and since has been anything but shy in expressing her disapproval of Trump. College and high school athletes have staged anthem protests.So have American hammer thrower Gwen Berry and fencer Race Imboden, who this month protested social injustice and Trump by raising a fist and taking a knee, respectively, on the medals stand at the Pan American Games.The Players Coalition, a group of NFL players, leveraged anthem protests into a $89m social justice partnership with the league.Moore said that Kaepernick has helped revive and galvanize a tradition of athlete activism that peaked in the 1960s when Muhammad Ali refused to fight in the Vietnam War and American track athletes John Carlos and Tommie Smith gave black power salutes on the podium at the 1968 Summer Olympics.That tradition largely went dormant in the 1980s and 1990s – in part because Ali, Carlos and Smith lost work and endorsement opportunities for their actions, and in part because many athletes followed the smiling, stick-to-sports examples of superstar pitchmen OJ Simpson and Michael Jordan, who embodied an anodyne ethos reflected in Jordan’s (possibly apocryphal) proclamation that “Republicans buy sneakers, too”.Times change. Last September, the sports apparel company long associated with Jordan – Nike – featured Kaepernick in an advertising campaign with the slogan, “Believe in something, even if it means sacrificing everything”.“Kaepernick’s actions and then the treatment he received are really the exclamation point on this new era of athlete activism,” said Kenneth Shropshire, CEO of the Global Sport Institute at Arizona State University and author of The Miseducation of the Student Athlete: How to Fix College Sports.“A lot of people have tried to pinpoint where it began,” Shropshire said. “Was it the Rams? Was it LeBron in Miami with Trayvon Martin? What has become clear is that after folks saw Kaepernick, something different was going on.”Earlier this month, Kaepernick posted a workout video on Twitter. Referring to his ongoing exile and desire to play, the post’s caption read “5am. 5 days a week. For 3 years. Still Ready.”Brandt said that it’s unlikely that the 31-year-old free agent will get another NFL opportunity – at least not on the field.“It’s not a question of talent,” Brandt said. “There are over 100 quarterbacks on rosters right now. And no one disputes that he is a top 100 quarterback. I think for teams, it just becomes: ‘Is he worth the drama?’“But time heals all wounds. Maybe in five years, the NFL hires him for social activism. I think at some point there will be some kind of detente that does not involve him playing.”Ali, Smith and Carlos were once reviled and shunned. Today, all three are widely admired – both for taking conscientious stands and enduring the price of doing so. Ali lit the Olympic flame at the 1996 Atlanta Games, while Smith and Carlos have been honored with a fist-raising statue at San Jose State University, their alma mater.Moore said that Kaepernick will someday enjoy similar public regard.For now, Kaepernick continues to work, donating money to community charities and staging his Know Your Rights camps for young people. He also continues to wait. Last week, the NFL announced that Jay Z – who previously had expressed public support for the quarterback – would co-produce upcoming Super Bowl halftime shows and help promote the league’s social justice projects.At a press conference, however, the headlining music mogul repeatedly was asked about one man. “Everyone’s saying, ‘How are you going forward if Kaep doesn’t have a job?’” Jay Z said. “This was not about him having a job.” That much rang false, and in a larger sense true, a reminder of everything Kaepernick has lost and won."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3e16f45da0409cfa01e37dc70853442ded16a456/151_9_4143_2487/master/4143.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6b6d278711747677825af0df19efa025","title":"steve smith jofra archer australia england the ashes headingley","story":"Australia’s key problem heading into the third Test surrounds their best batsman while England have a new special weaponThe respite between Tests is brief but at least there is some scope for measured decisions. For Australia the key problem surrounds their best batsman, Steve Smith.During the Lord’s match there was barely any time for their backroom staff to decide whether he should resume his innings on Saturday afternoon. Citing the fact Smith was desperate to get his name on the famous honours boards in the pavilion, a tradition that feels like an ancient rite when in fact these boards are a relatively recent innovation, he was allowed to return to the crease 40 minutes after retiring hurt, though he could not score the 20 additional runs needed to prod the engravers into action.Now there will be a little more time to consider the priorities of the tour party. Number one, by a distance, is to ensure the wellbeing of every member of the team number two is to retain the Ashes. By this measure it would be remarkable if Smith was allowed to play at Headingley on Thursday, even though it is a fair assumption he will want to. Objectivity must be hard to find in these circumstances, whether assessing the opinions of the player concerned, the coaching staff or the doctor who is an employee of Cricket Australia.At Lord’s there was talk of a “McGrath moment” after Smith was forced to withdraw, a reference to the freakish accident with a stray ball in 2005 just before the start of the second Test at Edgbaston. The parallels are not that close. Fourteen years ago England won that second Test to level the series at Lord’s this week Australia retained their 1-0 lead, which means they are much better placed than Ricky Ponting’s side. They require one more victory to ensure the retention of the Ashes. They are hardly in desperate straits – in fact their situation more closely mirrors that of the 1981 tourists as they head to Headingley and miracles were required to change the course of that series.However, there has undoubtedly been a mood swing in this series and that has been triggered by the extraordinary Test debut of Jofra Archer. The numbers do not suggest anything too remarkable. In the match Archer took five for 91 from 44 overs, excellent figures but not ones that accurately reflect the impact he has had on both sides.Joe Root now recognises he suddenly has a special weapon. His next step is to work out how to use it judiciously. Meanwhile Australia are aware of a major new challenge ahead.In the 21st century the fear factor has diminished. The advent of ever more sophisticated helmets, chest protectors and arm guards has helped, although one consequence of helmets is that batsmen get hit on the head far more frequently.County cricketers of the 70s and 80s would peruse the fixture list carefully to check when they were scheduled to come up against Michael Holding, Colin Croft, Sylvester Clarke, Imran Khan, Malcolm Marshall or Joel Garner. One or two might even plan their hamstring injuries accordingly – there were no tell-tale scanning machines around then. In pre-helmet days there was real anxiety that could easily tipple over to raw fear within the dressing room.Fear has not felt like such a factor in recent times – perhaps that is partly because your correspondent has been reclining in the safety of a press box. But it is still possible to spot that frisson when it becomes apparent batsmen are arriving at the crease fearful of being hit by a cricket ball travelling in excess of 90 mph. The best can be “petrified” and that was the case in Australia in 2013-14 when Mitchell Johnson was at full throttle.In his autobiography Kevin Pietersen admits to that feeling when waiting to bat. “A shudder ran through the dressing room,” he writes after a Johnson bouncer had smashed into the gloves of Jonathan Trott in Brisbane. “You very seldom hear people in your own team saying they are physically scared but our tail-end batsmen were scared.”At Lord’s we had no way of knowing how the Australia dressing room reacted to the bowling of Archer on a slow pitch but it can be guaranteed this would have become a topic of animated conversation, especially after Smith and Marnus Labuschagne had been hit. In his first Test Archer created the same frisson as Johnson managed throughout an entire series six years ago.Everyone now knows Archer hits batsmen frequently, 19 times in a brief international career that started in May.

Terry Downes was a ferociously charismatic British boxer who steamed his way to the world middleweight title in 1961 and delighted fight fans with one-liners as sharp as his blows. Downes’s tale, from scrapping on the streets of London as a child to sporting success and an unlikely movie career, is the subject of a new show at the Edinburgh fringe performed by his grandson, James McNicholas. The Boxer, staged in one of the Pleasance’s sweaty Bunker venues and directed by Tom Parry, mixes punches with punchlines in a style that does Downes proud.With his first solo show, McNicholas – who has previously visited Edinburgh with the sketch comedy trio Beasts – contrasts his grandfather’s life story with his own. He takes to the stage in a Lonsdale tracksuit, and at one point dons boxing gloves, to play a heightened version of Downes. These character-comedy scenes about “Pop”, as McNicholas always knew him, are intercut with more traditional standup routines in which he compares his achievements with those of his grandad. Downes was a world champion at 25 while McNicholas was once told by a PE teacher that he was so unfit he’d be dead by that age.McNicholas grew up hearing his grandfather’s larger-than-life story and had long planned to make a show about him. Downes died in 2017 and, last Christmas, McNicholas was feeling “a bit helpless” when he found himself watching a boxing match on TV. “One guy got knocked down and everyone assumed it was over. The other guy was celebrating. But then he got back up.” McNicholas was moved by the scene. “That action of standing up, getting back on his feet, resonated with me.” Within days, the shape of the comedy show was clear in his mind.After binging on boxing movies, from The Champ to Rocky and Raging Bull, McNicholas noticed a recurring arc, which gave his show its structure. He presents it in the defining sections of Downes’s career: the promise, the rise, the fall, the rally and the resolution. The 60-minute tale blurs comedy and theatre. “I’m pleased that it slightly defies genre in that way,” says McNicholas, who started out as an actor. “There’s a bit of cynicism within comedy about theatre but a bit of aspiration, too – theatre has a credibility that comedy in some ways aspires towards. But there’s a suspicion of deep pretentiousness.”For research McNicholas reread Downes’s colourful autobiography, My Bleeding Business, and spoke at length to his grandmother, Terry’s wife Barbara, whose voice can be heard in the show. “When I told my family I was going to do this, there was a bit of dissent,” he admits. But while there are plenty of laughs in the show, it is clearly made with heart and honours Downes, delighting in his success and never making fun of him. Its resolution is particularly emotional.As a child, McNicholas would visit Downes most weekends. “He was very brusque and would tell me in no uncertain terms that I’d be helping him paint a fence or mow the lawn. I knew a very different person to the man I portray in the show – I knew an old man with a pipe and a stick. Who was that man in his 20s and 30s? We know our grandparents, but we know a version of them. To rejuvenate him was a nice thing to be able to do.”Downes boxed for the US Marines and, had he resided in America a little longer, would have qualified to represent the country in the 1956 Olympics. He turned professional back in Britain and was world middleweight champion for nine months. Retiring in 1964, he went on to star in films including A Study in Terror, opposite Barbara Windsor, and Dance of the Vampires, directed by Roman Polanski.“He was always coming out with these little quips and one-liners. That was part of the inspiration for me,” says McNicholas, who also writes about football. He is an Arsenal fan and is directing a show at the fringe by the young comedian Raphael Wakefield called Wengerball, charting the rise and fall of Arsène Wenger. McNicholas’s whole family is sporty: his brother is a football agent and their cousin, Wally Downes, is a footballer turned manager. But the standup was hopeless at sport when he was younger. “That’s another project I want to pursue, asking people what they were like at sport in school. I think it’s really funny and formative.”McNicholas is still close to his fellow Beasts: he directed Owen Roberts’ first solo comedy show in 2018 and before this year’s fringe, he and the third Beast, Ciarán Dowd, sent each other recordings of their new shows. “You see one man on stage but a lot of comedy benefits from a slightly more collaborative process,” McNicholas says, “even if it’s just someone throwing you an idea for a line. Emotionally it’s massive to have that support.”No boxing movie would be complete without a montage showing the plucky hero’s training sessions – and the fringe is a gruelling challenge for standups. What is McNicholas’s regime? “There have been a lot of broken promises,” he laughs. “I was going to join the gym, run every day. It’s incredible how quickly the plan disintegrated.” He’s given up on getting in his five portions of fruit and veg and is mainly concerned with looking after his voice. “I’m trying to drink only clear spirits because someone told me that was better for your voice than beer. That’s as healthy as it gets: drinking exclusively clear spirits!”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/919bdf1e5c6d7e2eaf0c479fe7fa3732599091d6/0_207_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=69ddc257733d881214178fac118ca442","title":"twitter china hong kong accounts","story":"Company also suspends thousands of accounts as it reports ‘state-backed information operation’Twitter has removed nearly 1,000 accounts and suspended thousands of others tied to a campaign by the Chinese government against protesters in Hong Kong, the company announced on Monday.Twitter disclosed a “significant state-backed information operation” originating from within the People’s Republic of China (PRC) targeting the pro-democracy movement in Hong Kong. It removed 936 accounts and suspended approximately 200,000 accounts its investigation found were illegitimate.“Covert, manipulative behaviors have no place on our service – they violate the fundamental principles on which our company is built,” Twitter said in a statement.The company released an archive of offending tweets and accounts, many of which accused protesters of violence and being sponsored by western governments. “We don’t want you radical people in Hong Kong,” one deleted tweet said.In addition, Twitter said it was banning all advertising from state-controlled news media entities. “Any affected accounts will be free to continue to use Twitter to engage in public conversation, just not our advertising products,” it said, adding that the ban would not apply to entities that are taxpayer-funded but independent.There has been significant unrest in Hong Kong over a now-suspended bill that would have allowed suspects to be extradited to mainland China for trial in Communist party-controlled courts. The demonstrations have since swelled into wider calls for democracy.The protests, which began in June, have presented one of the biggest challenges for the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, since he came to power in 2012.The company also announced it would not accept money from any “state-controlled news media entities” in the future, including organizations such as China Daily. The new advertising rules do not apply to tax-funded state media organizations like BBC, PBS, NPR, or CBC.Twitter has been ramping up its efforts to crack down on fake accounts and misinformation ahead of the 2020 elections, after the US government determined the platform was used in a “systematic” campaign by Russia to undermine the 2016 elections.As part of those meddling efforts, the Russian Internet Research Agency (IRA), a center of state actors in St Petersburg, sent out more than 10m tweets attempting to influence US politics between 2013 and 2018.Since then, other states appear to have attempted to adopt the playbook. In June, Twitter removed 4,800 accounts with ties to the Iranian government, four accounts tied to the Russian government, and 33 accounts tied to the Venezuelan government.Following Twitter’s disclosure of the Chinese campaign on Monday, Facebook said it had removed seven pages, three groups and five accounts belonging to a small network that originated in China and focused on Hong Kong.“We’re constantly working to detect and stop this type of activity because we don’t want our services to be used to manipulate people,” Facebook said.Facebook, too, has faced intense criticism over the use of its platform by misinformation campaigns. Russia-backed content reached millions of Americans on Facebook during and after the 2016 presidential election. Facebook paid a $5bn (£4bn) penalty in the US in July for the Cambridge Analytica breach, which involved targeted manipulation campaigns of some of its 185 million users in Canada and the US. The fine was the largest privacy penalty in US history."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6a66bddd86fa1fab79dd1fcd82428efff998a389/0_133_2046_1228/master/2046.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2182fe14bd8b48eb1efacaf1569eea2f","title":"tv tonight meet the real life mavericks of the rafs flight school","story":"Tom Cruise is returning in a Top Gun sequel next year, but until then, here are the British versions.

Omar called Israel’s decision to block the planned official visit “nothing less than an attempt by an ally of the United States to suppress our ability to do our jobs as elected officials” and questioned the billions of dollars in US aid to the country.“As legislators we have an obligation to see the reality there for ourselves,” Omar told reporters during a press conference at the Minnesota state house in St Paul on Monday. “So I would encourage my colleagues to visit. Meet with the people we were going to meet with, see the things we were going to see, hear the stories we were going to hear.”Omar said Israel’s decision was “not consistent with democracy” and not reflective of actions taken by an ally of the US.Israel is the top recipient of US foreign aid and the country has long enjoyed bipartisan support. But Israel’s decision to bar the congresswomen entry threatens to undermine those ties, especially at a time when Democrats are increasingly critical of Netanyahu and his close alliance with Trump.Tlaib likened the decision to a ban imposed on a member of Congress seeking entry to South Africa during apartheid in 1972.“History does have a habit of repeating itself,” Tlaib said. Omar later added that the difference between then and now was that the US government was promoting the ban as opposed to actively working to lift it.She added: “We must be asking, as Israel’s ally, that Netanyahu stop the expansion of settlements on Palestinian land and ensure full rights for Palestinians if we are to give them aid.”At the urging of Trump, Netanyahu denied entry to Omar and Tlaib, the first two Muslim women elected to Congress, over their support for the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement (BDS) for Palestinian rights.Israel later relented and said the Detroit-born Tlaib could visit her 90-year-old grandmother, who lives in the occupied West Bank, if she did not promote the international boycott of Israel. Tlaib initially agreed but, facing criticism from some Palestinian activists, she changed her mind and announced that she would not travel to the country under “these oppressive conditions meant to humiliate me”.Trump has tried to make Omar, Tlaib and the other half of the foursome known as “the Squad” – all popular progressive congresswomen of color – the face of the Democratic party.In a series of racist tweets, Trump told the lawmakers to “go back” to their home countries. All are US citizens, and only Omar was not born in the US.At the press conference, Tlaib tearfully described her decision not to make the trip after a late-night phone call with her family.“I think my grandmother said it beautifully when she said I’m her asfour. Asfour in Arabic means her bird. She said I’m her dream manifested. I am her free bird. So why would I come back and be caged and bow down when my election rose her head up high?” Tlaib said, her voice cracking. She added: “We all decided as a family that I could not go until I was a free, American, United States congresswoman.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/38ee20d3292115e62639a965ce92598656e8314e/0_168_5691_3415/master/5691.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5ec76190d18b2a3950ebc3fc0c72c96f","title":"nevada casino workers unions owners","story":"Despite winning six union elections, the opposition continues through legal appeals and stalled contractsIt has been a long struggle. But it is still not over. The billionaire Trump allies who own the casino – and others like it – have embarked on a campaign of stalling recognition, delaying contract negotiations and intimidation and poor working conditions, casino workers say.Since UNITE HERE Culinary Workers Union 226 and Bartenders Union Local 165 began union-organizing drives at Station Casinos in 2011, workers have successfully voted to form a union at six of the company’s properties in Nevada.But, despite winning six union elections, the anti-union opposition from the third largest private employer in the Las Vegas area, Station Casinos, continues through legal appeals, none of which have been successful, and stalled contract negotiations.Station Casinos executives and spokespersons have repeatedly affirmed they would respect union election results. In 2016, Station Casinos president Richard Haskins told the Las Vegas Review: “We have said all along that if a fair and lawful election is held we will abide by the results.”The company is owned by billionaires Frank and Lorenzo Fertitta. The Fertittas have donated $2m to Trump’s America’s First Action PAC, over $1.5m to Trump’s Victory Fund, and more than $3m to the Republican National Committee and other Republican candidates since Trump’s election.Several casino workers have alleged wrongful terminations for engaging in union activity at Station Casino properties, and current workers report that the company continues to fire workers without just cause as Nevada is an employment “at will” state, which grants employers the right to terminate employment at anytime for any reason.“The management hasn’t recognized the union because they do whatever they want to workers and with the union, they won’t be able to do that anymore,” said Paola Felix, a guest room attendant at Green Valley Ranch Resort. “Without a union contract to protect you, you don’t get a chance to defend yourself, they just terminate you for no reason.”When the first Station Casinos property voted to unionize in September 2016, company management sent out memos to all its employees that health benefits would be increased for all employees except those who had unionized. As part of an NLRB settlement in March 2017, Station Casinos agreed to recognize the union at Palace Station Casino and reimburse the workers at Boulder Station for lower healthcare premiums they were denied.“They’ve filed legal challenge after legal challenge,” said Gunaydin Milli, a uniform room attendant at Palms Resort \u0026amp Casino since 2008, where around 900 workers voted to unionize in April 2018. In May 2019, the NLRB ruled the resort was violating federal labor law by refusing to bargain with the union, but a union contract has still yet to be negotiated as Station Casinos is appealing the ruling in federal court.“They’ve refused to negotiate with us and they’re breaking the law. The hard work we do everyday makes the company successful. We deserve to have something to show for it too,” said Milli.Casino workers have held numerous protests and rallies calling on Station Casinos to negotiate with the unions and to cease union busting at properties where union organizing drives are ongoing.“The company has been fighting these workers for a long time,” said Geoconda Argüello-Kline, secretary-treasurer for the Culinary Workers Union, Local 226. “What the company has been doing is sending a message to workers they do not respect the democratic way these workers voted ‘yes’ to be represented by the Culinary Union.”2020 Democratic presidential candidate Julian Castro has recently called on Station Casinos to negotiate with the six unions. Senator Bernie Sanders has also publicly called on the Trump-supporting casino owners to negotiate.The struggle is expected to gain more attention as Democratic presidential candidates compete for support from the Culinary Union ahead of the Nevada Democratic Caucuses in February 2020.A spokesperson for Red Rock Resorts, the parent company of Station Casinos, Michael Britt told the  in an email: “With respect to both Palms and Green Valley Ranch, although the union would clearly prefer that we not exercise our legal right to challenge the National Labor Review Board’s (NLRB) decisions regarding those properties in the United States federal courts – we have every right to do so and our challenges are both legal and appropriate.”They declined to clarify the reasons behind those challenges.In Red Rock Resort’s most recent annual report, the company claimed, “Union organization activities could disrupt our business by discouraging patrons from visiting our properties, causing labor disputes or work stoppages, and, if successful, could significantly increase our labor costs.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5386335edb9c5b74f3dc3ba92b2241e1cc57be29/0_238_3084_1850/master/3084.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e3f25e7c517b090819783e92c2913d10","title":"french tourists in hot water in sardinia over sand souvenir","story":"Couple in hot water as Italian authorities get tough on issue blighting island for yearsA pair of French tourists could face up to six years in jail after allegedly stealing 40kg (6st 3lbs) of sand from one of Sardinia’s pristine beaches.Border police found the white sand, taken from Chia beach in the south of the Italian island, stashed into 14 large plastic bottles in the boot of the couple’s car. The pair were about to board a ferry for Toulon, in southern France, from Porto Torres.They told police they took the sand as a souvenir and did not realise they had committed an offence.But they now face between one and six years in prison as Sardinian authorities get tough on an issue that has blighted the island for years.Police said there had been a “boom” this summer in the quantity of sand, shells and other beach objects found in people’s luggage at the island’s airports, with 10 tonnes seized at Olbia, close to the Costa Smeralda, in recent weeks alone.People also risk fines of up to €3,000 (£2,700), but police struggle to apply the penalties due to most culprits being visitors.“When those responsible for these episodes are foreigners, it is difficult to collect the fines,” Antonio Casula, the chief of Sardinia’s forest rangers, told La Stampa, adding that the incidents were becoming more frequent.Vigilantes patrol the beaches and signposts clearly warn it is forbidden to take sand. But unaware of the seriousness of the offence, many tourists find the sand an irresistible keepsake.The sand is usually placed in plastic bottles or bags and labelled with the name of the beach from which it was taken. Although the practice is seemingly harmless, it is not only an offence but is detrimental to the island’s environment.Some sand thieves do repent, however. A man from Rome recently returned a bottle of sand he had stolen as a child to the mayor of Cabras.In 2016, a woman who took sand from Budelli, an island off Sardinia that is famous for its pink sand beach, returned it after 29 years.The woman sent the sand back with an apology, writing: “I read in some newspapers and heard on the TV what this sand is and how it is made. I understood how unique Sardinia is. I felt guilty.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f006cafe5bddcbcbc4e5425f5384b69979d3f60e/0_204_6109_3666/master/6109.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=17e335ff56281f90a1c062159b056688","title":"employee at uk consulate in hong kong detained in china","story":"Detention comes amid more than two months of pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong An employee at the UK’s consulate in Hong Kong has been detained by mainland Chinese authorities on his way back to the city, his girlfriend has said.Simon Cheng, 28, was travelling back from a business trip in Shenzhen province to his native Hong Kong on 8 August when he suddenly stopped messaging, his girlfriend, Li, told the .“Ready to pass through the border … pray for me,” he had messaged just before he went silent, Li said.More than 10 days later, Li and Cheng’s family have not been able to get in touch with him. Li said Hong Kong immigration authorities told her Cheng had been placed under “administrative detention” in mainland China in an unknown location and for unknown reasons.The detention of Cheng, who works in the British consulate as a trade and investment officer for Scottish Development International, comes amid more than two months of pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong that have threatened Beijing’s authority over the city.“We are extremely concerned by reports that a member of our team has been detained returning to Hong Kong from Shenzhen,” a spokesman for the Foreign and Commonwealth Office said. “We are providing support to his family and seeking further information from authorities in Guangdong province and Hong Kong.”The protests were triggered by a controversial bill that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China, where the Communist party controls the courts, but have since evolved into a broader pro-democracy movement.Public anger – fuelled by the aggressive tactics used by the police against demonstrators – has collided with years of frustration over worsening inequality and the cost of living in one of the world\u0027s most expensive, densely populated cities.The protest movement was given fresh impetus on 21 July when gangs of men attacked protesters and commuters at a mass transit station – while authorities seemingly did little to intervene.\u0026nbspUnderlying the movement is a push for full democracy in the city, whose leader is chosen by a committee dominated by a pro-Beijing establishment rather than by direct elections.Protesters have vowed to keep their movement going until their core demands are met, such as the resignation of the city’s leader, Carrie Lam, an independent inquiry into police tactics, an amnesty for those arrested and a permanent withdrawal of the bill.Beijing’s influence over Hong Kong has grown in recent years, as activists have been jailed and pro-democracy lawmakers disqualified from running or holding office. Independent booksellers have disappeared from the city, before reappearing in mainland China facing charges.Under the terms of the agreement by which the former British colony was returned to Chinese control in 1997, the semi-autonomous region was meant to maintain a “high degree of autonomy” through an independent judiciary, a free press and an open market economy, a framework known as “one country, two systems”.The extradition bill was seen as an attempt to undermine this and to give Beijing the ability to try pro-democracy activists under the judicial system of the mainland.Lam has shown no sign of backing down beyond agreeing to suspend the extradition bill, while Beijing has issued increasingly shrill condemnations but has left it to the city\u0027s semi-autonomous government to deal with the situation. Meanwhile police have violently clashed directly with protesters, repeatedly firing teargas and rubber bullets.Beijing has ramped up its accusations that foreign countries are “fanning the fire” of unrest in the city. China’s top diplomat Yang Jiechi has ordered the US to “immediately stop interfering in Hong Kong affairs in any form”.Lily Kuo and Verna Yu in Hong KongCheng’s detention was first reported by the Hong Kong news site HK01. According to Li, he regularly travels to mainland China for meetings and had gone there most recently for work. Immigration officials have increased checks at the border between mainland China and Hong Kong, detaining people and checking their phones and other devices.Beijing has taken an increasingly hardline tone against the protests, which it sees as a direct challenge to its rule.It has also repeatedly warned Britain – the former colonial ruler of Hong Kong – against “interference”. China has appeared irked by Britain’s public rebukes of the Hong Kong authorities’ handling of the demonstrations.According to Li, Cheng had not participated in the protests or expressed his position on the movement in any public forums. “As far as I know, he did not attend any of the protests, even the 1 million march. I am just worried about him,” she said.Li, who met Cheng while he was studying in Taiwan – where she is from – has been calling and writing to British, Chinese, and Hong Kong officials. According to Li, Cheng’s career had progressed from a part-time job at a fast food restaurant to his current position at the consulate. “His life was just beginning,” she said.“He grew up to be a very caring, diligent and hardworking person. Now, he is missing and detained for no reason. This is deeply distressing for his family and friends.”Li said she and Cheng had discussed marriage, and possibly moving back to Taiwan, but Cheng wanted to remain in Hong Kong. “He said he loves Hong Kong and wanted to sacrifice all he has for his motherland.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3991056.1566236182!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"parking blackspots worst places for clamping in dublin are revealed","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tLast year, Dublin City Council  recorded revenue of €27.9 million from parking fees and a further €3.2 million in clamp release fees. Photograph: Alan BetsonThe  Almost 130 motorists on average are having their vehicles clamped each day in Dublin city.Figures provided by Dublin City Council show a total of 23,383 vehicles were clamped for illegal parking in the first six months of 2019 – a daily average of 129.The number of clamping fees imposed on motorists is virtually unchanged over the same period last year, but is down 19 per cent on the corresponding figures for 2017.However, the latest figures indicate a reduction in illegal parking rates as the decrease in the number of vehicles clamped last year was partially linked to long periods of bad weather associated with Storm Emma in the first half of 2018.A spokesperson for Dublin City Council said it believed the downward trend was linked to “greater education and compliance”.Mespil Road remains the top blackspot for illegal parking in Dublin city, with 416 vehicles clamped at the location between January and June.The figures show that Ranelagh has emerged as a new location for large numbers of vehicles to be clamped – 320 in the first half of this year compared to just 35 over the same period in 2018.Most of the offending vehicles were clamped for parking on a clearway.Local Green Party councillor Hazel Chu welcomed the increased enforcement levels and stressed that there were enough parking spaces in the area to facilitate customers of businesses in Ranelagh.“Parking in the clearway also affects the cycle lane, which makes cycling more dangerous. At the same time, there needs to be clarity with signs to inform motorists when they are allowed to park on the main road through Ranelagh,” Ms Chu said.Valid paid parkingThe most common reason why vehicles were clamped in the first half of 2019 was a failure to have valid paid parking, which accounted for a third of all offences.Almost 4,000 motorists had their vehicle clamped because the time on their parking fee had elapsed, including the 10-minute “grace period”.Almost 2,000 vehicles were clamped for parking on a clearway, while more than 1,400 were detected parking on a footpath and a further 1,000 for parking a non-goods vehicle in a loading bay.A total of 815 vehicles were clamped for parking in a bus lane and another 213 for parking in a disabled parking space without a valid permit. Another 39 vehicles were clamped for parking in spaces reserved for electric vehicles.Despite a high-profile campaign by a number of cycling groups to highlight the extent of illegal parking on cycle lanes, the latest figures show that less than one vehicle is being clamped per day for such an offence.In the first six months of the year, a total of 125 vehicles were clamped for parking on a cycle lane, although the figure is up on 49 for the same period in 2018.The council spokesperson said there had been no change of policy in terms of targeting any particular form of parking infringement.“Dublin City Council continues to enforce illegal parking throughout the city to ensure maximum use of spaces in the city,” she added.Last year, the council recorded revenue of €27.9 million from parking fees and a further €3.2 million in clamp release fees.New contractEarlier this month, the council awarded Dublin Street Parking Services a new contract to continue to provide parking enforcement services for a further five-year period.The standard clamp release fee is €80. Vehicles which are not removed within 24 hours are towed away and impounded, leaving their owners to face a release fee of €160 and a daily storage charge of €35 to have them returned.It is estimated that approximately 0.2 per cent of vehicles which are parked in Dublin city are clamped. Around 13 million parking tickets or payments are recorded each year.The local authority operates more than 1,000 pay-and-display meters around the city for almost 30,000 on-street parking spaces.Since 2017 motorists are entitled to a “grace period” of 10 minutes from the expiry of their parking ticket before their vehicle can be clamped.Parking officials are now also statutorily obliged to remove clamps within two hours of a release fee being paid."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3991161.1566242789!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"british pm to meet varadkar in dublin in september","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTaoiseach Leo Varadkar says the withdrawal agreement will not be reopened   British prime minister Boris Johnson says it will not pass the House of Commons.British prime minister Boris Johnson is to visit Dublin in early September after he and Taoiseach Leo Varadkar spoke for almost an hour by telephone on Monday night. Government Buildings said the two men had “shared perspectives on the withdrawal agreement” but sources in Dublin said that both men had restated their existing positions.The sharp isions on the backstop are reflected in the agreed statement released after the call. Mr Johnson said the withdrawal agreement “in its current form” would not pass the House of Commons, while Mr Varadkar said the withdrawal agreement would not be reopened.However, the two men said that their teams would be in close contact over the coming weeks. The statement also acknowledges that discussions on Brexit can only take place between EU and the UK, and it is understood that there are no talks scheduled with the British government on how to avoid border checks in the event of a no-deal.Food and animalsMr Varadkar has suggested that checks on food and animals, which officials say are necessary to protect the EU’s single market when the UK leaves, could take place on imports from Britain at Northern Ireland’s ports in order to avoid checks on the Border. This would require agreement with the British government, but no talks are currently scheduled, sources say.High-level government sources in Dublin say that there are ongoing contacts between officials and some senior politicians, while a number of Ministers, including Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe and Minister for Housing Eoghan Murphy have travelled to London to meet their counterparts. But there have been no discussions on preparing for a no-deal, and one Brussels source says that no-deal preparations will be unilateral, and there will not be negotiations on preparing for a no-deal. Despite last night’s call between Mr Varadkar and Mr Johnson, senior sources in Dublin said the Irish Government – and the EU – would most likely await developments in London before considering any change in their approach. Merkel and MacronMr Johnson is also expected to meet German chancellor Angela Merkel and French president Emmanuel Macron this week before travelling to a G7 meeting in France where he will meet other world leaders. Irish sources say they will expect a read-out on Mr Johnson’s position from their EU counterparts after Mr Johnson’s meetings.However, they also say there is likely to be little if any serious engagement with the British government until challenges to Mr Johnson from MPs opposed to a no-deal Brexit are resolved when the House of Commons meets again in September.Mr Johnson on Monday rebuffed a call from UK Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn to recall parliament, and also dismissed leaked warnings from his own officials about the potentially dire consequences of a no-deal Brexit on October 31st. Mr Johnson also reassured Mr Varadkar, the Common Travel Area between Britain and Ireland will not be affected by the ending of freedom of movement between the UK and EU after Brexit.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Photograph:  Niall CarsonPAPressure is building on the Government to advance plans for alternative shipping routes bypassing Britain to avoid severe delays at English Channel ports stemming from a possible no-deal Brexit. Potential risks to the key “landbridge” transit route for Irish traders through the UK to Europe have escalated in light of the UK government’s no-deal plans which show severe disruptions at British ports.Operation Yellowhammer, the secret UK planning dossier leaked over the weekend, warns of significant interruptions at UK ports that could last up to three months after Brexit.The report says up to 85 per cent of lorries travelling across the Channel may not be ready for French customs, creating delays of two days and a severe bottleneck for Irish hauliers bound for Europe. About 150,000 haulage units use the landbridge every year, leading to concerns among Irish businesses that there is insufficient capacity on direct shipping routes to Europe to offer an alternative for this traffic.Fresh foodIndustry groups have warned delays at English ports could affect the transport of fresh food and time-sensitive produce, and have criticised the Government for not developing detailed alternative plans.“What are the Government’s contingency plans for this? All I have heard from the Government is there is increased capacity for Dublin to Cherbourg but that is not a viable alternative to the scale and type of goods using the landbridge,” said Aidan Flynn, general manager of Freight Transport Association Ireland. “This is where the Government are letting themselves down. There hasn’t been enough joined-up thinking amongst the various stakeholders around the table. Planning has been ad hoc and focused on customs and tariffs but it is the movement and access to market that are the most important things.Irish Ferries sails from Dublin to Cherbourg three times a week, while Stena Line also sails three times a week from Rosslare to Cherbourg but on different days. This could lead to a potential demand for daily sailings from each port should a no-deal Brexit at the next deadline of October 31st disrupt landbridge traffic. Ferry companiesThe Government has said there is sufficient capacity on existing direct ferry routes to France to meet current market demand. Should that change, commercial operators will respond where necessary. Hauliers warn of a potential shortage of capacity on the longer sea routes to the European ports of Zeebrugge and Rotterdam that would be required to put traders closer to their markets.Several sources conceded that the direct routes to Europe, last between 20 and 40 hours, would be too long for Irish importers and exporters transporting fresh food and time-sensitive produce. The ferry companies servicing the Irish ports are said to be looking at alternative arrangements in the event of English ports being severely affected by congestion in the event of a no-deal Brexit scenario. “Irish Ferries will respond to the market demands whatever they are at whatever stage,” said the ferry company’s parent, Irish Continental Group, in response to queries.European shipping companies could add vessels and routes on direct services between Ireland and Europe, depending on the level of demand and disruption to cross-channel transit from a crash-out Brexit. Importers and exporters were urged to look at using alternative ports on the English east coast to avoid Dover, the busiest UK port on the channel, to avoid the inevitable no-deal Brexit delays. “Businesses will have to actively export using other east-coast ports,” said Neil McDonnell, chief executive of Isme, the representative body for the country’s small and mid-sized businesses.“Operation Yellowhammer has shown that they could be facing three months of torture.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Photograph: Simon DawsonEPABoris Johnson’s government is to launch a major public information campaign to reassure Britons about a potential no-deal Brexit, as the prime minister said he was “confident” the EU would change its position on the Irish border backstop.Downing Street declined to comment on the leaked document about Operation Yellowhammer, its planning for a no-deal Brexit. But officials said the document was “out of date” and did not reflect the government’s state of preparedness. Whitehall insiders said the media campaign, with a budget of £100 million, would begin in the next couple of weeks to explain in a “user-friendly way” what iniduals needed to do ahead of Brexit day on October 31st. In an effort to rebut the stark warnings in a leaked contingency planning paper, the emphasis will be on consumers.Those with knowledge of the preparations said the campaign would be run on TV, radio and social media. The government is working to ensure that its official website is ready for a significant increase in traffic once the campaign launches. It will include details of what consumers need to do to be prepared for travel abroad.A Number 10 spokesperson said “further information will be published in the coming weeks” on government preparations for leaving the EU with or without a deal, noting that Mr Johnson had “significantly stepped up planning” for no-deal. Downing Street insisted it had been “engaging widely” with businesses, despite lobby groups expressing concern that smaller firms were underprepared.Mr Johnson insists he still wants to strike a deal with Brussels. But during a visit to a hospital in Cornwall, he said it was “very much up to our friends” to change their stance on the withdrawal agreement, admitting that other European nations were “showing a little bit of reluctance”.“They have seen that the UK parliament has three times rejected the withdrawal agreement, the backstop just doesn’t work, it’s not democratic and I hope that they will see fit to compromise but in the meantime we get ready to come out on October 31st,” he told Sky News.“That’s fine, I’m confident that they will. But in the meantime we have to get ready for a no-deal outcome. I want a deal. We’re ready to work with our friends and partners to get a deal. But if you want a good deal for the UK, you must simultaneously get ready to come out without one.”Widespread disruptionResponding to the leaked Yellowhammer document, Mr Johnson added that he was “very confident” that the government would be ready for departure on October 31st, with or without a deal. “I’m not pretending that there won’t be bumps on the road. There will be, I said that on the steps of Downing Street, but if everybody puts their minds to it I have absolutely no doubt that we can get ready.”The Yellowhammer document said the consequences of a no-deal exit could be widespread disruption - possibly for months - to trade, food and medicine distribution, fishing, and fuel supplies, and civil unrest.Parliament will have a chance to scrutinise no-deal planning in early September. Michael Gove, the minister in charge of no-deal preparations, will update MPs on the government’s preparatory work for Brexit when it returns on September 3rd, according to officials.This will be the first of what will become weekly updates to the House of Commons on preparations for leaving the EU and Mr Gove is expected to cover the activities of the daily and weekly committees working on deal preparations.Downing Street has rejected a call from 110 MPs to recall parliament early from its summer recess to allow further scrutiny of its Brexit plans.“The House of Commons agreed the date it would rise for summer recess, as well as its return on September 3rd and this was passed by a majority of close to 200 MPs,” a spokesperson said.Only the government has the power to recall parliament early.No-confidence motionIn a keynote speech in Corby, Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn said he would table a vote of no confidence in the Johnson government when parliament returns next month.However, Mr Corbyn did not spell out whether this would be tabled immediately after parliament returns on September 3rd or at some later date.“I will bring a vote of no confidence in the government, and if we’re successful, I would seek to form a time-limited caretaker administration to avert no deal, and call an immediate general election so the people can decide our country’s future,” he said.Mr Corbyn ruled out suggestions by some MPs that a caretaker government could only be formed by a figure commanding wider support across the Commons.Mr Corbyn said the “constitutional precedent” was for the leader of the opposition to “take over” if a government falls from power. He said MPs determined to block a no-deal had to understand that it “falls to the leader of the opposition to make sure no deal does not happen”. – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2019Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

But, all the same, he has a strong case. “Do you know what percentage of people live in Asia?” he asked. I guessed around 50 per cent. It turns out to be 60 per cent. 4 billion people in Asia. A mere 700 million in Europe. QED.\u0026nbspNivern, now 37, is a posterboy for the utility of studying modern languages. At 14 he went on a school exchange to Paris. Brought up in Manchester, he found himself living across the street from the Louvre. At 17 he got a summer job in a factory outside Paris, packing cakes in boxes, where he was known as “Anglais”. “I was impressed that, even in the industrial zone, they still stopped for a proper lunch with a baguette and a bottle of wine.”This was the summer of 1998, the year of the Mondial in France. He tried – and failed – to get into the World Cup final at the Stade de France, but watched France beat Brazil 3-0 on a screen outside and saw the whole city go mad. “I couldn’t get home and I couldn’t get to work the next day either.” He went on to take French and German at Keble College, Oxford, specialising in 17th century French theatre. “Learning languages opens up your eyes to other parts of the world,” he says. “I just wanted to keep on going.”\u0026nbspWhich explains why, a couple of months after graduating, he took a job teaching English in a high school in a town, Hengshui (“not scenic, but with wonderful people”), three hours south of Beijing. With practically no knowledge of Chinese. He just threw himself in at the deep end and found he could float. When he got back to England he switched to international management and Chinese for his masters at Soas (the School of Oriental and African Studies), London. \u0026nbspNivern joined forces with fellow student Ed Holroyd Pearce (who had studied Oriental languages at Cambridge) to set up not just one but two companies, China Recruitment and China Consulting. “The simple idea was to make it easier for people to do what we did.” Those two eventually fused into one, CRCC Asia. They arrange the jobs (across a range of sectors), travel, accommodation and visas, and do all the networking for you. From small beginnings in Nivern’s kitchen in 2006, they now have a team of 50 working out of offices across Asia, collaborating with companies large and small. Nivern is based in Philadelphia, where he has set up partnerships with American universities like Texas and Michigan. And they are now expanding into South Korea, Japan and Vietnam. \u0026nbspI would love to say I get it right all the time. But the Chinese are incredibly receptive to foreigners trying to speak ChineseThis year they expect to send some 1,500 college students and graduates (generally between 18 and 23) to internships in Beijing, Shanghai, Seoul, Tokyo, Ho Chi Minh City and… Manchester (it works in reverse too). Forty per cent\u0026nbspwill come from the UK, 40 per cent\u0026nbspfrom the US, and others from New Zealand and Australia. And CRCC Asia are providing a number of scholarships to support people can’t afford to self-finance. There is funding for 250 places\u0026nbspby the British Council. Globalism – combined with Brexit – is persuading a lot of young people to look east in search of work experience and an enhanced CV.\u0026nbspNivern picked up the Mandarin language relatively late. “I would love to say I get it right all the time. But the Chinese are incredibly receptive to foreigners trying to speak Chinese.” He reckons that the grammar is not as difficult as German, “what’s tricky is the tonality.” The same syllable, “Ma”, can mean either “mother” or “horse” (and a few other things), depending. “Hopefully the context helps,” says Nivern. A sentence involving a mother riding a horse is a well-known tongue twister. Most people, like Nivern himself, go to China with no Chinese, “but we encourage everyone to try – it makes a huge difference”.\u0026nbspChina bans actors and films from Asian awards ceremony in TaiwanChina warns Hong Kong protesters as police amass near borderAsian stocks fall as China hits back at US claim of yuan manipulationNivern says that China is like an onion: “You can go on peeling off layers. You think you know it but you don’t.” In CRCC Asia’s “Career Bridge” programme (which gives you training in “intercultural fluency”), one of the key concepts they try to get across to those new to China is mianzi or “face”. You can give face and you can lose face. Nobody wants to lose it. You have to be sensitive to hierarchy in China. If you’re arranging a dinner party, you put the least senior person closest to the door. Conversation should be addressed to the most senior person (like a government official) to begin with. If there is a toast, you can clink glasses, but you have to make sure the rim of your glass is lower than the local bigwig’s glass, otherwise you risk giving offence. By going lower you are giving face. “There’s sometimes a battle as to who goes lower,” says Nivern. “You can end up on the floor.”\u0026nbspJust as Nivern was inspired by the 1998 World Cup, so too, 10 years later, the Beijing Olympics of 2008 gave CRCC Asia a significant boost. The Chinese government took the games seriously enough to close factories and pull vehicles off the road with a view to cutting pollution. “It was all perfectly choreographed. You could say regimented. The closing ceremony was fantastic too.”\u0026nbspApparently the thing that shocked his Chinese friends most was the sight of then mayor of London, Boris Johnson, leading our 2012 handover, looking scruffy, with his jacket unbuttoned, one hand in his pocket, and his shirt hanging half out. He showed a lack of respect and lost a lot of face that day. “But at least I managed to get into the stadium this time,” said Nivern. \u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Two consecutive quarters of contraction are typically defined as a recession.The contraction between April and June was mostly driven by sinking demand from abroad, the Bundesbank said. Exports “were down substantially”, it noted, as pre-Brexit preparations ahead of the UK’s initial exit date at the end of March prompted companies to build up stocks in the first quarter.“As things currently stand, it is unclear whether exports and, by extension, industry will regain their footing before the domestic economy becomes more severely affected,” the Bundesbank said.Appetite for German cars and other goods has also waned in China as growth in the world’s second-largest economy is cooling, partly due to the year-long trade war with the US.Up until a week ago, economists surveyed by Bloomberg were predicting\u0026nbspthat Germany’s economy will grow by 0.2 per cent in the current quarter.But since then big-name institutions including Deutsche Bank have lowered their expectations. The concern for many analysts is that continuing global trade tensions will prolong the downturn in German manufacturing and eventually feed through to the still-strong services sector.The central bank’s forecast follows weeks of disappointing economic data and news of meagre earnings at German companies. The government has signalled that it might be willing to step up spending should the downturn worsen.The European Central Bank is also considering providing extra monetary stimulus to the wider euro zone.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

PRESS ASSOCIATION Photo. Picture date: Saturday June 29, 2019Figures from the Gambling Commission estimate that 55,000 children in the UK could have a gambling problem.Fruit machines remain the most common way for children to first encounter gambling but bookmakers and online casinos have come under increasing pressure over the proliferation of adverts for betting, particularly in places where children are likely to see it such as during football matches and on social media.The available evidence indicates that exposure to gambling at a young age increases the risk that a person will become addicted in later life.Twitter has become an important platform for the both traditional and e-sports companies to advertise to potential customers. The study found that the five biggest operators -\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspLadbrokes, bet365, Coral, Betfred​ and Paddy Power - sent an average of 78 tweets per day.Much of this content is designed to be widely attractive, memetic and, most importantly, shareable, the study\u0027s authors wrote.\u0026nbspAs a result, it is very difficult to restrict, or even predict, the audience for a given piece of messaging.Despite the risks of children being exposed, just 0.1 per cent of social media gambling ads were found to contain a warning about the minimum age for placing a bet.The advertising\u0026nbspindustry\u0027s code of conduct states that\u0026nbsp“marketing communications must be obviously identifiable as such” but many of the social media adverts assessed did not do this.Close to three quarters of the gambling adverts appeared to break advertising industry regulation in some way, the researchers said.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Although it was higher than a year ago, the 1.2 per cent annual rise still lagged behind inflation, which is running at 2.1 per cent, according to the latest official data.“There is little doubt that the market continues to face its inevitable challenges,” said Glynis Frew, chief executive of Hunters, an estate agency with over 200 branches across Britain.Official data showed last week that the average price at which homes are sold grew only 0.9 per cent in the year to June, while in London it tumbled by 2.7 per cent. The average British home cost £230,292 in June, down from a peak of £232,000 in August 2018.Buyers have been biding their time as it remains unclear whether the UK will leave the EU with or without a deal. In the latter case, house prices could plunge by almost 6 per cent in 2020 and another 3 per cent in 2021, according to forecasts by the government’s spending watchdog, the Office for Budget Responsibility.However, the more confident buyers are now abandoning the ‘wait and see’ approach and taking advantage of improved housing affordability as the Brexit deadline nears, Ms Frew said, commenting on Rightmove’s findings.For its latest report, Rightmove measured 130,435 asking prices, covering around 90 per cent of the UK market. The properties were put on sale by estate agents between 7 July to 10 August and advertised on rightmove.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The predicament of the young prince, Segismundo, calls to mind the Chinese sage\u0027s story of the man who dreams he is a butterfly and wakes to wonder whether he is actually a butterfly dreaming he is a man. This youth is at the mercy of political fluctuation: he\u0027s been imprisoned in a dark tower from birth because of a horoscope that predicted he would usurp the throne. Then, when there are anxieties about the succession, his father has him drugged, brought to the Palace, and bafflingly treated like a prince. A poetic piece that tackles deep metaphysical, political matters in a dazzlingly theatrical way. PTA play of astonishing breakthroughs. There had been plenty of soliloquies in Elizabethan drama beforehand. But no-one had ever talked to an audience like Hamlet. He doesn\u0027t just let you into his confidence, he lets you into his consciousness the best portrayals make you feel that you are soul-to-soul with this figure. It\u0027s his capacity for searching introspection that gets in the way and disqualifies Hamlet as a revenge hero: he\u0027s rather wonderfully miscast. Hamlet is brilliantly self-reflexive, constantly probing its own theatricality. The conscience of Claudius is tested by a play-within-a play Hamlet tries to fool the court by assuming an “antic disposition” that may at times waver into authentic madness. The piece is like a painful meditation on the contradicting meanings of the verb to “act” – to feign and to intervene. Inexhaustible. PTFeminism and expressionism collide in US playwright Sophie Treadwell\u0027s extraordinary vision of a mechanised, dehumanising metropolis. We feel the nerve-shredding racket of modern existence – described as “this purgatory of noise” – assaulting the Everywoman character at every stage as she makes her descent to doom. She\u0027s a stenographer, a sensitive cog in the machine who is blackmailed by her mother into marriage with a boss who revolts her, and ends up condemned to the electric chair for murdering him. Treadwell\u0027s nagging dialogue, with its jangly staccato and syncopated telegraphese, uncannily anticipates Harold Pinter and David Mamet. Her cry against institutionalised misogyny – “I will not submit” – resounds down the ages. PTIn Gogol\u0027s great phantasmagoric farce, an impecunious clerk newly arrived from St Petersburg is mistakenly assumed to be the eponymous inspector by the corrupt mayor and officials of this provincial town. Panic drives these paranoid locals to project a false identity onto this stranger. That would have been a good enough joke. Gogol, though, gives it an inspired, twist. His penniless nonenity turns out to be driven by an equivalent dread of being recognised as one of life\u0027s losers. So when he twigs to their exploitable mistake, he treats their absurd respect (not to mention their bribes) as long-overdue recognition of his true worth and becomes airborne with grandiosity. It\u0027s the interlocking lunacies that generate the comic delirium in this Russian masterpiece. PTOne of Pinter\u0027s most haunting and unnerving pieces. A married couple, Kate and Deeley, play games of power and possessiveness with the wife\u0027s former flatmate, Anna, who comes to visit for the first time in 20 years. The piece is horribly preoccupied with the use people make of selective – and conceivably invented – memories as weapon or way of gaining the upper hand. We mint memories, in this understanding of it, in response to the psychological needs of the moment: “There are things I remember which may never have happened, but as I recall them.” Deeley is threatened by Anna\u0027s youthful relationship to his wife and strongly attracted to the newcomer. There’s a wonderful evocation of rackety London when the girls lived as secretaries, but the uneasy comedy of all this turns lethal. PTThe best Jacobean tragedy outside Shakespeare, The Changeling also seems to anticipate film noir. The heroine hires a shady type to bump off her fiance. This villain has a facial disfigurement, but the piece is alert to how perversely attracted we are to what repels us. The assassin demands her virginity as his blood-money and the slide into shadowy corruption becomes inexorable. There is a subplot in a madhouse that is designed as a distorted mirror of the main action in its obsession with disguise, lunacy, and sex. PTThis Pulitzer-winning American playwright explores the history of her great-grandmother in early 20th century New York. Esther is a black seamstress – unmarried and illiterate – who sews ravishingly beautiful garments for other women to wear on their wedding nights. She gets what could be a last chance of happiness but it\u0027s destroyed in circumstances that are never sentimentalised. The sensual feel of fine fabric (her means of supporting and expressing herself) is conveyed with gorgeous descriptive power. Intimate Apparel manages to be uplifting without ever losing its irreverent humour. PTSophocles\u0027s play is still the most powerful ever written about the conflict between our obligations to the state and our duty to the ties of kinship. Antigone defies her uncle Kreon, the new ruler of Thebes, by burying her brother Polyneikes. He had brought an army against his native city and Kreon, in these politically volatile times, wants his corpse left for the dogs as an exemplary desecration. The philosopher Hegel saw this as the quintessence of true tragedy: not a conflict between good and evil, but between right and right. In fact, productions nowadays tend to come down in favour of Antigone and her self-sacrificing intransigence. PTRichard Bean had the inspired idea of transposing Goldoni\u0027s 18th century commedia dell\u0027arte romp from Venice to Brighton in 1963. Our jack-the-lad hero – frantically trying to hold down a pair of jobs, unbeknownst to either boss – is a failed skiffle player. The complications are deliciously warped. One character does a bunk to Brighton disguised as her psychotic twin brother who has been bumped off by her posh twit of a boyfriend in a gangland brawl. Still with me? The dialogue is naughty and knowing, but there\u0027s a terrific innocent joy to the physical clowning which peaks in the delirious sequence where our hero has to dish up lunch to the two masters at the same time. PTA supreme example of how a writer can make a play by putting together a triptych of miniatures. Holman was brought up in the pacifist tradition and Making Noise Quietly looks at the long-range effects of war in three chance encounters. In the first, set in a Kent field in 1943, a northern Quaker and an uninhibited London aesthete discuss their reasons for not fighting. In the second, a naval officer arrives to tell a mother of her son’s death in the Falklands War. The third is set in the Black Forest in 1986. An English private, gone AWOL with his disturbed eight-year-old stepson, come into testing collision with a rich German businesswoman who survived the Holocaust. There\u0027s a stunning scene in which she draws the little boy out of his dogmatic mutism by her repeated, stern insistence that he says “thank you” it\u0027s uplifing in the end but it\u0027s not pretty. Writing of rare sensitivity and cumulative power. PTThough he described it as “the lightest of light comedies”, Private Lives is the Noel Coward play that one would undoubtedly preserve for posterity. He wrote it as a vehicle for himself and Gertrude Lawrence, with indecent speed. The play centres on two orcees who, five years after their split, bump into each other on adjacent hotel balconies while on the first night of honeymoons with their new spouses. An elegantly contrived coincidence followed by a pattern of cheekily reversed expectations: most comedies end in marriage this one begins with nobbled nuptials as the couple unceremoniously ditch their second partners and abscond to Paris together. Elyot and Amanda are the kind of flighty egotistical couple that can neither live together nor apart. Anti-romantic comedy soaked in sex (and romance): “Don\u0027t quibble Sybil.” PT1240 Angels in America (1990-93), Tony KushnerSubtitled “A Gay Fantasia on National Themes”, Tony Kushner\u0027s astonishing two-part play is set in the AIDS crisis of the mid-1980s during the right wing administration of Ronald Reagan. The word AIDS was never mentioned by the President, and the struggle to find a cure was hampered by a lack of government recognition. Kushner retaliated by putting gay men centre stage in an epic that shows them fighting to forge their private and public destinies. This is, however, very far from a conventional “issue” play in its glorious ambition. The piece rages from Antarctica and the damaged ozone layer to a baroque heaven that god has abandoned. Prophetic angels crash through ceilings. There are “mutual dream” sequences where people wander in and out of each other\u0027 fantasies. The presiding demon of the piece is one of drama\u0027s greatest monsters: the incorrigible and shameless Roy Cohn was a real-life Republican fixer (and mentor to the young Donald Trump). PTA middle-aged woman is buried in a mound of earth first up to the waist then, after the interval, up to the neck. It is a sight that has never lost its capacity to startle. Beckett\u0027s Winnie prattles away dogged with optimism (“This will have been another happy day”) in a loquacious attempt to stave off hysteria and despair at her encroaching fate. Partly irritating, partly heroic, she brings forth a dotty lyrical monologue that\u0027s threaded with genteel half-remembered wisps from the “immortal” classics. Peter Hall, who directed Peggy Ashcroft in the part, rightly pointed out that “Beckett\u0027s theatre is as much about mime and physical precision as it is about words”. Except that his texts are great and this one is superb beyond belief. To quote Winnie: “What is that unforgettable line?” PT1440  Long Day’s Journey into Night (1940), Eugene O NeillWhen O\u0027Neill described Long Day\u0027s Journey as a “play of old sorrow, written in blood and tears”, he was barely exaggerating. This enormous autobiographical drama is so raw and unremitting in its revelations about his dysfunctional Irish-Catholic family that the author left instructions – mercifully disobeyed by his widow – that the play was not to be performed until 25 years after his death. You can understand the trepidation. Long Day\u0027s Journey plunges deep into the tortured heart of the Tyrones – James, the acclaimed actor who sold out to commercial success, his wife Mary who has recently relapsed into morphine addiction, and their two sons. When the play is under the baton of the right director, it\u0027s the like listening to the recapitulations in a great piece of music. You emerge drained but in a state of elating catharsis. PTHector wants to teach boys knowledge that will last them a lifetime. But the headmaster has become obsessed with government league tables and has hired Irwin to teach them glib, exam-passing techniques. That\u0027s the clash at the heart of Alan Bennett\u0027s hugely popular hit. It\u0027s set at a Yorkshire grammar amongst a group of clever sixth-formers. As with a lot of Bennett\u0027s work you can discern a revue-like structure in the play\u0027s glorious string of skits, gags, songs and sheer elating silliness. But it\u0027s also a brilliant portrait of a maverick teacher. The scene in which the doomed Hector analyses the Hardy poem “Drummer Hodge” with his pupil Posner is unsurpassed in drama as an example of humane teaching. Gay, unhappy Posner also has the play\u0027s best joke: “I\u0027m a Jew. I\u0027m small. I\u0027m homosexual. And I live in Sheffield. I\u0027m fucked.” PTFrank Hardy, an itinerant Irish faith healer, his wife, and his manager tell four monologues that contradict each other, leaving the audience to question truth and memory, lies and storytelling. Frank struggles to understand his own “gift”, and how his ability to cure comes and goes Faith Healer is also a parable about the artist and his inspiration. The play foundered when it opened on Broadway, but has since been recognised as a modern classic: in a good production, there’s a trembling sort of power to it. Friel’s writing can be rhythmical, incantatory, but it’s also gorgeously subtle. Although Friel throughout maintains a – crucial – ambivalence, the play attains a sort of transcendent grace of its own. HWPlays by this American writer tend to be long, slow – and strangely riveting. It’s hard to pin down what exactly makes John so bewitching. It is set in a kitschy, tat-filled Gettysburg guesthouse, where a fighting young couple interact with the dotty landlady and her blind but visionary friend. The house seems haunted: creepy dolls and pianos start playing themselves. But it’s also haunted by history (it was a civil war hospital), and by the older women’s memories of love, ghosts, and their own mystical experiences. All of this is a little spooky, but also rather emotionally stirring. Baker is also super sharp on the millennial couple’s dying relationship, which opens out into a look at how it’s often women who have to prop up men’s myths, to feed their needy hunger. HWFrom “I have always depended on the kindness of strangers” to “Stellaaaaaa”, Williams’s play has entered the popular consciousness. As well it might: there’s something eternal in its themes of loss, ageing, and the lies we live by. Fear and lust rub up against each other, sweatily few other writers have captured the heat of the South like Williams, and this is the playwright at his most atmospheric. Blanche DuBois – the deluded southern belle who shacks up with her sister and her macho, abusive husband – is a summit part for an actress, and everyone from Vivien Leigh to Tallulah Bankhead, Cate Blanchett to Gillian Anderson have had a go. HWThe only surviving full trilogy of Greek tragedies, through Agamemnon, The Libation Bearers, and The Eumenides Aeschylus traces the impact of violence and revenge down a Royal family, throwing questions of justice and duty into sharp relief. To win the Trojan war, Agamemnon sacrificed his daughter the trilogy opens with a play in which his wife Clytemnestra kills him to avenge her daughter’s death. In Libation Bearers, Clytemnestra’s son Orestes murders her in retaliation (if Antigone is a tragedy because it’s a conflict between right and right, this is perhaps a clash between wrong and wrong). The cycle is broken in Eumenides, where the gods form a court in which to try Orestes. It’s juicy, meaty, high-octane stuff – and has been given era-defining productions both in Peter Hall masked version at the National in 1981, and in Robert Icke’s crisp modern adaptation in 2015. HWPart of the playwright’s cycle exploring the African-American experience in 20th century American –  a play for each decade – this chapter is set in a Chicago recording studio in 1927. Ma Rainey, the “mother of the blues”, is slow to show up to record some tunes. Instead, we watch her band kill time and spar with one another. Although it all lands light as a butterfly, the script is stinging on subjects such as ambition and race relations. Ma Rainey, when she arrives, proves worth waiting for: an immense, haughty presence. There’s a twist towards the end, giving the play punch – plus the tunes are great, of course. HWIbsen wrote great women: we could have gone for Hedda Gabler. But A Doll’s House is one of those plays with a wide significance: written in 1879, it’s a proto-feminist text. When our troubled heroine Nora slams the door at the end of the play, it’s not just on her patronising husband, but on the whole of The Patriarchy. The play shocked some in its portrayal of a woman made so desperate by her suffocating domestic situation that she abandons her children as well as her husband, choosing freedom and self-actualistion over the prison of the home. Of course, things have changed for women since, but this exceptionally controlled play still unfolds perfectly – and that slam still resonates. HWYou could make a case for any of Chekhov’s plays really (we nearly went for his early, entertaining Platonov, just to be different) but the lucidity of The Seagull wins out. It’s got more plot, a sliver less ennui, than some of his others: a young man, Konstantin, longs to be a playwright his narcissistic mother Arkadina – an actress – is wrapped up in her new boyfriend, Trigorin, a successful novelist. He in turn romances Nina, Konstantin’s girlfriend and an aspiring actress. It’s not much of a spoiler to say none of their dreams exactly come true, life proving endlessly, exquisitely disappointing. The Seagull is a mordant comedy – scenes skewering both Arkadina’s monstrous ego and her son’s attempts at avant garde art are some of the best bits of theatre-about-theatre ever. But there’s also an unbearable tenderness to the play’s portrayal of young love, hope, and idealism. HW2340  Mother Courage and Her Children (1939), Bertolt Brecht Few, if any, playwrights of the 20th century had as much of an impact on theatre as Brecht: he wanted art to be a political tool rather than escapist entertainment, but also revolutionised theatrical form and style, doing away with naturalism. But it can mean his “epic theatre” is still associated with didacticism, rather than drama. Not so Mother Courage, though, which is epic in both senses: written after Hitler invaded Poland, but set during the Thirty-Years\u0027 War, it is a potent story of one mother’s attempts to profit from conflict, and the huge cost war always takes in the end. HWBased on the Greek myth where Medea kills her children in order to get revenge on her unfaithful husband, this tragedy has lost none of its force – or power to shock. But the text allows more sympathetic readings Medea too, as a woman fighting for justice in an unjust world. With a monumental lead part, and a chorus who react and comment on the action, the play has always been one of the most popular of the Greek tragedies. Taut and tense, you see the horror coming but feel desperately compelled to look. HWThe mother of a murdered child. Her imprisoned paedophile killer. A criminal psychologist attempting to understand what drove him to do it. Through first monologues, and then dialogue, this modem classic has much to say about the extremes of human anguish, but also our capacity for change, and for forgiveness. It’s a dark and thorny work, but a deeply humane one too, by a prolific British writer at her best. HW2640 The Importance of Being Earnest (1895), Oscar Wilde Has there every been such a reliably delightful comedy? The improbable plot of tangled engagements, lost handbags, invented wicked relatives, and real monstrous aunts runs like clockwork. There are innumerable blissful one-liners, the characters are delicious upper-class twits, and at every turn Wilde has a fine old time pricking societal niceties. It’s frothy fun, and funny froth, and always invites larger-than-life performances. Being so very bankable has led to Wilde’s play certainly being over-staged and it now feels thoroughly un-urgent – and then it makes you laugh all over again. HWSherman’s harrowing play pulls the rug from under you. You invest in the relationship between Max and Rudy, a decadent gay couple in Berlin in 1934 – but after the Night of the Long Knives they flee, before being caught and sent to Dachau. On the way, Max’s desire to survive produces sickening betrayal. He pretends to be Jewish rather than gay, but in the camp meets Horst, a man who reveals the honour in being true to one’s self. There’s an astonishing scene where – forbidden to touch – they have sex purely through words. Ian McKellen originally played Max, but Richard Gere and Alan Cummings have also taken on the role in what is now seen as seminal gay text – one that proves truth and love may flower in the most horrific, hopeless circumstances. HWAh, the transformative power of theatre… This familiar idea is irresistibly proven by Wertenbaker’s oft-revived play, based on a true story about a group of convicts in an Australian penal colony who put on a production of George Farquhar’s The Recruiting Officer. It has fun sending up the pretensions of theatre, but ultimately uses it as means for talking about empathy, communication, and understanding, as relations between the reviled prisoners and the cruel officers thaw. A direct piece of storytelling with a huge heart. HWLucy Prebble made her name with ENRON, charting the hubris of the financial giant, but while it may be less flashy, The Effect is still dazzlingly good. It has, at its heart, a question we’d all like to know the answer to: what is love? The play follows two volunteers in a clinical trial for a new anti-depressant when they fall for each other, they wonder whether their love is “real”, or a by-product. And given all interactions in the brain are just chemical, does it even matter? The idea of what’s really real and what’s really romantic, what happiness is and what function unhappiness might have, are turned over by Prebble’s own very sharp mind. Her characters are fun to spend time with, her dialogue is snappy, but she digs deep too, into both scientific theories and human emotions, taking us from the grey lows of depression to the technicolour highs of new love. HWIt can be hard to separate this play from an animating original performance by the great Mark Rylance, who played Johnny “Rooster” Byron – a wild misfit who lives in a caravan in the woods in rural England, gathering local young people to him like some kind of drink-and-drug-fuelled pied piper. Such a summary might sound tawdry, yet set on St George’s Day and ripe with Rooster’s storytelling, it has a mythic, mystical quality. A state-of-the-nation show powered by anti-establishment brio, it also precisely captures a contemporary rural community (very sweary, and very funny). Jerusalem became a ridiculously big hit, with audiences camping out round the theatre for tickets. But a recent revival suggests the play can still crow, whoever plays Rooster. HWWhat makes a great play? A lot of critics, academics, and playwrights themselves will point to form matching content. On this, Tim Crouch’s glitteringly clever play really delivers – while also being extremely moving. A stage hypnotist encounters the father of a girl he killed in a car accident. The father truly believes his daughter has been transformed into oak tree. At every performance, the father is played by an actor who’s never seen or read the play before they are given a script or fed lines by – yes – the hypnotist (played initially by Crouch himself, also acknowledging his “real” role as the playwright). The actor is transformed before us we accept that they are now the father. An Oak Tree has a radical honesty which has made it hugely influential among younger generation. We always know theatre isn’t “real” – by playfully acknowledging that, the emotional impact is actually heightened. It’s a magic trick where understanding the trickery only makes the magic more real. HWAthol Fugard came to see that the righteous anger of didactic anti-apartheid drama was not as effective as the subversive laughter of the black townships when it came to getting across the harshness of the conditions there. Certainly, there is nothing moralising or solemn about this piece which was developed by Fugard from improvisations with the great John Kani and Winston Ntosha who first performed it. A mischievous shaggy dog story, it pulls the audience into an atmosphere of good-humoured sociability. Sizwe is a work-seeker in Port Elizabeth who can\u0027t get a job because he doesn\u0027t have a permit. It turns out that he has found a dead man\u0027s pass book and has substituted his own photo, killing off Sizwe Bansi. A deceptively light and humane play that outlasts the apartheid era. PT3340 Purgatory in Ingolstadt (1924)  Pioneers in Ingolstadt (1928), Marieluise FleisserMarieluise Fleisser, the author of these sorely neglected plays, was the lover, protégée, and victim of Bertolt Brecht, and her subject was the lower Bavarian city of her birth. The plays use a bold collage technique instead of linear narrative, and she had penetrating insights into its vicious pack mentality and conformist claustrophobia. In Purgatory, she evokes a stifling Catholic ethos: we see two very different rebels (one girl seeks in vain for an abortion) who suffer the humiliation of having to crawl back to the pack. Brecht effectively hijacked her second play Pioneers (about the contact between the inhabitants and a visiting squad of bridge-builders). He imposed overt anti-militarism and sensationalising sex, and Fleisser was denounced as a traitor to German womanhood. Stephen Daldry and Annie Castledine directed a superb version of these plays at the tiny Gate Theatre in 1991. Since when, nothing. It\u0027s high time Fleisser was given her due. PTTempting as it is to include Michael Frayn’s sublimely funny backstage farce, Noises Off, the more serious Copenhagen just pips it. It imagines a real meeting between nuclear physicists, the Dane Niels Bohr and German Werner Heisenberg, in Copenhagen in 1941, to discuss developments that will lead to the atomic bomb. Then he reimagines the meeting, and reimagines it again – after all, no-one really knows what happened. Was Heisenberg warning his old friend of the Nazis’ advances in nuclear weapons? Hoping for a mutual pact to prevent the atomic bomb? Seeking absolution? Looking at the unreliability of memory, the structure of Frayn’s play is cleverly animated by the scientific ideas his characters discuss: Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle is the basis for its dramatic form. A big hit when it opened at the National, it went to the West End, Broadway – and wound up on TV, starring Daniel Craig. HWThis play was a theatrical explosion. Sarah Kane’s debut, written while she was a student, features a nasty tabloid journalist holed up in a Leeds hotel with a much younger woman, whom he sexually abuses. The world of the play – and its conventional theatrical form – is then blasted apart becoming a war zone: a soldier bursts in, explosions go off, and short scenes of grim horror unfold (stage directions include “he eats the baby”). Famously described as a “disgusting feast of filth”, Blasted was seen by critics as a puerile attempt to shock, and anointed as the classic example of provocative, Nineties in-yer-face theatre. But it’s since become canonical. It doesn’t seem to grow old: Kane’s writing has a horribly vivid energy, and the atrocities it depicts, depressingly, take on fresh resonance for each generation that discovers it. HWWho committed the first infidelity? Was it a man, or was it a woman? (You can bet it was a man who first thought of this prurient question.) The court in Marivaux\u0027s dark comedy thinks it has created the right laboratory conditions for finding out the answer. Four teenagers have been brought up in complete solitude and then are released into each other\u0027s company where their encounters will furnish “a most original entertainment” for the unseen Prince and his fiancée. The play incisively shows how easy it is to turn a stage into an experimental blank slate. But it feels a bit pervy – the Enlightenment\u0027s idea of reality television. Marivaux is elegantly conscious of the objections. There are razor blades secreted in the rococo décor of his works. PTIt\u0027s easy to make Pirandello sound like a forbiddingly cerebral writer. All his life he played tricksy games with philosophical problems such as the deceptiveness of identity. But his aim was to “to convert intellect into passion” and his best works succeed in doing so. Henry IV is about madness, the appearance of madness, and the consequence of deciding to become trapped within the appearance of madness. The protagonist is an Italian nobleman who falls from his horse at a pageant and comes round, convinced that he\u0027s the medieval German Emperor. For 20 years, he has been allowed to live this illusion, attended by flunkies in period-costume. But now comes an embassy bent on “shocking” him from this idee fixe. Richard Harris and Ian McDiarmid were the last pair to play Henry in the West End and they relished the chance to interweave the quizzicality and raw pain that the part requires. The predicament of the central character feels more tragicomically stimulating than far-fetched. PT3840 A Raisin in the Sun (1959), Lorraine HansberryThis play made history: the first on Broadway written by a black woman (shamefully, Britain wouldn’t have its equivalent – a play in the West End by a black British woman – until last year, with Natasha Gordon’s Nine Night). A Raisin in the Sun looks at the Youngers, an African-American family living in poverty in Chicago, dreaming of a better life – and fearing that their dreams will shrivel up like “a raisin in the sun”. Hansberry’s aching drama exhibits the same forceful tug as an Arthur Miller play, laying out how circumstances can crush hope. Its discussion of black identity, however, still crackles today – and the emotional punch that Hansberry’s script carries has drawn big names down the decade: Sidney Poitier starred in the premiere, and everyone from Denzel Washington to P Diddy has also had a crack. Hansberry died at only 34 one can’t help but wonder what other plays she might have had on this list. HWCaryl Churchill has been called the Picasso of modern playwrights. Today, at the age of 80, the British playwright continues startlingly to reinvent herself. Far Away is a twisted fairy tale that demonstrates her matchless gift for merging the apocalyptic and the fantastical. It unfolds in three episodes that shelve steeply. In the first, Joan is quizzing her aunt about what she has just accidentally witnessed. It sounds as if she has espied a bloody act of ethnic cleansing. Then the play escalates into a blackly hilarious vision of cosmic warfare. Partisan brutality has now spread from humans to the animal and mineral world. “The cats have come in on the side of the French,” someone says earnestly. The “natural goodness of deer has come through” says someone else. This is characteristic of Churchill, finding a brilliantly absurdist way of attacking the pernicious myth that there is a simple ide between virtue and evil, “them” and “us”. A sliver of genius. PTTom Stoppard sometimes gets accused of being all head and no heart – but this play proves otherwise. Yes, it’s a mind-achingly clever look at both science and art, pitting the rational against the romantic, while giving you mini lessons in chaos theory, the second law of thermodynamics and the life and shaggings of Lord Byron. But there’s a love story and a tragedy here, that in a well-calibrated production can be very moving. Two stories, set in the same country house, in 1809 and the present day, intersect and eventually overlap beautifully. The mathematic theorising forecasts hope as well as disaster for the universe, and the story offers the same for its characters. HWCalderon\u0027s play is one of the masterpieces of the Spanish Golden Age. The predicament of the young prince, Segismundo, calls to mind the Chinese sage\u0027s story of the man who dreams he is a butterfly and wakes to wonder whether he is actually a butterfly dreaming he is a man. This youth is at the mercy of political fluctuation: he\u0027s been imprisoned in a dark tower from birth because of a horoscope that predicted he would usurp the throne. Then, when there are anxieties about the succession, his father has him drugged, brought to the Palace, and bafflingly treated like a prince. A poetic piece that tackles deep metaphysical, political matters in a dazzlingly theatrical way. PTA play of astonishing breakthroughs. There had been plenty of soliloquies in Elizabethan drama beforehand. But no-one had ever talked to an audience like Hamlet. He doesn\u0027t just let you into his confidence, he lets you into his consciousness the best portrayals make you feel that you are soul-to-soul with this figure. It\u0027s his capacity for searching introspection that gets in the way and disqualifies Hamlet as a revenge hero: he\u0027s rather wonderfully miscast. Hamlet is brilliantly self-reflexive, constantly probing its own theatricality. The conscience of Claudius is tested by a play-within-a play Hamlet tries to fool the court by assuming an “antic disposition” that may at times waver into authentic madness. The piece is like a painful meditation on the contradicting meanings of the verb to “act” – to feign and to intervene. Inexhaustible. PTFeminism and expressionism collide in US playwright Sophie Treadwell\u0027s extraordinary vision of a mechanised, dehumanising metropolis. We feel the nerve-shredding racket of modern existence – described as “this purgatory of noise” – assaulting the Everywoman character at every stage as she makes her descent to doom. She\u0027s a stenographer, a sensitive cog in the machine who is blackmailed by her mother into marriage with a boss who revolts her, and ends up condemned to the electric chair for murdering him. Treadwell\u0027s nagging dialogue, with its jangly staccato and syncopated telegraphese, uncannily anticipates Harold Pinter and David Mamet. Her cry against institutionalised misogyny – “I will not submit” – resounds down the ages. PTIn Gogol\u0027s great phantasmagoric farce, an impecunious clerk newly arrived from St Petersburg is mistakenly assumed to be the eponymous inspector by the corrupt mayor and officials of this provincial town. Panic drives these paranoid locals to project a false identity onto this stranger. That would have been a good enough joke. Gogol, though, gives it an inspired, twist. His penniless nonenity turns out to be driven by an equivalent dread of being recognised as one of life\u0027s losers. So when he twigs to their exploitable mistake, he treats their absurd respect (not to mention their bribes) as long-overdue recognition of his true worth and becomes airborne with grandiosity. It\u0027s the interlocking lunacies that generate the comic delirium in this Russian masterpiece. PTOne of Pinter\u0027s most haunting and unnerving pieces. A married couple, Kate and Deeley, play games of power and possessiveness with the wife\u0027s former flatmate, Anna, who comes to visit for the first time in 20 years. The piece is horribly preoccupied with the use people make of selective – and conceivably invented – memories as weapon or way of gaining the upper hand. We mint memories, in this understanding of it, in response to the psychological needs of the moment: “There are things I remember which may never have happened, but as I recall them.” Deeley is threatened by Anna\u0027s youthful relationship to his wife and strongly attracted to the newcomer. There’s a wonderful evocation of rackety London when the girls lived as secretaries, but the uneasy comedy of all this turns lethal. PTThe best Jacobean tragedy outside Shakespeare, The Changeling also seems to anticipate film noir. The heroine hires a shady type to bump off her fiance. This villain has a facial disfigurement, but the piece is alert to how perversely attracted we are to what repels us. The assassin demands her virginity as his blood-money and the slide into shadowy corruption becomes inexorable. There is a subplot in a madhouse that is designed as a distorted mirror of the main action in its obsession with disguise, lunacy, and sex. PTThis Pulitzer-winning American playwright explores the history of her great-grandmother in early 20th century New York. Esther is a black seamstress – unmarried and illiterate – who sews ravishingly beautiful garments for other women to wear on their wedding nights. She gets what could be a last chance of happiness but it\u0027s destroyed in circumstances that are never sentimentalised. The sensual feel of fine fabric (her means of supporting and expressing herself) is conveyed with gorgeous descriptive power. Intimate Apparel manages to be uplifting without ever losing its irreverent humour. PTSophocles\u0027s play is still the most powerful ever written about the conflict between our obligations to the state and our duty to the ties of kinship. Antigone defies her uncle Kreon, the new ruler of Thebes, by burying her brother Polyneikes. He had brought an army against his native city and Kreon, in these politically volatile times, wants his corpse left for the dogs as an exemplary desecration. The philosopher Hegel saw this as the quintessence of true tragedy: not a conflict between good and evil, but between right and right. In fact, productions nowadays tend to come down in favour of Antigone and her self-sacrificing intransigence. PTRichard Bean had the inspired idea of transposing Goldoni\u0027s 18th century commedia dell\u0027arte romp from Venice to Brighton in 1963. Our jack-the-lad hero – frantically trying to hold down a pair of jobs, unbeknownst to either boss – is a failed skiffle player. The complications are deliciously warped. One character does a bunk to Brighton disguised as her psychotic twin brother who has been bumped off by her posh twit of a boyfriend in a gangland brawl. Still with me? The dialogue is naughty and knowing, but there\u0027s a terrific innocent joy to the physical clowning which peaks in the delirious sequence where our hero has to dish up lunch to the two masters at the same time. PTA supreme example of how a writer can make a play by putting together a triptych of miniatures. Holman was brought up in the pacifist tradition and Making Noise Quietly looks at the long-range effects of war in three chance encounters. In the first, set in a Kent field in 1943, a northern Quaker and an uninhibited London aesthete discuss their reasons for not fighting. In the second, a naval officer arrives to tell a mother of her son’s death in the Falklands War. The third is set in the Black Forest in 1986. An English private, gone AWOL with his disturbed eight-year-old stepson, come into testing collision with a rich German businesswoman who survived the Holocaust. There\u0027s a stunning scene in which she draws the little boy out of his dogmatic mutism by her repeated, stern insistence that he says “thank you” it\u0027s uplifing in the end but it\u0027s not pretty. Writing of rare sensitivity and cumulative power. PTThough he described it as “the lightest of light comedies”, Private Lives is the Noel Coward play that one would undoubtedly preserve for posterity. He wrote it as a vehicle for himself and Gertrude Lawrence, with indecent speed. The play centres on two orcees who, five years after their split, bump into each other on adjacent hotel balconies while on the first night of honeymoons with their new spouses. An elegantly contrived coincidence followed by a pattern of cheekily reversed expectations: most comedies end in marriage this one begins with nobbled nuptials as the couple unceremoniously ditch their second partners and abscond to Paris together. Elyot and Amanda are the kind of flighty egotistical couple that can neither live together nor apart. Anti-romantic comedy soaked in sex (and romance): “Don\u0027t quibble Sybil.” PT1240 Angels in America (1990-93), Tony KushnerSubtitled “A Gay Fantasia on National Themes”, Tony Kushner\u0027s astonishing two-part play is set in the AIDS crisis of the mid-1980s during the right wing administration of Ronald Reagan. The word AIDS was never mentioned by the President, and the struggle to find a cure was hampered by a lack of government recognition. Kushner retaliated by putting gay men centre stage in an epic that shows them fighting to forge their private and public destinies. This is, however, very far from a conventional “issue” play in its glorious ambition. The piece rages from Antarctica and the damaged ozone layer to a baroque heaven that god has abandoned. Prophetic angels crash through ceilings. There are “mutual dream” sequences where people wander in and out of each other\u0027 fantasies. The presiding demon of the piece is one of drama\u0027s greatest monsters: the incorrigible and shameless Roy Cohn was a real-life Republican fixer (and mentor to the young Donald Trump). PTA middle-aged woman is buried in a mound of earth first up to the waist then, after the interval, up to the neck. It is a sight that has never lost its capacity to startle. Beckett\u0027s Winnie prattles away dogged with optimism (“This will have been another happy day”) in a loquacious attempt to stave off hysteria and despair at her encroaching fate. Partly irritating, partly heroic, she brings forth a dotty lyrical monologue that\u0027s threaded with genteel half-remembered wisps from the “immortal” classics. Peter Hall, who directed Peggy Ashcroft in the part, rightly pointed out that “Beckett\u0027s theatre is as much about mime and physical precision as it is about words”. Except that his texts are great and this one is superb beyond belief. To quote Winnie: “What is that unforgettable line?” PT1440  Long Day’s Journey into Night (1940), Eugene O NeillWhen O\u0027Neill described Long Day\u0027s Journey as a “play of old sorrow, written in blood and tears”, he was barely exaggerating. This enormous autobiographical drama is so raw and unremitting in its revelations about his dysfunctional Irish-Catholic family that the author left instructions – mercifully disobeyed by his widow – that the play was not to be performed until 25 years after his death. You can understand the trepidation. Long Day\u0027s Journey plunges deep into the tortured heart of the Tyrones – James, the acclaimed actor who sold out to commercial success, his wife Mary who has recently relapsed into morphine addiction, and their two sons. When the play is under the baton of the right director, it\u0027s the like listening to the recapitulations in a great piece of music. You emerge drained but in a state of elating catharsis. PTHector wants to teach boys knowledge that will last them a lifetime. But the headmaster has become obsessed with government league tables and has hired Irwin to teach them glib, exam-passing techniques. That\u0027s the clash at the heart of Alan Bennett\u0027s hugely popular hit. It\u0027s set at a Yorkshire grammar amongst a group of clever sixth-formers. As with a lot of Bennett\u0027s work you can discern a revue-like structure in the play\u0027s glorious string of skits, gags, songs and sheer elating silliness. But it\u0027s also a brilliant portrait of a maverick teacher. The scene in which the doomed Hector analyses the Hardy poem “Drummer Hodge” with his pupil Posner is unsurpassed in drama as an example of humane teaching. Gay, unhappy Posner also has the play\u0027s best joke: “I\u0027m a Jew. I\u0027m small. I\u0027m homosexual. And I live in Sheffield. I\u0027m fucked.” PTFrank Hardy, an itinerant Irish faith healer, his wife, and his manager tell four monologues that contradict each other, leaving the audience to question truth and memory, lies and storytelling. Frank struggles to understand his own “gift”, and how his ability to cure comes and goes Faith Healer is also a parable about the artist and his inspiration. The play foundered when it opened on Broadway, but has since been recognised as a modern classic: in a good production, there’s a trembling sort of power to it. Friel’s writing can be rhythmical, incantatory, but it’s also gorgeously subtle. Although Friel throughout maintains a – crucial – ambivalence, the play attains a sort of transcendent grace of its own. HWPlays by this American writer tend to be long, slow – and strangely riveting. It’s hard to pin down what exactly makes John so bewitching. It is set in a kitschy, tat-filled Gettysburg guesthouse, where a fighting young couple interact with the dotty landlady and her blind but visionary friend. The house seems haunted: creepy dolls and pianos start playing themselves. But it’s also haunted by history (it was a civil war hospital), and by the older women’s memories of love, ghosts, and their own mystical experiences. All of this is a little spooky, but also rather emotionally stirring. Baker is also super sharp on the millennial couple’s dying relationship, which opens out into a look at how it’s often women who have to prop up men’s myths, to feed their needy hunger. HWFrom “I have always depended on the kindness of strangers” to “Stellaaaaaa”, Williams’s play has entered the popular consciousness. As well it might: there’s something eternal in its themes of loss, ageing, and the lies we live by. Fear and lust rub up against each other, sweatily few other writers have captured the heat of the South like Williams, and this is the playwright at his most atmospheric. Blanche DuBois – the deluded southern belle who shacks up with her sister and her macho, abusive husband – is a summit part for an actress, and everyone from Vivien Leigh to Tallulah Bankhead, Cate Blanchett to Gillian Anderson have had a go. HWThe only surviving full trilogy of Greek tragedies, through Agamemnon, The Libation Bearers, and The Eumenides Aeschylus traces the impact of violence and revenge down a Royal family, throwing questions of justice and duty into sharp relief. To win the Trojan war, Agamemnon sacrificed his daughter the trilogy opens with a play in which his wife Clytemnestra kills him to avenge her daughter’s death. In Libation Bearers, Clytemnestra’s son Orestes murders her in retaliation (if Antigone is a tragedy because it’s a conflict between right and right, this is perhaps a clash between wrong and wrong). The cycle is broken in Eumenides, where the gods form a court in which to try Orestes. It’s juicy, meaty, high-octane stuff – and has been given era-defining productions both in Peter Hall masked version at the National in 1981, and in Robert Icke’s crisp modern adaptation in 2015. HWPart of the playwright’s cycle exploring the African-American experience in 20th century American –  a play for each decade – this chapter is set in a Chicago recording studio in 1927. Ma Rainey, the “mother of the blues”, is slow to show up to record some tunes. Instead, we watch her band kill time and spar with one another. Although it all lands light as a butterfly, the script is stinging on subjects such as ambition and race relations. Ma Rainey, when she arrives, proves worth waiting for: an immense, haughty presence. There’s a twist towards the end, giving the play punch – plus the tunes are great, of course. HWIbsen wrote great women: we could have gone for Hedda Gabler. But A Doll’s House is one of those plays with a wide significance: written in 1879, it’s a proto-feminist text. When our troubled heroine Nora slams the door at the end of the play, it’s not just on her patronising husband, but on the whole of The Patriarchy. The play shocked some in its portrayal of a woman made so desperate by her suffocating domestic situation that she abandons her children as well as her husband, choosing freedom and self-actualistion over the prison of the home. Of course, things have changed for women since, but this exceptionally controlled play still unfolds perfectly – and that slam still resonates. HWYou could make a case for any of Chekhov’s plays really (we nearly went for his early, entertaining Platonov, just to be different) but the lucidity of The Seagull wins out. It’s got more plot, a sliver less ennui, than some of his others: a young man, Konstantin, longs to be a playwright his narcissistic mother Arkadina – an actress – is wrapped up in her new boyfriend, Trigorin, a successful novelist. He in turn romances Nina, Konstantin’s girlfriend and an aspiring actress. It’s not much of a spoiler to say none of their dreams exactly come true, life proving endlessly, exquisitely disappointing. The Seagull is a mordant comedy – scenes skewering both Arkadina’s monstrous ego and her son’s attempts at avant garde art are some of the best bits of theatre-about-theatre ever. But there’s also an unbearable tenderness to the play’s portrayal of young love, hope, and idealism. HW2340  Mother Courage and Her Children (1939), Bertolt Brecht Few, if any, playwrights of the 20th century had as much of an impact on theatre as Brecht: he wanted art to be a political tool rather than escapist entertainment, but also revolutionised theatrical form and style, doing away with naturalism. But it can mean his “epic theatre” is still associated with didacticism, rather than drama. Not so Mother Courage, though, which is epic in both senses: written after Hitler invaded Poland, but set during the Thirty-Years\u0027 War, it is a potent story of one mother’s attempts to profit from conflict, and the huge cost war always takes in the end. HWBased on the Greek myth where Medea kills her children in order to get revenge on her unfaithful husband, this tragedy has lost none of its force – or power to shock. But the text allows more sympathetic readings Medea too, as a woman fighting for justice in an unjust world. With a monumental lead part, and a chorus who react and comment on the action, the play has always been one of the most popular of the Greek tragedies. Taut and tense, you see the horror coming but feel desperately compelled to look. HWThe mother of a murdered child. Her imprisoned paedophile killer. A criminal psychologist attempting to understand what drove him to do it. Through first monologues, and then dialogue, this modem classic has much to say about the extremes of human anguish, but also our capacity for change, and for forgiveness. It’s a dark and thorny work, but a deeply humane one too, by a prolific British writer at her best. HW2640 The Importance of Being Earnest (1895), Oscar Wilde Has there every been such a reliably delightful comedy? The improbable plot of tangled engagements, lost handbags, invented wicked relatives, and real monstrous aunts runs like clockwork. There are innumerable blissful one-liners, the characters are delicious upper-class twits, and at every turn Wilde has a fine old time pricking societal niceties. It’s frothy fun, and funny froth, and always invites larger-than-life performances. Being so very bankable has led to Wilde’s play certainly being over-staged and it now feels thoroughly un-urgent – and then it makes you laugh all over again. HWSherman’s harrowing play pulls the rug from under you. You invest in the relationship between Max and Rudy, a decadent gay couple in Berlin in 1934 – but after the Night of the Long Knives they flee, before being caught and sent to Dachau. On the way, Max’s desire to survive produces sickening betrayal. He pretends to be Jewish rather than gay, but in the camp meets Horst, a man who reveals the honour in being true to one’s self. There’s an astonishing scene where – forbidden to touch – they have sex purely through words. Ian McKellen originally played Max, but Richard Gere and Alan Cummings have also taken on the role in what is now seen as seminal gay text – one that proves truth and love may flower in the most horrific, hopeless circumstances. HWAh, the transformative power of theatre… This familiar idea is irresistibly proven by Wertenbaker’s oft-revived play, based on a true story about a group of convicts in an Australian penal colony who put on a production of George Farquhar’s The Recruiting Officer. It has fun sending up the pretensions of theatre, but ultimately uses it as means for talking about empathy, communication, and understanding, as relations between the reviled prisoners and the cruel officers thaw. A direct piece of storytelling with a huge heart. HWLucy Prebble made her name with ENRON, charting the hubris of the financial giant, but while it may be less flashy, The Effect is still dazzlingly good. It has, at its heart, a question we’d all like to know the answer to: what is love? The play follows two volunteers in a clinical trial for a new anti-depressant when they fall for each other, they wonder whether their love is “real”, or a by-product. And given all interactions in the brain are just chemical, does it even matter? The idea of what’s really real and what’s really romantic, what happiness is and what function unhappiness might have, are turned over by Prebble’s own very sharp mind. Her characters are fun to spend time with, her dialogue is snappy, but she digs deep too, into both scientific theories and human emotions, taking us from the grey lows of depression to the technicolour highs of new love. HWIt can be hard to separate this play from an animating original performance by the great Mark Rylance, who played Johnny “Rooster” Byron – a wild misfit who lives in a caravan in the woods in rural England, gathering local young people to him like some kind of drink-and-drug-fuelled pied piper. Such a summary might sound tawdry, yet set on St George’s Day and ripe with Rooster’s storytelling, it has a mythic, mystical quality. A state-of-the-nation show powered by anti-establishment brio, it also precisely captures a contemporary rural community (very sweary, and very funny). Jerusalem became a ridiculously big hit, with audiences camping out round the theatre for tickets. But a recent revival suggests the play can still crow, whoever plays Rooster. HWWhat makes a great play? A lot of critics, academics, and playwrights themselves will point to form matching content. On this, Tim Crouch’s glitteringly clever play really delivers – while also being extremely moving. A stage hypnotist encounters the father of a girl he killed in a car accident. The father truly believes his daughter has been transformed into oak tree. At every performance, the father is played by an actor who’s never seen or read the play before they are given a script or fed lines by – yes – the hypnotist (played initially by Crouch himself, also acknowledging his “real” role as the playwright). The actor is transformed before us we accept that they are now the father. An Oak Tree has a radical honesty which has made it hugely influential among younger generation. We always know theatre isn’t “real” – by playfully acknowledging that, the emotional impact is actually heightened. It’s a magic trick where understanding the trickery only makes the magic more real. HWAthol Fugard came to see that the righteous anger of didactic anti-apartheid drama was not as effective as the subversive laughter of the black townships when it came to getting across the harshness of the conditions there. Certainly, there is nothing moralising or solemn about this piece which was developed by Fugard from improvisations with the great John Kani and Winston Ntosha who first performed it. A mischievous shaggy dog story, it pulls the audience into an atmosphere of good-humoured sociability. Sizwe is a work-seeker in Port Elizabeth who can\u0027t get a job because he doesn\u0027t have a permit. It turns out that he has found a dead man\u0027s pass book and has substituted his own photo, killing off Sizwe Bansi. A deceptively light and humane play that outlasts the apartheid era. PT3340 Purgatory in Ingolstadt (1924)  Pioneers in Ingolstadt (1928), Marieluise FleisserMarieluise Fleisser, the author of these sorely neglected plays, was the lover, protégée, and victim of Bertolt Brecht, and her subject was the lower Bavarian city of her birth. The plays use a bold collage technique instead of linear narrative, and she had penetrating insights into its vicious pack mentality and conformist claustrophobia. In Purgatory, she evokes a stifling Catholic ethos: we see two very different rebels (one girl seeks in vain for an abortion) who suffer the humiliation of having to crawl back to the pack. Brecht effectively hijacked her second play Pioneers (about the contact between the inhabitants and a visiting squad of bridge-builders). He imposed overt anti-militarism and sensationalising sex, and Fleisser was denounced as a traitor to German womanhood. Stephen Daldry and Annie Castledine directed a superb version of these plays at the tiny Gate Theatre in 1991. Since when, nothing. It\u0027s high time Fleisser was given her due. PTTempting as it is to include Michael Frayn’s sublimely funny backstage farce, Noises Off, the more serious Copenhagen just pips it. It imagines a real meeting between nuclear physicists, the Dane Niels Bohr and German Werner Heisenberg, in Copenhagen in 1941, to discuss developments that will lead to the atomic bomb. Then he reimagines the meeting, and reimagines it again – after all, no-one really knows what happened. Was Heisenberg warning his old friend of the Nazis’ advances in nuclear weapons? Hoping for a mutual pact to prevent the atomic bomb? Seeking absolution? Looking at the unreliability of memory, the structure of Frayn’s play is cleverly animated by the scientific ideas his characters discuss: Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle is the basis for its dramatic form. A big hit when it opened at the National, it went to the West End, Broadway – and wound up on TV, starring Daniel Craig. HWThis play was a theatrical explosion. Sarah Kane’s debut, written while she was a student, features a nasty tabloid journalist holed up in a Leeds hotel with a much younger woman, whom he sexually abuses. The world of the play – and its conventional theatrical form – is then blasted apart becoming a war zone: a soldier bursts in, explosions go off, and short scenes of grim horror unfold (stage directions include “he eats the baby”). Famously described as a “disgusting feast of filth”, Blasted was seen by critics as a puerile attempt to shock, and anointed as the classic example of provocative, Nineties in-yer-face theatre. But it’s since become canonical. It doesn’t seem to grow old: Kane’s writing has a horribly vivid energy, and the atrocities it depicts, depressingly, take on fresh resonance for each generation that discovers it. HWWho committed the first infidelity? Was it a man, or was it a woman? (You can bet it was a man who first thought of this prurient question.) The court in Marivaux\u0027s dark comedy thinks it has created the right laboratory conditions for finding out the answer. Four teenagers have been brought up in complete solitude and then are released into each other\u0027s company where their encounters will furnish “a most original entertainment” for the unseen Prince and his fiancée. The play incisively shows how easy it is to turn a stage into an experimental blank slate. But it feels a bit pervy – the Enlightenment\u0027s idea of reality television. Marivaux is elegantly conscious of the objections. There are razor blades secreted in the rococo décor of his works. PTIt\u0027s easy to make Pirandello sound like a forbiddingly cerebral writer. All his life he played tricksy games with philosophical problems such as the deceptiveness of identity. But his aim was to “to convert intellect into passion” and his best works succeed in doing so. Henry IV is about madness, the appearance of madness, and the consequence of deciding to become trapped within the appearance of madness. The protagonist is an Italian nobleman who falls from his horse at a pageant and comes round, convinced that he\u0027s the medieval German Emperor. For 20 years, he has been allowed to live this illusion, attended by flunkies in period-costume. But now comes an embassy bent on “shocking” him from this idee fixe. Richard Harris and Ian McDiarmid were the last pair to play Henry in the West End and they relished the chance to interweave the quizzicality and raw pain that the part requires. The predicament of the central character feels more tragicomically stimulating than far-fetched. PT3840 A Raisin in the Sun (1959), Lorraine HansberryThis play made history: the first on Broadway written by a black woman (shamefully, Britain wouldn’t have its equivalent – a play in the West End by a black British woman – until last year, with Natasha Gordon’s Nine Night). A Raisin in the Sun looks at the Youngers, an African-American family living in poverty in Chicago, dreaming of a better life – and fearing that their dreams will shrivel up like “a raisin in the sun”. Hansberry’s aching drama exhibits the same forceful tug as an Arthur Miller play, laying out how circumstances can crush hope. Its discussion of black identity, however, still crackles today – and the emotional punch that Hansberry’s script carries has drawn big names down the decade: Sidney Poitier starred in the premiere, and everyone from Denzel Washington to P Diddy has also had a crack. Hansberry died at only 34 one can’t help but wonder what other plays she might have had on this list. HWCaryl Churchill has been called the Picasso of modern playwrights. Today, at the age of 80, the British playwright continues startlingly to reinvent herself. Far Away is a twisted fairy tale that demonstrates her matchless gift for merging the apocalyptic and the fantastical. It unfolds in three episodes that shelve steeply. In the first, Joan is quizzing her aunt about what she has just accidentally witnessed. It sounds as if she has espied a bloody act of ethnic cleansing. Then the play escalates into a blackly hilarious vision of cosmic warfare. Partisan brutality has now spread from humans to the animal and mineral world. “The cats have come in on the side of the French,” someone says earnestly. The “natural goodness of deer has come through” says someone else. This is characteristic of Churchill, finding a brilliantly absurdist way of attacking the pernicious myth that there is a simple ide between virtue and evil, “them” and “us”. A sliver of genius. PTTom Stoppard sometimes gets accused of being all head and no heart – but this play proves otherwise. Yes, it’s a mind-achingly clever look at both science and art, pitting the rational against the romantic, while giving you mini lessons in chaos theory, the second law of thermodynamics and the life and shaggings of Lord Byron. But there’s a love story and a tragedy here, that in a well-calibrated production can be very moving. Two stories, set in the same country house, in 1809 and the present day, intersect and eventually overlap beautifully. The mathematic theorising forecasts hope as well as disaster for the universe, and the story offers the same for its characters.

Two consecutive quarters of contraction are typically defined as a recession.The contraction between April and June was mostly driven by sinking demand from abroad, the Bundesbank said. Exports “were down substantially”, it noted, as pre-Brexit preparations ahead of the UK’s initial exit date at the end of March prompted companies to build up stocks in the first quarter.“As things currently stand, it is unclear whether exports and, by extension, industry will regain their footing before the domestic economy becomes more severely affected,” the Bundesbank said.Appetite for German cars and other goods has also waned in China as growth in the world’s second-largest economy is cooling, partly due to the year-long trade war with the US.Up until a week ago, economists surveyed by Bloomberg were predicting\u0026nbspthat Germany’s economy will grow by 0.2 per cent in the current quarter.But since then big-name institutions including Deutsche Bank have lowered their expectations. The concern for many analysts is that continuing global trade tensions will prolong the downturn in German manufacturing and eventually feed through to the still-strong services sector.The central bank’s forecast follows weeks of disappointing economic data and news of meagre earnings at German companies. The government has signalled that it might be willing to step up spending should the downturn worsen.The European Central Bank is also considering providing extra monetary stimulus to the wider euro zone.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

So are\u0026nbspattempts by the Saudis to reheat isions between Sunnis and Shia. Are we right to view the region as a place of sectarian strife, asks Robert Fisk. Or is religious coexistence in the Arab world much stronger than antagonism and violence?Click to followThe IndependentThere are two stories that I and my colleagues have been writing about the Middle East for more than 40 years. Both are wrong.\u0026nbspThe first is that the next war will be about water. Or the lack of it. I started writing about the conflict over H2O when I visited Aleppo and found that the Queiq river – which was supposed to run beneath the fine white stone bridges in the city centre – only reached the outskirts as a two-foot wide stream of sewage.Turkey decided to build dams on the Tigris – and the waters of that great river started to fall in Iraq. The Lebanese claimed that the Israelis were stealing water from the Litani river in southern Lebanon. There were secret pipelines in deep valleys invisible from the air, they said. I trudged with UN soldiers through the actual river, downstream, in these dark ravines. But there were no pipes.And there’s been no war. The second, far more sinister, story we’ve all covered is that the Middle East is a sectarian quagmire in which religion and faith have created an age-old antagonism between Muslims and Christians, between Sunni Muslims and Shia Muslims and between Muslims, Christians and Jews. The region is therefore permanently at war, its people poisoned by sectarian hatreds and doomed to eternal conflict — which we civilised westerners must occasionally step in to sort out.\u0026nbspDidn’t the French and British arrive in Lebanon in 1860 to stop the Druze slaughtering the Christian Maronites? Didn’t the British have to intervene to stop fighting between Muslim and Christian Palestinians and Jewish immigrants in Palestine between 1920 and our humiliating retreat in 1948? Didn’t the Americans and British and French and Italians arrive in Lebanon to end a Christian-Muslim civil war in 1982? Didn’t the Americans have to send their troops to separate Sunni and Shia death squads in 2004 and 2005 and 2006?In our reports – certainly in mine – much emphasis was placed on the suffering of Catholic Maronites in Lebanon, Copts in Egypt and Catholics and other Christian sects in Iraq. They were being slowly driven from the Holy Land, we would write. I recall visiting a clutch of burnt-out Egyptian churches and bombed churches in Iraq. The headlines – for obvious reasons — always used the word “exodus”. And the flight of the Christians – to Europe, America, Australia – was always “of Biblical proportions”.Mahmoud Abbas and Pope Francis in front of the Church of Nativity\u0026nbspin Bethlehem\u0026nbsp(AFPGetty)In the northern Syrian city of Qamishleh, I sat beside a church with a group of Orthodox and Catholic bishops and clergymen in a variety of black hats and red sashes. The Syrian war had been underway for four years. Please, they begged, stop telling Christians to leave the Middle East. We had been attending a Syriac wedding where clerics were bedecked in gold, scarlet and black robes. There were hosts of blazing candles, a multitude of blessings, and much ululating a very definite reminder that Christianity was an Eastern – not a western – religion. But of Qamishleh’s 8,000 Christian souls, only 5,000 remained. Isis\u0026nbsphad seen to that. Most of the Christians were Assyrians, the descendants of the 1915 Assyrian genocide, which accompanied the far larger holocaust of a million and a half Armenian Christians at the hands of the Ottoman Turks.The clerics in Qamishleh – part of it still held by the Syrian regime, the rest by the Kurds — believed that their latest “exodus”\u0026nbsp(there I go again) only began after the 2003 Anglo-American invasion of Iraq whose architects, as we all know, were born-again Christians. One of the priests spoke loudly and with considerable anger. “This loss of Christians is a very negative thing,” he said.Among the priests was a certain Father Gabriel, tired and sick since he fled his Syriac church in Deir ez-Zour in July 2012. “Nusra totally destroyed our church there and all our houses,” he said. “We thought we would be able to return in about 15\u0026nbspdays…”. Which is, I noted at the time, what the Palestinians – Christians as well as Muslims – thought when they fled their homes in 1948. “The west is not receiving us because theirs are Christian countries. They are secular countries…. In a couple of generations, the Syriacs in the European countries will have disappeared.”The west is not receiving us because theirs are Christian countries. They are secular countries…. In a couple of generations, the\u0026nbspSyriacs\u0026nbspin the European countries will have disappearedFather Saliba recalled how Isis\u0026nbsphad captured the northern Iraqi city of Mosul, burnt\u0026nbspits churches and libraries and established its “Islamic State”. “France said: ‘We will take the Christians in’, but we believe we should live here…. Now Isis\u0026nbsptries to destroy us so we will have no place in this country. We knew early on that this was an existential challenge to our presence in the Middle East.”\u0026nbspBut, I thought at the time, hasn’t the presence of Christians in the Arab world always be an “existential challenge”? I recalled how in Lebanon, I had once been taken on a scholarly tour of the tiny Maronite Christian parishes high above the Mediterranean, squat humps of churches in the hills north of Beirut, the sun white on their stones, sometimes built over Roman temples, much as Muslims would later construct their mosques within or around Christian churches. In many cases, the eyes of the saints and holy men of Christianity on the ancient church frescoes had been gouged out and local Maronite villagers told us that this was the work of the Muslim invaders of the eighth century.\u0026nbspBehnam and Mart Sarah Syriac Catholic Church, which was damaged and defaced during its occupation by Isis (AFPGetty)Untrue, said the experts. Many monasteries converted to Islam and the monks themselves cut the eyes from their own Biblical heroes in order to conform to the Muslim world’s refusal to countenance the portrayal of a human face in a place of worship. French academic Christian Decobert believed that when the Arabs arrived in Egypt, the Near East and in North Africa, all the countries were Christian. “Half of the Persians were Christian…. Under the Byzantines, there was a man of religion who had power and very frequently he was in charge of the collection of taxes,” Decobert said.When the Arabs began to settle in their newly conquered lands, they decided to create an administration. And of course – this is my own interpretation – they needed tax collectors. “Some monasteries disappeared,” Decobert said. “Some survived. Some converted to Islam – this was nothing to do with faith, it was about the cultural system. And the first people who converted to Islam were the monks. So the heads of the monasteries became key people in the Islamic system. There was no distinction between religious and economic life.”Kamal Salibi, one of the finest of Lebanon’s modern historians – a Protestant and an old friend, he died almost eight years ago – wrote a short but revealing book called A House of Many Mansions, which will still be read a 100 years from now for its historical revelation and its wisdom. He insisted that the Maronites did not come to Lebanon as a persecuted people from the Orontes valley, as they claimed, and that they had in fact begun their life as heretics. As the years passed, Salibi, a professor at the American University of Beirut, became even more sensitive to what he called the “Muslim predicament”\u0026nbspin the Middle East.And it is indeed strange that although they remain a profound minority in the region, the Christians of the Arab world should have become not just a sounding board for Islam, but a minority fine tuner on the instrument of coexistence between two great religions, more often than not in harmony but with a distressing habit of producing discord – to the delight of religious extremists and, alas, of politicians and journalists.Quetta\u0026nbsp(AFPGetty)Writing my new book on the Middle East, scheduled to be published next year, I intended to devote my chapter on religion to Muslims and Islam. But it was instructive for me to discover, as I worked on the chapter, that it was turning out to be, primarily, about Christians. Perhaps I can give readers a hint as to why this is the case by quoting directly from my text. Needless to say, blood and pain and betrayal crowd the many pages before and after the chapter on religion.Yet in modern times, Salibi asked, “what traditional civilisation could continue to stand on its feet once the west Europeans – partly as a result of their special genius, partly as a result of their geographical location, partly as a result of their guts and their luck – found a way of going around Africa, crossing the Atlantic and reaching the Americas, tapping wealth beyond the dreams of avarice all over the world…reducing the whole world to relative poverty and to increasing poverty. Well, from that moment on, the Muslim world and other legitimate civilisations…could no longer stand in the face of the west. And this is the situation which continues to the present day.”Aphrem II, at the heavily damaged church of St\u0026nbspMary in Syria’s eastern city of Deir Ezzor\u0026nbsp(AFPGetty)Over Salibi’s lecture to me, needless to say, there hung the canopy of a very dark history the 1860 mutual slaughter of Christians and Druze in Lebanon which the Ottomans were powerless – or unwilling – to control. Muslims descended on the Christians of Damascus in an even worse blood-letting – the “largest single massacre of Christians in the Arab world”, as one historian was to call it — which was suppressed with extreme brutality by the Ottoman Turks. We shall return to this later.\u0026nbspYou have the last Sultans, all of them being pianists and playing Mozart and trying to paint and reading western booksThis did not involve any intention of “converting”\u0026nbsp– in itself a word which has become a cliché and thus obsolescent – but out of what humanist scholar Tarif Khalidi would refer to as “a particular Muslim fascination with Jesus…” Khalidi – still gloriously alive – once spoke to me “of another age and another narrative when Christianity and Islam were more open to each other”, a period when the traditional images of Jesus in Islamic art were like “a love affair between Islam and Jesus”.Once described as “the foremost Islamic scholar of our time” by Edward Said, Khalidi – a Palestinian Muslim whose mother was a prominent Lebanese feminist — is the latest translator (into English) of the Quran. But he is also the author of a wonderful book of Muslim stories about Jesus, a body of literature which he calls the “Muslim gospel”. In Islam, of course, Jesus is greatly revered as a prophet, although his inity is rejected.Created with Sketch.Scars on Middle East landscape bear witness to past peace failures Show all 16Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A Syrian tank lies turned over in the Hermon Stream in the Banias Nature Reserve on the western edge of the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights.

The building is a scar in the landscape as it stands deserted following the 1967 Middle East war when Israel captured the area from the JordaniansThe battle for the soul of Islam between Sunnis and Shias – today, between the Sunni autocrats of the Gulf and the four-decade old Shia\u0026nbspIslamic Republic of Iran and its unfortunate allies – has been a sad and wearying feature of this great, wondrous, often misunderstood, misinterpreted and sometimes, for a Christian, deeply confusing faith. If the seventh century martyrdom of Hussein and Ali are a passion play of betrayal and blood whose pain may be framed at Kerbala and Kufa as well as the betrayed and bloodied man on the hill at Golgotha, then perhaps this calvary unites Christians and Shia\u0026nbsprather than Christians and Sunnis. Our attempt to understand the isions within Islam fascinated our Christian ancestors. The 17th century cleric George Abbot, later Archbishop of Canterbury, compared the differences between Sunni and Shia to those between “Papistes and Protestant”.Western ignorance was heightened by just the kind of Catholic-Protestant parallel which Archbishop Abbot drew. For the difference between the two sects is theological, not doctrinal. Sunnis stress the unity of the community, Shia\u0026nbspthe integrity of government. This is echoed in the Iranian-Saudi polemic today: “you are splitting the community’’ versus “you are an unjust government’’. Thus when Churchill created the Iraqi state with a Sunni king from Arabia but with a largely Shiite population, a real ‘line in the sand’ had been drawn long before George Bush senior used that phrase as he sent American troops into Iraq for the first time in 1990.Hamas and Israel in 2014 (AFPGetty)At a time when the world – or at least its media and pseudo-opinion makers – would have us believe that the Middle East is now breaking apart as a result of\u0026nbspinter-religious hatred and warfare, it will be all the more necessary to read the work of Ussama Makdisi — a brilliant professor of history at Rice University in the US and, interestingly, Edward Said’s nephew — when his extraordinary and deeply penetrating study of ecumenism and the modern Arab world is published this autumn.\u0026nbspLike all great histories, the very first words of his text give us his theme. “Every history of sectarianism,” he writes, “is also a history of coexistence.” Makdisi happily concentrates on the northern and eastern part of the Middle East (the ‘mashriq’ in Arabic) – Lebanon, Syria, the occupied Palestinian territories, Israel, Jordan, Egypt and Iraq — rather than all the territory of the former Ottoman empire. This avoids any analysis of the most egregious Middle Eastern but non-Arab sectarian massacre of modern times: the genocide of a million and a half Christian Armenians by Muslim Turks (and Muslim Kurds) in 1915 and the succeeding years, along with the aforesaid Syriac Christians.But the story of Arab coexistence, in the last years of the Ottoman empire and the century after its collapse, provides Makdisi with an opportunity to examine the Middle East’s common share in a global 19th-century revolution. This “revolution”, in Makdisi’s words – and it’s good to use the word in the non-violent sense – “introduced the profoundly important and historic principle of political equality among citizens, many of whom had been discriminated against or classified as inferior in centuries past…” These included Jews in Europe, blacks in the United States, and non-Muslims in the Ottoman Empire. In Ottoman domains, Makdisi suggests, this development occurred after 1860 when the Christians and Druze mercilessly assaulted each other in Lebanon and Syria.Shia\u0026nbspand Sunni Muslim clerics stand on the rubble of Hezbollah’s al-Manar TV station in Beirut.\u0026nbspHumanist education helped Lebanon recover\u0026nbspfrom its 15-year\u0026nbspwar (AFPGetty)He likes to talk about the “ecumenical frame”, the scaffolding upon which the reconciliation of modern political “solidarities” (political equality, etc) were reconciled, with the reality of religious and ethnic differences in the region – which included a new political order which embraced both the “secularity”\u0026nbspof citizens and (italics: and) the necessity of religiously segregated laws which governed (and still govern) marriage, orce and inheritance.\u0026nbspWhen I read the page proofs of Makdisi’s admirably short book, I was immediately reminded of the comic moment when the late President Elias Hrawi of Lebanon suggested that he would like to introduce civil marriage to his country of freedom and coexistence. Far from applauding this magnificent attempt to bring Lebanon into the modern world, normally argumentative bishops and priests and vicars and otherwise suspicious Sunni and Shia\u0026nbspimams and clerics immediately met in mutual conclaves hitherto unknown in the modern history of the Levant — to jointly denounce Hrawi’s isive, unpatriotic and irreligious suggestion.\u0026nbspIt not only encouraged what we might refer to as inter-faith marriage. Far more disastrously, it meant that the huge income obtained from church and mosque control of orce and problems of inheritance would disappear, and might – horror of horrors — be retained by Christian and Muslim families. My own non-academic journalist’s conviction is that “religious”\u0026nbspwars are not in fact created by ergent forms of faith but by property and money. Who holds the most land and the larger amount of treasure applies, I fear, rather too precisely to almost any “theological”\u0026nbspdispute – whether this takes place in lands of oil, overseas investments or the control of real estate (as in ‘a Protestant parliament for a Protestant people’).Makdisi notes with grim cynicism how the massacre of Christians in 1860 in Mount Lebanon and Damascus is dismissed in Arabic literature, even today, as the “haditha”, the “event”\u0026nbsp– the same word used by most Lebanese for their 1975-90 civil war. More perversely, as Makdidi says, this blood-letting is called “tawshat al-nasara” – the “hubbub of the Christians”. The tragedy of Makdisi’s narrative comes, inevitably, with the Balfour Declaration in favour of a Jewish “homeland”\u0026nbspin Palestine when – these are my words, not Makdidi’s – a sectarian state for Jews was introduced to the Middle East at the moment when Arabs were (hopefully) adhering to a new model of non-sectarian secular life.AFPGetty)“The loss of a multireligious Palestine was a terrible blow that was compounded by the end of Jewish life in most of the Arab world,” Makdisi writes. “The destruction of the idea that one could be simultaneously Arab and Jewish still scars the Arab world.” And – again, these are my words – if Israel’s supporters object to my own reference above to that nation’s “sectarian state” (since it contains hundreds of thousands of Arab Muslims and Christians), Netanyahu’s support of the new law which makes Israel “the nation state of the Jewish people” should silence them all.Talking of words, I have to say that Makdisi’s otherwise flawless thesis is occasionally crippled by his inability to shake off the fraudulent academic jargon which American universities now seem to inject into their scholars. Much of the text of Age of Coexistence\u0026nbspis mercifully free of this language. But I sighed repeatedly when I had to negotiate “historicisin” “empathetic”\u0026nbsp(for sympathetic), “valorised”, “secularity”, “consociational”\u0026nbsp”coevalness”, “situate” (for place), and our old enemies “posit”\u0026nbspand “space”. These words are the secret scripture of the clique, the little academic verbal and semantic ticks and contrivances designed to keep the elite of academia safe from proles like us. But Makdisi’s work is too important for these irritations to distract us. What he does is to remind us, repeatedly, of the critical declarations of secularism which existed in the history of the Middle East.The tragedy of\u0026nbspMakdisi’s\u0026nbspnarrative comes\u0026nbspwith the Balfour Declaration in favour of a Jewish “homeland” in Palestine when\u0026nbspa sectarian state for Jews was introduced to the Middle East at the moment when Arabs were (hopefully) adhering to a new model of non-sectarian secular lifeWhen the Sharif Hussain was negotiating with Colonel Henry McMahon over the future of the Ottoman Middle East – the all critical correspondence containing Britain’s most outrageous betrayal of the Arabs – he (Hussain) wrote of how “the Muslim is indistinguishable from the Christian, for they are both descendants of one forefather”, while McMahon challenged Hussain’s claim to Syria and what is now Lebanon on the grounds that they were not “purely Arab”. The Christians of the region, in other words, could not be “Arab”\u0026nbspin the eyes of the British.\u0026nbspHussain’s non-sectarian nationalism was all the more instrumental since it almost coincided with the 1919 constitution of Syria when Hussain’s son Faisal briefly ran his “Arab kingdom”, which guaranteed freedom of religious thought and religious practices for “all sects” and promised that each community (Christian, Muslim, Jewish) could administer its own personal status laws and local councils. In the same year, as Makdisi reminds us, the Egyptian Christian Coptic priest Qommus Sergius preached national unity from inside the great Al-Azhar in Cairo, the most venerable Muslim religious institution in Egypt, perhaps in the Arab world.Al-Nuri Mosque in the Old City of Mosul (AFPGetty)This “new”\u0026nbspkind of secular nationalism was bursting forth within the Arab world at the same time as Anatolia was being emptied of its Christian Armenians by the Muslim Turks. Christian Arabs were largely unaffected and untouched by this act of genocide. Turkish reforms, originally secular in character and at first welcomed by the Armenian themselves, turned into sectarian nationalism and, I suspect, were already taking on the aspect of fascism when Ataturk created the Turkish state. Ataturk’s passing was mourned by the Nazi paper Volkisher Beobachter with a black-fringed front page. This heritage, alas, continues in Turkey even today.Oman will find itself in troubled waters if it keeps playing two sidesWhat is Britain’s policy on Iran?Lies and buffoonery: Boris Johnson’s fantasy darkens the Middle EastHow Egypt’s army determines the destiny of the entire Middle EastFew Arabs in the Middle East today dispute the sectarianism which the French, British and later American empires re-injected into the Middle East. The French ripped Lebanon from Syria and set up minorities – especially the Alawites – to control Sunni Muslims in Syria. The British were intent on creating a Jewish “homeland”\u0026nbspin a part of the Ottoman empire which had hitherto been a homeland for Jews, Muslims and Christians. Oddly, Lebanon survived with more freedom than most of its Arab neighbours. The primary task of government, Makdisi points out, was “to harmonise relations between communities, not democratise relations between inidual secular citizens.” To Arab thinkers in Beirut and Damascus, including many Christians, ‘Arabism’ should be defined “not by ethnicity, blood or race…but by a common culture”.Jalalabad (AFPGetty)Certainly, Makdisi does not avoid the creation of the Arab dictatorships. “The tragedy of the military nationalists in Iraq, Syria, and Egypt,” he writes, “was that their commitment to revolution was far more energetically manifested in their construction of post-colonial security regimes than it was in building postcolonial democratic secular states.”In other words, while the military men destroyed modern Arab politics, Islamists threatened to destroy modern Arab culture. Mosques and churches could stand in this sparse environment. Political parties and trade unions were smashed. One of the great late 19th century Lebanese intellectuals, Boutros Boustani, a Christian translator of the Bible into Arabic, founded a school for Maronite Christian, Sunni and Shia Muslim children to educate pupils in a non-religious environment. In his self-financed newspaper, he preached that knowledge led to enlightenment which led, in turn, to “the death of fanaticism and the birth of ideals held in common…the fundamental cause of the trouble was the intolerance that is born of ignorance, and that the only way to peace among the sects lay across the untilled field of knowledge.”Or, as we would say today with Blairite repetition: education, education, education. Perhaps that is why Lebanon, the most educated population in the Arab world, recovered from its 15-year civil war in the late 20th century. Humanist education remains the watchword of Tarif Khalidi. It’s a lonely battle in a landscape of generals and autocrats who will use history but never acknowledge its lessons. That is why the Sharif Hussains and the King Faisals and the Salibis and the Boustanis and the Makdisis are so valuable.\u0026nbspThen I am reminded of a walk along a Manhattan pavement during the Iraqi civil war atrocities after the Anglo-American invasion. There on a news-stand was the latest copy of Time magazine, a journal I usually stay away from. But its front cover promised “how to tell the difference” between a Sunni and a Shia. Different ways of praying, different kinds of mosques. I bought it, of course. Heaven spare us all.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

PRESS ASSOCIATION Photo. Picture date: Saturday June 29, 2019Figures from the Gambling Commission estimate that 55,000 children in the UK could have a gambling problem.Fruit machines remain the most common way for children to first encounter gambling but bookmakers and online casinos have come under increasing pressure over the proliferation of adverts for betting, particularly in places where children are likely to see it such as during football matches and on social media.The available evidence indicates that exposure to gambling at a young age increases the risk that a person will become addicted in later life.Twitter has become an important platform for the both traditional and e-sports companies to advertise to potential customers. The study found that the five biggest operators -\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspLadbrokes, bet365, Coral, Betfred​ and Paddy Power - sent an average of 78 tweets per day.Much of this content is designed to be widely attractive, memetic and, most importantly, shareable, the study\u0027s authors wrote.\u0026nbspAs a result, it is very difficult to restrict, or even predict, the audience for a given piece of messaging.Despite the risks of children being exposed, just 0.1 per cent of social media gambling ads were found to contain a warning about the minimum age for placing a bet.The advertising\u0026nbspindustry\u0027s code of conduct states that\u0026nbsp“marketing communications must be obviously identifiable as such” but many of the social media adverts assessed did not do this.Close to three quarters of the gambling adverts appeared to break advertising industry regulation in some way, the researchers said.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

PRESS ASSOCIATION Photo. Picture date: Saturday June 29, 2019Dr Becker told The Independent: “That is, of course not an extremely big difference, but it comes from a data set with thousands of respondents. Hence, while children might not be the biggest driver of life satisfaction and happiness it has on average still a\u0026nbspsignificant influence.”They found that adults who have regular contact with their children are happier than parents who still live with their children or never had them.\u0026nbspDr Becker said: “We build on a lot of pre-existing literature and rather than finding some completely unique\u0026nbspnew result for children, we lend further evidence to the literature suggesting that children correlate with higher happiness under specific circumstances.”Researchers also found that marriage was “consistently positively correlated with wellbeing and lack of depressive symptoms”.The findings show social networks are also an important determinant for well-being and happiness – it is not just about being married or having children but\u0026nbsphaving people to share feelings and thoughts with too.“Taken together, our results suggest that social networks may be important for wellbeing and mental health in old age. Spouses, partners and children are often the basis of long-lasting social networks, which can provide social support to elderly people,” according to the study, published in Plos One.“While results on parenthood might be controversial and depend on the age of the studied population, there is widespread agreement that social support is associated with higher life satisfaction, and that social networks are an important factor for wellbeing.”\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

A practice run fell 20mph short of the record, but conditions improved on the day and a tailwind helped.Changing the aerodynamics of the car was a balance, as it decreased the 4x4’s top speed, but reduced wind resistance when the bike was released.Mr Campbell laughed: “Porsche spend millions testing their cars in a wind tunnel and we stick a big Tupperware box on the back of it!”He was so desperate to break the record that he ditched a parachute designed to help him brake quickly before the end of the airfield – because it was causing turbulence.\u0026nbspBut he did wear the latest kangaroo-skin protective suit, which inflates in the event of a crash.His next challenge will be to try to reach 220mph next year on a six-mile track at the Bonneville Salt Flats in Utah, USA.He said: “This has been a five-year programme and the record was the culmination of one part of it.“We have been bound by finances and budgeted to do what we can. Our plan is now to go to Bonneville and use a longer test track.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

has demanded ministers drop “cruel” plans to instantly end the free movement of people in the event of a no-deal Brexit.\u0026nbspIn a scathing letter to the home secretary – seen by The Independent – the London mayor said the proposals would be a “fundamental affront to British values of tolerance and respect”.\u0026nbspMr Khan’s comments come\u0026nbspas Downing Street said free movement for EU citizens “as it currently stands” will end on\u0026nbspthe 31 October Brexit deadline – despite a replacement system not yet up and running.No\u0026nbsp10 said the structure\u0026nbspallowing European Union citizens to freely live and work in the UK would “look different”, with changes including tougher checks to prevent foreign criminals entering the country.In his letter to Priti Patel on Monday, Mr Khan said he was “very concerned” about plans to end free movement on day one of a no-deal Brexit. “I urge you strongly to reconsider,” he said.The London mayor continued: “I fear that such a

fundamental affront to British values of tolerance and respect.“These plans risk providing encouragement and cover for perpetrators of hate crime and discrimination in the UK who may be heartened by

the UK, said in a statement: “The idea of ending freedom of movement abruptly on October 31 in case of no deal is reckless politics.“It hollows out the prime minister’s unequivocal guarantee to EU citizens he has given only three weeks ago. Ending freedom of movement without putting legal provisions in place for those EU citizens who have not yet successfully applied through the settlement scheme will mean that millions of lawful citizens will have their legal status removed overnight.“We have been calling for the settlement scheme to be a declaratory registration scheme, so all EU citizens who have made the UK their home are automatically granted status, as promised by those in government.”A Home Office spokesperson said: “EU citizens and their families still have until at least December 2020 to apply to the EU settlement scheme, and 1 million people have already been granted status.“Freedom of movement as it currently stands will end on 31 October when the UK leaves the EU, and after Brexit the government will introduce a new, fairer immigration system that prioritises skills and what people can contribute to the UK, rather than where they come from.”The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Although it was higher than a year ago, the 1.2 per cent annual rise still lagged behind inflation, which is running at 2.1 per cent, according to the latest official data.“There is little doubt that the market continues to face its inevitable challenges,” said Glynis Frew, chief executive of Hunters, an estate agency with over 200 branches across Britain.Official data showed last week that the average price at which homes are sold grew only 0.9 per cent in the year to June, while in London it tumbled by 2.7 per cent. The average British home cost £230,292 in June, down from a peak of £232,000 in August 2018.Buyers have been biding their time as it remains unclear whether the UK will leave the EU with or without a deal. In the latter case, house prices could plunge by almost 6 per cent in 2020 and another 3 per cent in 2021, according to forecasts by the government’s spending watchdog, the Office for Budget Responsibility.However, the more confident buyers are now abandoning the ‘wait and see’ approach and taking advantage of improved housing affordability as the Brexit deadline nears, Ms Frew said, commenting on Rightmove’s findings.For its latest report, Rightmove measured 130,435 asking prices, covering around 90 per cent of the UK market. The properties were put on sale by estate agents between 7 July to 10 August and advertised on rightmove.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It is still not clear why those strange parts of the sky would behave in such an outstanding way.But researchers have now claimed that those spots of energy could be the consequence of conformal cyclic cosmology, a theory that suggests that our universe existed in another form before ours.

That radiation could last from one version of the universe into the next, they claim.Strange flashes are coming from our nearest black hole, scientists sayThose places where the electromagnetic radiation was especially high\u0026nbsp– referred to as Hawking points – could therefore be left over from the previous universe.Those anomalous points would therefore be explained by what is known as CCC theory. Rather than being mysteriously glowing points, they would be the final evaporation of the supermassive black holes that were in the version of the universe that came before ours.Many scientists have objected to the idea of the cyclical universe, and Hawking radiation still remains to be confirmed.But the researchers say that they hope their analysis will at least help to give us a a significant initial indication of the nature of these anomalous regions and provides an important new input into cosmology, irrespective of the validity of CCC.And they conclude by suggesting that their findings will pose a significant problem for the conventional understanding of the universe, however they are formed.\u0026nbspIt is hard to see, however, that they find a natural explanation in the currently conventional inflationary picture, they write.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Hes a nice fella, its alright.But one heckler yelled: What a disgrace!Another shouted from the back: He is our leader, not the press, not Boris Johnson, or Jo Swanson!Another reporter was shouted at as he quizzed the Labour boss on whether he had enough cross-party support from MPs.And activists replied with: Shame on you!There seems to be an awful lot of whataboutery in the press at the current time, Mr Corbyn added in another hit at the media.An ITV reporter asked him why he felt people in his own party didnt want him to lead a government of national unity, but was then booed by hecklers.Mr Corbyn tried to intervene, saying: “No, Let Andy ask his question, please! I am defending your right to speak here.Another heckler muttered “Media lies.”The Labour boss is set to host Opposition MPs next week for a crunch stop No Deal summit, John McDonnell revealed today.The Labour boss also confirmed today that he wanted Boris Johnson to cancel the rest of MPs holiday and drag them back to Westminster to sort out Brexit.Thats despite the fact that more than MPs voted to go on holiday just a few weeks ago.Today No slapped down the chances of a recall and said it wasnt going to happen.James Cleverly MP, Conservative Party Chairman, said of Mr Corbyns speech today:  Jeremy Corbyn has everything he can to frustrate Britain leaving the EU on October st, and now he has confirmed he is willing to cancel the referendum result. Politicians don’t get to choose which public votes they respect.Corbyn would wreck the economy, he won’t keep our streets safe and his only answer to Brexit is more delay causing more confusion – showing he’s more interested in playing cynical party political games than respecting the referendum result.Only Boris Johnson and the Conservatives are committed to delivering Brexit by October st, whatever happens, so that we can deliver the change that our country needs and the people voted for.He’s spent his le appealing to the same tiny band, and until the past few years has never been trusted with the slightest genuine responsibility.He’s been able to spout off about everything from the IRA to the Middle East without ever having to actually act on his wrong-headed convictions.And, with Corbyn now Leader of the Opposition, his mindless and dangerous cult brook no dissent. Labour MPs who disagree with him are Tories in disguise.The media daring to ask him questions are “a disgrace”, as one of his barmy army put it yesterday. Voting Conservative makes you just plain evil.The contrast between Magic Grandpa and Boris couldn’t be clearer. While the latter can deliver a good gag, his record also bears the most serious scrutiny. Two terms as Mayor of London. A former Foreign Secretary.The only person around Corbyn with the slightest experience of actual power is his Shadow Chancellor. That’s John McDonnell, who was fired as London’s finance chief by Ken Livingstone for being too left wing, which is some feat…So when Corbyn claims to be a more serious, trustworthy figure than the current Prime Minister Give over, Jezza."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/NINTCHDBPICT0005145960","title":"inside lord mountbatten marriage","story":"But behind closed doors, their -year marriage was far from perfect – with Lord Mountbatten once admitting: “Edwina and I spent all our married lives getting into other people’s beds.”A stunning but highly-strung socialite, Edwina - who was named the sixth best dressed woman in the world at the time - had at least  lovers including Indian Prime Minister Nehru and singer Leslie Hutch Hutchinson, who she once gted a jewel-encrusted penis sheath.She was said to be sexually obsessed, once being thrusted across a banquet table during a romp with one lover.Lord Mountbatten - who Prince Louis is widely-believed to be named after  - was ‘devastated’ by her infidelity in the early days of their marriage.But realising he had little choice in the matter, he began taking lovers of his own, too.Yesterday, FBI documents from the s revealed shocking claims that Mountbatten - who was murdered by an IRA bomb  years ago this month -  was secretly “a homosexual with a perversion for young boys.”In the documents, the couple are described as “persons of extremely low morals” and many have suggested both were bisexual - a huge taboo at the time.Here, we delve into their controversial marriage.The great-grandson of Queen Victoria, Mountbatten – the uncle of Prince Philip – was born in  at Frogmore House, Windsor as Prince Louis of Battenberg, a title he lost when he and other royals dropped Germanic names during World War I.By the time he met -year-old Edwina Ashley, in , she was a leading light in London society with an inheritance of £millionfrom her grandfather, financier Ernest Cassel, to fund her party lestyle.Their wedding, at St Margaret’s chapel, Westminster, attracted a crowd of , and was attended by many members of the royal family including Queen Mary, Queen Alexandra and the then Prince of Wales – the future Edward VIII.Both were virgins when they wed but Edwina soon revealed her love of sex when she asked to go to Paris on their honeymoon so they could explore “the most awful places we could find”.Louis found sex less appealing, calling it a mixture of psychology and hydraulics.He was so awkward in bed he was said to have named her breasts Mutt and Jeff - naval slang for medals.Louis - affectionately known by his family as Dickie - was often away with the navy and cracks began to show in their marriage after the birth of their first daughter, Patricia, in .Edwina was so jealous of the attention the baby got that she packed her off to a nanny the South Coast and embarked on a series of affairs.She soon surrounded herself with a harem of lovers she referred to as “ginks” – including Lord Molyneux, a rich American polo player called Laddie Sandford and newspaper editor Mike Wardell.Daughter Pamela Hicks later revealed that several admirers were often in tow at the same time, and even had to be kept apart at the family home, Broom House in Park Lane.“When my mother ed from shopping one day she was met with, Mr Larry Gray is in the drawing room, Mr Sandford is in the library, Mr Ted Phillips is in the boudoir, Señor Portago [is] in the anteroom and I don’t know what to do with Mr Molyneux’,” she wrote.Divorce, especially within the Royal family, was frowned upon and Pamela said the fallout was “messy and complex.”“When my father first heard that she had taken a lover, he was devastated,” she said. “But eventually, using their reserves of deep mutual affection, my parents managed to negotiate a way through this crisis and found a modus vivendi .”The pair agreed to a ‘discreet’ open marriage and Pamela said that her father’s “total desire for my mother’s happiness” was what made the marriage work.When her husband was posted to Malta, in the early s, Edwina enjoyed a fling with American golfer Bobby Sweeney.For his part, in , Dickie began to flirt with -year-old Margaret Whigham, the future Duchess Of Argyll – who became notorious for her own sex scandal in , when she was photographed performing a sex act on an unknown man.He finally entered into a long term affair with Yola Letellier, the boyish Frenchwoman who inspired Colettes  novella, Gigi.But the biggest scandal of the couple’s marriage was about to break.Its reported that pair were the “talk of the West End” and the scandal had “shaken society to its very depth”, causing the woman to be “exiled” by royal command.The woman was soon identied as Edwina – who had recently joined her husband in Malta – and the man was wrongly thought to be singer and activist Paul Robeson.After a court case held in secret, the paper finally apologised and offered “genuine and deep regrets”.But many believe Edwina’s real lover was the suave and famously well-endowed West Indian cabaret singer and pianist, Leslie ‘Hutch’ Hutchinson, who was becoming notorious for bedding society women.The bisexual entertainer - who had lost his childhood innocence when his father took him to a brothel at the age of  - had arrived in London in the s after being discovered by Cole Porter.“Edwina interrupted Hutch playing the piano,” he says. “She kissed his neck and led him by the hand behind the closed doors of the dining-room. There was a shriek, and a few minutes later she ed, straightening her clothes.“Hutch seemed elated, and before he ed to the piano, told me that, with one thrust, he had flashed [propelled] her theof the dining-room table.”Lady Mountbatten was said to be so besotted that she showered him with gts, including a jewelled gold cigarette case, a gold ring engraved with her coat of arms, a gold and diamond watch and – outrageously – a Cartier, jewel-encrusted penis sheath.One disputed story surrounding the pair was that they were once locked in a sexual position when Edwina suffered from vaginismus - a condition that makes the vagina clamp around a penis - and the couple had to be separated at hospital.One night, an inebriated Mountbatten fell into Quaglino’s restaurant and told the bandleader, Van Straten:  “I am lonely and sad and drunk... Hutch has a p**** like a tree-trunk, and he’s f****** my we right now.”Although he was cast out of royal circles over the scandal, Hutch would go on to put another two royal notches on his bedpost, enjoying a fling with Princess Marina and, allegedly, with Princess Margaret in , when she was  and he was .Bizarrely, on Hutchs death in , Mountbatten rang the funeral directors offering to pay for his headstone and grave in Highgate Cemetery.After the court case Edwina moved on to Colonel Harold ‘Bunny Phillips’ of the Coldstream Guard who she met on a cruise - after allegedly bedding his older brother Ted.He was ft in and “thrillingly handsome” according to Pamela, who was nine when they met.“He would stay with us for long periods of time and, to us children, he was part of everyday le.”In , Lord Mountbatten was appointed Viceroy of India and charged with overseeing the country’s transition to India and the couple moved to Delhi.There, Edwina was to find her most enduring love affair - with Indian Prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru who, at , was ten years her senior.Pamela later said her father condoned the relationship, called them a “happy threesome.”As Mountbatten himself wrote to his daughter Patricia, “She and Jawaharlalare so sweet together, they really dote on each other.”Some believe the couple also indulged in threesomes, as Dickie tried to rekindle the spark with Edwina.When the Mountbattens left India, in , Edwina wouldto visit yearly and Nehru would make an annual trip to London whenever she was there.In between, they wrote long love letters to each other.As Edwina became increasingly close to Nehru, new rumours were beginning to circulate about Lord Mountbatten.The FBI had interviewed several people who claimed the naval commander was bisexual, with one claiming he had a fetish for “young boys”.The first FBI files date back to February , soon after Mountbatten had become supreme allied commander of southeast Asia.It reads: Lord Louis Mountbatten and his we are considered persons of extremely low morals.It also said there were claims that Lord Louis Mountbatten was known to be a homosexual with a perversion for young boys.Homosexual acts were banned in the UK until , and many memos about Mountbattens sexuality have been edited or destroyed since.But in the new book – The Mountbattens: Their Lives and Loves - Anthony Daly, a rent boy to the rich and famous during the s, claims Dickie’s friend Tom Driberg, told him, that “Mountbatten had something of a fetish for unorms — handsome young men in military unormsand beautul boys in school unorm.”Ron Perks, Mountbatten’s driver in Malta in , also told author Lownie he often took him to the Red House near Rabat, which “was an upmarket gay brothel used by senior naval officers”.Edwina died in , at the age of , from unknown causes - with a pile of Nehrus letters by her bed - and Pamela said Dickie remained loyal to the end.“To her dying day, he was always worrying that Mummy would orce him,” she wrote. “But although she said she had no time for royalty and that she was a true socialist, Mummy would never have left him.“Try keeping her away from a party at Buckingham Palace.”Lord Mountbatten was assassinated in an IRA bomb attack in  in Ireland , that also killed his his -year-old grandson Nicholas, Patricia’s mother-in-law Lady Bradbourne and a -year-old crew member, Paul Maxwell.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Even these ones,they were going through the long grass you wouldnt see them.If she doesnt want to be seen, you arent going to see her.Its so nice to discover something new in nature.So much of the time you hear about species being extinct, and here we are with something new. Its incredible.Alan started a research programme at his ,ha reserve around ten years ago, studying how mostly black leopards survive outside of protected areas.The area is perfect for wildle because the mountainous terrain puts off poachers and animal farmers, while the surrounding citrus groves provide perfect safe corridors.Four years ago Alan caught Goldie - then a cub - on camera with her mum Pippa, but kept quiet, fearing she might not survive into adolescence.He said locals started talking about an oddly coloured lioness in the area - not home to any lions - and Alan wonderedit might be the now-adult strawberry leopard.Returning home during a thunder storm in late July, he came across a dead pregnant giraffe, suspected to have died from a heart attack.After checking there was nothing they could do, they cut her open to encourage predators who would usually be too small to feast on giraffes.They set up a motion camera, nailed to a tree, and ed to collest the memory card a month later.Strawberry leopards are caused by a rare gene mutation called erythrism.The little-understood genetic condition causes an overproduction of red pigments or an underproduction of dark pigments.This results in their distinctive orangey-pink tinge.The first strawberry leopard was spotted in the wild and photographed in  in South Africas Madikwe Game Reserve – more than km from the recent sighting.Alan said: We thought we might get too photos of blades of grass.But I was in the bar and this very shocked, pale, researcher who was going through the photos came and said you need to look at this.There she was, this golden leopard feeding from am to am. It was pretty cool.In one, she has turned around and snarled at the camera. You can see her nose wrinkled up. Its quite amazing.And its just so clear."},{"url":null,"title":"lions extinction wild experts medicine bone trade","story":"The demand for traditional medicine is said to be fuelling the sick practice where lions are bred and killed for their bones.Animal welfare experts have called for a ban on the fast-expanding industry, which they say is trading lions into extinction.Head of policy at the Born Free Foundation, Mark Jones, told : Lions are not designed to be raised in captivity.This is all about cash before conservation in what is a really cruel and cynical industry.The latest comments come after a year-long investigation into the callous industry headed by former Tory peer Lord Ashcroft.His probe discovered some of the lions are even being targeted inside fenced enclosures by wealthy trophy hunters.The canned hunting industry is so despicable that even other hunting organisations want to distance themselves from it.Among the shooters are Brits who are paying thousands for the privilege to kill the maginicent beasts, reports the Mail on Sunday.Those that arent shot by the heartless hunters are butchered in slaughterhouses for their  bones - used to treat ailments like rheumatism.Besides the bones, other body parts are in great demand as the animal represents strength and bravery, which are believed to be transferred to the patient.The Global Nature Fund estimates more than , lions are killed annually for the burgeoning bone trade, including many in South Africa.Dr Jones added: The international trade in lion bones is a relatively new thing but has grown enormously over the last decade.Initially, it was a by-product of canned hunting but more recently it is now an end product in itself.People are breeding them for commercial purposes and the South African government is actively encouraging this.There have been horric reports of lions being kept in appalling conditions. They are starved and emaciated.If your aim is to extract a skeleton, then these farms do not have to worry about the conditions of the lions while they are alive.The cubs born in the more ruthless farms are taken away from their mothers at just a few days old to be hand reared.As the lions become too dangerous to be allowed near tourists some are supplied to South Africa’s burgeoning ‘trophy hunting’ industry."},{"url":null,"title":"this futuristic round house on sale for 950k is hiding an amazing 1930s art deco interior","story":"The waterfront home in Essexs Frinton-On-Sea may look modern from the outside but it has an incredible s art deco interior - including the original mosaic tiles.The three-bed Essex home was part of British architect Oliver Hills grand vision to create London’s ‘Long Island’ in the s.Fine  Country estate agents who listed the property said: “The beautully presented Grade II listed modern movement home was designed by renowned British architect Oliver Hill in the early s, with the concept to construct a modernist estate, incorporating, opulent, al living, for the middle classes looking for grandiose homes by the sea, within close proximity of London.”Oliver Hill planned to build a massive estate of modernist homes for the middle classes around Essex’s Frinton-On-Sea.Although his dream did not come true the house on sale was built to be the show home.The Estate Agents added: “Originally there were plans to build around , new homes, with a modern element, namely Frinton Park estate.“Sadly, this did not come to fruition and there are approximately  inidually styled homes in Frinton-On-Sea.“The map of which is proudly placed in mosaic tiles within the front reception room of The Round House, which was constructed to be the show home of this wonderful venture.“The Round House has been sympathetically restored to a very high standard and offers luxurious living with fabulous undisturbed views over Frinton On Sea waterfront.”The current owner who restored the property said: “Having spent many happy, family holidays in Frinton, I had always been fascinated by the futuristic, modern movement style of The Round House“When the property came to market, its fair to say that it was in a dilapidated state, but I was ready for the challenge.The stylish outside space is perfect for entertaining and is reminiscent of s South Beach Miami with a hot tub, wood burner and potential for outside cooking.“The sub-tropical mature garden is illuminated at dusk, thus making it ideal for alfresco dining.“The views from the house are superb, both by day and by night and it is still a pleasure to look towards Harwich at sunset and enjoy waking up to the sunrise over the sea.The Round House is very much a party house, perfect for indoor outdoor entertainment, and its generally a very sociable space.“The front veranda is the perfect setting to enjoy a glass of wine on a summers evening and roof ladders offer the opportunity for sunbathing and quiet moments of reflection.I have loved living in a Grade II listed modern movement house and have enjoyed the benefit of the original features, including the fashionable Crittell windows.“Its just a short stroll down the slope to the beach where I have had fun kite surfing, paddle boarding and kayaking.

You will be beheaded.John Letts says he begged his son to come home, telling him: A father should never live to see his son buried.He went on to accuse him of being a pawn ... helping spread hatred, pain, anger, suffering and violence.Letts was entitled to citizenship through his Canadian father John but was born in the UK and grew up in rural Oxfordshire with HIS organic farmer dad and British mum Sally.Sources said the Canadian government had “gone berserk” at Britain ripping up Letts passport.Office of Public Safety minister Ralph Goodale said: “Terrorism knows no borders, so countries need to keep each other safe.“Canada is disappointed the United Kingdom has taken this action to offload their responsibilities.”It is thought the decision to revoke his citizenship was one of the last actions of Theresa May’s administration."},{"url":null,"title":"jeffrey epstein prince andrew shady pals","story":"The Queen’s silliest son has been friends with Jeffrey Epstein for many years.Andrew even invited the convicted paedophile to Sandringham House, her private home in Norfolk.Grotesque Epstein was convicted of securing a child for prostitution in  and served  months in prison.Last month Epstein was charged again, for sex trafficking of minors, and on August  he killed himself in prison.But Andrew is loyal to his awful friends.He met Epstein even AFTER his  conviction. They were photographed walking in New York’s Central Park after Epstein’s conviction for securing a child for prostitution.Andrew apparently had to reassure the Queen personally he did not have relations with underage girls, though he was photographed with his arm round one of Epstein’s accusers. What a conversation that must have been.“Air-miles Andy” has long been an embarrassment to the Royal Family and the country, the best possible argument for getting rid of the monarchy.He likes to travel by helicopter to events he could just as easily reach by car.He once took a £, helicopter trip from Windsor to West Sussex, which is less than an hour and a half by car. But his profligacy is just the start.His role as a “special trade representative” from  to  cost the public £million including travel and police protection. One trip to America by private jet cost £,.And he wasn’t very good at it. Wikileaks revealed the US ambassador to Kyrgyzstan wrote of Andrew’s diplomacy: “Rude language a la British . . .  turned to the general issue of promoting British economic interests abroad.He railed at British anti-corruption investigators who had the ‘idiocy’ of almost scuttling the al-Yamamahdeal with Saudi Arabia.”Former minister Chris Bryant said of Andrew: “When I was at the Foreign Office, it was very dficult to see in whose interests he was acting.“He doesn’t exactly add lustre to the Royal diadem.”He lives in luxury with his similarly profligate and foolish ex-we Sarah at Royal Lodge in Windsor Great Park, which was renovated at a cost of £million when he moved in.His family are supported by the Queen’s income from the privy purse and the Duchy of Lancaster. In exchange, he performed  royal engagements in .He tried to get his daughters Beatrice and Eugenie full-time royal status — with the money too — but his brother Charles said no.He is attracted to shady dictators and the worst detritus of the international rich.Several times he met the son of former Libyan tyrant Colonel Gaddafi, Sa al-Islam — wanted by the International Criminal Court for crimes against humanity.Andrew had to step down from his envoy role in  over his friendship with Ilham Aliyev, the president of Azerbaijan who has been criticised by Amnesty International.Again, Andrew loyally continued to visit his pal.He was also close to Goga Ashkenazi, a Kazahk socialite. So much so, Goga’s ex Timur Kulibayev — who controls much of Kazakhstan’s oil and is now married to the former Kazakh president’s daughter — paid £million for Sunninghill Park , the house Andrew shared with ex-we Sarah Ferguson.That was £million over the asking price.I have visited Sunninghill. It was ugly and peeling. Buying it was the act of a person buying access to the Royal Family.But Andrew doesn’t think about such things. He took Goga racing at Ascot and introduced her to the Queen.He is profligate, entitled and foolish. He has lived too long in a fetid world of the shady super-rich.What did he think would happen  He has the entitlement of a Royal but none of the responsibility.With vile Epstein now dead, Andrew issued a statement: “His Royal Highness deplores the exploitation of any human being and the suggestion he would condone, participate in or encourage any such behaviour is abhorrent.”This is an awful piece of PR guff, which implies that HE is the victim. How dare people think such things about him It is not good enough when the issue is child trafficking.Andrew must say what he knew and did not know. People will believe he is stupid. That is a defence of sorts. He must apologise for his poor judgement then go somewhere very quiet.I am not a monarchist. But being Duke of York and a Knight of the Order of the Garter should mean something.If Andrew were heir to the throne, the monarchy would fall over this.

Central to this is the ongoing downturn in industry.”Exports “were down substantially”, the bank noted, as pre-Brexit preparations ahead of the UK’s initial exit date at the end of March  led to companies building up stocks in the first quarter.Bundesbank added: As things currently stand, it is unclear whether exports and, by extension, industry will regain their footing before the domestic economy becomes more severely affected.”Although economists have not yet predicting a Europe-wide recession, they have voiced fears that the European Union will not thrive while its power economy is struggling.Germany accounts for more than a quarter of the EUs output, with its  million people.Many of the blocs countries count Germany as their number one trading partner.This includes France, the Netherlands, Belgium, Slovakia, Sweden and Italy.Katharina Utermöhl, senior economist at the German insurer Allianz, told the New York Times: If the largest member state is affected, this will also start to weigh on the euro area as a whole because of the close economic relations.”She added that, should Europe suffer more blows such as a no-deal Brexit, the risk of a recession is rather high.It comes ahead of Boris Johnsons crunch talks with Angela Merkel and Emmanuel Macron in Paris this week.The PM believes Emmanuel Macron and Angela Merkel will cave and broker a new Brexit deal.This is despite Brussels chiefs saying repeatedly they will not reopen talks over a fresh deal.Speaking during a visit to a hospital in Cornwall yesterday, Boris told Sky News: We will be ready to come out on Oct.  - deal or no deal.“Of course, our friends and partners on the other side of the Channel are showing a little bit of reluctance to change their position - thats fine - I am confident that they will.I hope that they will compromise - they have seen that the UK parliament has three times rejected the Withdrawal Agreement, the backstop just doesnt work, it is not democratic. I hope they will see fit to compromise.The PM has stated that we will be leaving the bloc “do or die” by the Halloween deadline and has won the backing of Brexiteers for his tough stance against Brussels – refusing to meet any EU leaders in person until now.However, Boris has also said that brokering a trade deal with the EU is a top priority.He said: “I want a deal, we are ready to work with our friends and partners to get a deal butyou want a good deal for the UK you must simultaneously get ready to come out without one.”"},{"url":null,"title":"edinburgh festival best joke tourettes charity complains","story":"The Dave Award went to Swedish comedian Olaf Falafel for his joke: “Have you heard about the man who kept shouting broccoli and caullower  He thought he might have florets.”But Suzanne Dobson, chief executive of the UK Tourette’s Action charity, was not laughing and called the joke “rubbish”, claiming it had brought “shame” on TV channel Dave.She said: “Not only is it not funny to poke fun at people with Tourette’s, it’s not even that funny a joke, is it ”Ms Dobson said: “I would ask them to walk in the shoes of somebody with Tourette’s for a day, and then tell methey find it quite so amusing.”She also said the charity had several calls from parents, who said their children with Tourette’s syndrome had been angered and upset by the joke.The charity had been about to launch a campaign to stop Tourette’s being used as a punchline, which Ms Dobson said was “unfortunately about a week too late”.Kate Stone, one of the lists who shortlisted Falafel’s joke for the award, said: “It’s a good one, it’s a pun, everyone kind of recognises it as it’s intended to be a joke and I think that’s one of the things that matters the most for this.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Not for a moment did they envisage having to act on it.The letter was — like almost everything Mr Corbyn has ever said or done — about posturing rather than acting. The Labour leader spent  years as a backbencher before his elevation to being Leader of the Opposition.During those three decades he achieved precisely nothing.Had he not been elected leader, the few people to have been aware of his existence would have known him as a minor fringe MP who hung out with terrorists and racists.The sum total of his contribution to politics as a backbencher was to have proposed  Early Day Motions, the parliamentary equivalent of tweeting.Topics which he considered worth his time included “seal genitalia”, “Disney children’s pyjamas” and an MI proposal to use pigeons as flying bombs.Mr Corbyn’s natural disposition is to tear down, to criticise and to oppose.He could not even bring himself to support his own party when it was in power, voting against the last Labour government  times.There is not a single piece of legislation that owes anything to his contribution.This is the context in which his and Labour’s seemingly incoherent stance on Brexit — one day against another referendum, another day for one one day for Brexit, another day for Remain — must be seen.He is uninterested in the mechanics of a concrete solution. He has no real views on the details of Brexit or even how we get there.For Mr Corbyn, Brexit is a means to an end — which is as a vehicle to power.That is why, for example, he has on  occasions instructed Labour MPs either to abstain or to vote with the Government on Brexit, rather than attempting in any serious way to force the Government to change course, either over the type or Brexit on offer or a second referendum.He wants Brexit.He and his coterie of revolutionary socialists believe that leaving without a deal will be chaotic and that in that chaos Labour will be swept into office.But that, by definition, requires Brexit both to happen and to be chaotic.Most of his party take a dferent view — most are Remainers — so every so often the Corbynites view it as tactically wise to offer the appearance of wanting to work against the Government’s version of Brexit.Hence yesterday’s letter. But it is all meaningless posing. In her speech yesterday rejecting Mr Corbyn’s demand that she support him as PM, Jo Swinson hit the nail on the head.She said: “In my first week as leader of the Liberal Democrats I called on Jeremy Corbyn to table a vote of no confidence in the Government and I asked him to table it before summer recess, because that was the only way to be sure we could hold an election before crashing out on the st of October.”You do not have to share Ms Swinson’s opposition to Brexit to accept that her analysis is spot on.Mr Corbyn refused to table such a vote of no confidence at the end of July. Had he actually wanted to avoid No Deal, he would have done.There was every chance Boris Johnson’s new government would have lost and we would now be in the middle of an election campaign.Whatever the outcome of that election, we would not — as we are now — be spending time analysing the prospects of a so-called government of national unity or looking at cynical letters written by the Labour leader.Mr Corbyn and his allies doubtless think they are being extremely clever, riding two horses at the same time.But his problem is that every time he opens his mouth, the unsuitability for office becomes ever clearer. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It shows a transformation in the approach, that Boris Johnson is willing to leave on a fixed date with no question of extension.“It’s the do-or-die pledge in black and white. It’s not merely symbolic.

in a hint they wouldnt back him to be PMit came down to it.The letter was the most positive reaction to Mr Corbyns call, which was rejected by all sides of the political spectrum.But Tories reacted with fury at the idea that their own side was talking to the Opposition at all.Iain Duncan Smith told The Sun: It’s contemptible than anyone would talk to an anti Semitic Marxist about possibly forming a government.And he wrote in thetoday that trying to stop Brexit would be the true betrayal.The thought that anyone would listen to this man, who stood on a manesto in  to deliver on the vote to leave the EU while opposed to a second referendum, but who now declares he is in favour of a second referendum, is ludicrous, he wrote.The message to those like Mr Hammond who want to block Brexit and to those who would do deals with Mr Corbyn to block Brexit is this: leaving with no deal isn’t a betrayal of the British people, but trying to stop it is.Mr Corbyns plot to take power as a caretaker PM to delay Brexit again and call a fresh election has been slapped down by most of the opposition MPs - who said they will refuse to work with him.The Liberal Democrats, Greens, SNP and Plaid all agreed they wanted to work together to stop a No Deal Brexit, but poured cold water on his demands to be installed in NoBoris Johnson is brought down.New Lib Dem boss Jo Swinson said this morning that he doesnt command support right across the House of Commons, and he has not been much use, frankly, on the issue of Brexit."},{"url":null,"title":"michael gove says no deal brexit dossier is worst case scenario and leaked by disgruntled former minister","story":"Published by The Sunday Times, the documents warn Britain will be hit with a three-month meltdown at its ports, a hard Irish border and shortages of food and medicine -

this is the most realistic assessment of what the public face with no deal.These are likely, basic, reasonable scenarios - not the worst case.However, when asked about the dossier - codenamed Operation Yellowhammer - Minister Kwasi Kwarteng told Skys Sophy Ridge on Sunday: I think there is a lot of scaremongering around and a lot of people are playing into Project Fear and all the rest of it.Weve got to prepare for No Deal.In fact the previous prime minister created DExEU and she said that the mandate of DExEU last year, last summer, was to prepare for no-deal...Now weve got a new Prime Minister who is very much focused on that and the scale and intensity of those preparations are increasing and we will be fully prepared to leave without a deal on October .According to reports, the leaked documents surfaced before Boris Johnson - who has made his enthusiasm for a No Deal Brexit clear - actually became Prime Minister.The dossier reveals:Meanwhile Downing Street has reportedly blamed Philip Hammonds camp for leaking the secret documents.The blame comes just days after the Prime Minister unleashed a scathing attack on remainer Philip Hammond.In a letter the Prime Minister slammed the former chancellor for damaging the national interest in his attempts to stop No Deal.Jonson also warned remainers that foul play could could push the nation even closer to a No Deal Brexit as member states would refuse to negotiatethey felt Britain’s withdrawal could be stopped.And Michael Gove, the Cabinet minister responsible for no-deal planning, also tried to play down fears today.He claimed the cross-government paper for a no deal Brexit was a worst case scenario.The Brexiteer tweeted: We dont normally comment on leaks - but a few facts - Yellowhammer is a worst case scenario - v signicant steps have been taken in the last  weeks to accelerate Brexit planning - and Black Swan is not an HMG doc but a film about a ballet dancer...Speaking to reporters today he added: It is the case, as everyone knows, thatwe do have a no-deal exit there will inevitably be some disruption, some bumps in the road. Thats why we want a deal.But it is also the case that the UK government is far more prepared now than it was in the past.But a former head of the British civil service, Lord Bob Kerslake, who described the document as credible, said the dossier lays bare the scale of the risks we are facing with no-deal Brexit in almost every area.He added: These risks are completely insane for this country to be taking and we have to explore every avenue to avoid them.Irish deputy prime minister Simon Coveney said, in a tweet, that Ireland had always been clear a hard border in Ireland must be avoided.The leak comes as Boris Johnson prepares to travel to Berlin to meet German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Wednesday, before going to Paris to meet French President Emmanuel Macron the following day.Mr Johnson has repeatedly vowed to leave the bloc on Halloween with or without a deal - and pointed the finger at the anti-democratic EU for pushing the UK towards a No Deal by refusing to negotiate.After more than three years of Brexit dominating EU affairs, the bloc has repeatedly refused to reopen the Withdrawal Agreement which includes an Irish border insurance policy that Johnsons predecessor, Theresa May, agreed in November.Mr Johnson will tell Mrs Merkel and Mr Macron there must be a new Brexit deal when he makes his first trip abroad as PM.Details of the PMs travel plans emerged as Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn reiterated his call for MPs to work together to prevent a no-deal Brexit.Mr Corbyn, who set out his plan to be installed as a caretaker prime minister last week to stop the UK crashing out of the EU without a deal, said his proposal is the most democratic way to prevent a no-deal."},{"url":null,"title":"brits would rather have a no deal brexit than let jeremy corbyn wreak havoc in no10 poll reveals","story":"Nearly half of voters want to leave the bloc without a withdrawal agreementit means the Labour boss stays away from Downing Street.Meanwhile  per cent of voters were unsure either way, a YouGov poll found.The vote also found that almost a quarter of Remain voters would prefer No Dealit meant no Corbyn in No, while  per cent of Labour voters say the same about their own leader.While  per cent of Leave voters would rather a No Deal Brexitit meant no Corbyn -

Primates including marmosets, capuchins, squirrel monkeys and lemurs would no longer be allowed to be kept or traded in the UK. An estimated , primates are being kept as pets in Britain. Experts believe some are owned as designer pets and must-have accessories.Labour believes only a total ban will end animal cruelty – with the move included in the party’s “Animal Welfare Manesto” which will be published later this month.Under its plan, monkeys and other primates currently kept as pets would be allowed to stay with their owners as long as the keepers were registered and agreed to subject themselves to regular inspections.  The clause avoids potentially damaging headlines by ruling out the need for a monkey amnesty or forced euthanasia of primates already kept as pets. Shadow Environment Minister Luke Pollard said: “It is astonishing that it is still entirely legal to keep primates as pets, regardless of how endangered or dangerous the animal is. “Anyone can browse the internet and buy a primate with little or no checks and inspections. “We know that primates are very intelligent, social animals with complex needs that simply cannot be met in a home environment.  “Labour will ban people from keeping pet primates as part of our plans to bring Britain’s animal welfare laws into the st Century.” An RSPCA spokeswoman said: “We don’t believe that primates should be kept as pets because their needs simply cannot be met in a domestic environment. “They are intelligent, sentient and highly social animals with complex needs. “Just like humans, primates can become depressed without adequate stimulation.  “They need a spacious and enriched environment that challenges their intelligent brains and allows for them to behave like primates should, yet we find them kept alone in indoor bird cages in living rooms. “The RSPCA regularly sees primates that have been kept as pets with behaviour problems and very poor health, especially metabolic bone disease , as a result of totally inappropriate care.” In , Greater Manchester was dubbed Britain’s monkey capital after the charity said more monkeys were kept in the area than anywhere . The RSPCA received more calls about primates in distress in Greater Manchester than any other part of Britain, with reports animals were being kept as pets in yards, garages and houses.

Ms Graves told : “I still can’t believe what happened to me on that slide.    I was meant to be having a lovely holiday with my family but the whole experience has been traumatising. “As I hit the water, I was in a lot of pain and I lost so much blood that I had to get a transfusion.

Ms Graves said a staff member looked after her as she lost a signicant amount of blood, but she became faint and breathless. After being taken to Le Hospital in Burgas by ambulance, she was stitched up, given a blood transfusion and underwent surgery to repair a severed artery, she said. She claims she suffered profound arterial bleeding leading to haemorrhagic shock and secondary anaemia. Her treatment in Bulgaria was covered by her travel insurance.  Ms Graves said she was forced off work for about five weeks while recovering from her injuries back home in the UK. A week-long stay at the resort can cost more than £, per person in peak season. The Brit has hired the law firm of Irwin Mitchell to investigate the incident. She said: I really hope that the investigations can get to the bottom of it as I don’t want anyone  to have to go through what I have.    “I wish I had never set foot in that water park.” Ms Graves has called for more awareness on the potential dangers of water slides.

They followed him to his house but heard another child crying inside, and soon alerted the police. Cops arrived at the scene shortly after and witnessed the disastrous living conditions the children had been made to endure.

The boy was said to be crying and in a distressed state saying he could not get back into his house - when asked how long he had been out, the child replied all day.  Miss Cutter said the neighbour took the boy home, and when she heard anther child crying inside the property she called the police. Miss Cutter said the neighbour later told officers she had often see a number of the familyaposs children in the street without shoes, and that the youngsters would sometimes ask her for food and drink, orthey could come inside when it was raining.

The Duke and Duchess of Sussex were photographed boarding a -seater Cessna  at Nice airport on Saturday, as a scheduled British Airways flight took off behind them. They had arrived on the French Riviera with baby Archie just three days earlier, again on a private plane from Farnborough airfield in Surrey. Last night Sir Elton released a rare statement defending the Royal couple, who stayed at his £m palatial home Castel Mont-Alban during their short break.    The singer, a close friend of Harry’s mother Princess Diana, said: “To maintain a high level of much-needed protection, we provided them with a private jet flight. “To support Prince Harry’s commitment to the environment, we ensured their flight was carbon neutral.” But environmentalists said the decision to fly privately could not be offset by Sir Elton’s donation to the sustainability website Carbon Footprint. Paul Morozzo, Climate Campaigner for Greenpeace UK, said: “An airliner is over ten times as polluting as a modern train, and private jets are ten times more polluting still. “It’s vitally important that all frequent fliers reduce the number of flights they takewe are to confront the climate emergency.” Ken Wharfe, an ex-royal protection officer who guarded Princess Diana, said: “Frankly it’s hypocritical. Harry can’t be preaching about the catastrophic effects of climate change while jetting around the world on a private plane.”    Earlier this month Harry and Meghan chartered their own luxury aircraft for both legs of a six-day trip to Ibiza to celebrate the Duchess’ th birthday. It is not known who paid for that journey. The decision to fly privately means they have generated an estimated seven times the emissions per person compared to passengers on a commercial flight from Nice to Britain. There were more than  commercial flight options for the same route. Harry and Meghan’s trip to France was estimated to have had a carbon footprint of just over three tons and their earlier trip to Ibiza was believed to have had a footprint of more than four tons. The carbon footprint of an average person in the UK is  tons a year. The couple’s decision to use a private jet for their Ibiza trip means the journey would have emitted six times more carbon dioxide per person than a scheduled flight from London to the Spanish island. The flights there and back would have given out . tons of carbon dioxide. There are around  scheduled flights from London and the South East to Ibiza each day.    At least one leg of the journey to the Spanish island is thought to have been booked through NetJets, which has earned the nicknames ‘Hertz For Heirs’ or ‘Uber for billionaires’ because of its services for the mega-rich. NetJets says it has been carbon neutral since  by investing in research to create sustainable alternatives to fossil fuels. Coming so soon after both Harry and Meghan of their climate change concerns, the private flights provoked widespread criticism. In an interview published in the September issue of Vogue with conservationist Jane Goodall, Harry revealed that he and Meghan wanted a “maximum” of two children because of environmental concerns. The issue was guest-edited by the Duchess. She selected climate change activist Greta Thunberg as one of her “forces for change” to be put on the front cover. However -year-old Greta, , travelled to New York from England by boat because she refuses to travel by plane.

He was pictured after the billionaire had left the property – which victims described as being full of pornographic and bizarre ornaments – with another female who looked to be in her teens, shivering in a thin jumper while he wore a thick coat. The footage was shot in December , a day after the infamous image of Andrew with Epstein in the city’s Central Park, following his jail release. The park photo embarrassed Buckingham Palace as the Duke of York faced calls to explain why he had not broken links with his disgraced pal. And Buckingham Palace has been quick to deny claims two of Epstein’s alleged victims have made against him since.    But the new footage of Andrew at Epstein’s lair has piled pressure on him to finally come clean about their friendship. One question being asked is how the bizarre features in Epstein’s New York home did not seem to ring alarm bells. Visitors to the £million, nine-storey Manhattan property, which included a steady stream of young women, said it was as weird as Epstein himself – who talked of having his penis ­cryogenically frozen and seeding humanity with his DNA. The entry foyer where Andrew stood to wave off the brunette was decorated with rows of framed articial eyeballs. Close by hung an oil painting of ex-President Bill Clinton in red heels and the semen-stained blue dress that Monica Lewinsky wore when she performed a sex act on him. A chandelier had a le-size female doll hanging from it and his bathroom had prosthetic breasts on the wall so he could play with the nipples while he bathed. A creepy chessboard featured customised figurines modelled on his female staff, apparently dressed suggestively. Behind Epstein’s desk was a  painting by Kees van Dongen called Femme Fatale, showing a woman cupping her exposed left breast.     And another large painting showed Epstein himself in a prison surrounded by barbed wire and gun-toting guards – which he said was “to remind me I could go back to prison any time”. But Andrew apparently brushed off all these indications about Epstein, as he did when others asked him. In a  Vanity Fair article about his relationship with the pervert, a friend of the pair was quoted as saying: “I remember when Andrew and Jeffrey became friends. “Jeffrey had Andrew put on a pair of sweatpants for the first time. He had him wear blue jeans. It was Jeffrey who taught Andrew how to relax. After Jeffrey was convicted, I phoned Andrew and told him, ‘You cannot have a relationship with Jeffrey.’ And he said, ‘Stop giving me a hard time, you’re such a puritan.’  “Our conversation descended into a screaming match and Andrew said, ‘Leave me alone, Jeffrey’s my friend, being loyal to your friends is a virtue’.” Depraved Epstein died in custody nine days ago, aged , while being held on child sex-trafficking charges. His death has been ruled a suicide but this is still being disputed. He had faced trial next June,  years after he was jailed in Florida. In a sweetheart deal in  he admitted procuring an underage girl, aged , for prostitution. He got just  months. An alleged victim, aged , and her parents claimed Epstein molested her at his mansion in Palm Beach, where bathrooms were stocked with soaps shaped like male and female genitalia. Since the  Central Park photo emerged, two of Epstein’s alleged victims have accused Andrew of impropriety. “Sex slave” Virginia Giuffre, then Roberts, claimed she was “lent out” to the Duke for sex on three occasions – one of them in London. And Johanna Sjoberg had alleged that he groped her breast at Epstein’s New York home when she was . Ms Giuffre and Ms Sjoberg made their allegations against Andrew as part of a  Florida court filing. But a judge threw out the claims and ordered them struck from the record as “immaterial and impertinent”. Days before Epstein was found dead, a huge legal dossier containing the lurid allegations was unsealed.  Andrew’s lawyers reiterated their denials, saying: “It is emphatically denied that the Duke of York had any form of sexual contact or relationship with Virginia Roberts. Any claim to the contrary is  and without foundation.” Buckingham Palace also said in  that “any suggestion of impropriety with underage minors is categorically untrue”. But despite the repeated denials of wrongdoing, Andrew and the palace have yet to explain the photo of him with his arm around Ms Giuffre, then , in London in  – and why he did not sever his ties with Epstein once he was a ­registered sex offender. Andrew, , was introduced to Epstein in the s by British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell, the daughter of the late, disgraced ­newspaper owner Robert. The -year-old was allegedly his fixer for young girls but she denies all claims and has never been arrested. Records detailing flights by Epstein’s private jet reveal that in May , Andrew flew to Palm Beach with him and Maxwell. A month later, Epstein and Maxwell are believed to have attended a bumper royal birthday bash at Windsor, marking Andrew’s th, Princess Anne’s th, Princess Margaret’s th and Prince William’s th. That autumn, Andrew was a guest at a Halloween “hookers and bondage” party in Manhattan, where Maxwell dressed as a prostitute. And in December that year, the Prince hosted a birthday party for Maxwell at Sandringham, which Epstein attended. All three then went to Thailand to celebrate the New Year. Other encounters between Andrew and Epstein are believed to have taken place at the Queen’s Norfolk estate and a dinner in Saint Tropez.

the sides prepare for cup tie","story":"Dundee host Aberdeen in the Betfred Cup on Sunday and, eventhe Dons have had a few early season problems, it’s fair to say anything other than a win for them would be a shock.On the back of relegation, James McPake’s Dark Blues are finding their feet after a major overhaul of the squad during the summer.It means they go into this tie as major underdogs, though history does tell us this is a competition in which Dundee are capable of upsetting the odds.Tonight Tele Sport looks back at a couple of occasions when they have – and some others when the result has been true to the form book.While unlike the present format, this tie was over two legs, it was similar to this clash in that Dundee had just been relegated at the end of the previous season.Aberdeen were at the peak of their powers under Alex Ferguson and, as reigning champions, a bigger knockout tie for them was a European Cup meeting with Liverpool around the same time.That they went out of that competition to the team that would eventually win it was no great surprise but losing to Dundee was.After a draw at Dens in the first leg, the feeling was Donald Mackay’s team were heading to the Granite City hoping for little more than to keep the score respectable.In the end, however, a battling performance saw them hold their own and progress to the semi-finals thanks to a Cammy Fraser strike.Dundee would go on to make the final before losing to city rivals United on a historic day at Dens Park.The only time the north-east rivals have faced up in a national final and it was Aberdeen who lted the trophy with a comfortable Hampden victory.Once again, the pair met with Dundee, under Jim Duffy, out of the top flight but going into the tie on the back of a fine unbeaten run that saw them riding high in the First Division and making the final.For those of a Dark Blue persuasion, however, it quickly became a day to forget as their team didn’t really show up.An effort from former Dens favourite Billy Dodds had Aberdeen ahead by the break and, when Duncan Shearer added a second right at the start of the second half, it was all over bar the shouting.Although Dundee were again in the second tier, with the backing of Aberdeen-based businessman Callum Melville, their strong line-up was always going to provide a stern test for the visiting Dons.So it proved as, despite losing experienced goalkeeper Rab Douglas through injury in the first half, Jocky Scott’s team pulled off the result of the round by winning in extra-time.Goals from Eddie Malone and Craig Forsyth had the home team apparently cruising but a double from Michael Paton saw the proceedings heading into extra-time.As the game ebbed and flowed, one of those Melville-backed signings, a young Leigh Grfiths, came up trumps with the winner.The last time the teams met in a League Cup tie saw Dundee still recovering from a second period of administration that had seen the team almost fold the previous year.Having performed a miracle in keeping the team in the First Division in the   season, boss Barry Smith was looking to pull off a shock at Pittodrie.They battled hard to give him the scalp he wanted but, on the night, came up just short.A tight tie was decided as early as the th minute when home attacker Darren Mackie grabbed the only goal."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/08/2.44276588-240x180.jpg

As you know cup games are all about finding a way to win and my players deserve so much praise for that.“We’ll give them a few days off and then get back to some training days which we haven’t had the luxury of in recent weeks.“It takes luck, good players and quality but in any team there has to be a strength to dig out results.“For long spells it didn’t look like there was a goal in us but we made changes, took a risk by going man for man at the back and thankfully we had enough bodies at both goals to get the reward.“A lot of people would have taken pleasure in seeing us go out of the cup and I have a lot of pleasure in seeing my team go through.“I know we can improve, be far more slicker and more technical, and I know we’ll have more energy in our legs.“There are certain games where you need grit and determination and we had that.”Considine conceded the penalty for a foul on Jordon Forster, but redeemed himself with the equaliser.McInnes added: “If Andy has conceded a penalty he has certainly made up for it.“It was a real dagger to the hearts of the Dundee players late on and we looked more equipped to get the second goal and once we got it we managed to get over the line without too much fuss.”McInnes’ celebrations for both his team’s goals were a mixture of relief and jubilation, in many ways mirroring the emotions of the Red Army who had travelled to Dens.He said: “Our fans were put through the mill. They came here with high expectations and it wasn’t playing out as they expected.“We have to credit Dundee for that.

These should ensure everyone receives #joined up# care, that they are asked how they are feeling as part of every diabetes appointment and that a mental health professional with knowledge of diabetes is part of every diabetes care team.To sign our petition, go to diabetes.org.uk missingAngela Mitchell, National Director of Diabetes Scotland.Sir,I#m asking residents in the Highlands and Islands to give their views on Conservative proposals for tackling serious crime.In order to provide Scotland with an alternative to Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP in , we are keen to gain feedback from as many people to our policy proposals to make them as relevant as possible to the needs and aspirations of everyone in Scotland.Too many people in Scotland are affected by the behaviour of serious criminals. This needs to be properly addressed and my colleague Liam Kerr MSP, shadow Justice Secretary, has outlined key policy proposals in a member#s bill in the Scottish Parliament to tackle this scourge.It would give Scottish judges the power to impose whole le sentences to those convicted of the most serious violent and sexual crimes including the murder of a police officer.The courts would still have discretion to impose the appropriate sentence based on all the facts of each case, as they do in England and Wales where such a provision already exists.The proposed Whole Le CustodyBill will not mean the perpetrators of a particular crime will always receive a whole le sentence, but rather that the courts will have the power to impose one where there is sufficient justication.We have started the consultation and experts and members of the public are invited to register their views.Email me at donald.cameron.msp@parliament.scot or write to me at Donald Cameron MSP,  George Street, Oban, PA NT, with your views.MSP Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands.Sir,The SNP has warned Scotland’s NHS is under threat from a Tory-Trump trade deal that could leave the Scottish Government without a veto over a post-Brexit deal that sells Scotland out.This stark warning follows the revelations from Donald Trump that in terms of trade deals, everything, including the NHS, would be on the table.At Prime Ministers Questions, SNP Deputy Westminster Leader Kirsty Blackman MP said Donald Trump and the Tories could not be trusted on the NHS and criticised the UK government for plotting to take powers away from the Scottish Parliament that would allow it to safeguard Scotland’s NHS.The threats to Scotland#s NHS are growing under the prospect of a hard-right Tory-Trump Brexit trade deal. Those threats could undermine the integrity and independence of our Scottish NHS.The UK Tories will block any potential veto by the Scottish Government over such a damaging deal.The SNP government will fight to the end to defend Scotland#s public services from this unprecedented Tory Brexit danger. Our NHS must remain in public hands. It is not, and should never be, up for sale.Scotland has been completely ignored throughout the Brexit process and Tory plans to grab powers from the Scottish Parliament will leave us even more exposed.It is clearer than ever that the only way to properly protect Scotland#s interests, and keep our NHS in public hands, is with the full powers of independence.MP Brendan O#Hara, Argyll and Bute."},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures week 25","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowFiona McCuish of Ardrishaig captured the VIC puffer wending its way up the Crinan Canal.Fiona used her camera phone as the vessel passed through West Bank, Ardrishaig."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column june 28 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWhat is it with recruiting #professionals# to Argyll We seem to be a distinctly unattractive prospect, as witnessed by the problems with recruiting a dentist in Lochgilphead.What people fail to appreciate is that they stand to gain so much more than they would lose by coming to Argyll.The scenery is unrivalled the pace of le is civilised we are not that far from the central belt and a sense of community remains.Just turn to our front page story for proof.Disappointment at losing out on council grant funding has turned into joy in Tarbert.But only because the people of the village have such big hearts, as they have demonstrated in the past.The council may argue that this vindicates its decision to refuse funding.

They also make for an excellently contrasting pair.From Mendelssohn’s exuberant opening bars, we are swept through music that is complex yet captivatingly, joyously melodic throughout, while Enescu’s is moody, breathlessly dramatic and, in parts, simply volcanic.Guest directed by Marianne Thorsen, SE will explore the specic charm of seeing a small group of musicians performing live. With fewer instruments, the fabric of the music becomes more tangible, subtle shts in mood may have a new-found presence, and pieces you think you know well might offer surprising new colours when heard live. With fewer musicians on stage, it is easier to follow each inidual path and witness the beautul alchemy of eight artists creating something together.Thorsen is an acclaimed soloist and passionate chamber musician. Former leader of the Nash Ensemble, she regularly performs with Norway’s Trondheim Soloists, one of the founding ensembles of The Bridge network and festival.The first half of the tour, which is called Chamber Notes, will call at Crear Studio, Kilberry, on August , followed by a performance at Mull Theatre, Tobermory, on August  before moving on to Inverness and Dundee.Other Scottish dates, including Edinburgh and Glasgow, are programmed for February .PIC:Marianne Thorsen. no_aMarianne Thorsen"},{"url":null,"title":"kilberry sportive well supported in sunshine","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe Kilberry Loop Sportive saw around  cyclists take on a -mile route starting and finishing in Tarbert.All eyes were on the forecast for the non-competitive cycling event on Saturday August .

We do at the moment have a dentist and fully qualied staff and are happy with their work.Rumour has it that the aforementioned dentist and staff will be taking on patients from Mid Argyll Hospital, which I presume they tend to already.But the practice is to lose its local NHS patients, so they will deal solely with patients who require dental treatment from the hospital. I think this situation leaves the NHS patients in limbo.I am sure we would rather that the current dentist and all of her staff be given a chance to voice their opinions on this matter as much and as well as the local populace.Yes, it will be brilliant to have both dentists in the town. There is the possibility that those on the local list who are currently treated well by the dental department at the hospital maybe still seen by the dentist and her staff, but I would like this to be confirmed by the local NHS trust.Brian MacDonald, CrinanSir,Hundreds of people across Scotland have been helped through their exam results by a local group of Skills Development Scotlandcareers advisers.Based across the north of Scotland, the advisers were part of a team taking calls at the SDS Exam Results Helpline from am on results day.The helpline is a vital service, supporting young people and their families at what can be one of the most stressful times of their lives.Expert advice and guidance is available all year round, not just on results day.Our professionally qualied careers advisers are working in every state secondary school in Scotland and from our network of high street centres across the country.In schools, careers services are delivered one-to-one, in classrooms and at school events across all year groups, supporting young people to develop the skills to make informed career decisions throughout their lives.

While McAndrew has the harmonic range, Smalls almost monotoned meanderings, accompanied by the backing vocals of Grant Pringle and Cameron Jack, creates the rawest of emotions.Concluding the new EP is the orchestral art-song, A Theory of Everything. Built around a single, beautully menacing chord, which apparently symbolises the background radiation in our universe, the finale discusses the search for discovering a unying theory of everything.To quote Small from Imprints, As you travel through space, you are displaced, imagining time. You exist like a plant, you bloom and you grow, then wither and die. But the one card you play, genetically, is always an ace.

at Barrel Law, near Hawick.In September, plans for an poundm wind farm were rejected by Scottish Borders councillors.The proposal would have seen seven turbines, of up to m in height, erected on land to the north-west of Roberton, near Hawick.The company behind the plans, Germany-based ABO Wind, then submitted an appeal to the Scottish Governmentrsquos planning and environmental appeals ision .As part of that appeal process, the DPEArsquos appointed reporter Elspeth Cook held a hearing at Forman Hall, Roberton.However, the hearing was simply to clary and define legal terms and certain technical standards in order to help inform Ms Cookrsquos decision.For example, one point of contention between Scottish Borders Council and ABO Wind is whether or not the combined appearance of Barrel Law and the existing wind turbines at Langhope Rig will create a lsquolandscape with wind turbinesrsquo or a lsquowind turbine landscapersquo, as per the legally-defined definitions.The councilrsquos position is that a distance of between -km is required in order to maintain the current landscape type in the valley, but ABO Wind suggest the turbines should be less than km apart, as they state that spreading out the two turbine sites would actually make the landscape look more saturated as the wind turbines would effectively cover a larger area.Furthermore, they state that a greater distance between the two developments would push the Barrel Law turbines outside of the topography which makes wind farms viable in this area.Appearing as part of ABO Windrsquos  of representatives, land and development consultant James Welsh told the reporter: ldquoIn our opinion we preserve the distinct identity of the two groups.ldquoThere are examples of wind farms being approved with similar distances between them but still being accepted as being clearly separate wind farms.ldquoTo insist on a greater separation would increase the effect of a cumulative effect between them.Scottish Borders Councilrsquos planning consultant, Dr Guy Wimble, said: ldquoI donrsquot dispute that they are identiable as separate elements, my issue is the effect of the wind farms on the landscape, and recognising that they are two dferent wind farms not one development.ldquoThe proximity of them makes this appear more of a wind farm landscape rather a landscape with wind farms.ldquoWhile I accept that separating the developments would make the wind farms seem more spaced out, by putting them closer yoursquod increase density.John Campbel QC, appearing on behalf of a group of objectors called Barrel Law Action Group, said: ldquoIf you pull the wind farms apart then clearly you increase the area of cumulative effect.ldquoIf you pull them together, yoursquore going to increase the cumulative effect just by sheer numbers, and you lose the ability to discern the two as distinct entities.Melrose and Leaderdale councillor Tom Miers, appearing in his capacity as Scottish Borders Councilrsquos executive member for planning and environment, told the hearing: ldquoIt seems to me that the guidance allows for developments in this area but doesnrsquot necessarily promote it.ldquoNo one is disputing that the two wind farms would be separate, wersquore working to find out what degree of separation would be appropriate.Mr Welsh responded: ldquoIf you increase to a km distance it will push all m turbines outwith the area that has been identied as having the appropriate topography for this type of development.Ms Cook also sought clarication on certain technical points, mostly surrounding tables and figures contained within ious reports submitted by the appellant and the local authority."},{"url":null,"title":"art-thou-shakespeare-cyclists","story":"BORDERS

They have got the choice of three roads. The first is the C, which is impossible. Somebody would get killed every day.ldquoThe second is the Lowood Bridge and that is unsuitable.ldquoIf anybody is on that bridge, how will a -tonne lorry be able to pass  If it tried to squeeze through, it would hit the people and would crush them.ldquoThe other option is bringing the traffic through the town and the community of Galashiels does not want that.ldquoThe roads were not built for that use. It is dangerous.ldquoThere never has been a route proposed on this application and there is still not one to this day.ldquoSo how could it have been approved, without knowing where the traffic is going Melrose community councillor Mr Douglas claimed SBC was ldquounnecessarily endangering the publicrsquos lives and putting financial expedience before public safety in a letter to council chief executive Tracey Logan.And he asked to see a copy of a lsquopre-planning application decisionrsquo on potential vehicle routes.But, in a response, Ms Logan said: ldquoI have been advised no such document exists.She added the council had considered a transport statement and a report from the public consultation process.However, she admitted: ldquoNo detail of vehicle routes was included within either document. This was principally because at the time of the planning application, the contract for removing and treating wasted had not yet been awarded, meaning that the end destination was not known.ldquoThe council has recently awarded the contract for waste recycling to Levenseat, a company based near Forth in North Lanarkshire. Levenseat will consider dferent routes at dferent times of the day, depending on circumstances such as traffic....

There was a lot of spirit and a feeling that a number of towns in Scotland which have been forgotten, like Campbeltown, will not be left behind after independence.#He put the turnout at more than , and added: #The fact that the march extended theof Longrow gives a fair indication of the numbers who were there.He also told the Courier this week that he remained the #legal indentity# of the All Under One Banner group, despite a bitter public row among the hierarchy which looks like splitting the group in two.It was the biggest rally held in the town in recent years with marchers coming from as far afield as Aberdeen and Alloa and as well as Oban, Glasgow and Islay, with many travelling on the weekend ferry from Ardrossan.#It really exceeded expectations and made a big splash in the town, Ron Wilson of Yes Kintyre told The National.#There was a real buzz as people came early and most of the hotels were booked up. The pubs and cafes were busy so it was good for local businesses. Campbeltown is a Yes town and it was brilliant to have all these people come here. Local people were coming off the pavements and joining the procession so it created a good, positive vibe.Pro-Unionists opponents held their own counter demonstation. However, the march went off without any incident and there were no arrests, with only one warning which was drug related.A spit of rain earlier in the day failed to develop into poor weather as the marchers would round the town to hear speakers and listen to musicians at the rally at Kinloch Green.Mr Wilson said he was particuarly pleased at the turnout as there had been some confusion over whether the march would go ahead due to internal sions within the hierachcy of All Under One Banner, which has organised independence marches across the country.Following Mr Singh#s sacking, founder Neil Mackay resigned from his position on its national executive pending an internal investigation.Pro-UK Unionist group A Force For Good met the march on the shore front and say they filmed and counted the marchers, as they have at previous events, and afterwards claimed the turnout was just .Director, Alistair McConnachie, said: #All Under One Banner is basically the marching wing of the SNP. AUOB, and SNP MPs and MSPs, lie about the numbers which attend their marches, sometimes up to  or  times.#Unfortunately, they are not challenged by the Scottish media.

She met friends she hadnrsquot seen in weeks this morning and smiled as she said hello to George the lollipop man.She seemed slightly anxious as she waited in line in a new place, but the friendly manner of her new teacher visibly lted her mood and she went in with a smile, unknowingly tracing my childhood footsteps and those of her big sister.But then as I walked home, I was suddenly overwhelmed with anxieties: money worries, work worries, deadlines, bills etc. It seemed asduring the holiday period I had consciously decided to put such thoughts aside, to just enjoy the family time. Now was the pay back, we had ed to lsquorealityrsquo.But then I suddenly remembered a tale a fellow storyteller had told me many years ago. It just popped into my head and it spoke to me as I wandered back. And the truth in the story was the antidote I needed in that moment. And so I will share it with you in case you may one day find you need it:There was once a weaver who was weighed down with worries. He had so many things to do, so many responsibilities he looked into the future with dread. His worries kept him awake at night, which of course made his worrying worse during the next day. It was a vicious cycle.Then one day, he was sitting at his loom working and his worries got in the way. He couldnrsquot concentrate and he made mistake after mistake. He cursed and this was heard by an auld guidewe who happened to be passing by his window.ldquoFir whit reason dae ye curse at yer loom son, is there nae joy in yer work  she asked.The weaver looked up, feeling ashamed: ldquoIrsquom sair sorry fir ma words. Itrsquos just that as I work I think aboot orsquo ma troubles.The old woman nodded in understanding. She knew about troubles herself.ldquoAye, she said with an understanding nod, ldquotroubles can fair get ye doon.Then she paused and thought for a moment. She could see in the weaverrsquos face that he was riddled with anxieties.ldquoCan I show ye something that will tak ye awa frae yer work fir only a few minutes The weaver was happy to have a break so he left his loom and came outside.ldquoDae ye hae a bucket  asked the guidewe.ldquoA bucket ldquoAye a bucket, tae put some water in, she explained.The weaver fetched his bucket, wondering what the old woman was going to do with it.She took it to the well and filled it with a little water.ldquoNoo son, I dinnae kenthis will be tae heavy fir ye tae hold up.The weaver laughed: ldquoOrsquo course itrsquos no too heavy, fir ye only put a wee drop orsquo water in it.So the woman asked him to prove this by holding up the bucket with arms outstretched. The weaver had strong arms because of his work and held the bucket before him without any effort.ldquoAh, said the guidewe, ldquosae itrsquos nae tae heavy.ldquoIt isnae heavy at arsquo, replied the weaver.The old woman smiled: ldquoIn that case, keep haudin it afore ye like that fir  minutes. He wondered why she was asking him to do this, andshe was just trying to make a fool of him. But he was also intrigued and knew her to be an honest old soul, and so he did as she asked.After a few minutes of holding the bucket in front of him, it began to feel much heavier. After five minutes, his arms began to ache and soon they began to shake. The pain began to spread to his back as he desperately tried to keep the bucket in position.ldquoIs  minutes no over yet  asked the weaver desperately.ldquoIf the bucket is now tae heavy fir ye, put it doon son.He was reluctant to admit that the bucket was now too heavy to hold and so put it down.ldquoThe water got heavier son, didnrsquot it ldquoThe water wasnae heavier, protested the weaver, ldquoye just made me hold the bucket for tae lang.ldquoSae the water did get heavier, no in itself, but for you!The weaver looked confused and the guidewe continued.ldquoWater can get heavierye haud it ower lang afore ye, evenitrsquos just a wee drop. Yer worries are like that water, son. I am sure that they are many but ye mak them much heavierye try tae haud them in yer thochts arsquo the time.She smiled at him: ldquoTry an put the bucket doon as often as ye can,ye ken whit I mean. Dinnae mak it heavier than needs be. When ye need tae, haud it, but no arsquo the time.ldquoIn fact, she added while raising a pointed finger, ldquohauding it arsquo the time gies ye pain and paralyses ye. Yersquoll hae nae ability left tae empty the bucket.And so the old woman wandered off, leaving her words with the weaver. He looked down at the bucket. He lted it again and held it in front of him. It wasnrsquot as heavy now as before, but still had the same amount of water in it. She was right, water can get heavieryou hold it for longer, even though itrsquos the same weight.He chuckled to himself and watched the woman as she waddled down the street.ldquoThank ye! he called out.He ed to his loom. This time he whistled and sang as he worked. He enjoyed his creation and made no mistakes, for he had put his bucket of worries down for a while.Later they would still be there, but they might seem lighter and easier to manage now that they had stopped paralysing him with anxiety.And so that was the story. And as I arrived home, I realised that although I needed to deal with lots of things, I wasnrsquot going to give my worries more weight by holding them constantly in my thoughts.Itrsquos really important to put your bucket down every now and then, and that can make it easier to empty as well."},{"url":null,"title":"letter-railway-isn-39-t-perfect-39-s-better-driving","story":"Sure, things

years. While the name of these types of promotions seems to imply that players will be on the receiving end of totally free spins, during which anything won can be kept and withdrawn, the truth is often a bit murkier than that.The UK Gambling Commission has played no small role in attempting to clear up the matter. According to them, to use the term ldquofree spins casinos must genuinely offer free games with no strings attached, such as wagering requirements. The old, standard spins are to be referred to as ldquobonus spins instead.When Free Spins Are Not Truly Free SpinsThere are several occasions when free spinsarenrsquot free. Any spins which come with wagering requirements, for instance, breach the concept of being truly free. Wagering requirements, also known as playthrough rates, denote that a player must wager whatever they win a specic number of times before they can withdraw those funds.Wagering requirements are common in deposit bonusesbut shouldnrsquot be included in any offer which proclaims itself to be free.Free Spins With No Wagering RequirementsFortunately, the new regulation issued by the UK Gambling Commission, Swedish Gaming Authority and others are aiming to fix this issue. True free spin deals should come with no hidden terms and no strings attached. They should be offered to players with a genuine chance to win real money for free, money which can ndasha player desires ndash be withdrawn from the start. This doesnrsquot mean to say that there arenrsquot other terms and conditions.Many top free spin bonuses tend to come with dates attached, only being valid during a predetermined period. Moreover, they may only be valid on select slot machines and could be limited to players in a specic region.Only a Handful of Chances to WinThere is a downside to the new ldquofree spins offers at casinos. They generally tend to provide a limited number of spins, far fewer than the old no deposit bonuses with wagering requirements, and deposit offers. Moreover, they are often only valid on slot games which do not offer substantial cash prizes, including many simple - line games from NetEnt and others.Promos Which Are Ideal for Test Driving CasinosSuch free spin bonuses which come with no wagering requirements at all are hardly going to be appealing for players who fancy landing big wins. As mentioned, they tend to be valid on slots which donrsquot offer such epic wins. However, these promos and deals may make the ideal introduction to slot gaming for new players, or those who wish to test-drive a slot before deciding to wager real money on it.The East Lothian Courierencourages readers to gamble responsibly.

The procedure for iding matrimonial property, which is any money and other assets owned jointly or inidually is that it is to be ided fairly, which may not simply mean equally. If the situation has to be resolved in court that can result in a decision that is far from satisfactory to one ndashor both ndashof the partners.ldquoItrsquos important that we advise clients about the fact that Alternative Dispute Resolution is available. These situations emphatically donrsquot involve an inevitable progress to court ndashwhich should be regarded as very much the last resort, he says.In fact, some % or more of cases are now dealt with through negotiation rather than a court order that determines the ision of assets. People who proceed to court, says Ferry almost inevitably have an urgent issue such as suffering from a serious shortage of money or protection issues resulting from circumstances of domestic abuse.The alternative routes principally involve collaboration or mediation. Mediation, involves an independent mediator guiding the parties toward a solution. The mediator does not usually give them legal advice as to their entitlements though in assisted mediation both parties have their solicitors in the background .ldquoThat is an option that sometimes works out well ndash but many people are looking for veriable answers, and this can be achieved through the collaborative approach which I find is generally a better way to resolve disagreements.Ferry, a trained collaborative lawyer, believes this route is best to minimise conflict and secure financial choices ndashwhile also, importantly, ensuring the best future for the children. He explains that collaborative law involves the parties and their advisers in four-way meetings with discussions around the table, in private and without the delay of correspondence and court proceedings. And this, he says helps to avoid subsequent, and potentially costly, misunderstandings.The problem with pensionsPensions, for example, can become very contentious. ldquoIn our experience pensions are frequently overlooked by clients when considering orce settlements. However, the value of the pensions built up during the marriage or civil partnership is taken into account and can be substantial. Our clientsrsquo settlements often involve pension sharing agreements.ldquoHowever, pensions can be extremely complicated ndashnot only in terms of valuing them and iding them but itrsquos also important to get the best advice on which pensions should be shared and which should not. Some have more benefits attached to them than others. For example, there may be spousersquos benefits attached to them which may be very valuable.In addition, he adds, there are ious types of pensions such as Self Invested Personal Pensionswhich can be convoluted when dealing with them in orce cases as sometimes these can involve multiple underlying property and other assets contained in the pension which may need to be valued too.ldquoYou need to take advice not only about its value at the date of separation but also its type of pension and current value. A failure to identy pension interests or to correctly apportion the value of a pension may have dramatic long-term implications for either spouse and there is a strict timescale involved after orce for implementing the pension share.Business assetsFerry says that clients also need advice about business assets and shareholdings, as to what constitutes matrimonial property as these can, inadvertently, be converted into matrimonial property in the course of, for example, restructuring a company that was founded or bought before marriage.ldquoShareholdings that may be worth several millions can be transferred into the joint matrimonial pot and that possibility is not often considered by the accountant or tax advisor involved, he says.These are just a few of the issues to be considered but despite the obvious vexations that separation and orce involve, Ferry believes in confronting them in a positive, proactive way. The Family LawAct of  was well thought out and is quite flexible, providing for the needs of inidual cases, he says.Divorce, he adds, need not end up in long, drawn out court proceedings. ldquoWhether via a pre-nuptial agreement or a collaborative resolution, with good legal advice parties can deal with separation and orce in way that achieves the solution that works best for them both.Noel specialises in all areas of family law but is particularly noted for acting in high value cases for high net worth iniduals, for example, celebrities, sports personalities, entrepreneurs, business owners, directors, professionals and executives.

A child in what seems to be a bowler hat tucked over his ears clutches a jug in his arms almost as big as he is, and a curious face juts through a tenement window, perhaps anxious to see what the man with the camera might be doing in a grim Glasgow close.These evocative images are among hundreds of Glasgow scenes captured by th-century photographer Thomas Annan, as he meticulously recorded a city undergoing social and structural changes intended to help end the squalor and deprivation, and usher in a new way of le.Many of Annanrsquos photographs shed light on the east endrsquos harsh past, where slum le came to an early end at an average age of just  and the stinking closes and wynds harboured homes crammed with dozens of people sharing the most basic of living conditions.Other images cast light on the effort to raise the cityrsquos living standards ndash such as the pivotal waterworks project that fed clean water from Loch Katrine to the heart of the city.The photographs and Annanrsquos remarkable work is now set to be explored at a sold-out event organised by the Alexander Thomson Society, which is to be held at the Kelvin Hall later this month.According to art historian Anne Lyden, of the National Galleries of Scotland, who will present the event, Annanrsquos fascinating images reflect a time long gone but also serve as a reminder that modern le is not immune from challenges and a constant need for the city to evolve.ldquoAnnanrsquos photographs are interesting because they are a moment when change was already starting to happen in the city, she says. ldquoHe started work in , two years after the Glasgow City Improvements Act and the earlier Police Act were bringing about change and trying to improve conditions.ldquoThere was improved lighting and sanitation. However, the city fathers decided it would be better to completely demolish and start over again.As a result, many of Annanrsquos images show closes and tenements that would go on to be razed, with families displaced and new buildings erected in their place.Some, however, such as an image of the Saltmarket taken in  from Bridgegate, feel almost familiar, save for the eerie figures that line the cobbled street, many with their unsmiling faces turned to the photographerrsquos lens.Many of Annanrsquos photographs, a signicant number of which capture the overcrowded heart of the city, were commissioned by the Glasgow City Improvement Trust with the distinct aim of recording ldquoOld Glasgow before it was demolished.ldquoThe photographs demonstrate the challenges of a shting city and how urban planners have to constantly evaluate what is available for a changing demographic, adds Ms Lyden. ldquoWhen Thomas Annan was documenting these parts of Glasgow, there was a huge movement of people from the north of Scotland and Ireland coming to the city. At one point there were , Irish people living in that area.ldquoSimilar issues are being dealt with today in terms of managing housing stock.Annan took scores of photographs of old closes, tenements and wynds at a time when the compact city centre was home to more than , people. But his work also shed fascinating light on the cityrsquos industrial heritage, including images of work to dredge areas of the Clyde and of grand houses also facing demolition for new housing schemes and roads ndash just as the grim closes were being destroyed to make way for improved accommodation.The extraordinary clarity of many of the -year-old images, taken at a time when photography was still in its infancy, are testament to Annanrsquos technical skill, adds Ms Lyden.ldquoHe was incredibly skilled. The clarity in his images is because he was working with glass plate negatives. He was able to capture a tremendous amount of detail and was able to use dferent processes that he had travelled to Vienna to achieve the rights to use.ldquoHis photographs are evidence of a time past, but also reflect a lot of the same issues that we are dealing with today.Anne Lyden on Thomas Annan is at the Kelvin Hall on Wednesday, August ,at pm."},{"url":null,"title":"elections-watchdog-may-delay-indyref2","story":"In a formal submission to MSPs, the Electoral Commission said it might not allow the First Minister to re-use the Yes No question of .Other experts, including the Institute for Government and Law Society of Scotland, also raised \"concerns\" and warned the government must not ldquoavoid full scrutiny on the question.The SNPrsquos campaign messaging throughout  and since has been built upon the word ldquoYes, with the partycurrently using the yes.scot website to promote its arguments.:Boris Johnson will use first foreign trip to present Angela Merkel and Emmanuel Macron with Brexit ultimatumMs Sturgeon has said she wants another referendum in the second half of , but has suggested it could be accelerated in the event of a no-deal Brexit.However the UK government has refused to grant Holyrood the required power.In May, the SNP Government published its -page ReferendumsBill, paving the way for Indyref, provided the missing power could be secured from Westminster.It provoked immediate controversy by suggesting SNP ministers could ignore the Electoral Commission by re-running the Yes No question from the first independence vote.Section  of the Bill says the Commission must be consulted on the wording of any question and publish a statement on its intelligibility.However there is an exemption: section  says the Commission will not be consultedit has previously published a report on the wording of the question, as it did in .The Bill does not allow the Commission to change its mind based on new evidence -

dferent\" after Brexit Day with changes including tougher checks to prevent foreign criminals entering the country.Ministers were warned that dramatically changing the system on October  could leave the UK facing \"another Windrush\" a reference to the immigration scandal which led to Amber Rudds resignation as Home Secretary in April .Last week, Home Office officials produced a discussion paper for a ministerial no-deal Brexit meeting, which warned that implementing an immediate ban on free movement could present a \"handling and reputational risk\" for the Government.A Whitehall source said the document raised concerns that an \"interim\" immigration system would prove impossible to enforce because the Government and employers would be unable to distinguish new arrivals from those already living in Britain.It recommended that free movement should continue until a new immigration system was ready in January  to provide \"maximum certainty\" to EU citizens and employers.However, Downing St confirmed an immediate end to free movement ldquoas it currently stands on October  and said that Boris Johnson and Priti Patel, the Home Secretary, would shortly set out details of the Governmentrsquos new immigration system.The Prime Minister has made clear he wants to introduce an Australian-style points-based system to cater for the UKrsquos specic needs after Brexit.His spokeswoman insisted that EU citizens currently resident in the UK would not be prevented from re-entering the country after trips abroad, although it was unclear how checks would be carried out.The system allowing EU citizens to apply for settled status would be unchanged and the two million people who had not yet completed the process would not be prevented from entering the UK by the ending of free movement.\"The Home Office have set out that no one eligible for settled status will be unable to re-enter the UK when free movement ends and they have obviously been doing a signicant amount of work to communicate how you apply,\" she explained.A Home Office spokesman told The Herald that the issue of how an EU citizen, re-entering Britain at the border, would prove their eligibility to reside in the UK was one of the issues the department was still looking into but he made clear it would be resolved before October .However, the  Million group, which campaigns for the rights of EU citizens in the UK, said: \"The idea of ending freedom of movement abruptly on October  in case of no-deal is reckless politics.\"It hollows out the Prime Ministers unequivocal guarantee to EU citizens he has given only three weeks ago.It warned that ending freedom of movement without putting in place legal provisions for the majority of EU citizens, who had not yet successfully applied through the settlement scheme, would mean millions of lawful citizens would have their legal status removed overnight.\"We have been calling for the settlement scheme to be a declaratory registration scheme, so all EU citizens who have made the UK their home are automatically granted status, as promised by those in Government.\"Otherwise, this will open the door to mass discrimination under the hostile environment with employers, landlords, banks and the NHS unable to distinguish between those EU citizens with the right to live and work in the UK and those without,\" it added.Sir Ed Davey for the Liberal Democrats claimed there was a \"question-mark\" over whether the Governments plans to end freedom of movement on October  was legal and whether the ports and the borders \"could

Unlike the diseases of the pasts, such as tuberculosis, which could be cured with antibiotics, or the scourge of cigarettes which has been signicantly reduced by measures ranging from hefty taxation to the smoking ban, obesity and the damage it causes will be much harder to reverse.So far, no country in the world has achieved a signicant or sustained reduction in its obesity rates.

Figures obtained by the Herald earlier this year showed that the number of bariatric surgeries carried out on NHS Scotland has fallen by a fth - from  in   to  in  .The question is whether changing the food environment can offer an effective alternative.One criticism is that restricting price promotions will disproportionately affect the poorest. It is impossible to separate obesity from deprivation.One in three adults living in Scotlands most deprived communities is obese, compared to one in five in the most affluent postcodes.In its submission to the Scottish Governments consultation, BMA Scotland said: \"Increasing food prices have in some cases led to people choosing cheaper food products that are often less healthy.\"Finding ways to ensure that healthy options are also more affordable than unhealthy alternatives can help to change peoplersquos behaviours.\": Warning over back-to-school spike in asthma attacksOf course, pleasure as well as price influences shoppers and, with the best will in the world, making a six-pack of apples cheaper than a six-pack of chocolate biscuits is unlikely to make the fruit bag more appealing to someone seeking a quick endorphin hit.Nonetheless, there is evidence that a price-based approach can work.Professor Peter Morgan, of Aberdeen Universitys Rowett Institute, pointed to studies showing that subsidising healthy foods can change behaviour.He said: \"These demonstrate that both subsidiesand taxationsignicantly alter dietary consumption of targeted food items and contribute to weight control through restricting calorie intake.\"This work confirms other research which suggests that price reduction policy to reduce the cost of healthy foods is more effective on food choice than price increases .\"He said foods high in sugar and saturated fat should be automatically excluded price promotions.The push to change the food environment through legislation is also a signicant pivot away from the narrative of personal responsibility that has dominated the obesity debate for decades.It is no coincidence that major food and drinks brands from Cadbury to Coca Cola have rushed to sponsor major sporting events.Professor Mike Lean, an expert in human nutrition at Glasgow University, said it was vital that any obesity strategy makes clear that exercise is for health not weight loss.\"It is most important to state clearly that physical activity does not contribute usefully to weight loss, to help people already obese.

But more importantly, the marching doesnrsquot help garner new voters. Will waving a Saltire ever persuade a single Unionist to back Scottish independence Genies donrsquot go back into bottles. The only way for the broader Yes movement to protect itself from this growing online wing is to speak up. If people donrsquot speak up then the metastasising populist fringe risks alienating voters who can be wooed and drowning out the voices of the good, decent, majority of independence supporters.Neil Mackay is Scotlandrsquos Columnist of the Year."},{"url":null,"title":"herald-diary-chocs-away-shop-talk-stakes","story":"SADLY, with chains such as Tesco taking over the corner shop and the introduction of self-service tills, you dont get so many interactions like this, but as a traveller from Aberdeen commented: \"I was in Motherwell, about to get the bus back to Aberdeen.

Now that claim is seemingly dead in the water, the Tories have hit on a new way to boost an economy they seem hell-bent on ruining: raise the state pension age to  and, thanks to the combination of more workers and fewer pensioners, the state will stand to benefit to the tune of poundbn.According to the Centre for Social Justice - a right-wing think-tank chaired by benefits-slasher and one-time Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith - existing policies that will see the state pension age rise from  to  in  and then again to  by  should not only be speeded up, they should be turbo-charged too. Indeed, with the proportion of the population reaching pension age growing far faster than the proportion reaching working - and hence tax-paying - age, the organisation has mooted raising the state pension age to  by  before ramping it up to  just seven years later.At face value it almost seems like a reasonable plan. When the first state pension was introduced over a century ago, it was only ever meant to act as an insurance policy to be cashed in by those unlucky enough to make it into an infirm old age. With just a quarter of the population living long enough to receive it, the cost of providing that version of the pension was relatively small.Due to dramatic increases in le expectancy in the intervening years, though, state pension provision has become a hugely costly business, with the near poundbn the Government pays out to pensioners now expected to balloon to closer to poundbn in little over a decade.As the bill for state pensions is met out of current year taxation, with the taxes paid by todayrsquos workers funding the pensions paid to todayrsquos pensioners, the intergenerational impact of that will be immense raising the pension age is the most obvious way to ameliorate the impact. After all, anything that can reduce the burden on taxpayers while also increasing the pool of workers paying into the system has got to be a good idea, right Well, yes, only there are three glaring problems that show why the plan in its current form should never have seen the light of day. The most obvious issue with forcing swt and dramatic changes to retirement plans is that great swathes of the population are finding it hard enough to work beyond  as it is, never mind keeping on going to  and beyond. Sure, many people are more than capable of continuing to work beyond the official retirement age of , and many do so out of choice. But for those who have spent  years scrubbing floors or laying bricks, fighting fires or digging roads working into later le may not be an option.The state already makes allowances for those in the former group, giving all workers the option to defer taking their state pension infor enhanced payments when they do decide to draw it. Those in the latter group have no such luxury, though, with no systems in place to enable those who cannot keep working to take their pension early at a suitably reduced rate. The implication for them is clear:the pension age is raised further many people will face the stark option of either continuing in a physically demanding job they are physically unfit to do or potentially falling into poverty.The risk of the latter is all too real, with a study from Professor Bernhard Ebbinghaus of the University of Oxford finding that the proportion of over-s living in severe poverty in the UK is already five times what it was in , with our state pension provision largely to blame.The UK is, Professor Ebbinghaus said, ldquoa good example of the Beveridge-lite systems that have historically failed to combat old-age poverty because they ldquohave rather ungenerous basic pensions with means-tested supplements which ldquoreproduce relatively high severe poverty rates among the elderly. Low though the state pension may be, putting it further out of that age-grouprsquos reach is hardly likely to help solve the problem.Then therersquos the question of le expectancy. While it is true that part of the dficulty in accounting for the state pension is that people now typically live for  years or more in retirement, in some parts of the country - and Scotland in particular - that is not the case. And while Scottish males being born today are expected to make it to  and females to , there is no expectation that anyone born between  and  - the first cohort that would be impacted by the mooted pension-age rises - will make it to .That is the crux of why the proposal cannot be allowed to fly. Yes, itrsquos a fallacy that each of us has a pension pot sitting at Westminster with our name on it - and, no, none of us has a right to be supported in retirement by the state - but it would be a cynical government indeed that would expect its citizens to pay the pensions of older generations without any hope of ever getting one of their own. It would be an egregious breach of the social contract and no exaggeration.The Centre for Social Justice has its own spin on the age-rise proposal, with its chief executive Andy Cook saying that by finding ways to help older people stay in work the Government would be doing its bit to improve their health and wellbeing. But as those who want to do that already have the means of doing so, the proposal smacks more of finding ways for a Government staring financial ruin in the face to cut its own costbase.Sure the state pension is expensive, and sure it makes sense to find ways of limiting the extent to which that cost will grow. But doing that in isolation, without also finding ways of growing the pot used to meet that cost, makes no sense at all.Then again, with immigration, that becircte noire of any self-respecting Brexiteer, being the most effective way of increasing the working-age, tax-paying population, is it any wonder the Centre for Social Justice has had to be so extreme "},{"url":null,"title":"letters-need-true-unity-not-vanity-project","story":"Given that we are in a national emergency where normal arrangements do not hold, it is not sufficient to argue, as Mr Corbyn does, that he, on the basis of ldquothe normal constitutional processes, should be interim PM. If he is honest with himself about how he is widely perceived, then he must accept,he genuinely has the nationrsquos interests at heart, that he is not the right person to lead this cross-party coalition.In any case it is desirable that the leader of a government of national unity should not be the leader of any of the main parties, all of whom have particular axes to grind, but should instead be an experienced back-bench parliamentarian who can be impartial, and who has earned and can command the widest possible trust and support in the house. Suggested names of suitable candidates include Kenneth Clarke, Harriet Harman, or Yvette Cooper.If Jeremy Corbyn, in this moment of national crisis, proves to be concerned only with putting personal vanity and party interests first at the expense of sincerely getting this laudable initiative to work, he, and unfortunately his party, will not be forgiven.Robert Bell, Cambuslang.JO Swinson was right to reject the idea of a caretaker government of national unity headed by Jeremy Corbyn. While MPs who oppose a disastrous No Deal Brexit must work together to find a solution, it must be a workable solution, not a fantasy. And a Corbyn-led government is not deliverable ndash it is doubtfulhe could even count on the support of all Labour MPs.The caretaker government option must be pursued, but it must one be headed by a Prime Minister who both commands a majority in the House of Commons and has credibility with EU leaders. The EU must be able to have confidence that the Prime Minister genuinely plans to offer a further referendum, preferably on a deal less damaging to the UK and the EU than that negotiated by Mrs Mayrsquos government. As Mr Corbyn has been all over the place on Brexit, and is still lacking a clear position, he has no credibility whatsoever.The SNPrsquos support for the Corbyn option just delays the dficult work needed to get a credible solution. This increases the risk of the UK crashing out of the EU at the end of October. But maybe that is what the SNP actually wants, despite its repeated protestations to the contrary Alistair Easton, Edinburgh, EH.ALAN Thomsonis concerned that Parliament should respect the will of the  per cent of Scottish voters who in  chose to remain within the UK. He shows no such concern for the will of the  per cent of Scottish voters who in  chose to remain within the EU.After the failure of the independence referendum, the Scottish Government acted with commendable realism and maturity, accepting that the independence cause would have to be relegated to the back burner for the immediate future. It would perhaps still be there, had it not been for the lunacy of Brexit: a move of which the results could never have been anything but bad, and thanks to the well-nigh unbelievable irresponsibility and incompetence with which the process has been conducted are all set to be catastrophic, for the entire UK and most of all for Scotland. If this is not a ldquomaterial change of sufficient magnitude to warrant a re-opening of the independence issue, I canrsquot imagine what would be particularly since a key argument of the No campaign in  was that by remaining in the Union Scotland would safeguard its place in the EU.Mr Thomson imagines that it is ldquodebatable whether Boris Johnson will succeed in re-negotiating a withdrawal agreement. He will not: that is no more debatable than the fact that the sun will rise tomorrow. Either we will crash into the chaos of a no-deal withdrawal on the appropriate date of Hallowersquoen, or we will be subjected to a few more months of ignominious floundering by the Westminster parties and their feuding sub-sections .

As co-founder of the CSJ and architect of the much-derided Universal Credit system, Mr Duncan-Smith regards himself as the Godfather of a Conservative Government that appears eager to gradually dismantle the foundations of our welfare state and wishes to see state intervention being limited to th century standards.As Labour MP Paul Sweeney noted, le expectancy in the UK is now in decline at the same time as the CSJ proposes to increase the pension age.

In my work with Women Against State Pension Inequality , I do meet women who are not computer literate and donit know how to make their voice heard. Waspi supports these women. Many of these women have no option but to continue to work, many when dealing with their own ill health or that of their partner. I regularly hear of women, unable to continue to work, who need to sell their home to have money to live.Currently, we await the outcome of the Judicial Review heard in June . This action was brought by our sister group BacktoSixty. There is another group, FeistyWomen. We all have slightly dferent angles on the outcome we seek but come together to voice the opinion of the unfairness and injustice of this legislation. We have no issue at all with the equalisation of SPA but with the methodology of implementation.There are many myths circulated by government on this issue.

If you see a hedgehog lay still in the open, or with flies round it orit’s struggling to walk properly, it is in urgent need of rescue.”If you find a hedgehog in need of help the society suggest you use gardening gloves or an old towel to collect the animal, placing it inside a high sided cardboard or plastic box with the towel or an old t-shirt in the bottom for it to hide under. Take the box indoors away from flies.If the hedgehog isn’t bleeding, offering a warm wrapped hot water bottle is good first aid, but do make sure there is room for it to get offit gets too warm and ensure the bottle is not allowed to go cold.Offer some meaty cat or dog food and water but don’t force feed it.Once you’ve done that, call a local hedgehog rescue centreyou know of one, or BHPS on    for further advice and local contacts.If it’s a baby, Fay says you should check for siblings.data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.buchanobserver webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Enquiries are ongoing to establish the circumstances that led up to the incident\"  Appeal for information following suspicious fire in Peterhead viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BUCH | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BUCH | Article Teaser\"“Hoglets don’t usually come in ones,” she said. “If a hoglet it is trouble, its brothers and sisters may well need help too, so do look around vicinity for others.” She added: “Acting quickly could literally mean the dference between le and death.

Now we want to reach out to the public and local organisations theand breadth of Scotland to get their feedback.“I would encourage everyone with an interest to consider the new strategy and to join the conversation. “The consultation is available online but we will also be going out to communities across rural, island and urban locations in the next  weeks where it would be great to hear as many views as possible.”data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.ellontimes webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Colin points out a wall during the Bennachie dig.\"  Open day for people to see dig at Bennachie viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"ELLO | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"ELLO | Article Teaser\"The strategy aims to protect our climate as well as meeting the needs of its people and businesses.It’s a fine balancing act but the government believes the strategy will tackle climate change, help the economy prosper and improve our health and well-being. There will also be more accountability with proposals for citizens’  and a delivery board.However, the strategy only provides a broad overview of the direction the government is taking, rather than a detailed action plan.Michael explained: “It sets out the direction we will be travelling in for the next  years, with the clear intention that this will not sit on a shelf gathering dust.“The delivery plan, which will be released when the strategy is finalised, will be updated every year to see how much progress has been made on the objectives.“That plan will contain far more detail on what we, as a government, plan to do to meet our targets.”While the government will, of course, lead the way, every Scot has a part to play in the strategy – particularly when it comes to our climate.Michael said: “Scotland has the most ambitious targets for tackling climate change in the world.“The Climate Change Bill, currently before the Scottish Parliament, includes an increased ambition to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, with a net-zero emissions target by .“Transport is currently the largest contributor to Scottish emissions.“This will be tackled through a range of actions including an ambition to phase out the need for new petrol and diesel cars and vans by .“We will promote and design our transport system so that walking, cycling, public and shared transport are promoted ahead of private car use.“However, we also need to help people make the transition to lower carbon travel – to walk or cycle for short journeys,they are able to, or use public transport ahead of single driver car journeys.“That will not only help to reduce car emissions, which are currently responsible for the most greenhouse gas emissions, but will also help people become more active, improving their health and well-being.“There is no doubt in my mind that our climate is changing. The Beast from the East ably proved that.“It cost the UK economy at least £ billion per day as gridlocked roads and no trains or buses meant many workers were unable to get into work.“We are experiencing more severe winter weather, coupled with summers which are hotter and wetter.“That should serve as a real wake up call to us all that we need to change our behaviours now.“Government has a major part to play but we each also have a personal, inidual responsibility to take action to ensure we minimise the impact that we’re having on the environment.“We have to get this right for future generations, given the impact it could have on their lives.”Michael admits that it may be a struggle to wean people away from their cars.For the car remains the dominant mode of transport in Scotland. In ,  per cent of all journeys were made either as drivers or passengers in a car or a van. This was up from  per cent in  and  per cent in .The proportion of single occupancy car trips also shows an increasing trend. The figure of  per cent in  compares with  per cent in  and  per cent in .But with  per cent of Scotland’s greenhouse gas emissions caused by transport, and cars being responsible for the lion’s share, our love affair with the car has to change.It’s for that reason the Scottish Government is moving fast to rid our streets of petrol and diesel cars.The move to electric cars by  – the most ambitious target in the UK – should help meet the emissions target.It has also recently introduced low emission zones in Glasgow city centre, with Edinburgh, Dundee and Aberdeen set to follow.However, with bus trips also in decline, the government has a major job to do in persuading people to change their habits.Michael said: “We need to encourage people to make greater use of public transport.“That, in turn, will help reduce congestion in our cities and towns – as well as reducing emssions.“A double decker bus can take up to  passengers while occupying little more road space than a single car.“Bus use generally has been in decline since the s for a number of reasons, one being longer journey times caused by congestion on the network.“If we can tackle that, people will be more inclined to travel by bus once again.”Technology, both existing and yet to be dreamed up, will also have a role to play.Michael added: “The rail electrication project proves what we can do – we need to be ready and able to introduce new technologies.“However, what people want today and in  years is the same– linking people and places in ways that are reliable, affordable and safe.“Our strategy will be a catalyst for change. “By focusing on our priorities and delivering the outcomes, Scotland will have a transport system that demonstrates to the world that it is open for business.”The strategy opened for public consultation on Wednesday, July , and will close on Wednesday, October .The consultation team will be going out to train and bus stations across the country in the coming weeks to guage public opinion.Members of the public are also being encouraged to have their say online.Visit consult.gov.scot transport-scotland national-transport-strategy to have your say.

Please feel free to contact us with any questions by phoning  ,# said those involved.A spokesperson for the project went on to say: “A huge thanks to all the landowners who have helped us by agreeing the essential land access we need to get started.

They will be checked regularly by the project staff.The Orkney Native Wildle Project is a partnership between Orkney Islands Council, Scottish Natural Heritageand RSPB Scotland. Following three years of development generous support for the project has been provided by, the Heritage Lottery Fund and EU Le, providing a combined grant of £. million for the duration of the five-year project.Stoats are native to the UK Mainland but not to Orkney, where they were first recorded in . Since then the population has increased rapidly and is now fully established and widely-distributed throughout Mainland Orkney, Burray and South Ronaldsay.

It is customary, indeed a pre-requisite, that before great battles commence there is no limit to intentionally circulating misinformation of what one force or another intends to do.Deception can take the shape of an error not meant to break the surface. One such was Operation Mincemeat, where before the invasion of Sicily both Churchill and Eisenhower approved the use of a dead London tramp’s body to play the role of a Royal Marine carrying sensitive documents that were of course . Washed up on the Spanish shore the secrets carried by “The Man who never was” had the effect of directing Axis troop deployments to Greece and Sardinia but crucially not Sicily. That Ian Fleming, the creator of James Bond but back then working for naval military intelligence, had a hand in the ruse has since given the escapade its own notoriety.Alternatively intentionally revealing plans that apparently cannot be hidden but are in reality feints on a grand scale to throw opponents off might be deployed. One such example was Operation Fortitude’s phantom armiesdesigned to convince Nazi Germany’s High Command that the Normandy landings were themselves only a ersionary tactic. These deceptions are not just deployed during war but happen regularly in commerce, such as announcing the end of a particular brand or recipe for a brand so that the kickback from distressed loyal customers creates a higher media profile that raises sales. The proposed changes are then withdrawn in response to “customer demand” and all is well with the world.• : Corbyn can’t be national unity PM, he can barely keep Labour together – Christine JardineThroughout le we are met with deceptions that are meant to distract us from a larger event or simply manage our expectations. It is the stuff of pulp fiction in romance, crime thrillers and political tussles. That it should happen now during the preparations of the UK’s expected exit from the European Union should be a surprise to no one – but many shall be fooled.Will there be some disruption brought about by the changes known and unknown  Of course, just as there was when decimalisation changed the way we counted our money and weighed our goods – or when we entered the European Economic Community. There were some who sought to exploit each change for their own benefit by raising prices under the guise of greater costs or changes in supply. So we can expect some disruption and we can expect some among us to seek to take advantage from it, be it commercial or political – but their motives in most cases will be blindingly obvious.So this past week we have had much manufactured fog descend upon us to confuse us and deceive us as Brexit approaches. Some authors of this  fog wish to create fake news to scare a nervous public into the remainer camp. Some, such as the incredulous worst case scenario “Yellowhammer” report that appeared in the Sunday papers has all the look of an attempt to manage expectations by exaggerating what impact “No Deal” will have. There is no need for a hard border between Ireland and the UK. Thanks to the use of existing customs practice we will have no need of it, the Irish have said they will not erect one – so it will be for the EU to impose one. Let us see who’s been lying to the public, fomenting ision and heightening tension. As I have said in this column before, Keep Calm and Carry On, Brexit is coming deal or no deal.• : Brexit: Boris Johnson to tell Angela Merkel and Emmanuel Macron that there must be a new dealAs examples of the fog of war go, any talk of a government of “national unity” is a real pea-souper. How could it be unying  It would seek to stop the Prime Minister respecting the outcomeof the greatest democratic event in our history. It would mean a cabinet composed entirely of remain-supporting MPs, for how could any leave support in all conscience be part of it  It would mean government by parliament rather than an executive scrutinised and held to account by parliament – so who would scrutinise and hold parliament to account The majority of the British people would have their wish torpedoed by politicians, the vast majority of whom were elected promising to honour the referendum and deliver Brexit. There would be no national unity, there would be greater ision than we even know today with democracy tossed on a bonfire of broken promises and political self-interest. Any election that followed would no longer be about parties or even policies but about the new ide of the people versus parliament. A government of National Unity is so oxymoronic as to be decidedly and repulsively Orwellian.Jeremy Corbyn tried to take advantage of this political disarray in Westminster by offering himself up as the potential caretaker prime minister but so transparent was this tactic that it dissolved on launch. Maybe one day it will be made into a film entitled “The prime minister who never was”. The illiberal undemocratic leader Jo Swinson offered up Labour’s Harriet Harman and Conservative Ken Clarke as alternatives – and they obliged by preening themselves before the media­ – but they too are being met with derision. Clarke might at least attract some of the necessary Conservative support – but really  His role as former Deputy-Chairman of British American Tobacco led George Monbiot to argue he was unfit for office  The Chancellor who wanted to increase VAT on fuel, but when defeated raised the tax on whisky – and the health minister with a record of abusing workers rights second to none. Would Labour and nationalist MPs swallow that Clarke’s proposed anointment did cause me to wonder , having backed anyone but Boris for the premiership, Ruth Davidson would give her full backing to Clarke rather than face “No Deal”  Is she with Boris – or cuddling up to Ken Most bizarrely the Green MP Caroline Lucas, following a spasm of misandry, suggested only an all women Cabinet could prevent Brexit.All of this assumes a no-confidence motion in the new prime minister winning the day – which is by no means certain.There shall be much more of this fog to come before it clears and we can see what was truth and what was fake.

Striker Joe Casey, who had tumbled a couple of times in the box and seen play waved on, went to ground again and this time, after consulting the linesman, referee Robbie Summers awarded a penalty.

The oil and gas industry has been vital for jobs in Shetland, but we owe it to the workforce to give them a future in alternative zero-carbon industries by starting that transition now.#That means the Scottish and UK governments must stop subsidies for new oil and gas expansion and instead redirect it towards protecting our future. The SNP and Liberal Democrats are yet to realise this, but time is short.#Where o where is the proof of MANMADE climate change, This is not made up, it is not a conspiracy and The Greens do have common sense.

The money SIC receives to run these services has historically been determined by the local government distribution formula # this was the case when the Lib Dems were in office. For each of the last two years the SNP has provided an extra £m of funding for internal services.“The Scottish Government is also committed to implementing an RET-equivalent that includes cabin costs on the Aberdeen route but we have been prevented from doing so by the Pentland Ferries complaint.“Baseless accusations that the SNP has held Shetland to ransom are part and parcel of the Lib Dems negative narrative that only holds us back.

No two bottles are the same due to the processes involved, but the minor flaws are what add to their charm. “Historically stone bottles were gradually replaced by mass produced glass bottles, the result of which is that many of these were buried in landfill sites or dumped in rivers and canals and can be dficult to locate.”Neil added: “I’ve always had a big interest in local social history, these stoneware bottles are part of it. I have been working hard in documenting the past so that it can be preserved for future generations. “I have amassed a collection of local items, everything from clocks to water pumps, but there are a few items that I have struggled to find. I am keen to locate any stoneware bottles from Banbridge and anything relating to the Dunbar McMaster spinning mill in Gilford.”He said: “I was born in Gilford into one of the mill workers houses owned by the Dunbar McMaster company and my family were historically mill workers there. I have a fantastic photo of my grandmother working in the mill taken during the Coronation in . I am seeking anything relating to the mill and its history such as receipts, packaging or advertising or even furniture.”Neil commented: “I am part of a local history group, who meet regularly to discuss past events and places and we regularly showcase items so that they can be shared by all.“I would really love to put on an exhibition in Banbridge and that’s probably where this is going.”Open Day raises over £, Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Sadly Neil’s we Kate doesn’t share his enthusiasm for artefacts from the past: “She thinks it’s a load of junk, she’s a minimalist.”If you can help Neil add to his collection email him at neilreid@gmail"},{"url":null,"title":"revealed the 20 ni sights on lonely planet s ultimate uk travel guide","story":"The Giant#s Causeway has been ranked as the UK#s third best tourist destination by respected travel guide Lonely Planet, finishing ahead of attractions such as Hadrian#s Wall and London#s Tate Modern art gallery.For the first time Lonely Planet has picked its  most unmissable experiences and hidden gems across Great Britain, Northern Ireland and the Channel Islands to form its ultimate UK travel hitlist.Titanic Belfast was also ranked in the top  UK destinations by Lonely PlanetIn total,  sights and experiences in Northern Ireland feature in the list which was unveiled today, including the Crown Liquor Saloon in Belfast, Rathlin Island and Londonderry’s walls.Out of the score of attractions only one is in Co Armagh , while none of the sights in Co Tyrone feature in the Lonely Planet must see list.Welcoming the news, Niall Gibbons, CEO of Tourism Ireland, said: “The inclusion of  Northern Ireland experiences and attractions – including the Giant’s Causeway at number three – in Lonely Planet’s ‘Ultimate UK Travelist’ is good news and will surely help to inspire GB travellers to put Northern Ireland on their holiday wish-list. “It is another well-deserved accolade for all of these attractions, which provides Tourism Ireland with a great hook to continue to promote Northern Ireland as a ‘must visit’ destination.”Lonely Planet’s VP of Experience, Tom Hall, said: “Lonely Planet’s Ultimate United Kingdom Travelist brings together the UK’s most compelling sights and experiences, ranging from world-class museums and giant cathedrals to rollicking festivals, inky lochs and tiny pubs. “We’re thrilled to name the Giant’s Causeway one of the UK’s very best sights - alongside many other wonderful experiences in Northern Ireland including spotting puffins and seals on Rathlin Island and riding a boat through Co Fermanagh’s Marble Arch Caves.”Giant’s Causeway is described by Lonely Planet as “timeless” and “unrepeatable” and is beaten only by the Edinburgh Festival Fringe and London’s British Museum.The Ultimate UK Travelist is available at a cost of £..

mcauleys mum speaks on his","story":"THE mother of -year-old Gerald McAuley who was shot dead by a loyalist gunman in August  says she has never felt any hatred towards the man who took her son’s le. While helping families move out of the burned streets of Clonard, Gerald, a member of the Fianna youth, was shot dead by on Waterville Street, not far from his Colinward Street family home. During the Scarman tribunal, an acting superior of Clonard Monastery spoke of how he had given Gerald and three others hit by shotgun blasts the last rites. Gerald was taken to the Royal Victoria Hospital where he was pronounced dead at .pm. The tribunal concluded he had been shot by a Protestant gunman. Speaking to the Andersonstown News Gerald’s -year-old mother Nellie spoke of how her second oldest child was born on the Feast of St Gerard and how much he loved fishing, birds, motor racing and bikes. “I remember when Gerald left school, he went to St Thomas’, he got himself a job in a factory in Northumberland Street. I remember he was working in it around three weeks and he came home and said ‘Mummy, the boss wants to see you.’ The first thing I asked was ‘What have you done ’ I went down and the man praised Gerald, how much of a good, clean worker he was and told me how much he had in common with his own sons. He told me how he wanted Gerald to go to the Tech come September but that Gerald had told him how he wanted to join the Irish Merchant Navy when he came of age. I saidthat’s his wish I can’t hold him back.”Nellie spoke of how on August   she had gone out to look for Gerald as he hadn’t come home.Telling how fraught the roads around Kashmir, Falls and Albert Street had become as violence flared around her and her son Jim as they looked for Gerald. “I remember Gerald came in around am that night and went to bed. I got up the next morning to go to work, I worked in C#A as a cleaner and I turned on the news. It was saying about Patrick Rooney, Trooper McCabe and the fella, the bus driver from Ardoyne who had been killed. I came home later that day and Gerald was in the house with his friend. I said to him ‘Waren’t you in work ’ He said ‘Mummy, there is no work, it’s gone, it’s away.’ He went straight out again and that was the last I saw him.”Nellie said she went out to look for Gerald as trouble continued to flare and found herself at the City Hospital. “I remember the Sister on the ward brought me into the office and I said to her that I was looking for my son. She went out and came back and I will always remember how she said ‘No mother, he’s not here, there’s only a boy of around  in Musgrave.’ I said that’s him, that’s Gerald. “Gerald was a big lad, he had it in the shoulders, he had a big frame and he wore a size  shoe. I remember later a priest being on the other side of the street from our house, he was wearing a heavily beaded vest, a beret and a stick and said ‘Mrs McAuley your son has gone to Heaven,’ then he turned on his heel and walked away.”Following Gerald’s death Nellie recalled her feelings: “You’re here and you’re not here. About six weeks after Gerard was buried we were invited up to the old Felons at the side of the cemetery and that night they had a colour party come on the stage and said that night that Gerard was in the Fianna from  years old. Looking back on it Gerald asked me could he go away for a week with the boys out of school. I remember he said he needed five shillings and could I give it to him. He said he needed an enamel plate, cup, mug and even then the penny didn’t drop. I brought him down to Millets and we got the plate, everything. The fella in the shop said he would need a wee container to carry his eggs in and we got that as well. Soon after he came in to say ‘Mummy I’m awful sorry some of the boys couldn’t get their money and couldn’t go.’ I don’t know how long after that then he did go.”  years on from the anniversary of Gerald’s death on Thursday, Nellie reflected how she “wasn’t ing right” half a century ago.” “I never had any hatred. Gerald died on the Feast of the Assumption, August , that’s Her day, he was taken on Her day and that’s the way I looked at it.” A wreath-laying ceremony for Gerald McAuley will take on Friday, August  at .pm in Bombay Street Memorial Garden.

Fans will be treated to singles Feel the Raindrops, Your Greatest Shade of Blue and s classic Broken Land – the ‘most played song on Radio ’ during that particular year. With just over two weeks to go until they tak the stage, songwriter Pat Gribben told the Andersonstown News that he along with the rest of the band are “looking forward” to the August  gig. “Of course it’s always nice to be asked,” said Pat, “I’m looking forward to catching up with Brian Kennedy. I played guitar with Brian and haven’t seen him since his illness and now that he is cancer free, it will be good to see him.”On composing one of the most iconic songs of the s, Broken Land, Pat explained how he had been “messing about” on producer Garry Bell’s keyboards. “I got my daughter to school that Monday morning and the main part of the song was done that day,” he said.Still heavily rotated on airwaves  plus years later, Pat said there are lots of songs written that could appear on a new Adventures album. “I think we are playing better now than back in the day, I don’t know why, maybe we are all more experienced. I’d like to put a new album out and give the people that come to see, that are coming to see us, that new work, new material to sing along to.”Pat spoke of how the band are already looking to  with a series of gigs already lined up. “I have a lot of material and it’s a matter of putting it all down and getting it out there.

From  stylish bedrooms, a stunning bar with an extensive drinks and cocktails menu and even an eye-catching garden and bridal suite, the Lansdowne has it all.As for grub, the Lansdowne caters for diners from AM to PM and a recent Thursday lunchtime visit for myself and two colleagues offered us the chance to sample some dishes from their lunch menu.The menu is made up of light bites, small plates and main plates so your choice depends on just how hungry you are and how much time you have. We were greeted and shown to our table by their new yet welcoming staff and joined for lunch on this occasion by co-owner Jim McLaughlin who took little time in doing the work for us by selecting some of his favourite and most popular dishes from across the lunch menu. Jim’s background is in food, so we had no hesitation he would deliver the right goods to the table.It wasn’t long before our huge selection of grub arrived in front of us and left us with the question, where to begin We were served three main plates – the larger courses on the Lansdowne lunch menu. First up was the simple yet classic Chicken Caesar salad – a generous portion of sliced chargrilled chicken mixed in with maple-cured bacon lardons, baby gem lettuce, garlic focaccia croutons and lashed with parmesan shavings drizzled in Caesar dressing. Often known as the not so healthy salad option for dieters, it would have been rude not to try this classic and spoonful after spoonful, the smorgasbord of flavours really came out. The next main plate was the duck confit, served on a bed of sweet potato mash, green beans with a dash of herb butter and red wine jus. For me, it was quite the standout dish and as a duck lover, it hit all the right spots from the crispiness on the outside to the easily torn-off meat on the inside, all brought to le by the sweet potato mash and red wine jus.The last of the main plates was my colleague’s definition of heaven – a huge pot of steamed mussels in garlic and white wine cream and served with rosemary and red onion focaccia bread. A massive lover of all things fish, the silence at the table was noticeable as she made her way through the portion, which, priced at just £, could easily be shared amongst two.Also served up on this lunchtime occasion was a selection of small plates which are proving the most popular choice od customers, according to Jim. Small plates are exactly what they say on the tin and take a form similar to Spanish tapas, meaning they are ideal to share. Customers can choose  for £,  for £ or  for £ so whether you want a nibble over a drink or simply can’t choose and need to try a few, the world is your oyster at the Lansdowne.For me, the stand-out small plate was the crispy pork belly with a layer of caramel apple sauce. Pork belly is one of my favourite things and, having previously worked in a Chinese restaurant, I am all too familiar with it and this did not disappoint.Another triumph was the firecracker chicken wings, served with a blue cheese dip. The wings were a perfect combination of a fiery wsoon overtaken by the wonderful dip – I would highly recommend.The brie also deserves a paragraph to itself because it was simply mouth-watering. A crispy shell was soon followed by the delicious melted delight that is brie but the dish was really taken to the next level by the homemade blackcurrant gel and it is not dficult to see why it is the most popular side dish order, according to Jim.Also served to us on small plates was the crispy beef: large chunks of beef brisket which were cooked to perfection and beautully seasoned with pickled carrot and a tastebud tingling Asian dressing which ensured the beef inside the crispiness was moist and melting.The deep fried salt and chilli squid was equally as good and something I also adore – well, anything salt and chilli really. The squid was fresh, fried expertly and served with a napa salad, harissa mayo, coriander and sesame seeds, it would put some Chinese restaurants’ attempt at the dish to shame.The small plates were a huge success on our visit and enjoyed in the impressive surroundings of the stylish bar, for me it was exactly how ‘bar food’ should be – in fact, it was on another level. I cannot wait to try some of the other small plates which include spicy Italian meatballs, crab bruscietta and sweet potato bhajis. The main plates were mighty fine too and maybe with a cocktail or two the next time. I am already looking forward to planning my next lunchtime visit to the Antrim Road’s famous stalwart.

has rejected the findings of a poll which revealed that almost three out of five voters in Northern Ireland would prefer a border down the Irish Sea to a hard Brexit.Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said the idea that more people here would rather remain closely aligned with the EU than the UK is in no way reflective of the community he represents.The survey carried out by Belfast-based polling and market research company LucidTalk asked people how they would vote in a referendum proposing that Northern Irelandremained aligned to the European Union, \"perhaps staying in the single market and the customs union\".Read MoreDire Brexit warnings of no-deal listed in leaked document dismissed by DUPAlex Kane: Boris Johnson could be tempted by Brexit backstop only for Northern IrelandCorbyn: Brexit

the response, unionist voters were largely opposed to the prospect of breaking away from the United Kingdom in favour of the EU, with some % of Democratic Unionists and % of Ulster Unionists rejecting the idea.However, Sir Jeffrey questioned the level of support for staying aligned with the EU indicated by the LucidTalk poll, saying it contrasts with the views of his constituents in Lagan Valley.\"These polls by LucidTalk I dont think accurately reflect opinion,\" he told the Belfast .\"Their polling methods are not reflective of the wider community, especially on the unionist side.\"In contrast to the  of people that they poll, the people that I talk to in my own constituency do not share that view at all. data-dfpadtargetingSir Jeffrey Donaldson\"A clear majority of them would not support Northern Ireland being separated from the UK.\"As the UK hurtles towards its exit from the European Union, which Prime Minister Boris Johnson has repeatedly said will go ahead with or without a deal on October , experts have warned that at least , jobs could be at risk in Northern Irelandan agreement is not reached.Sir Jeffrey said the survey has no bearing on his partys position of opposing the backstop and protecting links with the United Kingdom. data-dfpadtargetingMartina Anderson\"We believe that it is not in Northern Irelands best interests, economically or in any other way, to be torn away from Great Britain,\" he continued.He said the UK is one of the largest economies in the world.\"We export far more goods to Great Britain than we do to the rest of the world, including the EU combined, so I dont think it is a credible or rational approach that we should create barriers between ourselves and what is by far our biggest market.\" However, nationalist politicians said the poll is an accurate reflection of public opinion in Northern Ireland and comes as no surprise.An overwhelming number of nationalists opted for closer alignment with the EU, with % of Sinn Fein and SDLP voters who responded to the poll backing the Northern Ireland only backstop.Sinn Fein MEP Martina Anderson said the survey reinforces her view that more people would prefer a united Ireland as a means to staying within the EU than a potentially catastrophic crash-out.\"Opinion poll after opinion poll has shown that the majority are in support of a pathway back into the EU,\" she said.\"I think we need to acknowledge that the vast majority of people in the north voted against Brexit.\"If faced with the choice, they would prefer an enhanced border in the Irish Sea.\"Ms Anderson added: \"If unionists are surprised, they dont have their finger on the pulse of the people that they represent,\" she said.\"The majority of the people quite clearly dont want to see a hardened border.\"Also responding to the survey, SDLP Brexit spokesperson Daniel McCrossan said his only surprise is that the number of people who favour a border in the Irish Sea over a potential hard Brexit is not higher.\"Brexit has been an absolute calamity which looks about to end in a disastrous no-deal,\" the West Tyrone MLA said.\"This will be bad for business, trade and commerce.\"It will especially hit people hard along the border.\"A united Ireland has become a reality for many now and not just an aspiration.\"It should be no surprise to anyone that a further majority wants to avoid a hard border on this island that would interrupt integrated supply chains, damage our economy and bring hardship to border communities.\"Its sadly also no surprise that the DUP continues to ignore the wishes of most people.\"The Tory-DUP Government at Westminster has no mandate for a no-deal exit.\"The majority of middle ground voters also supported the compromise, with % of Alliance voters and % Green Party voters backing the proposition."},{"url":null,"title":"backlash as linfield consider ditching no sunday games rule","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER

But Linfield chiefs feel that -they reach the group stages of the Europa League - their team will need an extra day to recover from their Thursday night fixture before playing again.Hence the proposal to move Saturday games to Sundays, despite the long-standing Never On A Sunday rule in its constitution.Mr McGivern said: \"To reach the group stages would be huge for the club and many things need to be taken into consideration.\"We will have extra games - and that will have an impact in terms of scheduling our league matches.\"We cant play home games at Windsor Park on a Sunday because of a club rule. \"Will we have to change that  Probably, but our members will decide that.\"Linfield can play away on a Sunday but there must be a rule change for a home fixture.\"We will be a few games behind other sides and thats the price for being successful in Europe.\"The whole image of the club will be lted and theres obvious financial benefits.\"However, possible change to the clubs constitution has been criticised by North Antrim MLA Mr Allister. \"I think it will be a retrograde step,\" Mr Allister said.\"Theyve had that rule for a very long time. \"To use the exigency of this present situation as an excuse for changing it permanently I think would be inappropriate - and out of keeping with the culture and tradition of Irish League football.\"The ban on Sunday football matches was lted by the Irish Football Association only in , despite protests from the DUP and evangelical campaigners, including the Free Presbyterian Church.The first match held on a Sunday since the ban was lted was an Irish Premiership match between Glentoran and Bangor at The Oval in Belfast.See back page for full story"},{"url":null,"title":"bombay streets burning by loyalists 50 years ago remembered in","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Ryanair is also seeking a High Court injunction tomorrow to stop strike action by its UK-based pilots on August - and September -.Ryanair did not respond to a request for comment when asked when it would begin cancelling flights. Company sources promised \"robust contingency\" planning should the strikes go ahead so a minimal amount of flights would be cancelled.The airline is seeking an order against Forsa, the parent union of the Irish Airline Pilots Association. Ryanair argued in the High Court that balloted strike action by some of their pilots was unlawful. Forsa is contesting the airlines application for an injunction.Justice Denis McDonald began hearing arguments yesterday from Ryanairs legal representative Martin Hayden.The airline claimed strike action would be in breach of an agreement both parties signed up to in the summer last year.The airline also argues Forsas ballot and subsequent notice of strike action was unlawful, and that the  agreement is a \"binding conclusion\" and \"over-arching\".Mr Hayden told the court Forsa has not actually quantied what it is claiming and Ryanair, although \"not indisposed to making an offer\", is prevented from doing so in the absence of such a request. \"To make a counter offer you need to have something to counter,\" he said.Justice McDonald disagreed with this assertion, arguing that this is not backed by mediator Kieran Mulvey in his report, but Ryanairs understanding of his report.\"Im not asking for your understanding, Im not seeing anything from Mr Mulvey saying Ryanair cannot make a counter proposal without further information from Forsa,\" Justice McDonald said.Mr Hayden said the \"damaging strikes\" would not only affect Ryanair as a company, but many customers. \"If I could say this, this is ultimately a pay request... that the go-to moment is a strike, its a disproportionate response,\" he said.The hearing will resume this morning, but a judgment is not expected until tomorrow."},{"url":null,"title":"blackout report blames extremely rare and unexpected lightning strike","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

I make a reference to my go-to sound engineer  Gerry Craig  being a past pupil and so continues a ream of well-known characters in the local and national music scene who are former students of MAPA including  Roe, Ports, Soak, Touts, Balkan Alien Sound, Cherym, Sugarwolf, New Pagans  and  Foreign Owl. Grainne  continues that “once past levels  and  there are pathways for students to continue performing or to get into the technological side of the arts after which students do a HNC or HND which they can then top up to full honours degree at Leeds Beckett, Leeds College of Music or Paisley. A bit like in a video game. Or le. Performing Arts works similarly in the running order which covers all aspects of performance, production, writing and stage management,  Jamie  from Waterside Theatre and  Chloe  in the Playhouse are past pupils as well as  Damien McGinty  from  Glee  and  Jamie-Lee O’Donnell  from  Derry Girls. Just to reassure the parents out there who are probably freaking out a bit about their children opting not to go to Queens or Trinity to study law that graduates have followed a erse range of career paths including Performing Musicians, Performing Singers and Actors, Studio and Live Sound Engineers, Theatre Technicians, Stage Managers, Music Managers, Acousticians, Record Label Marketing, Music Educators and Music Therapists. And to prove it, as part of the course recent guest lecturers have included  Eoin O’Callaghan  ,  Phil Nelson  ,  Tony Perrey and  Gareth Stewart  . As part of the course students have visited SSE Arena, Belfast , London West End Theatre, Output Music Conference, Belfast and have partaken in student collaboration weeks in Kokkola , Talinnand Glasgow.  Rory  and  Grainne  then tell me about the end of year show which is a collaborative effort between the departments to re-imagine popular films, last year it was “Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels” and included a pit orchestra and utilised the equipment available to students to reproduce scenes they couldn’t perform live on camera. That sounds magic to me. The department maintains links with festivals which offer performance production opportunities including Stendhal and Celtronic. Students also participate annually in BBC introducingas well as ious shows and gigs throughout the year in venues around town culminating in the MAPA showcase which includes live performances of both music and dance as well as recorded pieces. “The space is versatile and state of the art”  Grainne  tells me “the theatre can adapt to accommodate band, theatre and dance performances, there are sound-proofed practice rooms, two recording studios and three computer suites of Mac computers with up-to-date software” which conjures up the image of the perfect environment to satisfy the most creative of minds out there.

They also claimed that the deceased Creggan man suffered further injuries as he fell to the ground on a laneway outside St Marys Church in the estate.However, Seamus Bradleys family repeatedly maintained that he died later having been taken away from the scene in an army saracen and sustained fatal injuries whilst being subjected to torture during interrogation.The Coroner, Judge Patrick Kinney, however ruled out both versions of the events at Laganside Court in Belfast last Thursday . The judge said he was satisfied that Seamus Bradley was killed by a soldier who got out of a Saracen, fell to one knee and opened fire, but added that he had been unable to identy the soldier responsible for the shooting.“He was running across an open area of ground, he had no weapon and he was clearly visible,” Mr Kinney said.The Coroner also concluded that the deceased man could not have reasonably been percieved as posing a threat of death or serious injury to the soldiers in the Army vehicle nor to anyone  and that the use of force by the soldier was “entirely disproportionate to any threat that could have been perceived.”Furthermore, Mr Kinney said, there was no first aid or medical assistance provided by the soldiers, butit had been there was a “reasonable prospect” that Seamus Bradley would have survived. The judge also concluded the victim was not mistreated by British Army personnel in the Saracen either by physical assault, torture or shooting.Seamus Bradleys brother Danny who has pursued the case for decades told the Derry News: “First of all I would like to make a statement referring to my brothers first inquest in . The prosecution showed a black and white picture to the jury and then turned to my father and called him a liar and said your son was not tortured.“This same man was aware that there were coloured pictures showing that Seamus neck was badly marked and which the black and white images failed to show.“Seamus was stripped naked and badly beaten about the face and shot three times at close range. At the original inquest one soldier claimed that Seamus fell out of the Saracen onto his face, but the army medical officer said that never happened.“Sadly, the police at the time did not show the Bradley family any of the pictures and it took to  for the police to show nine black and white pictures. Then in  the Coroners office showed us  coloured pictures. It can be safely be said that both the black and white and coloured pictures went missing to save the security forces embarrassment.”Danny Bradley also told the Derry News: “I have mixed emotions but I achieved what I set out to do. That was to clear Seamus name and thats what matters. Its not about me.”“I also intend to send the Inquest report to the Irish Government as well as the independent ballistics report because this was a war crime. My brother was a soldier, a volunteer in the Provisional IRA. His papers were logged under war file by the British Government and they have broken the Geneva Convention becuase they had declared war on the IRA.“By doing so they must take responsibility for and due care of their prisoners and I will be asking for a proper investigation-something which the state failed to deliver in .”In  the former Historical Enquiries Team in their examination of the Bradley case concluded that the British Army,they were telling the truth, had acted lawfully with respect to his killing, but added that the death had never been “effectively investigated.”Sinn Féin MLA Raymond McCartney Justice Spokesman welcomed the Coroners Court decision and said: “The Bradley family have been campaigning for the truth about what happened to Seamus for many years. All families bereaved by the conflict are entitled to access to the truth about the deaths of their loved ones.“We need to see the British Government implementing the legacy mechanisms agreed at Stormont House so that families and campaigners can get access to the truth.”googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshCAPTION: -year-old IRA volunteer Seamus Bradley."},{"url":null,"title":"northern ireland society dealt decade anniversaries commemorations","story":"This week’s th anniversary commemoration of the Battle of the Bogside comes in the midst of a decade of anniversaries of many of the seminal events in recent Irish history. Half-a-century on, this week has also seen contention and disturbances surrounding the Apprentice Boys of Derry annual parade in Derry-the very same demonstration that was the focal point for the beginning of serious violence exactly  years ago.But, whilst the events of August  in Derry without doubt played a pivotal role in shaping the following decades, in a wider context it was just one episode amongst many more fraught historical events of the last  years.The decade between - was undoubtedly one of the most consistently eventful in Ireland throughout the twentieth century.Within those ten years the country went through the campaign for Home Rule, World War One, the Easter Rising, the Irish War of Independence, partition, the Irish Civil War and the foundation of the Irish Free State and Northern Ireland. Added to that were campaigns for social change exemplied by the  Lockout and the suffrage movement.In combined effect, each of these hugely momentous events left no strata of Irish society untouched or unscathed by the violence that emanated from them. And, the historical shockwaves of some of these events, most particularly partition, also shaped future events in Northern Ireland that literally exploded onto the streets in the late s.In the Republic of Ireland concerted efforts have been made in recent years to make this decade of centenaries more inclusive and tolerant and respectful. The civic remembrance of those Irish men who fought and died on the British side in WWI has grown for example and the previously unthinkable visit to Dublin by an English monarch has taken place.Republican leaders once sworn to end Queen Elizabeth II’s reign in Northern Ireland by any means necessary have greeted her with handshakes and smiles. Uncomfortable conversations around these events have also taken place.In the North, still three years away from the conclusion of this decade of th anniversaries, there is the looming prospect of how the creation of Northern Ireland will be dealt with by nationalists and republicans.The outward signs at least are of course currently not good, encapsulated as they are by the ongoing absence of Stormont. Overlapping it all is the fact that in the North the events of  years ago are beginning to come full circle into the realm of major time passed milestones.So, half-a-century after the Civil Rights movement rocked the foundations of the Northern state to their core, how have we dealt to date with the commemoration of seminal historical events north of the border Professor Peter Shirlow is Director at the Institute of Irish Studies at University of Liverpool and was formerly Deputy Director of the Institute of Conflict Transformation and Social Justice at Queen’s University. He has undertaken conflict transformation work in Northern Ireland and has used his knowledge to work with former combatants and non-governmental organisations in Yugoslavia, Moldova, Bahrain and Iraq.“I think we have dealt with these issues in ways that have shown a lot of maturity, especially when it came to commemorating .“There was a lot of stretching beyond previously comfortable positions and remembering for example the children and the Royal Irish Constabulary who were killed and a realisation that conflict is just not about the commemoration of those who were on ‘your’ side. We are also beginning to look at women in this period who were made invisible.“There are many ways in which to understand what happened and they are a lot more erse than we have been told, but we haven’t yet built this into ways of how to deal with our past,” Peter Shirlow said.The insistence within each community that their version of the stories of the past are the ‘righteous’ versions has been at the root of inter-communal stre even decades after actual conflict has ceased. Heroic versions of the past are something that Peter Shirlow says that as a society we need to look beyond. He added that his research has indicated that Northern Ireland’s dferent cultures are not necessarily converging on that issue as yet.Professor Shirlow is also the Independent Chair of the Office of the First and Deputy First Minister Employers’ Guidance on Recruiting People with Conflict Related Convictions working Group.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshHe told the Derry News: “I have found a very strong sense in the Protestant Unionist Loyalistcommunity that the conflict is finished and there’s a need to move on. They don’t want to engage because there’s a sense it’s in the past, that it’s over.“More people in the PUL community seem to have drawn a line under it-that it was  years ago, so there’s a reluctance to engage. A lot of loyalist prisoners came out and went back to work and don’t appear to have the same fascination with the Troubles.“The republican view of that is they believe loyalists do not want to engage because they are ashamed. It’s not a practical or a sensible view.“I’ve done a lot of research within Protestant working-class communities and there’s some acknowledgement of history, some reverence for Edward Carson and a degree of asking where we are going, but not a lot of interest in looking back at what happened during the Troubles.”The academic also said that he senses with the nationalist and republican community a need that their narrative of events “must be proven right.”So, the Derry News asked Peter Shirlow about how things will pan out when the centenary of the creation of Northern Ireland arrives It’s an issue he believes which still very much reverberates within the political sphere today.“The issue of partition is part of the inter-party talks at the minute. We will have to decide whether Northern Ireland is a ‘good place’ or a ‘bad place’.“We tend not to concentrate on what we have done well. Culturally we are globally renowned-from Van Morrison right through to Snow Patrol’s Crashing Cars being the most listened to song of the st century so far. In terms of sport we recently hosted The Open and we have names such as Rory McIlroy, Graeme McDowell and Darren Clarke, but we don’t use what should symbolise the positive aspects but concentrate on the fractious issue of conflict. It makes us forget how globally regarded we are,” he said.Professor Shirlow also contends that the all invasive aspects of one-sided commemoration also often obscure the stories of human bravery and kindness that took place during the conflict.“There are stories of the Troubles where many people put their own lives in danger to save others. I know someone in Ardoyne who took a policeman into their home and him to stop him being killed. It stops the appreciation of victims being someone’s mother or father, son or daughter. And, I’m sure it’s the same in Derry.“Commemoration doesn’t look at a lot of le experiences or the fact that people on both sides took risks to help protect each other. Commemoration can largely be about the self.”The Derry News also asked Peter Shirlowhe thinks that at specic times, political parties push their ideas of commemoration onto their prospective voters to purposefully polarise communities “There is part of it that is a response to ‘your’ community and that symbolises that these events have power and politicians are sometimes trapped in that. But, of course parties will use that for their own ends.“If we united on issues like the health service, education, employment and the environment perhaps there wouldn’t be such a focus on identity. However, there are signs that people are exploring other ways to move forward,” he said.CAPTION: Professor Peter Shirlow, Director of the Institute of Irish Studies at the University of Liverpool."},{"url":null,"title":"special creggan performance dedicated lyra mckee","story":"A special all-female performance of a play written by esteemed Irish dramatist Brian Friel took place in Creggan yesterday in memory of Lyra McKee.Art Over Borders’ th Lughnasa FrielFest paid tribute to the young writer and journalist who was killed in the city with a free performance of Brian Friel’s  play The Enemy Within.Two performances had been scheduled to take place in two churches, St. Columba’s Church of Ireland in Omagh, Friel’s birthplace, and All Saints Church of Ireland in the Waterside Derry on Saturday.However, festival organiser Arts Over Borders unexpectedly announced the additional free performance in Creggan.The Enemy Within is centred around Columbas room or cell in the Autumn of , on the island of Iona, off the West coast of Scotland.The entire play centres around issues such as ‘Who am I’ and ‘To whom am I connected ’Published in , Friel wrote the play connecting it to the social troubles at the time.Columbas enemies were not only limited to his inner self, but also to his own family. Even though he had left Ireland, presumably for good, his family held an immovable grip which crippled Columba in his work on Iona.This pressure contributes to the inner struggles Columba is forced through in several parts of the play.Yesterdays performance on the last day of the four-week festival was dedicated to the memory of Lyra McKee who was shot dead during rioting in the Creggan area on April  of this year.Her partner Sara Canning was invited along by the organisers. Derry born festival co-curators Sean Doran and Liam Browne felt it was appropriate and timely to honour the memory of Lyra McKee with this all-female world premiere presentation.Speaking to the Derry News, Mr Doran said: “Our international Brian Friel Festival is jointly held in Donegal and Derry, with the Derry location now celebrating the playwright’s more socio-political plays and themes of justice, gender and ethnicity.“To complement the Lughnasa FrielFest Donegal, Here I Come! we have given the title of OVERCOME to Derry’s Lughnasa FrielFest in recognition of Derry’s ability to continually overcome its challenges and to resonate  years on from the Civil Rights marches of  that were directly inspired by the Black American Civil Rights movement.“The Black spiritual singers Ruby Philogene MBE and Tayo Aluko will join the casts of Brian Friel’s The Enemy Within and The Freedom of the City offering sung preludes and interludes to the Omagh and Derry performances.”Mr Browne added: “We had the pleasure of working with Lyra previously when she kindly agreed to be part of a discussion  in our Home of St. Patrick Festival in Armagh in . On that occasion she explored the particular challenges that face young women today, the pressures to reveal, issues around identity, privacy and such.“The subjects which Friel explored throughout his work of gender, poverty, ethnicity, isolation and spirituality mirror the themes which also concerned Lyra and about which she wrote.”googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh"},{"url":null,"title":"strength community shown newtown mayoral visits","story":"Newtown Mayor Cllr David Selby with members of the Men#s Shed\" Strength of community shown in mayoral visitsThe fire cadets in Newtown.\" Skip to next photo Show caption  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\" href\" my account emailthispage \""},{"url":null,"title":"pictures brecknock yfc claims new shearing record","story":"The crowds of supporters.

By working with the Downpatrick Property Trust, we are able to regenerate this building to provide a commercial interest and much needed guest accommodation in the heart of the town.Breenrsquos Corner is the third project to be undertaken by the trust.It previously developed and later sold Maghinis House in Irish Street and also developed Britches Close in English Street as commercial and office accommodation.The trust also invested pound, in the Breenrsquos Corner buildings when they were bought and refurbished as residential accommodation in .The last of the residential tenants vacated the building several months ago and it has remained unoccupied.Current commercial clients which occupy ground-floor shops are not included in the development.The trust, which is chaired by Fergus Kelly, was described treasurer Mal McGrady as ldquoa community developer of the last resort which gets engaged when there is no private interest in developing a building or the cost of renovation would make development prohibitive for any private investor.He said: ldquoWe are excited by the new concept that Stephen Magorrian and Denvirrsquos proposed to us.ldquoThis concept is a win-win both for Denvirrsquos as it gives extra accommodation while bringing back this property into use which is beneficial to the townrsquos tourism offering.Mr McGrady said that the project was important to Downpatrick town centrersquos continued development.ldquoAt present this buildingrsquos external facade is an eyesore, particularly for traffic entering the town centre.ldquoWe will have the facility to provide an extra  beds in the town centre which will help provide accommodation for people on golf tours, bike tours, casual visitors and bus tours who stop at the St Patrickrsquos Centre and Down Museum and we believe that this will help regenerate the town centre, he added.The development, which is designed by JNP Architects and is being carried out by Keelryan Developments Ltd, of Newcastle, intends to provide affordable, contemporary guest accommodation to appeal to tourists and visitors who wish to stay in the town.Mr Magorrian said the Horatio Group would be responsible for the interior fit-out of the rooms and suites which would be leased from DPT and marketed by Denvirrsquos on its website and other hospitality sites such as Air bnb.ldquoI want the guests to be totally surprised when they come into the accommodation as it will be totally dferent to the exterior, he remarked.ldquoGuests can either walk the few metres around the corner to breakfast at the inn or enjoy a breakfast hamper provided by Denvirrsquos made up with items from local suppliers..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/10248136.jpg","title":"bandstand john garrity","story":"How long have you been performing Where do you perform What is your favourite song to play and why What has been your biggest gig to date Who are your major influences Do you write your own songs  What inspires your songwriting What would be your dream gig Best moment as a musician so far What is the most unusual venue you have played What is your lsquogo-torsquo encore song Whats the best thing about performing Do you always perform solo or do you also play with a band How would you describe your sound Any last words This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He applied perfectionism and professionalism to everything he did yet somehow managed to have more fun than anyone.“Most importantly, he was a father and husband. Everything he did, every deal he made, every late hour spent at work was for his family who are now completely heartbroken.”The post adds: “If you ever had the pleasure of meeting John, you will know the impact he left on you and the room. His energy was infectious and his passion and charisma for what he did will remain infamous.“The self-marketing campaigns will go down as the best in history.”It adds that funeral details have not yet

We believe it is important that all families feel welcome in the school. Education is a partnership between home and school with a shared responsibility based on trust and mutual understanding and the co-operation and participation of parents with our school in the education of their child is positively encouraged.ldquoA good relationship between school and home builds a childrsquos confidence, aids their learning and helps them to fulfil their potential in all areas.They stressed that the children had an equal say in their education, through the use of techniques like lsquoImmersion Daysrsquo ndash where pupils have a multi-sensory experience of any given topic.These learning opportunities have ied from using LEGO in building new robot designs and solving problems, to visits from STEM experts. businesses and education experts.The pupils develop a basis from these experiences from which to draw questions and interests, while the staff ask for pupilsrsquo ideas about how they would like to learn further.ldquoWe recently we had an Immersion Day on the topic of volcanoes, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoA few of the pupils mentioned ways they would like to learn more about the subject. When we followed their suggestions a few weeks later, they were incredibly enthused ndash it really focuses them, develops their engagement.These pioneering techniques of giving the children an equal say in their education have a proven record.Albert Primary featured in Estynrsquos lsquoRecognising excellence in education and trainingrsquo publication for its innovative approach.The publication said: ldquoThe school provides pupils with an excellent range of high quality learning experiences.Mr Gilbert said: ldquoMost importantly the inspection report captures the ethos of our school and, in particular, it confirmed that we are achieving our aim to make the school a happy and secure place in which pupils grow in confidence and independence.Albert Primary also earned an award for being the top performing primary school in Wales in recognition of their implementation of the Renaissance Reading programme, and the impact it has on their childrenrsquos reading progress.The staff were experienced and enthusiastic. During the tour, I was treated to a brief rehearsal of the schoolrsquos summer production ndash The Lion King. The youngsters performing looked genuinely thrilled to be involved, and were remarkably talented singers.There is plenty of sport provision, with the deceptively spacious grounds playing host to several open tarmac areas and courts. Football, basketball, rounders, cycling and more were on offer, along with chess, drama and music clubs. For those looking to go off school site, Belle Vue Park is feet away from the front entrance, and often works with the school.This year, Albert Primary has been awarded the prestigious Platinum Flag Award after previously gaining three Green Flag Awards thanks to the environmental education programme, Eco-Schools.But no school is without its problems.A major concern for Albert Primary is having to balance a large deficit budget. In order to do so the school has lost a number of agency learning support staff, with the deputy head taking on a greater teaching commitment next year to make up for the shortfall.Another blow came after four years of saving and planning to convert a disused toilet block into a teaching and community centre.The funds, totalling pound,, had to be used to offset the deficit budget instead. The proposal was to refurbish the existing outbuilding to provide a new classroom facility for the oversubscribed main school to use, alongside the community.The governors are currently creating a task group of stakeholders to address future funding sources.But the spirits of the pupils and staff have not been dampened by financial dficulties.ldquoI believe that we are extremely fortunate in Albert Primary to have created such a positive and vibrant environment in which our children can learn, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoIt is the dedication and commitment of its staff and everyone associated with the school that makes Albert Primary the school that it is today ndash successful, happy and continually improving.Albert Primary was founded in  to accommodate all ages of children up to school leaving age.Much of its original character has been preserved and it now holds Grade  listed status. The school has some unusual Victorian artwork by Norton Nante and parts of the school were designed by highly respected Victorian architect J Coates Carter.A Victorian mural on the front of the building shows several children hard at work. One of them is holding a pet mouse on a lead.It is clear that this quirky attitude to learning has been present and successful in the school for a long time.Long may it last. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This, coupled with the feedback from the schoolchildren we work with through our community outreach programme, was enough for us to want to do something about it.ldquoWhatrsquos a girl to do follows Ellie as she sets out on her quest to be an engineer ndash but the road isnrsquot easy. Her classmates think shersquos odd, her best friend, Flo, doesnrsquot understand, her brother says she canrsquot, and her grandad is behaving strangely. Ellie doesnrsquot want to give up on her dream and the book seesshe can make it in a world that can be so negative.Penarth author Alison Powell has been involved from the projectrsquos beginning and helped bring Ellie and her family and friends to le.Ms Powell said: ldquoWhen I was approached I was delighted ndash as a mother of two children, I know how important it is to re-enforce positivity through all aspects of le, to challenge stereotypes and ensure they know they can strive for any career they choose, regardless of gender, race or orientation.Evan, a year two Rhws Primary pupil, said: ldquoI loved the bit in the story where Ellie got a job.

Ms Parker and Mr Glover met several years ago when he trained her at their local gym. They then ended up unexpectedly working together later in le when Mr Glover changed jobs.Mr Glover said: ldquoIt was very tough for Julie before the transplant as she suffered with a genetic lung disease and her lungs slowly stopped working over a few years.\"It got to the point where she required an oxygen tank to be strapped to her back so that she could breathe. She never gave up and still worked and tried to do as much as she could and always kept a smile on her face.Ms Parker has a rare condition called Alpha--antitrypsin deficiency which means she lacks a protective enzyme inhibitor which makes her more vulnerable to smoke, dust and other toxic materials and increases the risk of lung disease. Because of the deficiency, Ms Parker was required to have a double lung transplant. Shortly after the transplant Ms Parker went to lunch with Mr Glover and he was amazed at how well she looked.He said: ldquoBecause I was seeing her every day, I knew her health was declining as a result of the lung disease. But I donrsquot think I was so aware of the extent until I saw her after the operation, and how healthy she looked.This isnrsquot the first challenge Mr Glover has taken on.In the past he has carried lbs up and down the highest mountain in Southern Britain, completed car dead lts and successfully performed  pull ups.The pair now plan to walk Pen-Y-Fan, the highest mountain in South Wales, together to raise money in the future once Ms Parker is well enough.Mr Glover set out to raise pound, and has now raised pound.Officially, Mr Glover had only  days to train for this challenge, enlisting friends to help him by sitting in the car and steering as he tows.ldquoI was getting up at :am to run around car parks towing the car with a harness before work,\" he said. \"I love setting myself challenges but donrsquot tend to do what everyone  does. So I will look for something a bit far out or invent my own and usually try and document them on video.All the proceeds from the day will go towards the charityrsquos Harefield Transplant Appeal, to raise funds for organ care systems to allow more patients to receive le-saving transplants.If yoursquod like to support Mr Glover in his marathon challenge his Justgiving page is: https:www.justgiving fundraising muscleworld article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Two-year-old Matilda Philpott who has Stickler Syndrome was joined by her two brothers, Oliva and Alfie, four-year-old Alice Haswell who has Goldenhar Syndrome camped out with her sister Scarlet, and -year-old Daisy Stacey who has Vacterl Association attended with her sister Molly.The weekend saw the families take part in a range of activities from archery, crafts and pop rockets to laser shooting, fire lighting, bush craft and raft making.The camp was the first time the referred children have been on a Scout Camp, something leaders have been hoping to achieve since the start of the group.Ruth Weltch, Group Scout Leader said: ldquoThe opportunity to regularly set up camp in the great outdoors is one of the main reasons young people enjoy Scouting so much and we wanted to give our children, who would not normally have the opportunity, the chance to take part in a weekend of outdoor activities and to sleep under canvas with their families.ldquoWe have been overwhelmed and humbled by the amount of help offered by leaders, not just from Cardf and Vale Scouts but from other scouting areas in Wales.This reflects the scope of the hospice itself which is open to all children with le limiting illnesses throughout Wales.ldquoWe have been able to give these children the opportunity to take part in activities not usually accessible to them and that we take for granted. It was an absolute joy to see them and their families take part in the weekendrsquos activities, seeing them smile and forget about their worries for a while was heart-warming.Lynne Phelps, from Ty Hafan, said: ldquoThe hard work, time and effort put in by the Scout Group since its inception has been truly amazing. The group has brought so much happiness to the hospice and given the children referred to us an opportunity to take part in activities with their families that they wouldnrsquot have had access toit wasnrsquot for Scouts.ldquoThe group has had a really positive impact not just on the children in our care, but also their families and our staff. We really canrsquot thank the Ty Hafan Scout Group enough.The Ty Hafan Scout Group was set up on the Scouting Centenary in  for any child referred to the hospice along with their siblings, parents and family, to spend time together having fun and making memories.A growing need for sibling involvement was soon recognised and so the group began to run regular sibling camps.The sibling camps have given the young people who have brothers and sisters in the care of the hospice the opportunity to attend events such as Scarefest and the Jurassic International Jamboree, as well as the chance to spend quality family time with their loved ones.ScoutsCymru gives over , young people in Wales the opportunity to enjoy fun and adventure while developing the skills they need to succeed, now and in the future.Open to all young people in Wales regardless of faith, gender, sexual orientation, race or social background, the movement encourages its members to do more, learn more and be more. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

prevent dogs dying in hot cars this summer and to raise awareness on summer safety for our canine friends.Just a few minutes in a hot car can prove fatal for dogs and yet every year animal welfare charities and the police receive thousands of reports of animals being left alone in cars on warm days.That’s why together with Dogs Trust, Councils across Northern Ireland are running ‘Summer Fun for Cool Canines’ events as part of the Dogs Die in Hot Cars campaign, to raise awareness about the dangers of leaving dogs in hot cars and to provide dog owners with practical tips to keep their dog cool and safe this summer.Laura McAnea, Campaigns Manager at Dogs Trust, said: “Many people still believe that it’s OK to leave a dog in a car on a warm daythe windows are left open or they’re parked in the shade, but the truth is, it’s not.“A car can become as hot as an oven very quickly, even when it doesn’t feel that warm and a dog can die in a hot car in  minutes. When it’s  degrees outside, in a car it can reach an unbearable  degrees within the hour.“We are delighted to be working with Local Authorities to raise awareness of the dangers of this and to try and prevent the heartbreak and distress caused when a much-loved family pet suffers, or dies, because they have been left in a car on a summer’s day.”Dogs Trust advise thatyou see a dog in distress in a hot car, call your local Animal Welfare Officer who will liaise with the PSNI to organise the rescue of the dog. This will help ensure the dogs can be removed from the car as quickly as possible, in a safe and legal manner.Signs of heat stroke in dogs include heavy panting, excessive drooling, vomiting, being drowsy and uncoordinated and collapsing. Dogs Trust advise that to help a dog in this condition, place them in the shade, pour small amounts of tepid, not cold, water onto their body, help them to drink small amounts of tepid water and once their breathing has settled, call the nearest vet.You can find out more about caring for dogs in the hot weather on the Dogs Trust website at https:www.dogstrust.org.uk news-events issues-campaigns

While an operator for the hotel has not yet been announced, the group has developed a series of Holiday Inn hotels across the UK and Ireland, as well as Seraphine hotels.

A statement, signed by  business organisations and trade bodies, says that “two and a half years on from the collapse of the Executive, and now approaching the likely conclusion of the Brexit process, the Northern Ireland business community is deeply concerned at the continued absence of a ing administration and is calling on political representatives to redouble their efforts to reach agreement to get the Assembly and Executive working again”. “There has seldom been a time when strong and effective leadership has been more necessary, both to deliver on the domestic agenda and also to speak up for Northern Ireland in the Brexit process. “We need a fully ing administration to agree and deliver a Programme for Government that will build infrastructure, reform our health service and education system, ensure we have a strong economy, and create opportunities for our young people. We also need effective representation in the Brexit discussions, even at this late stage in the process, to ensure that the economy is protected through whatever changes arise and that all necessary mitigations are sought and secured. “The business community will give encouragement and support to those politicians who stretch themselves to reach a compromise.

Editor John Mulgrew looks at the numbers, the analysis and the once household names no longer with us The tattered corner of the Ulster Business Top  list from  probably isn’t the worst way to analogise the then state of the Northern Ireland economy, and a precursor to what was around the cornerWe’ve come a very long way in a decade, and while there are some big and familiar names on the  Top  list, there are firms which have fallen off it entirely, and resigned to the history books post-recession.In former editor David Elliott’s intro to the magazine, it references the fact that most of the accounting periods in the list were just as the downturn was starting to gather pace.Economist John Simpson, writing in the edition, says the “big recession of  and  did not impact evenly across the economy, and recovery will be best seen as a sequence of dferent proportions”.There are some positive things to take from it – including a large glowing image of Victoria Square, which in the more than  years since it opened in the heart of Belfast has become part of the retail fabric of the city.Topping the list at the time was Viridian Group, which owned Northern Ireland Electricity and now includes Power NI as a subsidiary, with turnover of £.bn. However, it made a loss of £m during that period.Second on the list is a business familiar to many. Quinn Group, headed by Co Fermanagh businessman Sean Quinn, posted turnover of £.bn for the year ending    but incurred a loss of more than £m during the same period. There have been enough column inches written about the business in the years since then to fill many a book – and they have.Among those no longer on the list is developer David Patton  SonsLtd, Armaghdown Creameries Ltd and Ballyrogan Holdings.Many others on the list have since been acquired by some of the now giants in their respective industries.Moy Park is an interesting one. Back then it was still a large player in the poultry sector with turnover of £m.Those fortunes have evidently changed dramatically since then, as the company has held the top spot on the list for the last eight years, and now posts big profits and turnover of £.bn.Meanwhile, WR Barnett is on the  list in position , with a turnover of £m and pre-tax profits of £m. In the last  years, it has climbed the list to comfortably take the number two spot with sales of almost  times that of those a decade earlier.As far as employment goes, it was Tesco topping the list in , followed by Bombardier – which at the time had a workforce of around , people – with Royal Mail and Queen’s University following in third and fourth position.A lot has happened in the years since that list. The economy has slowly but surely gotten back on its feet. Growth has been gradual, and in the last year or so has been sitting at around %, while employment levels and unemployment levels are at their respective positive record levels. However, we are amid the most challenging time for business in a generation and some of the signs, and whispered conversations, are far from positive. As I write this, we still sit on the precipice of whether we secure an agreement on Brexit, or shuffle off the edge without a parachute.

For the UK, it is a signicantly big company.“Looking year-over-year, our performance was very consistent in the last few years.”“For people working there, working for a company which is the largest employer in a country, the top company, it is a source of pride for us.“But I don’t think that drives the behaviour of the team. We are more interested in making sure that our performance is sustainable in terms of margins.“It is nice that we arebut that is not our main goal. We are making sure that we are sustainable, work on quality, safety. There are lots of other things. It’s making sure that we fit our customer needs.“We have a lot focus on that, and we need to be competitive.”And as for growth, expanding turnover isn’t necessarily the main focus, according to Flavio“A lot of the efforts in the last year have been to consolidate the management tools they have in Pilgrim’s. They are very keen on efficiency, so that’s one of their strategies. “ a lot of focus in improving our performance, it’s how we can be more efficient, focusing on a portfolio that feeds our customer base, how we deal with our customers.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"ulster business top  launch ","story":"Posted on Wednesday  August  by Ulster Business Sarah Little, publishing director, INM NI, Mark Thompson, AL Goodbody with John Mulgrew The cream of Northern Ireland’s business community have gathered to mark the official launch of the Ulster Business Top  Northern Ireland Companies , with AL Goodbody.
