Luke Jensen, who runs its tech business, Ocado Solutions, received £6m.The influential proxy voting agencies, which advise big shareholders how to vote, have raised a red flag over the executive pay scheme before Wednesday’s meeting behind closed doors at its head office in Hatfield, Hertfordshire.RLAM said this year’s bonus bonanza was “a classic example of how poorly designed incentive plans can lead to excessive awards for management”. Ashley Hamilton Claxton, its head of responsible investment, complained payouts were not capped and the remuneration committee “did not apply any discretion”.The men were promised the shares in 2014 under a five-year “growth incentive plan” that measured Ocado’s share price growth relative to the FTSE 100.The company’s value has soared over the past two years: the shares, which were changing hands for about 250p in November 2017, are now worth £17 after Steiner sold its grocery-picking expertise to seven foreign supermarket chains. The advisory groups Pirc, Glass Lewis and Institutional Shareholder Services have told investors to vote against the company’s pay report. They have also urged investors to block the re-election of Andrew Harrison who is head of the remuneration committee.Lord Stuart Rose, Ocado’s chairman, said Ocado recognised the “sensitivities around executive pay”, but that the pay schemes had been approved and the payouts had been earned. He said: “The award reflects outstanding performance over a five year period during which £7.5bn of value was created for Ocado shareholders. “The remuneration committee is satisfied that Ocado’s pay schemes past and present, all of which have already been approved by shareholders, deliver above-market pay-outs only for outstanding results.”The lockdown has resulted in a period of record grocery sales as the closure of restaurants, cafes and pubs forces Britons to eat and drink at home. But while supermarkets have expanded online services after a surge in demand for home delivery, Ocado’s automated warehouses quickly reached capacity, forcing the retailer to turn away custom.The Shore Black analyst Clive Black said Ocado had suffered a “meltdown” in the early weeks of the crisis, with both the app and website crashing."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5924906cb4ab79ddfaafa9818004c762a7423ae5/0_201_3543_2127/master/3543.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=04d486d14bdc4c40c16013afa42ac981","title":"harry and meghan are trying to rebrand themselves but they should take a breather","story":"The Sussexes have reportedly collaborated with a book about their split from the royal family. So much for pursuing a new life of privacyThe Sussexes’ noble experiment in living a quiet life, free from the glare of publicity attached to a royal title, continues. First they started a war with the British tabloids, fighting them over the misuse of private information in court while grandly declaring a new policy of “zero engagement” with a number of outlets. Then they moved to Los Angeles, a paparazzi-free zone perfect for people trying to reclaim their privacy. Now they have reportedly cooperated with a tell-all biography – Finding Freedom: Harry, Meghan and the Making of a Modern Royal Family – that is coming out in August.According to a press release, Finding Freedom dispels “the many rumours and misconceptions that plague the couple on both sides of the pond” and was written with “unique access” and “the participation of those closest to the couple”. It is unclear how involved Harry and Meghan were with the book, but the Mail on Sunday claims they sat for interviews with the writers, Omid Scobie and Carolyn Durand (representatives for the couple deny this). Given their record, one imagines that, if they weren’t happy with the biography coming out, they would have issued a statement unequivocally saying so.If Harry and Meghan did give a green light to this biography, I can’t understand why. Let’s be clear: the racism and malice directed at Meghan by parts of the British media has been horrific. The pair have every right to try to take control of their narrative. But cooperating with a biography entitled Finding Freedom may not be the best way to do so. They had a row with their family and relocated they didn’t escape persecution from a war-torn country.Maybe before going full-steam ahead with their rebrand, our fearless freedom finders should take a bit of a breather, lay low and avoid baiting the media. After all, there is a fair bit going on in the world they may soon find that we are not all as desperate to hear about them as they seem to think."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/085ee7ce6318f815e4368be173dc01e018d53c56/0_27_4747_2847/master/4747.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=32a669335bdae3f800b984be2cf417b9","title":"the guardian view on lifting the lockdown not business as usual","story":"Tory MPs fear that the growth of the role of the state is accepted as necessary by the publicThe coronavirus pandemic has forced the British government to spend large amounts to keep its economy afloat and ensure the wellbeing of the public. Ministers did so without paying heed to questions of cost. They were right to forego such concerns. We are seeing wartime levels of spending, pushing deficits – and public debt – to new highs. But the analogy does not get us very far.In wartime the aim is to maximise production. Lockdowns minimise production. The solution is not to dwell on GDP. That will inevitably fall in a shutdown, which requires us to transact less intensely. As ministers contemplate a path out of the lockdown, there must be a frank conversation with the public about the big shift under way in the economy from its previous carefree state to a permanently distanced one. Part of that conversation is that as far as the economy is concerned, the state should be here to stay.There must be an emphasis that people’s mental health and wellbeing will be prioritised alongside physical safety. Standards must be enforced. Otherwise there may be little public buy-in when restrictions are eased. People won’t be forced into crowded buses to commute to work. No one would willingly work in an unsafe workplace. Tory MPs who suggest workers are reluctant to go back to work after being furloughed reveal not a real crisis but an ideological fear that the growth of the role of the state is accepted as necessary by the public.A series of small behavioural changes may add up to something much bigger. We won’t be shaking a lot of hands in the near future. There’s unlikely to be many people flying. Students won’t be found in lecture halls. By expanding testing and with a government committed to a Whack-A-Mole strategy of contact tracing and quarantine, there will be a time when businesses can, under a strict regulatory regime, reopen. But will this be normal? No. Some bits of the British economy have gone for good: department stores are surely part of a pre-Covid-19 age. Electrical retailers are planning drive-through stores.The types of jobs that the economy produces will change too. As restaurants, bars and local shops close down, there’s a legitimate concern that customers and jobs are falling victim to Amazonification. Low-paying, precarious employment is not a good way of building resilience. The Trades Union Congress idea of a job guarantee where the government becomes the employer of last resort, offering secure employment at a living wage, is a good one. This would be especially important for the under-25s who were about two and a half times more likely than other employees to work in a sector that is currently shut down.There will be plenty of positions to fill. Someone will have to take temperature readings at airports the greening of industry will throw up new roles. Not everything will work out the way we think it might. We ought to need fewer waiters and more delivery drivers. This doesn’t always work in the favour of tech companies. Redundancies at Deliveroo are perhaps a sign that its business model had little to do with making money from delivering food."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/71585c2a86e90f6e19430ab3b500e7c52b38ceba/0_32_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=62fc2c40fdcf316fbf31d2731de4a8d6","title":"the guardian view on polands presidential election call it off","story":"By staging an improvised postal poll during a pandemic, the Law and Justice party is indulging in ruthless opportunismOne of the most immediate and unavoidable consequences of the coronavirus pandemic was that “politics as usual” quickly ground to a shuddering halt. In Britain, mayoral and council elections due to be held this week were postponed for a year.A democratic hiatus of this kind is never to be welcomed. But delaying an election in order to conduct it properly is far preferable to the current state of affairs in Poland. This Sunday, as Poles tentatively emerge from two months of lockdown and continue to physically distance, an electorate of more than 30 million people is due to elect a new president by postal vote – the first such poll in the nation’s history. The date of the election was fixed in pre-coronavirus times. By insisting that it goes ahead, the rightwing Law and Justice-led government has taken the maxim “never let a crisis go to waste” to a new level.The decision to hold an improvised postal election is being contested by all the opposition parties. Key allies in Law and Justice’s own ruling coalition also oppose the move the deputy prime minister, Jarosław Gowin, resigned in protest last month, arguing that the country should be focused on battling coronavirus and rebuilding the economy. The other objections are numerous. There are enormous practical difficulties to organising an unprecedented ballot in such a short space of time and widespread concerns over possible fraud. Since ordinary campaigning on the streets has been impossible for two months, there are also issues of political balance, given the pro-government affiliations of Polish broadcast media.The simplest explanation for the government’s determination to press ahead regardless is naked opportunism. Since taking power in 2015, Law and Justice has acquired a well-deserved reputation for playing fast and loose with democratic norms, particularly in relation to the judiciary and media. In this instance, it appears the party has calculated that in times of national crisis, populations tend to rally round the government. In April, it rushed a bill through parliament to allow a postal ballot poll, ignoring a legal prohibition on rule changes less than six months from an election. From then on, the political playing field has been relentlessly skewed in favour of the government’s preferred candidate, Andrzej Duda, who is seeking a second presidential term. Mr Duda has enjoyed a high-profile role in the government’s strategy to combat Covid-19, receiving plaudits from government-friendly media. The candidate for Civic Platform, Poland’s main opposition party, has endorsed a mass boycott of the election while, confusingly, staying in the race. Unsurprisingly, given that backdrop, polls suggest that Mr Duda is set to win by a landslide.With the country split over the vote, and Sunday’s election in danger of descending into farce, it is still possible that Poland’s parliament will overturn the earlier decision to allow it to take place. On legal, logistical and ethical grounds that would be the right course of action. A pandemic is not the appropriate context for an experiment in postal voting that has no credibility among large swathes of the electorate. In the interests of democracy, this election should be postponed."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/173382999ff4e546427d20ec8ba84ec445476d40/0_0_3075_1854/master/3075.jpg?width=645\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=1dc261297ac94eb3d65249256604f7be 1290w","title":"explain it to me quickly did elon musk and grimes really name their baby x a 12","story":"Is it a troll, a code or an actual name? And how do you pronounce it? One  staffer asked another to explain the decision ... quicklyWhat is “X Æ A-12”, and why is it trending on Twitter?That, my friend, is the name of tech billionaire Elon Musk and musician Grimes’ first child together. At least according to Elon Musk, who tweeted “X Æ A-12 Musk” when one of his 33.7 million followers demanded to know his newborn baby’s name.Is this … real? Or is he trolling?Probably both, in a sense. Most people are working under the assumption that Musk’s tweet is a code for the baby’s real name. The fact Grimes’ has a track on her latest album, Miss Anthropocene, named ‘4 Æ M’ as in “for Æ Musk”, lends weight to the theory.Then Grimes stepped in to clear things up with a brand new cypher that explained Æ stands for AI and X stands for ‘X’.Glad we’re all on the same page then. But seriously, what does it say on the birth certificate?There are several working theories on how to pronounce ‘X Æ A-12 Musk’ and what it might mean at the moment.Why are people so fascinated with this couple?The pair both had pretty obsessive fan communities going into the relationship – many of whom (mostly Grimes fans) had mixed feelings about them as a couple. Since then there’s been a constant stream of drama about them, including a run in with ubiquitous beefer Azealia Banks, a lot of complaints about their mismatched politics (she’s been a Bernie supporter since 2016 he thinks we should “FREE AMERICA NOW”) and, of course, the baby build up.Grimes announced she was pregnant on Instagram by posting a photoshopped image of herself with a translucent, Space Odyssey-esque fetus inside her, and at the time no one was sure if it was a record teaser or an actual declaration that she was with child.Later she confirmed the news with a more confessional, conventional post, so I’d say that, much like a new Tesla model release or a album drop this is a phased marketing campaign for the miracle of life.But then again, he once got into a Twitter feud with a hero navy er, so heated it ended up in court and her entire pop persona is built around weirdness, so who knows what it really says on the birth certificate.Where does this sit on the mad celebrity baby name spectrum?If it’s not a code and the kid really is named X Æ A-12, I’m going to go ahead and award the name five out of five Moon Units. It’s definitely weirder than Blue Ivy (who also has her name worked into plenty of her mum’s creative output) Apple and Moses Shiloh and Pax, or even Nicholas Cage’s kid Kal-El. But, more likely, it’s a code for Xai Archangel – something a bit more normal sounding than, say, Kulture Kiari Cephus or Raddix Madden. Perhaps in an alternate timeline they would have gone with Pilot Inspektor, but sadly, it’s already taken.Whatever next? How does the next famous baby go further? Are we looking at the child of Zayn Malik and Gigi Hadid being called a series of emojis?Honestly, I think weird celebrity baby names are becoming passe. With all the Daeneryses Marvels and Teslas running around (seriously, 141 babies were named for Musk’s automotive brand in 2017) – calling your kid Kyd, just doesn’t seem that provocative anymore.

We see the benefits of this in our daily lives, whether it’s filing and paying taxes online, renewing a passport, booking a driving test or registering to vote. Offering services online means they can be provided far quicker and at a lower administrative cost, saving citizens time and helping government bodies to get the most out of finite budgets.However, because the services are now available through a computer or smartphone, there is an inherent risk of hackers gaining access to highly sensitive personal information.The public sector is now realising, as are many private companies, that this means cybersecurity can never be just an afterthought, and nor is it just a means of protecting online services from hackers.Important though that still is, digitally astute public bodies are starting to see cybersecurity as a mindset and a suite of enabling tools that help innovate new services to make life more convenient for the public. They also drive budgetary efficiencies through reduced administration, less paperwork and smoother running IT projects.As Stephen Wray, director of the cyber risk services team at Deloitte, explains, this means public organisations are now embracing cybersecurity as a vital consideration right from the start of a project. “It used to be a case of building something and then passing it on to the cyber team at the end of a project to see if it was secure,” he says. “Today, though, smart organisations realise they need to build in security-by-design throughout the entire process.”This is not just because compliance has been brought into sharper focus by the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which offers members of the public more privacy and greater control over how companies and government departments collect and store their information.In Wray’s opinion, public organisations seeking the best advice will come to see compliance as “a carrot, not a stick”, because by ensuring secure-by-design practice is incorporated from the start to the end of all projects, government services are empowered to deliver optimal features and at the same time provide a defendable position should there be a cybersecurity incident.People expect any provider of public services to be as flexible as any private company they deal with. Rather than fill in forms and queue in a town hall, they want to press a button on a smartphone to access services. This digital first approach requires a total rethink about how security is applied.“Cybersecurity has just got so much bigger. It used to be about securing a clearly defined perimeter,” says Wray. “Now cyber is everywhere. It is foundational and an enabler for all digital technology. Organisations are having to think about the wider picture, often critical systems and key assets are not within an organisation’s control and a significant portion of the value of the organisation rests in its supply chain. They may have computer-controlled devices, such as security cameras or automated doors to a public building, or huge swathes of citizen data managed and maintained by somebody else. Systems are built on systems and things can get complicated very quickly. It is within this complexity that hackers thrive. That’s why you need to start out every project with security in mind from the start.”Deloitte is finding that embracing this approach of security-by-design is enabling public bodies to turn around the preconception of cybersecurity as an expensive bolt-on to a suite of tools that can actually boost IT efficiency. “When organisations build security-by-design into everything they do, they prevent over-specification of the solution and avoid putting in too many features that are often unnecessary, unused and expand the opportunity for vulnerabilities from a security perspective,” says Wray. “What we’re seeing is that when cyber is built in from the start, public sector bodies don’t overscope, they can get it just right.”And when they get it right, they achieve two huge strategic goals at the same time. Not only do they protect citizens’ data and help maintain the public’s trust in government services, they also keep pace with the public’s expectations for how they should be empowered to interact with those services. Rather than get left behind, the public sector can be at the forefront of designing innovative services.“People want to use the latest, smartest products and services, but they can’t unless they’re safe,” says Wray. “It doesn’t matter what new technology can do, it’s only of use if it can be made secure for the public to enjoy. That’s what makes cybersecurity such an exciting, enabling capability. Without it, you couldn’t launch anything new without risking the trust customers have in you.”Wray cautions that government bodies must not only work on the technology but also the people within their organisations. “People can be your strongest link,” says Wray. A user-enabled security approach means that well-trained and cyber savvy workers can contribute to the overall security posture of the organisation. A single compromised computer could provide a path to a treasure trove of citizen data. But healthy password use, security policy adoption and being able to identify and report phishing will counter some of the most prevalent and common attack vectors.Getting the people focus right and embracing cybersecurity throughout the life cycle of any new service is essential. When combined, these measures allow the public sector to delight citizens with convenient, slick new ways of accessing services that they might have previously only imagined was possible through a Silicon Valley startup."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eabe2686ba6cb99dd19262cf0345ec719e290859/0_85_5760_3455/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3a397d9561b946bdd9f10c969dbb614f","title":"education system for children with special needs in england riddled with inequalities","story":"Damning report by MPs finds many pupils miss out on support and end up being excluded from educationChildren with special educational needs and disabilities (SEND) are being failed by a system “riddled with unexplained inequalities”, according to a damning parliamentary report.The report says many of the 1.3 million pupils in England with SEND are not getting the support they need and end up being excluded from school, damaging their education, wellbeing and future life chances.Prior to the coronavirus outbreak, the funding crisis in SEND and shortcomings in provision were high on the political agenda. Ministers responded with additional investment and the promise of a review of services, which is yet to be published.The new report by MPs on the public accounts committee depicts a system in which “desperate” parents fight to secure an education, health and care plan (EHCP) – a legally enforceable package of support for those most in need – which has become seen as a “golden ticket” to get adequate support.MPs on the committee criticised the Department for Education (DfE) for failing to get to grips with the mounting pressure in the system and said ministers were not doing enough to try to understand the reasons for significant disparities between different groups of children and the support they receive.“Pupils with SEND deserve the same quality of education and to get the same value from our education system as their peers,” said Labour’s Meg Hillier, the committee chair.“Disturbing disparities in identifying pupils with SEND, and in provision for them, point to underlying problems that can only be addressed through proper data collection and information.“These children, already facing extra hurdles and challenges in this life, must not find themselves discriminated against several times over.”Responding to the findings, Rosamund McNeil, the assistant general secretary of the National Education Union, said: “Dramatic funding cuts to local authority and school budgets have led to a loss in confidence for many parents that their child will receive appropriate SEND support.“For many, the EHCP is seen as the only way of accessing the education provision their child needs. Sadly, this doesn’t always provide the golden ticket they are looking for.”Geoff Barton, the general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL), added: “The PAC’s report paints a stark picture of a system for supporting children with special educational needs which is poorly funded and ridiculously complicated.“It is important to understand that many teachers and support staff do an amazing job for these young people despite these circumstances, but they need more backing from the government in the form of sufficient funding, and a system which is more streamlined and less bureaucratic.”A DfE spokesperson said: “We are committed to supporting the safety and wellbeing of children with special educational needs and disabilities, and are working to ensure they get the help they need during the coronavirus outbreak.“Only those with the most complex needs will require an education, health and care plan, but every child deserves the opportunity to thrive in education.“Our SEND review will look at how to improve the whole system for those children, young people and their families, who need additional help to access the support they need.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e7d263eda38f47c8c83f278f79a57b0d84916c96/268_327_4852_2911/master/4852.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9d5f06cef13e6c41e51679c5ef37cca8","title":"have you noticed changes to wildlife due to the uk coronavirus lockdown","story":"If you have spotted wildlife behaving differently due to fewer people outside, we’d like to hear from youConservationists have noticed changes to British wildlife as the shutdown of modern life as we know it has meant oystercatchers have been spotted nesting on beaches, and moles appearing above ground in search for worms.We’d like to see your photos and stories of changes to wildlife that you have spotted close to where you live.What wildlife have you spotted behaving differently, and where?You can get in touch by filling in the form below.

The Miami Herald obtained internal Norwegian Cruise Line documents confirming the doctor’s death and assuring crew on the ship that he had died in his sleep from “cardio-respiratory arrest”, but had “no symptoms of Covid-19”. The Herald reported that the cruise company did not respond to their inquiries. Norwegian Cruise Line also did not respond to the ’s request for comment.A third crew member on the Oasis of the Seas, currently off the coast of Florida, died in hospital on Sunday. The death of Carlos Baluran, who worked the night shift in the vessel’s incinerator, comes after the death of waiter Dexter Joyosa and Indonesian waiter Iputu Sugiartha in the last two weeks on the same ship.In a statement, the CDC told the  that it is “allowing crew members to disembark from cruise ships in US waters and return home if cruise lines submit a signed attestation stating that they have complied with requirements to safely disembark their crew members”.It said: “These requirements include ensuring safe transportation by non-commercial means, providing cloth face coverings to crew members or ensuring they have their own, and providing instructions to crew members to stay home for 14 days after they reach their destination.“CDC shared this information with all cruise lines in US waters on 23 April 2020 to help crew members return home safely. Since then, CDC has received and approved signed attestations to disembark crew from 15 ships.“Some cruise lines have been unwilling to comply with the requirements to safely disembark their crew. Reasons include unwillingness to sign the attestation because of the legal consequences, and not wanting to pay for noncommercial transportation.”But Cruise Lines International Association (CLIA), the largest trade association for the cruise industry, said some of the CDC’s requirements were “impractical”.“To require employers to guarantee that every employee outside the workplace will fulfil all of the CDC’s stated requirements, including not having any interaction with the public whatsoever, with criminal sanctions at stake, is both unprecedented and impractical,” it said in a statement.On Monday, the first wrongful death lawsuit for a crew member was filed on behalf of the family of an Indonesian housekeeper on the Symphony of the Seas, operated by Royal Caribbean. The suit alleges that the company failed to protect staff by not implementing social distancing measures on board by allowing crew to hold parties and eat together.The company replied in a statement that it was working with authorities around the world to repatriate thousands of staff. It confirmed it had agreed to CDC restrictions to repatriate staff, and said it declined to comment on pending litigation.Asked what support it was providing crew in the wake of the three deaths on the Oasis of the Seas, it said: “We have our Employee Assistance Program that crew can call 24 hours a day and is confidential.”Carnival Cruise Line, which announced plans to restart operations at the beginning of August, said it would use 18 ships to repatriate more than 10,000 healthy crew members to Asia, Africa, Europe, India and Latin America.“The safety and wellbeing of our team members continues to be a top priority. Given the pause in our operations, we are committed to getting our crew members safely home to their families. We sincerely thank them for their hard work, patience and understanding during this process,” said Christine Duffy, president of Carnival Cruise Line.Alongside more than 100,000 crew, CLIA confirmed that 50 passengers remain at sea on five cruise ships – Celebrity Eclipse, Costa Deliziosa, Queen Mary 2, Caribbean Princess and Coral Princess – as of 29 April. So far, CLIA has recorded 2,789 confirmed cases of Covid-19 onboard 33 CLIA oceangoing cruise ships, but could not provide data relating to crew.“It’s a shame that it comes down to dollars and cents,” said John Hickey, a maritime lawyer in Miami, who has represented both the cruise companies and, most recently, cruise crew members.A ship flying a flag of convenience means the owner has registered the vessel in a country other than their own. The ship flies the ensign or flag of that country, known as the flag state and operates under its laws, typically laxer than the owner’s own.For a ship owner, the advantage of this arrangement includes comparatively fewer regulations, lower employment requirements, and thus cheaper labour, cheaper registration fees and lower or no taxes.For crew members, the disadvantages tend towards lower working standards, fewer rights and little protection. They are opposed by the International Transport Workers\u0027 Federation.Panama, which has the largest ship registry globally, followed by Liberia, operates an “open registry”, allowing foreign owners to register ships under its flag. It guarantees anonymity to the owners, making it difficult for them to be held to account.The practice began in the 1920s in the US, when owners of cruise ships registered their vessels in Panama so that they could serve their passengers alcohol during Prohibition.He said the situation facing crews now is rooted in the cruise industry’s avoidance of US governance. Even though the largest cruise lines are headquartered in the US and serve largely American clientele, they avoid US labour law and other regulation by registering outside the US and sailing their ships under foreign flags.“These crew members are like refugees now. They are stuck between a rock and a hard place,” he said. “The cruise lines think they can do anything they want with these folks and not treat them like human beings and not get them back to their homes.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ddce0f2bf19bda0c7f05fd50bc28dada919492ee/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3f8aff9c157860f9cdd84396924c20c1","title":"favourite forgotten films to stream","story":"As our writers continue to highlight under-seen films available to stream, you’ve replied with your favourites, ranging from sci-fi to action to comedyA Spanish film featuring the troubled reunion between a fortysomething daughter and the mother who abandoned her 30 years ago.

Possibly the last Berlin-set cold war thriller made before the wall came down. Probably explains why so few people have heard of it. apostataeAvailable to rent in the UK and in the USIncredibly moving film showing how rumour and hearsay can destroy a person’s life and how they are powerless once the community makes their mind up.

Apparently it was Oscar-nominated for best FL film but it wasn’t one I’d heard much about. phil44sheffieldAvailable on Amazon Prime in the UK and Hoopla or to rent in the USGreat cast (Michael Shannon, Adam Driver), kind of a road movie with supernatural and sci-fi elements that resolves beautifully at the end with strong close encounters vibes. I’m not describing it well, to be fair, but then again it’s best not to know too much about it before you watch. I’m aware it’s not a super obscure movie, but hardly anyone I know has seen it, and it’s always been enjoyed by those I’ve recommended it to. Easy to watch, and even family friendly (for older kids, at least, I think it’s a 12 certificate).

About an attempted coup in North Korea, and the communist soldier who rescues Kim Jong-il by abducting him into the South. It moves fluently between epic action scenes, high-quality political intrigue between Korea, China and America, and also has genuinely funny dialogue in places. It’s also fascinating to see a more nuanced take on the political tensions in the region, within and between the countries involved. Rare to see a film of this scale move so deftly. And the whole scene in the obstetrician is wild. Boog1000Available on Netflix in the US and UKSorry to recommend a film about an epidemic but … I liked Perfect Sense by David Mackenzie, with Ewan McGregor and Eva Green (Stannis Baratheon shows up as well). It’s a film about adapting to a worsening situation and being forced to realise what’s important. I thought it was elegantly shot and the leads make the film about people and not the situation.

We talk to the women spearheading this new wave‘I wanted it to be relatable to any woman who’s ever worked in an office,” says Kitty Green of her new film The Assistant. “Everything in the film has been in the press already. But I wanted to take viewers on an emotional journey, so they could empathise with the character.”The #MeToo saga has been examined to near exhaustion, but The Assistant manages to add something new. Rather than perpetrators or victims, it focuses on a relative bystander: a young office worker at a New York film production company. We follow this character, played by Julia Garner, through her demeaning routine: commuting in before daybreak, photocopying, printing, taking her male co-workers’ lunch orders, clearing up leftover pizza from the meeting room (as the men come in for the next meeting, she is humiliatingly caught with a crust in her mouth).All this is interspersed with moments of everyday sexism and bullying communications from the Weinstein-like boss next door, who is not named or depicted. The Assistant doesn’t amp up the drama or trowel on the message: instead, it shines a cold, clear light on a culture of complicity, silence and misogyny, not to mention the general dehumanising nature of office life.Green’s previous films were documentaries, often centred on women, often stylistically adventurous. But for The Assistant, she opts for an unfussy approach. “In fiction film-making,” she says, “you can use the closeup to amplify micro-aggressions, tiny moments that often get overlooked.” Green still researched her story like a documentary, though, interviewing hundreds of working women worldwide. “The more real you make it, the more people are forced to interrogate their own role in all this.”As well as its relevance to the #MeToo moment, The Assistant is a type of film we’ve been seeing a lot in US cinema lately: one concerned with everyday experience, particularly of those on the lower rungs if not the margins – yet reflective of modern America as a whole. Authentic settings and scenarios are prioritised over exaggerated dramatics or showy technique (if you want an example of the latter in terms of #MeToo, go see Bombshell).Strikingly, many of these films are being made by andor about women. We’ve had the likes of Debra Granik’s Leave No Trace, about a disturbed survivalist father and his teenage daughter living in the woods Sean Baker’s The Florida Project, which follows a single mother living hand to mouth in an Orlando motel Chloé Zhao’s The Rider, about a Dakota rodeo star suffering ahead injury. And then there was Andrea Arnold’s American Honey, in which a teen runaway falls in with a hedonistic bunch and Andrew Bujalski’s Support the Girls, about female workers banding together at an exploitative sports bar.In Europe, such films would be readily classified as “realism”, in the vein of the neorealist cinema of 1950s Italy or the “social realism” of Ken Loach and Mike Leigh in the UK. But in the US, the idea of realism has never quite taken root. In commercial Hollywood especially, sociopolitical issues must always be refracted through the prism of genre: horror and sci-fi are the popular choices. Escapist cinema will always have its appeal. But perhaps, given America’s current – and worsening – predicament, audiences are now starting to crave films that strive to make sense of the here and now, rather than distract from it.A further sign comes in the form of Eliza Hittman’s Never Rarely Sometimes Always, about to have a streaming release in the UK. It concerns a Pennsylvanian teenager who travels to New York with her cousin to get a termination. As with The Assistant, the drama is low-key, almost documentary-like. There is no speechifying and no sentimentality: the characters don’t learn a redeeming lesson, offer a political insight or bond in a heartwarming way. Instead, we’re faced with the bare, brutal reality of the situation, which is compounded by the fact that these young women have no money, nowhere to stay, and little experience of the world.In 2007, the drama 4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days, told a similar story about a woman seeking an illegal termination in Ceauşescu’s Romania. Modern-day America looks just as grim in Never Rarely Sometimes Always, which won an award at Sundance this year in the category of neorealism. Tellingly, this was a new category at the festival.Could the prevalence of female film-makers have something to do with this wave? Opportunities have improved in recent years, it could be said, resulting in fresh perspectives on both the plight of women and the fragilities of male identity in modern America. It would be wrong, however, to assume that female film-makers naturally lean towards more personal, real-life subjects. A more likely factor, suggests Green, is the industry’s lingering apprehension over women.“They’ll fund us,” she says, “when it’s an area they think we have authority on. If I came to them with a dystopian sci-fi movie, they might not believe I could pull it off. But if I say it’s about a 25-year-old assistant, they might think: ‘Oh, OK, that’s something she might know something about.’”Hardship and poverty often go hand in hand with realism, and not just in front of the camera. One reason Italian neorealism caught on worldwide was because it was cheap to make. Perhaps this is why it never really took root in the US. “The idea of a socially conscious, class-conscious cinema has always been deeply suspect in America,” says Paul Malcolm, film programmer at the UCLA Film and Television Archive.Perhaps, he adds, the US establishment was reluctant to admit to a foreign influence, especially when its focus on societal ills and the plight of the working class came with connotations of socialism and communism. A very slender realist thread does run through US film history, however, says Malcolm, who recently co-curated a film season entitled American Neorealism, Part One (1948 to 1984). This showcased the likes of John Cassavetes’ Shadows (a rough, jazzy race drama shot on the streets of 1950s New York), Jerry Schatzberg’s The Panic in Needle Park (with the young Al Pacino as a 1970s junkie) and Barbara Loden’s Wanda (in which she plays a runaway wife drifting through grimy 1970s Pennsylvania).To these we should add landmark African-American films such as Shirley Clarke’s The Cool World and Charles Burnett’s Killer of Sheep. The neorealist strand also runs through black and minority film-making, from Boyz N the Hood to Fruitvale Station. Part two of UCLA’s film season is on hiatus due to the pandemic, but the list of potential candidates is getting longer by the month.Ironically, economic adversity could actually be a factor in the scarcity of US realism. It often becomes a calling card. Film-makers who have paid their dues and garnered critical acclaim through realist dramas are often tempted to bigger (but not always better) things. It happened to such great Italian neorealists as Vittoria de Sica, Luchino Visconti and Roberto Rossellini.It is also happening to their current US successors. Kelly Reichardt successfully transposed her realist sensibility to such period pieces as Meek’s Cutoff. Her latest, First Cow, may be set in the 1820s, but is no less a tale of graft and survival. On the other hand, Chloé Zhao is currently working on the Marvel movie Eternals, which is unlikely to ever be confused with The Rider. Still, while it marks a defection from the realist camp, the move also signals a big-budget vote of confidence in a rising film-maker. Kitty Green has plans but is not willing to discuss them just yet.Realism always seems to be born out of crisis. In Italy, it grew from the ruins of the second world war. Before that, a realist movement in art developed in the US and elsewhere in the 1930s, in the wake of the Great Depression. In fact, one of the most enduring fruits of social realism in the US was the Farm Security Administration, set up as part of Franklin D Roosevelt’s New Deal in the mid-30s. Its remit was to document the impact of the Depression on rural communities, through photography as well as film. But its images went beyond the merely factual, often achieving the emotional impact of a drama.The prime example is Dorothea Lange’s famous Migrant Mother photograph, which the Library of Congress captioned: “Destitute pea pickers in California. Mother of seven children. Age 32. Nipomo, California.” The photograph has come to encapsulate the whole era not just because it captures what happened but because – given the worry etched across the woman’s face as she holds her young – it also shows how those times felt.To future historians, such films as The Assistant or Never Rarely Sometimes Always could be this image’s 21st-century equivalents. With a new depression looming, there could be more like it to come. If realism is what a crisis calls for, the conditions could hardly be better, which is to say worse.• The Assistant is out now on digital platforms."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a2672ee2fa9c8b33e9a02f6f986509bf715fcec1/0_849_5218_3130/master/5218.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2b89421f0734b355f5aa91aba94ae77a","title":"nigel slater recipe lentils sausage harissa","story":"A richly savoury dinner, given depth by well-browned onions and enlivened with spicy chilli pasteLightly brown 4 fat sausages in a shallow pan with 2 tbsp of groundnut or olive oil.

From easing loneliness to providing food and clothes, we hear how two women and a football club are supporting their communitiesWhile thousands of us have been turning to local mutual aid groups during the pandemic, Lauren Henshaw went one step further.After asking members of her local Facebook group for Cheadle Hulme in Stockport whether there was a Covid-19 support group in the area, Henshaw – an operations director, who lives with her partner, Dave, and two-year-old daughter Beatrice – was surprised to find the answer was a resounding no. “Another woman and I realised nothing seemed to exist, so we discussed setting one up ourselves,” she says.Within days, Henshaw and fellow resident Roshni Latham had launched the Helping Hands Cheadle Hulme Facebook group, with the aim of sharing advice and matching people in need with volunteers or goods. “We bought pay-as-you-go phones and a local printing shop made leaflets which – with the postman’s help – we delivered to vulnerable people, targeting those in sheltered accommodation and the elderly,” she says. “At first, it was a volunteer-led service where people called us and Roshni and I would do things like shop for those who were isolating, pick up prescriptions and walk dogs. Then we started putting shoutouts on the Facebook group to match those in need with people who could help.”In recent weeks, the group’s focus has shifted to include not just older people and high-risk iniduals, but others in need of help too. “Now, most of that demographic have received letters from the government, local medical practices are involved in their care and food is more readily available,” she says. So, the idea of a “family bank” was born, designed to support those who wouldn’t necessarily ask for help. “So many people are falling through the gaps – you have to be registered to receive vouchers from the food bank for example, but many people aren’t yet. Then there are people like hairdressers who lost income overnight. We wanted to help people like that, and be a useful resource to the community.”The family bank works via Facebook requests, with Henshaw and Latham asking members to donate things such as children’s toys or nappies, which are then taken to a local car park for Henshaw to collect. Adhering to strict social distancing guidelines, it’s a major undertaking. “I travel alone, take antibacterial wipes and wear gloves and everybody leaves items in the centre of the car park, and when I drop donations off, I knock on the door and wave from the car at a distance,” she says. Her now-deserted office at a local industrial estate has become a temporary storage space for donations. It isn’t without its difficulties, though. “The sheer scale of donations is huge and social distancing means it’s just me alone. I haven’t had time to sift through it all – I’d like to organise it by age and gender so I can quickly grab what’s needed.”Henshaw and Latham have also enlisted the help of local businesses. “We’ve run Q\u0026ampA sessions with a local HR consultancy for people confused about employment rights or being furloughed. A local accountancy firm has offered free webinars for small business owners, and a nearby golf club has donated soup, which I distribute through local community groups to care homes, hospitals and vulnerable people.” Restaurants have also offered to cook meals, delivered by volunteers.Day-to-day, the pair have little time to stop and think about how far they’ve come. “Sometimes I feel totally overwhelmed – as admins of the Facebook group, Roshni and I are constantly monitoring requests or messages and manning volunteer phones,” she says. “We’re also liaising with people offering services, handing out leaflets, dropping off goods and applying for council grants.” And when daughter Beatrice takes her lunchtime nap, Henshaw takes the opportunity to drop off more donations, with plans already underway to set up a fundraiser to pay for a storage container, cleaning products and ingredients for meals. “I’m not getting much sleep,” she admits. “But then you take a bag of clothes to a family in need and realise why you’re doing it.”Jesse Tan has always provided a lifeline for older people and, alongside a bevy of colleagues and volunteers, she is determined that during the lockdown those same people don’t become isolated.Tan is the office manager of the Friend In Need (FIN) Community Centre in East Barnet, London, and is one of the many people around the country working on the frontline of community care during the Covid-19 crisis. “I live everyday knowing that our jobs are making a very significant difference to the people who are now locked down, desperate at home,” she says.Usually a busy day at the centre would involve welcoming visitors for anything from yoga classes, to tai chi or lunch clubs. “Our main reason for doing that is to battle loneliness, it’s a lot of prevention work because people come to build friendships and to socialise.”But the day after the nationwide lockdown was announced, on 23 March, that all changed. With all of their usual activities put on hold, Tan and her colleagues had to swiftly mobilise to provide support for their clients, who are on average aged between 85 and 90.They created both a Covid-19 community response group, to help with shopping, prescriptions and small DIY jobs, and a specialised mental health fitness team, to provide a check-in service over the phone. “Some had no one to collect their prescriptions or no food, or they had minor damages to their homes that made them worried or anxious,” she says. “Our calls have been very welcome as they were getting into a state of desperation, which – if not attended to – might trigger more severe problems.”Thankfully FIN has been inundated with offers of help from local people. “We have been recruiting volunteers who are placed in contact with an older person to make sure they are looked after. I can sense the spirit of community, because most of the people who have come forward to support us are people who wouldn’t usually.“I interview every new volunteer personally, and it does come across very clearly that we all have good in ourselves and it will come out at a difficult time. It’s the human in us.”As Tan explains, small acts of kindness by multiple iniduals can, together, make a huge positive impact within a community. “All of the volunteers do a small part of the work. They each carry out one or two small tasks a week, but together the team has made a very significant difference to the services we can provide. I always tell them: ‘Every little helps.’”It is not always easy to provide support though. With their usual schedule cancelled, Tan says that FIN is without a lot of its usual funding: “We normally collect a nominal charity fee from the people who attend our services, but we have lost all that. We have been left with a very small amount of funding. We are at risk of closing down in two months as the money that we’ve been saving has all been invested into the services we provide,” she says. “If people can’t give their time, it would be helpful if they consider donating.”But for those who can give their time, there really is no time like the present, with an estimated 8.8 million people over 70 who have been advised to remain at home.Tan says: “I always tell the younger people I work with: ‘All of us will grow old. One day most of us will need some support. Would you help the people who are old and vulnerable and who need us today? They contributed to this country. They need us now.’”With the football season shut down indefinitely, a team in Scotland, Stenhousemuir FC, turned their energy to the community. Within days of the lockdown being announced a hotline was set up to help local people, and a 30-strong squad of volunteers assembled in the first week to carry out tasks, such as dog walking and shopping, for those in isolation. Since then the number of volunteers has hit 80.The idea has been well received, so much so organisers have branched out to ease the strain on parents by collecting school lunches from a local high school and distributing them to children stuck indoors. On just one day last month, volunteers delivered more than 130 meals.Stenhousemuir FC chairman Iain McMenemy, who helped to organise the initiative, says: “It’s clear that there will be a significant impact on football and we will no doubt be affected by this. However, there are more important matters. The coronavirus will affect thousands within our communities. The wellbeing of friends, neighbours and our community should be our top priority.”This advertiser content was paid for by the UK government.

Not quite on a par with discovering Tutankhamun’s tomb, but he did find a big space, five metres deep, containing old paint tins, bottles, and the remains of a newspaper. The paper was dated 1964. After giving the bottles a wipe down, Jack found them to be etched with details common to the early 1900s.Inspiring.

Then, a few months in, she found out she was pregnant again – just as the coronavirus pandemic hitI stepped out of Oxford Circus tube into mid-morning crowds and cold, bright sunshine. The consultant’s words were still ringing in my ears. “Nothing.” How could the answer be nothing? This was January 2018, six months since my third miscarriage, a symptomless, rather businesslike affair, diagnosed at an early scan. The previous November, I’d undergone a series of investigations into possible reasons why I’d lost this baby and the two before it.That morning, we had gone to discuss the results at the specialist NHS clinic we’d been referred to after officially joining the one in 100 couples who lose three or more pregnancies. I had barely removed my coat before the doctor started rattling off the things I had tested negative for: antiphospholipid antibodies, lupus anticoagulant, Factor V Leiden, prothrombin gene mutation.“I know it doesn’t feel like it, but this is good news,” he said, while the hopeful part of me crumpled. We were not going to get a magic wand, a cure, a different-coloured pill to try next time.Now, my husband, Dan, was back at work and, for reasons I can’t really explain, I had decided to take myself shopping rather than go home after the appointment. I stood staring down the flat, grey frontages of Topshop and NikeTown and willed my feet to unstick themselves from the pavement.I ended up wandering the beauty hall of one of London’s more famous department stores. I let myself be persuaded to try a new facial, which uses “medical-grade lasers” to evaporate pollution and dead skin cells from pores to “rejuvenate” and “transform” your complexion. Upstairs in the treatment room, the form I was handed asked if I’d had any surgery in the past year. I wrote in tight, cramped letters that six months ago I had an operation to remove the remains of a pregnancy, under general anaesthetic. When I handed the clipboard back to the beautician, she didn’t mention it. I wished that she would.As I lay back and felt the hot ping of the laser dotting across my forehead, I thought how ridiculous this all was that this laser-facial is something humans have figured out how to do. How has someone, somewhere, in a lab or the boardroom of a cosmetics conglomerate, conceived of this – a solution to a problem that barely exists – and yet no one can tell me why I can’t carry a baby?There is no doctor who can reverse a miscarriage. Generally, according to medical literature, once one starts, it cannot be prevented. When I read these words for the first time, three years ago, after Googling “bleeding in early pregnancy”, a few days before what should have been our 12-week scan, I felt cheated. Cheated, because when you’re pregnant you are bombarded with instructions that are supposed to prevent this very thing. No soft cheese for you. No drinking, either. Don’t smoke, limit your caffeine intake, no cleaning out the cat’s litter tray. I had assumed, naively, that this meant we knew how to prevent miscarriage these days, that we understood why it happened and what caused it that it could be avoided if you followed the rules.You learn very quickly that the truth is more complicated. After a miscarriage, no medic asks you how much coffee you drank or if you accidentally ate any under-cooked meat. Instead you find that miscarriage is judged to be largely unavoidable. An estimated one in five pregnancies ends in miscarriage, with the majority occurring before the 12-week mark. Seventy-one per cent of people who lose a pregnancy aren’t given a reason, according to a 2019 survey by the baby charity Tommy’s. You are told – repeatedly – that it’s “just bad luck”, “just one of those things”, “just nature’s way”.Just, just, just. A fatalistic shrug of a word. But this is not the whole story. “There is this myth out there that every miscarriage that occurs is because there’s some profound problem with the pregnancy, that there’s nothing that can be done,” says Arri Coomarasamy, a professor of gynaecology and reproductive medicine, and director of the UK’s National Centre for Miscarriage Research, which was set up by Tommy’s in 2016. “Science is trying to unpick that myth.”Unfortunately, the roots of this myth run deep. It’s an idea reinforced by the social convention that you shouldn’t reveal a pregnancy until after 12 weeks, once the highest risk of miscarriage has passed. It goes unchallenged thanks to age-old squeamishness and shame around women’s bodies, and our collective ineloquence on matters of grief. The bloody, untimely end of a pregnancy sits at the centre of a perfect Venn diagram of things that make us uncomfortable: sex, death and periods.There is a magical feeling that comes on after a miscarriage, I have found. A semi-delusional state that lasts for days, sometimes weeks, afterwards. After each one of mine (and there have been four now), I’ve caught myself believing I am still pregnant, despite all evidence to the contrary – the trips to A\u0026ampE, the blood, the still ultrasounds, the forms labelled “sensitive disposal of pregnancy remains”.It starts in the mornings. For a moment, stuck somewhere between sleeping and waking, I won’t have remembered, and, briefly, I’m still happy. Pregnant. When the phone rings, for a split second I’ll imagine it is the hospital calling to tell me there has been a mistake. A mix-up. They’ve got the results: I am, in fact, still pregnant. Or my husband will say, casually, over dinner, “Oh do you want to hear some good news?” and I’ll think: he’s going to tell me I’m pregnant.It is the shock, I remind myself, the trauma: it leads to disbelief. Like feeling that the loved one who has died is about to walk through the front door any minute and sit in their favourite chair. This inability to accept reality seems logical to me – inevitable, even – when there is no explanation for what has happened. The brain wants to solve problems, to make meaning.There are very few specialist miscarriage clinics in the UK. Some people end up being seen by a general gynaecologist or sent to a fertility clinic. Generally, doctors will only agree to look for a possible cause of miscarriages once you have had three in a row. Even after investigations, which in NHS centres tend to look for structural problems with the womb and for blood-clotting disorders, around half of people will never be given a reason for their losses. There aren’t even official guidelines on preventing miscarriage – only on its diagnosis and “management”.With no answers to your questions – why did it happen? Will it happen again? – you are cut adrift in a sea of recommendations from women on Mumsnet, private doctors, people offering fertility supplements, herbalists and nutritionists, and from cult best-sellers that promise to tell you how to improve the quality of your eggs. It’s been more than 40 years since embryologist Jean Purdy watched as a single-cell embryo in a petri dish ided into two, then four, then eight cells that would become the world’s first IVF baby. Humans have worked out how to intervene in order to create life in a lab, but not how to sustain it in the earliest weeks inside the body. The stage between conception and an ongoing pregnancy, visible on an ultrasound scan (at around six weeks) is sometimes referred to as the “black box” of human development.According to Prof Nick Macklon, medical director of the London Women’s Clinic and an expert in miscarriage and early pregnancy, the reason there’s been so little progress is that we’ve been asking the wrong questions. “We use the term ‘recurrent miscarriage’ as if it were a medical diagnosis, yet there isn’t one single medical cause,” he said. Some women may have a blood-clotting disorder for others, a contributing factor could be thyroid dysfunction. Many women who miscarry appear not to have an underlying health condition at all instead, their bodies seem to be less able to discern what is and isn’t a viable embryo. Yet studies of possible preventative treatments tend to recruit their subjects as if all recurrent miscarriages have the same cause.This, in Macklon’s view, is likely to explain why several large, quality trials of possible treatments to reduce the chance of miscarriage, such as heparin (a blood thinner) and aspirin, as well as the hormone progesterone, have failed to show any clear benefit, and have subsequently been dismissed by the medical community. Some of these treatments may in fact work for some women, but, Macklon says, “because of the way the study is designed, it comes out as not working overall”.A related problem lies in the mistaken assumption that most (if not all) miscarriages happen because the pregnancy was doomed to fail. In half of all miscarriages, the embryo will have a serious chromosomal abnormality that means it could never survive, but the other half are believed to be healthy embryos. Prof Siobhan Quenby, a consultant obstetrician at University Hospitals Coventry and Warwickshire, heads up a specialist clinic into recurrent miscarriage, one of four centres that form Tommy’s National Centre for Miscarriage Research. The key question, she believes, is establishing whether someone is repeatedly losing chromosomally normal or abnormal pregnancies. “Everyone from their third miscarriage onwards should have their miscarriage tissue tested genetically,” she said.Yet access to genetic testing is patchy. Not all NHS hospitals can do this kind of testing on site. If someone miscarries at home, the onus is on them to collect a clean sample of the tissue and take it to their hospital within 24 hours. This may not be something they can do – or even know about.Quenby is a celebrity in the world of recurrent miscarriage patients. Her name often crops up in the “miracle baby” stories that make the papers, with headlines such as “Baby joy for couple who lost 13 babies to miscarriages”. Her particular area of interest is how the lining of the womb behaves in early pregnancy – and how it might contribute to miscarriage. She is one of the authors of a study published in January 2020, which found that a repurposed diabetes drug, sitagliptin, could reduce the risk of miscarriage by boosting the number of stem cells in the womb lining. These cells are responsible for renewing the lining and reducing inflammation. “It’s still only a small pilot trial, but it is fantastically exciting,” Quenby told me. “It’s the first time in a long time that there’s been a potential new drug treatment.”Quenby is convinced it’s not so much the treatment options that are lacking, but the will to try them. “It’s the opposite of ‘we can’t do anything’,” she said. “There are tons of things we can try now.” Still, as a miscarriage patient, you run up against the dilemma that recurrent miscarriage is not a diagnosis in itself, so the difficulty is in establishing which treatment is most appropriate to you. Even with the help of the most motivated of doctors, there is going to be a degree of trial and error.Many people will be told, as we were, that the best treatment is no treatment – simply try again. This is what we did, only to miscarry for a fourth time. We were under the supervision of the recurrent-miscarriage clinic, yet even after that fourth loss, the prescription remained the same: just keep trying.It took us a year before we felt ready to roll the dice again. Shortly after I started researching this piece, in November, I found out I was pregnant for the fifth time.To be pregnant again after previous miscarriages is to live at the fork of two alternative lives. You try to think as little as possible about what’s going on inside your body, while, of course, thinking about it all the time. Alive or dead? Baby or miscarriage? In every possible scenario, you plan for the two outcomes. To a certain extent, you are forced to buy into both possibilities simultaneously. You cannot truly believe it will work out, but you have to proceed as though you are pregnant anyway, until a scan proves otherwise. Alive and dead. Schrödinger’s foetus.You treat yourself as your own walking research study: a sample of one. Perhaps you take a different brand of prenatal vitamin. Or you do different exercise. You do no exercise at all. You drink less caffeine. You drink no caffeine at all. You are more careful. You are less careful, because you’ve been unimpeachably careful before and look where it got you. Mostly, though, you just wait.Why hasn’t miscarriage medicine moved faster or farther? Why isn’t there more certainty about what works and what doesn’t? The first detailed depictions of a human embryo’s development, from three weeks to four months, were produced by the German anatomist Samuel Thomas Soemmerring in 1799, and the images are remarkably similar to graphics used in week-by-week pregnancy apps today. Yet a precise schema of measurements to date the stages of early pregnancy – between seven and 16 weeks – wasn’t established in modern clinical practice until 1973, with the advent of ultrasound imaging. We had put a man on the moon before we could routinely see, in real time, what was happening inside a woman’s womb.Pregnancy research, in general, is underfunded. A recent research review, published in January 2020, found that for every £1 spent on pregnancy care in the NHS, less than 1p is spent on pregnancy research. “Compared to other areas – such as infertility – miscarriage has certainly lagged behind,” said Arri Coomarasamy, who sees patients in both fields.“Miscarriage gets a bad deal,” agreed Hassan Shehata, a consultant obstetrician and gynaecologist, who runs the Centre for Reproductive Immunology and Pregnancy, in Epsom, Surrey. “For a start, there is no specialist training,” he said. When you train as a gynaecologist, you can specialise in sub-fields such as infertility and IVF, but there is no specific speciality in miscarriage, he explained.There are also practical difficulties to conducting studies. “Pregnancy is difficult to research as, by its nature, studying it might disrupt it,” Nick Macklon told me. This means you’re often left with retrospective population data (easily skewed by multiple factors), or studying donated embryo or foetal tissue (tightly restricted for ethical reasons – and prohibited altogether by “personhood” laws in some parts of the US, which insist on burial or cremation of all pregnancy tissue).Even when human trials of treatments are feasible, there is the challenge of persuading women who are desperate to avoid another miscarriage to sign up to a study in which they might be given the placebo. As Ippokratis Sarris, a consultant in reproductive medicine and director of King’s Fertility, a private fertility clinic in London, put it: “It’s very difficult to do a proper trial – people want to take something they think might work. How do you tell them they can’t have it until there is good evidence?”Now that I was pregnant again, there was one treatment I was desperate to try. Progesterone has long been the great hope of miscarriage research. This “pro-gestation” hormone is produced in higher quantities during pregnancy by a woman’s ovaries (and, later on, by the placenta). It is essential throughout pregnancy and helps prepare the womb lining, although scientists don’t yet understand the precise mechanisms by which it does this. In May 2019, a large, multi-centre trial of progesterone, given in early pregnancy – the Prism trial – found that for women with a history of recurrent miscarriage who had started bleeding during their next pregnancy, taking progesterone made a significant difference to the live birth rate, compared with a placebo.I was prepared to argue the toss for progesterone with my doctors this time around. I knew the new evidence didn’t perfectly fit our circumstances. I wasn’t bleeding in this pregnancy, for one thing. To my surprise, the female doctor we saw at the clinic for our first appointment, in the first month of this pregnancy, agreed to prescribe it without so much as a raised eyebrow. It was not the first time I have asked about some speculative treatment, but it was the first time the clinic had agreed.As Dan and I joined the queue at the hospital pharmacy, tucked away in a grimy building in Paddington, I felt I was holding on to something bigger than the printed prescription in my hand. For the first time, we had something, after being told that there was nothing.Then less than a week later, at eight weeks pregnant, I started to bleed.There are therapies for miscarriage that have been available privately for well over a decade, yet are no closer to becoming mainstream medicine or available on the NHS. Where questions remain over the evidence, private clinics can go ahead and offer treatment anyway – something the NHS cannot do.One therapy available at a handful of private clinics – lymphocyte immunisation therapy (LIT), in which a woman is given a transfusion of white blood cells from their male partner before she becomes pregnant – has been banned in the US, outside of a research setting. Such treatments belong to a field known as reproductive immunology, and stem from work in the 80s and 90s by an American obstetrician, Alan Beer, who once summed up his theory in the following way: “Effectively, women become serial killers of their own babies.”The idea is that miscarriage can be caused by a hyper-vigilant immune system that misrecognises the symptoms of pregnancy as a threat. In these cases, treatment may involve suppressing the immune system using steroids or intralipids (essentially an emulsion of soybean oil and egg yolk, given intravenously, sometimes referred to as the “mayonnaise” or “egg-yolk” drip). Clinics charge up to £50,000 for such treatments. However, all but one of the experts I spoke to expressed scepticism about their effectiveness.Funding high-quality trials is particularly difficult when it comes to treatments that target the immune system, because, according to Quenby, in the past there has been a tendency to over-hype the results.Quenby believes our understanding of miscarriage would improve if we considered it as a public health issue, as we do stillbirth and neonatal deaths. Both of these are more common where there are high levels of social deprivation, and it’s likely the same is true of miscarriage rates, too. Though, currently, hospital trusts are not required to report the rate in their area.But like periods, female pain, the menopause and conditions such as endometriosis, which also want for good research and understanding, it’s hard not to conclude that miscarriage suffers from a lack of knowledge and interest because it happens to female bodies. What’s more, the underlying assumption tends to be that miscarriage is always down to something a woman’s body is or isn’t doing.In 2019, researchers at Imperial College London found that partners of women who have had three or more miscarriages tend to have higher levels of damage to their sperm’s DNA. The trial was small, comparing the sperm of 50 men whose partners had had miscarriages with 60 men whose partners had not. The results will need to be replicated. And before any possible treatments can be trialled, researchers need to establish what causes such DNA damage.Still, Quenby said, “The fact that we’re even looking at it is really important.” Traditionally, men and their contribution to the pregnancy have been largely left out of the picture. In the past three years, while I have been scanned and probed and pricked for multiple phials of blood, aside from completing a form outlining his basic medical history when we were referred to the recurrent-miscarriage clinic, Dan has not been required to so much as cough and say “ah”.When I discovered I was bleeding, I did a desperate search online for answers. I decided I was either having my fifth miscarriage – or, just possibly, the intermittent, brownish spotting was a side effect of the progesterone. I knew I should phone the recurrent miscarriage clinic, or my GP, or try to get an appointment for a scan at my nearest early pregnancy unit. But I couldn’t bear to. I was not ready to talk practicalities just yet, and there was no one at the clinic to call for the sake of talking. Besides, we were due to go back for a scan the following week.In the following days, the bleeding didn’t stop, but it didn’t get worse, either. Even so, I couldn’t shake the thought that, at eight weeks pregnant, this was the exact same point I had miscarried the last three times. Dan and I made our contingencies. It was early December, and we were due to move house in a few days, and we discussed how we would fit surgery around the move, if it turned out to be bad news. I bought sanitary pads and wine. We pretended we were sanguine. We pretended we knew how we would cope. “We’re pros now,” we joked. I barely slept the night before the appointment.On 4 December, my mum came with us to the hospital and managed to keep up a steady patter about her cycling, her knitting and the roadworks on the A14 while we waited. I knew she wanted to distract me. But the only words my brain had space for were the ones I was convinced I was about to hear for a fifth time: I’m so sorry there is no heartbeat. I’m so sorry there is no heartbeat.When we were finally called in for the scan, I explained to the sonographer that I was anxious. That I’d been bleeding. I tried not to look at the print on the wall of the room – the same room we were in last time – of a red heart, printed in swirly faux-brushstrokes. I tried not to think what I thought last time: how fucking inappropriate that is. A heart, for when there is no heartbeat.I lay down on the bed and unbuttoned my jeans. Dan held my hand. I was braced for the words: So sorry. So sorry. Except they didn’t come. The sonographer was telling us that everything looked fine. She turned the screen towards us, and she was pointing out the flickering heartbeat. She was telling us that I was measuring in at nine weeks and one day. The baby was moving. And I was crying.Did I dare to believe that the progesterone was actually working? The possibility loomed in my mind that our miscarriages really had been “just” bad luck all along. At least one of our losses was down to a chromosomal abnormality known as a triploidy: essentially an extra set of chromosomes. One cause of this is an egg being fertilised by two sperm at once – as random and unavoidable as that.About two weeks after it started, the bleeding waned and our clinic suggested it was time we transferred to our local hospital for antenatal care and the 12-week dating scan. (This is normally the first scan people have on the NHS, at the end of the first trimester, and it’s used to check the foetus’s health and estimate the due date.) On the one hand, this felt like an achievement – we had never made it this far before – but on the other, it meant leaving the relative security of the specialist clinic, where everyone understands why you don’t want to think further ahead than the next appointment.Feeling like fledglings pushed from the nest, we had to brave the official NHS booking-in appointment, which involved giving our medical histories to the local midwifery team and some routine screening tests. We have done this twice before, during previous pregnancies, when we knew and worried less. Two days after the second one, I bled out the tiny embryo on our bed at home. I hadn’t dared make this particular appointment since.We got our all-important appointment for the dating scan, a little over two weeks away – delayed slightly by the Christmas break. Time passed twitchily. We congratulated ourselves for not miscarrying on Christmas Eve, on Christmas Day, on Boxing Day.On 30 December, six hours before the scan, I read a note from the hospital that said you have to pay £5 for a copy of the scan photo. Fleetingly, I debated getting some cash out, but decided this would be jinxing things. At the hospital, I squeaked my name to the receptionist. We were early. This may have been our 12-week scan, but it had taken us 48 weeks of pregnancy to get here. I really wasn’t sure if I could wait another 20 minutes.I had my spiel prepared for the sonographer – “a bit anxious” … “four miscarriages”.“Thank you for telling me,” she said, as I lay down. There was the briefest of pauses. “OK, here’s your baby.”Whereas in previous pregnancies there had only been cavernous blackness on the ultrasound monitor, now there was wobbling movement the grey outline of a head and a tiny, round tummy – a waving, wondrous sea creature emerging from the dark.“They’re a wriggler,” the sonographer told us, smiling. I gripped Dan’s hand and we watched as the baby – I will try to call it a baby from now on – somersaulted for us. For the first time, we left an antenatal unit with a scan photo and stepped out into entirely new territory.On 14 March, we hit 24 weeks, which is deemed the point of “viability” – that is, when a foetus is theoretically capable of surviving outside the womb. Whatever was going to happen to us from now on, it would not be classified as a miscarriage. Keeping this baby alive would no longer be down to my body alone. Should anything happen, doctors would have to at least try to intervene. These were not comforting thoughts exactly, but they were something.Ten days later, the whole of the UK went into coronavirus lockdown. The weekend we had quietly celebrated reaching viability also turned out to be the last weekend I would see anyone but my husband or a healthcare professional for a long time.The initial days of confinement were softened by activity and preparation: batch-cooking, arranging deliveries, cancelling plans. I comforted myself by reading the official Covid-19 guidance from the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists over and over: “There is no evidence to suggest an increased risk of miscarriage … Pregnant women are still no more likely to contract coronavirus than the general population.”Slowly, though, as I watched the number of reported cases and deaths rise, marooned on the sofa at home, fear seeped under the door. Not a day has gone by, since finding out I was pregnant again, that I have not worried that my baby might die. But now, during a global pandemic, those nebulous anxieties hardened into something nameable. The shadow on the nursery wall had taken a solid shape.I woke up one night in the first week of lockdown feeling hot, my throat tight. This is it, I thought – I’ve caught it. I had barely been outside for a fortnight, though I did get my hair cut a few days before lockdown was declared. And so the taunt went round and around in my head, as I stared at the ceiling unable to sleep: your baby could die, and all for the sake of your split ends. In the rational light of day (and feeling fine), I concluded it had probably been heartburn.The world shrank. I baked bread and planted herbs. I silenced notifications and deleted social media accounts from my phone. I tracked my daily steps and counted my baby’s kicks using an app. Mixed in with the fear and stress of uncertainty, there was also a guilty kind of sadness for the things I would not get to do – things I had dreamed of for so long: a “last” holiday as a couple, showing off my bump in my first maternity dress, meeting new “mum friends” for coffee.People phoned to ask how we were coping, but it felt selfish to admit to such small sadnesses, when there were bigger worries: for my brother, who had to postpone his wedding for my cousin, who is a nurse for our four grandmothers, who all live alone. Then there were the worries of people I don’t know, but who could so easily have been us: those who have had their fertility treatment cancelled, or who will be told they have miscarried during scan appointments they have had to attend alone, in order to protect other patients and NHS staff. At the time of writing, hospitals were being advised not to offer extra scans in early pregnancy, even for people with a history of miscarriages.On 17 April, week four of lockdown, I attended an appointment for a 28-week routine growth scan by myself, while Dan, following the new rules, waited in the car. A security guard at the door checked my name off a list. The sonographer and midwife I saw wore masks and visors, while the doctor conducted my appointment from the opposite end of the consulting room. I projected my voice, like a bad stage actor: “No, no family history of diabetes”, and so on.On some days, it has felt as though the pandemic has brought my experience of pregnancy closer to the curve of normality. For so long, I had felt as if I was only playing at pregnancy, like a small girl with a cushion up her jumper. I couldn’t trust that I would get to do things other pregnant women take for granted. But then, suddenly, no one else was going to antenatal classes, throwing baby showers or browsing department stores for the perfect pram either.The temptation, when you get to where we are now, still pregnant after so many losses – and in the shadow of loss on a global scale – is to start talking about miracles. But I don’t believe in miracle babies any more. I believe we should be able to put our faith in the evidence, in knowledge of how our bodies work – or don’t work. That waiting and hoping isn’t enough. Even so, as I sit here, in my fifth pregnancy, in the third trimester, wearing my very first pair of maternity jeans, feeling our baby kick inside me, it is hard not to consider it a wonder that any of us gets to be here at all. Especially when there is still so much we don’t know.• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, and sign up to the long read weekly email here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/67bb4186bd72e3bff801ee8519bafa1113fd091a/0_122_4819_2893/master/4819.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2a3e03359f2483f003e8907ef5ae13c6","title":"feely lousy how getting iso nits was a surprisingly positive experience","story":"The lifecycle of head lice is long – which is why Cat Rodie felt disbelief when, five weeks into isolation, she realised why her family’s scalps were itchyWe were in our fifth week of lockdown when my eight-year-old daughter, Cerys, started complaining that her head was itchy. I didn’t think twice about it – “You just have a dry scalp,” I told her.The itching, along with the complaining about the itching, intensified. I got her some anti-dandruff shampoo.It didn’t occur to me that her itchy head could be nits. Perhaps if she’d been going to school I might have twigged sooner. There would have been an exasperated little note from her teacher, “Please check your children’s hair, we’ve had another case of head lice … ” followed by confessions and sympathy in the year 4 WhatsApp.Then my head started itching. My 10-year-old daughter Grace’s head started itching too. The penny dropped. I tentatively parted Cerys’ hair and groaned as I saw the eggs.I performed a quick one-woman demonstration of parts one to three of the seven stages of grief. Disbelief (Surely we can’t have nits? We’ve been isolating for five weeks!), denial (SURELY WE CAN’T HAVE NITS? WE’VE BEEN ISOLATING FOR FIVE WEEKS!) and guilt (I’m so sorry that I fobbed you off with anti-dandruff shampoo when you actually needed fast-acting head lice treatment).Eventually I got my act together and made a dash to the chemist. The pharmacist patiently explained that, while the girls have been at home, the nit lifecycle is quite long. In other words, the nits had been isolating with us from the start.I was 16 the last time I had nits. My then 13-year-old stepbrother had picked them up and lovingly shared them with the rest of the family. The smell of the head lice formula left me as dizzy, as did the indignity of being a teenage girl with head lice. I’ve heard that 90s nostalgia is big right now so I suppose getting nits was fairly well timed.Despite having nits in my childhood, I’d never had to deal with them as a parent. My girls had managed to avoid catching them – I credit my anti-nit plait-buns – that’s a hairstyle, not a baked good. Although I’d heard tales of the Nitty Gritty fine-tooth comb, I’d never actually used one. The three of us (the infested ones) huddled together on the sofa and read the instructions.Nits are tricky little buggers. They’re tiny and quick and difficult to see. Even with a liberal coating of head lice treatment (which smells a lot better than it used to), it was apparent that this was going to be a long afternoon. Fortunately, given that it happened in the middle of the lockdown, we didn’t have anywhere else to be.We made the best of it (stage seven – acceptance). I told them stories about the terror of being hauled out of class by the nit nurse. They made a list of all the kids they knew who’d had nits (almost all of them). It was a methodical job so, in a warped way, it was an exercise in mindfulness. While it wasn’t ideal, there was a simple joy in being in it together.When it was my turn my girls worked together, one combing with a reassuring running commentary, and the other squirting the treatment on. It should have been grim, like the memory of the nit nurse, but it was surprisingly relaxing.I never expected a day that started with an itchy head to end like this. My girls took great care in their work and, more than anything, I felt loved."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/460de4785dddaa8f27d5249523afc0cb4422592b/0_157_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8cb91480ca37bf60358edd5e9357534e","title":"the global race for face masks podcast","story":"The world economy may have dramatically dipped and the price of oil crashed, but one commodity is seeing an unprecedented boom: the face mask.

But he may struggle to win support from the unions, who traditionally occupy the role of general secretary.Among the favourites to replace Formby, the director of external relations at the GMB union is known as an extremely capable backroom dealer who has guided the union through tricky times with employers and Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour party.

She has denied any wrongdoing.A popular member of Jeremy Corbyn’s 2015 leadership campaign, she would be expected to command the support of many on the left of the party. She may suffer objections from some Starmer supporters because, like Formby, she is a Unite-backed official and is closely associated with Corbyn ally Len McCluskey.Scottish Labour’s former general secretary stood down in August after a row about the party’s position on a second independence referendum. He has been mentioned as a possible candidate by some on the right of the party.Some Labour sources have hinted that Starmer may wish to break with tradition and look for a candidate outside the party – an organiser from a third-sector body who will shake up the structures of the party without setting up their own power base."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2b24f2489b5a64b5b5fc048787ed2b6a7ad78a27/0_0_5000_3002/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=340807d50e49c61dfa852d1b0702b02b","title":"china launches new rocket into space as it steps up moon landing plans","story":"Space agency tests design that is billed to replace current Shenzhou module, a copy of Russia’s Soyuz China has successfully launched a new rocket and prototype spacecraft, according to state media, in a major test of its ambitions to operate a permanent space station and send astronauts to the Moon.A Long March 5B rocket took off from the Wenchang launch site on the southern island of Hainan and eight minutes later an unmanned prototype spacecraft successfully separated and entered its planned orbit, Xinhua reported.

The former Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith said: “A lot of people over 70 are fit and have kept themselves fit, often more so than people of other ages. There has been a backlash and people don’t think it’s the right way to go about it.”However, it emerged on Tuesday that the government’s scientists in March modelled an extended lockdown of 17 weeks for older people compared with eight to 13 weeks for the rest of society, as part of their advice on how to contain coronavirus.Ministers are understood to have considered the idea of different rules for older people, and Matt Hancock, the health secretary, did not rule it out when pressed about the idea on Tuesday. A spokesman for No 10 also said this week it was “perfectly reasonable that we will look at how guidance will apply for different age bands and we’ll continue to be guided by the science”, and stressed that there was a higher risk of coronavirus having a more serious impact for people as they got older.The government is expected to announce on Thursday that the lockdown will have to continue for the time being. Boris Johnson will set out plans for the next phase of tackling the virus on Sunday, including how restrictions could be lifted when it is safe to do so. The first secretary of state, Dominic Raab, has said the next phase should be “more comfortable, more sustainable” for the public.Downing Street confirmed on Tuesday that restrictions on outdoor activities were likely to be lifted first. “There is less likelihood of transmission of disease outdoors than indoors, and that is something we will be considering as part of the review,” the prime minister’s official spokesman said.The Edinburgh proposal could provide a plan for how different age groups or sections of society with different risk profiles could be treated. In a study outlining the strategy, the researchers describe a number of scenarios where the measures come into force over a three-month period.R, or the \u0027effective reproduction number\u0027, is a way of rating a disease’s ability to spread. It’s the average number of people on to whom one infected person will pass the virus. For an R of anything above 1, an epidemic will grow exponentially. Anything below 1 and an outbreak will fizzle out – eventually.At the start of the coronavirus pandemic, the estimated R for coronavirus was between 2 and 3 – higher than the value for seasonal flu, but lower than for measles. That means each person would pass it on to between two and three people on average, before either recovering or dying, and each of those people would pass it on to a further two to three others, causing the total number of cases to snowball over time.The reproduction number is not fixed, though. It depends on the biology of the virus people\u0027s behaviour, such as social distancing\u0026nbspand a population’s immunity.\u0026nbsp“The strategy works by concentrating efforts to control Covid-19 in the segment of the population that most needs protecting,” said Mark Woolhouse, a professor of infectious disease epidemiology at Edinburgh University.Woolhouse stressed that the approach was not a magic bullet, adding that it would need to be combined with contact tracing and other measures to allow Britain to ease some of its lockdown restrictions. As scientists learned more about who was most vulnerable to the virus, the number of people who needed shielding could be reduced, he said.Woolhouse, who said he was speaking as an independent scientist, is a member of the UK government’s scientific pandemic influenza group on modelling (Spi-M), which is chaired by Prof Graham Medley, a co-author on the paper. Medley was one of the first scientists to discuss how the population might acquire “herd immunity” as the epidemic swept through the country. The work has been peer-reviewed by the Royal Society’s newly formed Rapid Assistance in Modelling the Pandemic (Ramp) group.Sarah Harper, a professor of gerontology at Oxford University, who was not involved in the research, raised concerns about considering all people over 70 as vulnerable, even if that changed over time. “Using chronological age without taking into account iniduals’ health conditions will confine healthy, active, older iniduals to their homes,” she said.“Easing lockdown might be more effective if the risks were explicitly explained to the population, the possible range of vulnerabilities highlighted and iniduals asked to take appropriate action. These are sensible public health approaches which might have a better chance of being complied with,” Harper added."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/156461345b0d175436eba6cd095ce485a2391a34/0_207_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eea505daefa641248ed120b2b4746513","title":"rnli could cover fewer beaches if lockdown is eased","story":"The Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) is planning to provide lifeguard cover on about a third of the beaches it normally patrols if the lockdown is eased.Usually 1,600 lifeguards keep watch at 248 beaches around the UK and the Channel Islands but the charity is drawing up plans to cover about 70 of its usual spots in high summer if government guidance allows.RNLI planners are ploughing through data to pinpoint factors such as the busiest beaches and those where they have carried out the most rescues to work out which ones to patrol.They will also try to get an even spread of beaches around the UK to discourage a rush towards one well-guarded region.Earlier in the Covid-19 crisis, the RNLI warned it would be very difficult to suddenly ramp up its service because not enough lifeguards would have been trained.But it is planning to try to get around this by using experienced lifeguards who can be trained quickly, rather than taking on new ones.RNLI chief executive, Mark Dowie, said: “The RNLI is incredibly proud of its highly skilled lifeguards who work alongside the lifeboat crews, HM Coastguard and other emergency services.“RNLI lifeguards are professional lifesavers and will be essential when the lockdown is lifted and people head to our coastlines and enjoy our beaches.“The current situation means that the operational logistics and training behind setting up a lifeguard service – normally in full swing at the moment – have had to stop.“Re-establishing this infrastructure and distributing equipment to beaches will take time. And we must also make sure that conditions are safe for our lifeguards to provide an effective service – our priority remains the safety of our people and the public.“But despite these challenges, and given enough notice of lockdown lifting, we’re hoping to put lifeguard patrols on around 70 beaches.“We are planning for a service that we can adapt to changes in government guidelines and restrictions. We don’t know what social distancing restrictions will be in place, or whether we’ll have periods where restrictions are relaxed and then reintroduced.”The RNLI is urging everyone to follow government guidance and recommends that the permitted daily exercise is not on or in the sea."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/54dbd642c79dbdba2da8c723a51bf6bdd1f82c00/0_373_6000_3604/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4935451e4dfc2ecc4ba77b7a7417126f","title":"british sport devastating 700m black hole covid 19 pandemic","story":"The devastating financial effect of coronavirus on British sport was laid bare on Tuesday with the Football League, the Rugby Football Union and the England and Wales Cricket Board revealing they could lose more than £700m between them in the next year.With Premier League clubs also facing a potential £750m TV shortfall if the football season does not resume this summer, the financial damage to sport from Covid-19 is likely to run into billions.That, however, is only the tip of the iceberg with UK Sport also confirming that six unnamed Olympic and Paralympic sports are facing a threat to their solvency within the next three months because they are unable to host events and membership fees and sponsorship have dried up.Such is the severity of the problem – first revealed by the  last month – that the chair of UK Sport, Dame Katherine Grainger, has asked the government for £53.4m in exceptional funding “within weeks” to ease the financial uncertainty for Great Britain’s athletes and sports as they prepare for the postponed Tokyo 2020 Olympics and Paralympics, now to be held in 2021.“Sports are already struggling from loss of revenues from sponsorship, membership fees and events being cancelled,” Grainger said. “So if we can give them the reassurance that their long-term funding is in place, then they will not need to make decisions that could be quite disastrous for their sports.”But as the digital, culture, media and sport select committee was told, all sports are facing crippling costs owing to being unable to hold matches in front of spectators. Tom Harrison, the chief executive of the ECB, warned that English cricket could lose as much as £380m if there is no play this summer.“We are still working on impact of Covid-19 across the entire game, but we anticipate the cost of no cricket this year could be as bad as £380m across all of our professional clubs and the ECB,” Harrison told MPs. “That is the worst-case scenario.”There will be no professional cricket in England until at least 1 July and the Hundred, the governing body’s flagship new competition, has been postponed until 2021. Harrison said he still hoped some international cricket would take place behind closed doors “with a following wind”, including England’s matches against West Indies, Australia, Pakistan and Ireland.However, he conceded: “We staring at a £100m-plus loss this year whatever happens. We are going to have to take a good look at our cost base … and cut our cloth accordingly. We have less money coming into the sport. It is the most significant financial challenge we have ever faced.”The chairman of the English Football League, Rick Parry, painted a similarly bleak picture when he spoke to MPs, telling them the 71 lower league clubs were facing a £200m black hole by September.Parry said it was impossible to predict how many clubs could go under but was adamant English football would have to undergo huge changes, including a salary cap for players, to sustain itself in the years ahead.“There is a need for a reset – it’s overdue and it’s necessary. We need a rescue package and we need to address the longer term otherwise we will be back into problems in two to three years. We are heading for a financial hole of £200m by the end of September. Clubs are stacking up creditors and there are many uncertainties.”Parry warned of a “very messy” legal battle if the Premier League tried to deny promotion to the three clubs from the Championship – adding that “lawyers are going to get very wealthy if that happens”.Bill Sweeney, the chief executive of the RFU, said his organisation could lose £107m in the next year if England’s autumn internationals and the Six Nations Championship were cancelled.That figure would be reduced to £85m if games against New Zealand, Argentina, Tonga and Australia at Twickenham in November were played without fans. But Sweeney warned the RFU may end up needing a government bailout.He said: “It is a very significant loss of revenue and we are doing what we can to mitigate it. If this was to be prolonged and go through into the next summer and the Six Nations games were impacted, then there would be a catastrophic impact on rugby union in England.”In Sweeney’s view it could take between four and six years for the RFU to recover financially from the coronavirus crisis. He also confirmed that despite cutting costs, the RFU would be reporting £15m losses at the end of this financial year next month."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/373bb0bc1852a73b8007fa4a9cbda1475865706b/0_360_5320_3192/master/5320.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3c0fecd2018343a7837c05163adfc9fc","title":"sam cane named surprise new all blacks captain","story":"Sam Cane has been named captain of the All Blacks in a surprise announcement from new coach Ian Foster. Chiefs flanker Cane, 28, will replace Kieran Read, who retired from Tests after New Zealand placed third at last year’s World Cup.It is the first significant act from new coach Foster, who had given no indication that he was considering his leadership options, particularly with the coronavirus pandemic having halted the sport and leaving a question mark over when the All Blacks will play again.The appointment was also a mild surprise, with experienced lock Sam Whitelock having been considered a strong contender as skipper. However, Foster has plumped for the tough 68-Test openside specialist, who has led his country three times previously.Cane made his All Blacks debut in 2012 and was captain against Namibia at the World Cup three years later, becoming the fifth-youngest captain of the 67 men who have held the role. Foster said while the All Blacks’ plans for 2020 were still to be clarified, there was already an important role for Cane to fulfil.“We wanted to confirm Sam now because he’ll play a key role helping us plan for whatever the future looks like and will be working behind the scenes with the other leaders,” Foster said. “Sam is a ‘follow me’ type of leader and a very good thinker in the game. He has a natural ability to connect with everyone in the team and is straightforward and direct when he needs to be.”Cane, who began his Test career primarily as a backup to former skipper and all-time great Richie McCaw, felt he had grown into a leadership role.“As I’ve spent more time in the All Blacks and grown as a player, I’ve become a lot more comfortable being a leader in the team,” he said. “While we don’t know yet what the rest of the year looks like for the All Blacks, I’m looking forward to catching up with the coaches and other senior players as we firm up our plans.”He helped the Chiefs win successive Super Rugby titles in 2012-13 and became their co-captain for four seasons before taking sole charge this year.Cane’s career was left teetering when he fractured his neck during a Test against South Africa in Pretoria in 2018 but he recovered sufficiently to return last year and contest a second World Cup."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7c1a492ce2bedf2dcc11414504b070382e0199cd/16_41_1955_1173/master/1955.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=348fce4c4f6953ceb574d6adf2fbd2b1","title":"vijay singh complicated relationship with the world of golf","story":"Fijian beat Tiger Woods in his pomp at Augusta in 2000 but this complex character seems happy to shun the limelightAnniversaries of the sporting kind may be the only currency to soar in a pandemic. With live action paralysed, it isn’t difficult to envisage starved writers scraping around for first-hand accounts of Pindarrie’s triumph in the 2000 Guineas of 1820.Using an equine analogy, Vijay Singh was unquestionably a thoroughbred. The Fijian spent 32 weeks as the top-ranked golfer in the world. He defeated Tiger Woods in his pomp and returned three major victories in a professional haul of 64. In 2004, Singh won nine times. He sits fourth in the PGA Tour’s all-time money list, having collected more than $71m.April came and went without celebration of Singh’s finest hour. Twenty years had passed since he claimed the Masters. Woods, Ernie Els and David Duval couldn’t keep pace as Singh prevailed by three. Singh was already a US PGA champion but this meant more: Augusta National’s shameful history of racism was thrown back into sharp focus by a black man donning the Green Jacket for only the second time.Singh didn’t grow up in poverty but he didn’t have much. Coconuts took the form of golf balls and he crawled through a drainpipe to reach his local course. Pieced together, his story should be one of fairytale instead, it is barely acknowledged. The relationship between the golf world and Singh is a complicated one, emphasised when I got in touch with his management to speak to the 57-year-old about events of 2000 at Augusta. “Vijay would rather pass on the opportunity,” came the reply in respect of a wholly positive topic.There was no scope to take the refusal personally Singh didn’t appear in any alternative outlet. The affair conjured memories of approaching Singh before the 2011 Masters, when compiling the kind of vox pop that causes golf reporters undue stress. “Huh?” was Singh’s initial retort. He subsequently and briefly answered the trivial question while leaving the impression he would rather be undergoing root canal treatment.That Singh has little time for the media is far from breaking news. As these pages put it in 2003: “This complex and vulnerable man could not care less about schmoozing the men and women who, whatever else they are, are the only real link between him and the public.” The feeling is generally mutual. If Singh has no appetite to offer insight, why should anybody afford him publicity?Nonetheless, when Singh has chosen to open up he shines light into a life less ordinary. In 2008 he reflected, for example, on 1987 when working as a doorman at an Edinburgh nightclub. Singh travelled to the UK to try to qualify for the Open at Muirfield. “The women were the hardest ones to handle,” Singh recalled. “When they fight … goodness gracious me.“The worst part of the job was telling people they couldn’t come in because they were too drunk. It’s tough to always be the bad guy. I remember walking to my car – I had an old jalopy – at two in the morning and worrying about getting attacked. My car was fine if it started right away, but it often didn’t. So it could get a bit scary, wondering if a gang of guys were waiting for me.”Singh was already seen as “the bad guy”. He was banned from the Asian Tour in 1985 after allegations he had doctored a scorecard. Singh maintained his innocence but in golf mud of that kind sticks.The most illuminating and endearing tales of Singh emanate from Scotland’s capital. Willie Dyet was given the task of looking after Singh after he arrived from Malaysia.“He had no money and when I say no money I mean, no money,” Dyet says as he recalls paying £32 after Singh was refused the courtesy of the course at Gullane. Dyet funded new tyres for the jalopy. “But he was an excellent guy, no problem at all. He told me everything, no secrets. And he was totally dedicated to his golf.” Singh spotted Dyet by Carnoustie’s putting green at the 2018 Open, made a beeline for him and chatted with the warmth of an old friend.In 2003, Singh generated unwanted attention again. He was scathing about Annika Sörenstam being allowed a place in a PGA Tour event. “It’s ridiculous,” said Singh. “She’s the best woman golfer in the world, and I want to emphasise ‘woman’. I hope she misses the cut.” Being kind to Singh, who later said he had been misquoted, perhaps he felt his own toil towards the summit of the male game was being undermined by tokenism.A decade later, Singh was embroiled in a more unorthodox controversy. He admitted using deer antler spray, with the PGA Tour quick to launch an investigation due to the presence of the IGF-1 growth hormone. The Tour subsequently said it had “no reason to believe that Mr Singh knowingly took a prohibited substance” after “new information” from the World Anti-Doping Agency “deemed it only fair to no longer treat Mr Singh’s use of deer antler spray as a violation of the Tour’s anti-doping program”. Singh wasn’t placated. The golfer launched a lawsuit while insisting the Tour exposed him to “public humiliation and ridicule”. Here we had the Tour and one of its greatest beneficiaries engaged in warfare. It took until 2018 for an announcement that the matter had been resolved.When asking questions among fellow professionals about Singh, two themes are recurring. Golf-wise, he is described as borderline obsessional and filled with knowledge. Singh’s personality is perceived by many as aloof. “He can be like that with other players unless he likes and respects them, as a consequence he isn’t overly popular,” explains a major champion of Singh’s vintage. “He is a bit of a loner but still works his ass off on his game.” Singh came close to winning the Honda Classic last year his graceful swing has proved enduring.His is an outstanding career, confirmed when Singh gained entry to golf’s hall of fame in 2006. Six years earlier he delivered the marquee moment. Woods won golf’s other three majors in 2000 and the Masters of 2001 and 2002. He has since enjoyed a reincarnation of golf and character Singh has no desire to step into his own conversation.

So how can you impress a potential new boss from home?Candidates in their dressing gowns, dogs and children running about, partners in the background watching TV, or piles of dirty washing up on the kitchen counter – with 25 years in the recruitment sector, David Stone has heard it all when it comes to disastrous video interviews. “When people are working at home, because it’s your personal space, a lot of candidates completely overlook the fact that it’s still a formal first meeting,” Stone, the founder of MRL Consulting Group, says. “It’s amazing what you see going on in the background.”Holding interviews remotely – whether by phone or video – isn’t a new concept, particularly for companies that have built remote, international teams. Nor is the use of technology in the recruitment process, with an influx of artificial-intelligence tools that source and screen candidates hitting the market in recent years. There are algorithms that can analyse candidates’ tone of voice, facial expressions, and speech patterns during video pre-assessments, scoring them against an ideal profile for that role. Graduates have reportedly spent thousands of pounds learning how to beat these systems.But for many companies, still recruiting during the global Covid-19 lockdown, moving the process online can be a daunting prospect. Stone recommends all involved – recruiter and candidate – treat a remote interview like a traditional, face-to-face meeting as much as possible. “Get up, get showered, put a suit on,” he says. “Pay consideration to what can be seen on that camera behind you. Make sure you’ve got an hour’s worth of peace and quiet.” Some candidates may be more nervous appearing on video than they would be in person, he adds. “You’ve got to try and get past that. Build rapport, put them at their ease, get them talking about subjects they’re comfortable talking about so they relax.”Ellie Wilson, the co-founder and operations director of Virtalent, has run hundreds of remote interviews since launching her virtual assistant service six years ago. She’s found the recruitment process much more efficient when it’s all online. “We can go from someone submitting an assessment to having the final interview and running background checks almost within 48 hours,” she says. “I certainly don’t think you lose anything just because you can’t shake that person’s hand. I ask the same questions to a candidate that I would if they were sitting right in front of me. For me, nothing changes – I try to extract the information that I need to be assured that this is the right person for the job: can I see this person working with us, working with our clients? Do they give me confidence?”While recruiters may prefer to do the first round of remote interviews over the phone, Wilson says it is important to see the person you’re speaking to at some stage in the process. That doesn’t have to be via a bespoke HR platform – video conference tools such as Zoom, Skype, and Microsoft Teams work just as well. “If they’re going to be working remotely, you also need to be reassured they have the right set-up at home,” she adds. “I check that they have a dedicated desk area, they have an appropriate seat, and it looks free from distraction.”Candidates and interviewers alike should switch on all equipment 15 minutes beforehand, think about getting the lighting and camera angle right, test microphones, and put phones and any push notifications on silent, says flexible working consultant and executive coach Marilyn Devonish. “When speaking, look directly into the camera so the other person feels like you’re looking at them,” she adds, rather than getting distracted by your own image on the screen (Zoom has a “hide myself” option, which can help). She recommends interviewees also do a practice run-through with friends or family: “Think about making sure your personality comes out. So if you’re going for a job that needs a motivated self-starter, that’s what you’ve got to be when you’re on camera.” Candidates interviewed by video also have the luxury of being able to use printouts of the job description and any other reference notes without the interviewer’s knowledge.Recruiters should be mindful of including more visual and linguistic cues than they might use in person to show they’re following what the candidate is saying. “Things like saying ‘right’, ‘OK’, ‘great’,” Devonish adds. “If the sound drops, this is not the time to be scared or too polite – say: ‘I’m sorry, I missed that.’ Both sides need to make sure they can hear each other clearly.” A clear explanation for how the process will work should also be provided in good time, including the necessary passwords and access links. And always have a plan B. “Let them have a telephone number so that if the technology fails, they can call you. And if something does go wrong, watch how the candidate reacts – if they completely lose their head, that actually tells you a little bit about how they operate under pressure.”Stone believes the Covid-19 lockdown could mark a seismic shift in the way companies operate going forward. “This episode has proven that you don’t have to stop in your entirety when something like this does occur,” he says. “We’ve got some clients who are interviewing remotely and then onboarding new recruits by video too, just having a laptop delivered to their house. They’re hiring highly skilled people having never met them in their lives.”If you are currently recruiting for your schools please contact us by going to recruiters.the and if you are seeking a new role at a school please visit our jobsite"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4bf49803f60b1c5990a8de82a9db3e34413a5d02/0_46_5600_3360/master/5600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6686fc3324dda900adbf1588e6b737cd","title":"sicily to subsidise post covid holidays as italy considers reopening to tourists","story":"• Offer may include three-nights-for-price-of-two deal on accommodation in Sicily, and even cheap flights• Country’s tourism minister dispels talk of Italy being off-limits all yearSicily’s regional government is offering to subsidise holidays on the island for both domestic and international visitors in an effort to kickstart tourism after the coronavirus pandemic. News of the scheme came days before a statement from the Italian government that it expects borders to be open to tourists this summer.A financial pot of €75m of regional government money has been set aside to boost tourism following huge financial losses after the lockdown came into effect across Italy on 10 March. Current plans include subsidising visitors’ accommodation costs, offering one night of a three-night trip for free, or two nights of a six-day trip, as well as vouchers for cultural and heritage activities. The plans were detailed in an interview with Sicily’s tourism director, Manlio Messina, on Italian news show Mattino Cinque. There have been reports that the funding may also be used towards paying for up to half of the cost of flights, but this has not yet been confirmed.Once the lockdown restrictions have been successfully eased further (without a rise in coronavirus cases), more information on how to take advantage of the offers will be posted on the Sicilian tourist board website.Meanwhile, quashing what he called “fake news” reports that Italy may be closed to holidaymakers for the rest of 2020, Dario Franceschini, Italy’s culture and tourism minister, told newspaper Il Messaggero: “I have never talked or ever thought of closing Italian borders to tourists for 2020. I am working towards the complete opposite, and proposed yesterday at a meeting of EU tourism minsters as uniform approach to managing infection risks. We are also starting bilateral talks with other countries that send a lot of tourists to Italy.”This week Italy entered phase two of its lockdown, including the reopening of parks, and restaurants for takeaway meals. Some shops, museums and cultural venues are due to reopen on 18 May, and there is much discussion about managing social distancing on beaches and creating space for more outdoor tables at restaurants.Although he ruled out closing the border, Franceschini added a note of realism: “I imagine, unfortunately, that international tourism will drop sharply this summer – both incoming and outgoing. So we are making a strong investment in domestic tourism, because this will be a summer of holidays in Italy … You have to adopt the right balance between safeguarding health and restarting economic and social life. It must be done with the utmost care. We’re moving one step at a time.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ba412cacb6e452ce5b7501d9963b8a6b69fcdbbb/947_218_3798_2279/master/3798.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=118000853d4ab2b2e49371687891dfc0","title":"forget friends the 25 greatest overlooked sitcoms from lovesick to younger comedy tv shows lockdown","story":"All 4A six-part Channel 4 comedy from 2009 about talent agents, the show starred Stephen Mangan, a pre-stratospheric Sharon Horgan, and features Anthony Head’s greatest ever performance. It made central London look as beautiful as it has ever looked. And yet it came and went in the space of a single series.BBC iPlayerMy theory is that many more people know about Better Things than have actually seen it, thanks in part to the participation and then very sudden non-participation of its co-creator Louis CK. It’s an unvarnished, autobiographical-seeming sitcom about a orced woman (Pamela Adlon) who single-handedly raises three children. It is raw, touching and incredibly funny. And yet the most remarkable thing about is Celia Imrie’s exceptional performance as Adlon’s mother.NetflixNobody watched Lovesick when it was first on Channel 4, because back then it was called Scrotal Recall. Which is a shame, because Tom Edge’s comedy was a thing of true beauty. A man learns that he has a sexually transmitted disease and has to revisit his past partners to let them know. The episodes are told in flashback, as we watch the birth and death of each inidual relationship. Lovesick isn’t just funny it is also exquisitely constructed and beautifully performed.All 4Mark O’Sullivan and Miles Chapman’s mockumentary began as something deceptively broad: a Stath Lets Flats-ish look at two working-class builder brothers from Stevenage. But in this final form, it is much more nuanced and multi-layered than the premise would suggest. It slowly blossoms into a sweet, beautifully observed meditation on fraternal friendship. Sky ComedyA sitcom about a disgraced Harvard professor forced to teach high school biology. Dripping with talent, it is consistently riotously funny and as structurally solid as any sitcom can be. In a parallel universe, this show is as big as 30 Rock. BBC iPlayerThis might be the funniest thing on terrestrial television at the moment. Spencer Jones plays a down-on-his-luck chancer who drifts in and out of absurd situations. A self-playing piano lets him fake his way into a job as a restaurant pianist. A painting and decorating job ends with a visit from the armed response unit. Imagine a much sillier Only Fools and Horses and you’re on the right track.Sky ComedyA show set in heaven that aired at the same time as The Good Place was never going to come out on top. And yet Miracle Workers, in which Daniel Radcliffe plays a celestial worker trying to save Earth from destruction at the hands of an absentee God (played by Steve Buscemi), is arguably just as smart and clever as its more successful peer. The first season is a self-contained story with a finite ending. It will take you a day to watch from start to finish, and your life will be better for it.Sky Comedy The only true post-Friends success an excruciating faux reality show starring Lisa Kudrow as Valerie Cherish, a former sitcom actor bidding for a second shot at success. The Comeback is so funny that you will ache and so unflinching that you will chew the flesh from your hands. AmazonThe third season of Future Man came out a month ago, and nobody seemed to notice. Co-created by Howard Overman (who co-created Merlin and last year’s War of the Worlds), this swing-for-the-fences silly comedy sci-fi is about a gamer who becomes a time-travelling superhero. There is a huge chance that you will forget about Future Man the second it finishes, but at least you will have a good time while it’s on.AmazonMichaela Watkins should be one of the most famous performers in the world and Casual is proof of that. Playing a therapist who moves in with her brother after leaving her husband, Watkins is funny, sexy, sad and raw all at once. It’s a revelatory performance that never quite got the response it deserved. All 4George Jeffrie and Bert Tyler-Moore’s 2010 sitcom is as undemanding as it gets. Rafe Spall plays a slappable man-baby who struggles with the most basic of tasks and interactions, and the whole thing has a running sports-style commentary, which gets old within seconds. But underneath all that, you will find a solid hangout comedy about a bunch of friends in their first flush of adulthood. Now TVDarren Star’s comedy-drama has an excellent premise a 40-year-old single mother must pretend to be 26 to make a success of herself in the publishing industry. What’s more impressive, though, is that Younger is somehow able to sustain this premise for a full series. It is lightweight and disposable, but never manages to fall prey to any of the obstacles that litter its path. For something that could have fallen flat at the first obstacle, it is tremendously well done.All 4A Phoebe Waller-Bridge sitcom about twentysomething property s. The characters are broader than you would expect, and the tone is slightly too twee. Nevertheless, if you squint, you can tell who wrote it. There are moments where the characters sidle up to big realisations and then back away, trapped in the words unsaid. But also there are ukuleles, so tread carefully.All 4One of the best comedies of recent years, The Other Two is as bright and confident as a sitcom can be. Drew Tarver and Heléne Yorke play siblings who get left behind when their 13-year-old brother is catapulted to Justin Bieber levels of fame. Vicious and warm, it might actually be perfect.Now TVLike Casual, Mrs Fletcher isn’t exactly laugh out loud. It is a quiet, slow, contemplative Transparent-esque sadcom about a middle-aged woman rediscovering her sexuality after her son leaves for college. However, it is held together by a towering performance by Kathryn Hahn. With her ability to flit between dozens of directly conflicting emotions in a single take – not to mention the smart, compassionate script by The Leftovers’ Tom Perrotta – Mrs Fletcher is absolutely worth your time.NetflixIf there was a God, he would show us that he loved us by bringing back Great News. Written by 30 Rock’s Tracey Wigfield, it is a frantic workplace comedy that takes place at a cable news show. The hook is that a middle-aged woman takes a job in a newsroom alongside her high-achieving daughter, but really this is just a relentless screwball of a show. The script is perfect. The cast is perfect. Every episode fires on cylinders you didn’t know even existed. YouTubeAdam Pally and Sam Richardson play two members of a rapper’s posse who find themselves trying to adapt to civilian life after the rapper dies. It is an aggressively stupid show, and you will love it with all your heart.Now TVA period comedy starring Don Cheadle, set in the weeks leading up to the stock market crash of 1987, this is both a whirlwind comedy of vulgar excesses and a tightly plotted murder mystery. Almost nobody watches it, which is a crying shame.AmazonArguably the most underrated comedy of recent years, Andy Daly’s Review is a thing of total perfection. Daly plays Forrest MacNeil, a critic who reviews life experiences chosen for him by the public. It starts sensibly enough, with a review of stealing and cocaine addiction. And then comes orce, at which point things really begin to spiral. The genius of Review is how each new indignity piles on top of the last, causing MacNeil to quickly lose his grasp on reality. This show is a masterpiece. If you only watch one thing on this list, make it this.AmazonThis is one of those shows that only really qualifies as a comedy because it is half an hour long. There is a suicide attempt very early on in the series, which is used to vault to a place that deals with heavy issues like depression, homophobia and cancer. Reviews came bookended with the numbers of crisis support services. It is not something to sling on to unwind after a hard day. But if you’re in the mood, it is also so warm and brave that you will want to clutch it to your chest.Now TVIn a way, it is a good thing that Detroiters died, because it freed Tim Robinson to make the untouchable sketch show I Think You Should Leave. But in another sense, it is unbearably sad, because Detroiters was magnificent. Robinson and Sam Richardson play best-friend advertising partners with no money and barely any IQ. Each episode is basically just an excuse to watch Robinson and Richardson tool around like bozos. It will for ever be missed.Apple TV+Like The Morning Show, this is another excellent series that nobody watched because Apple overestimated its own popularity and will go down as a hidden gem. Rob McElhenney from It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia plays the charismatic lead developer at a videogame studio, and we watch as the effects of his obnoxious whims ripple out across his overloaded workforce. Mythic Quest could have simply become another tired old workplace comedy, but there is real artistry to be found here. A highlight is the episode A Dark Quiet Death, which is basically a sweet little indie movie that exists completely outside the universe of the rest of the show.NetflixThis list has been short on Japanese-language sitcoms, and even shorter on sitcoms about pudding-obsessed men who sneak out of work during the day to eat desserts that make them hallucinate and then ejaculate. Reader, Kantaro: The Sweet Tooth Salaryman is that show. It isn’t consistently funny, but it is consistently weird, which is just as good.Now TVDanny McBride is a weird one. On film, where he often appears as a side character in Seth Rogen-y comedies, he comes across as crude and obnoxious. And yet the TV shows he creates are exquisite. Eastbound \u0026amp Down was a classic, Vice Principals was extremely good and The Righteous Gemstones might be his best work yet. As a sitcom about dysfunctional televangelists, it is necessarily satirical, but at the same time it is crude and bleak and – sometimes – surprisingly big-hearted. McBride has stated that he wants this to run for years. Hopefully he will get his chance."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5ab8b79e18601b8fa904188057bd47d656b229fa/0_320_4800_2880/master/4800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b56ab73ac25245646e7265a161cfdbb4","title":"hollywoods jeremy pope is there room for another black man like me","story":"The Broadway actor-turned-breakout star of Ryan Murphy’s new series on representation, prejudice and the high-octane world of Tinseltown past and present‘Can all of us be in the same room at the same time?,” Jeremy Pope asks over the phone from his home in Los Angeles. It is over a month into lockdown, but he isn’t questioning the rules of physical distancing. Rather, the 27-year-old is pondering the unspoken rules of Hollywood prejudice – who gets to share a platform with whom, and whether there’s only space for one minority figure at any given time.Pope’s latest project – his first major TV role – is in Ryan Murphy’s new Netflix series Hollywood, a revisionist story set in 1940s Golden Age tinseltown, where he plays Archie, a gay, black screenwriter who is trying to break into the industry. It is a story he could relate to.“What’s brilliant about our series is that you have a powerful man like Ryan Murphy who is capable of making any type of TV he wants, and then he makes a show like this – showing the world what it could have been,” Pope says. “And I am what it can be, he’s given me my debut TV opportunity. I often feel very similar to Archie and I wonder: is there room for another black man like me?”Hollywood is a lascivious, lustful take on a much-mythologised era, centred on a group of fledgling stars: Pope’s Archie, whose retelling of Peg Entwistle’s suicide is picked up by director Raymond (Darren Criss), and actors Jack (David Corenswet) and Camille (Laura Harrier). Criss and Corenswet are established actors of the Murphy stable, having starred in his previous productions such as Glee, The Politician and The Assassination of Gianni Versace, yet for Pope, Hollywood – the show and the town – was an unfamiliar experience.“I was coming to the end of what I called my marathon when I was cast,” he says. “I was doing eight shows a week on Broadway of Ain’t Too Proud and that was right on the back of Choir Boy, so when I got the call to audition, I was exhausted.” Both shows were tales of the black American experience, albeit in very different ways Choir Boy was a journey of self-discovery set in an elite prep school and penned by Moonlight’s Tarell Alvin McCraney, while Ain’t Too Proud was a musical based on the career of the Motown group the Temptations. Both performances earned Pope Tony nominations, making him only the sixth person in its 73-year history to be up for two awards in one season.When he was offered the role of Archie, it was for an “untitled Ryan Murphy project” and he had no idea what it would entail. “When I met Ryan, we just had a great open dialogue about the show and it was a very collaborative process,” he says. “I soon became really excited about this story and representing a powerful black gay writer in the 1940s, but I needed to be reassured that there were directors and writers that represented me on the show, too.”That support namely came in the form of longtime Murphy collaborator and Hollywood co-writer and co-director Janet Mock. “Janet was my ride or die,” he says. “We got to really dig into these characters and talk about the racial acrobatics these people had to go through. We know how hard it must have been to just be a coloured man in the 40s but then to also be an out gay man? It’s like you already walk into a room with two strikes.”Archie’s scenes in the show are often highly demanding and emotional, tearfully confronting studio executives who seek to erase his experience or demanding recognition in the face of prejudice and privilege, yet Pope found it disconcertingly easy to tap into his narrative. “Doing eight shows a week in theatre means I can deliver that intensity once, or eight times or even 12 – I can bring that discipline,” he says, “but even more than that, with these scenes I would just think about people like Hattie McDaniel, who was the first woman of colour to win an Academy award. But she wasn’t allowed in the ceremony and when she did win, the Academy had written a speech for her. So, I would feel the pain that she had to go through to be a beacon of light for people like me. It’s so heartbreaking and it made me ask just how high am I allowed to dream?”For Pope, that battle to dream big continues. “It’s easy for me to go back to a moment in my life where I felt that maybe I wasn’t good enough or I wasn’t allowed to stand in my truth when I was playing Archie,” he says, referencing his teenage years in Orlando, Florida and trying to become an actor and singer. “Hollywood is a period piece but we can still identify with the struggles of the characters today – we’re still fighting for equal opportunities for women, for people of colour, for the LGBTQ community. I just hope that this show continues to inspire our generation of artists to keep fighting to establish that there is room for all of us.”In the meantime, Pope is spending his lockdown with a well-deserved break from the rigours of filming, “making music, writing and learning how to bake my grandmother’s pound cake”. “In these past couple of weeks I’ve just been able to think of all the moments we’ve had thus far and how great they have been,” he says – taking in the entirety of his community into his third person “we”. “I know that when I get back to work, we will be on that mission just as aggressively as we were before.”Hollywood is available on Netflix

ratcliffe us senate national intelligence","story":"John Ratcliffe was forced to withdraw his nomination for the same post nine months ago for exaggerating his security experienceA Trump loyalist nominated as director of national intelligence (DNI) looked set to sail through Senate confirmation hearings on Tuesday, only nine months after being forced to withdraw for having exaggerated his security experience.John Ratcliffe, a Republican congressman who fiercely defended the president in last year’s impeachment hearings, told the Senate intelligence committee that he would speak truth to power if confirmed as DNI.Ratcliffe was reminded by Democratic senators that his two predecessors had been forced from their posts because the findings of the intelligence community irritated Donald Trump, and that the spy agencies were currently under pressure to provide evidence for Trump’s claim that the coronavirus outbreak started in a Chinese laboratory.“Regardless of what anyone wants our intelligence to reflect, the intelligence I will provide, if confirmed, will not be impacted or altered as a result of outside influence,” Ratcliffe said in his opening remarks at his confirmation hearing, held under social distancing rules, with most of the senators and staff wearing masks. “Above all, my fidelity and loyalty will always be to the constitution and rule of law, and my actions as DNI will reflect that commitment.”However Ratcliffe, a fiercely partisan congressman, dodged questions on which Trump has broken with his own intelligence briefers, such as whether there has been any progress towards North Korean disarmament (there has not) and whether Iran was in compliance with the 2015 nuclear deal when Trump pulled the US out of the agreement (it was).Ratcliffe said that if confirmed, he would focus on the impact of coronavirus, questions about its origins in China and US competition with Beijing.“I view China as the greatest threat actor right now,” he said. “Look with respect to Covid-19 and the role China plays the race to 5G cybersecurity issues: all roads lead to China,” he told the panel.Ratcliffe withdrew his first nomination five days after Trump first named him as a candidate – to widespread surprise – last July, after it was found he had grossly overstated his national security experience.He had falsely claimed on his website to have “arrested over 300 illegal immigrants in a single day” and had “put terrorists in prison” although he had not tried a terrorism case in his time as a US attorney.“I don’t see what has changed since last summer … when the president decided not to proceed with your nomination over concerns about your inexperience, partisanship and past statements that seemed to embellish your record,” the ranking Democrat on committee, Senator Mark Warner, said on Tuesday.However the committee chair, Senator Richard Burr, and the other Republicans on the panel, indicated they would back Ratcliffe’s nomination and quickly put it to a vote in the full Senate, despite a legal requirement that the DNI “shall have extensive national security expertise”.“The Democrats in the committee and the Senate seem strongly opposed, but Ratcliffe seems likely to secure confirmation, probably on a party-line vote,” said Carl Tobias, a University of Richmond law professor.Tobias suggested that Ratcliffe’s promises to be objective may have assuaged doubters on the committee, or that Burr’s standing and independence may have been weakened after he was found to have sold hundreds of thousands of dollars in stocks in mid-February, a few days after publishing a commentary for Fox News claiming that the US was “better prepared than ever before” to confront the virus.Katrina Mulligan, a former official who worked for more than 10 years in the office of the director of national intelligence (ODNI), suggested another factor that has changed since last summer could be that the Senate is eager to replace the current acting DNI, Richard Grenell, another partisan with even less experience than Ratcliffe and who is not answerable to Congress because he is not confirmed in the role.Mulligan added that US intelligence officials may be resigned to Ratcliffe getting the top job for similar reasons.“The morale at ODNI is so low right now and people are so fearful, that I think that there is a real sense that it could be worse,” she said. “There’s this sense that at least he can form coherent sentences, and at least he has a modicum of experience which the current acting DNI really did not.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e3d6870b0c5591020f76a362a4925a2cd7a9b511/0_168_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7d14accafd555d82e87072fc87b62083","title":"rick bright us government scientist complaint hydroxychloroquine","story":"Rick Bright says he was reassigned to lesser role because he resisted pressure to allow widespread use of hydroxychloroquineA US government scientist has filed a whistleblower complaint alleging he was ousted from his position after raising concerns that the Trump administration wanted to “flood” coronavirus hotspots like New York and New Jersey with a malaria drug that Donald Trump was pushing despite scant scientific evidence it helped.Rick Bright, former director of the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, filed the complaint on Tuesday with the Office of Special Counsel, a government agency responsible for whistleblower complaints. He alleges he was reassigned to a lesser role because he resisted political pressure to allow widespread use of hydroxychloroquine, a malaria drug favored by the president.Bright also said the Trump administration rejected his warnings on Covid-19, the disease caused by the virus. Bright said he “acted with urgency” to address the growing spread of Covid-19 after the World Health Organization issued a warning in January.Bright alleges in the complaint that political appointees at the Department of Health and Human Services had tried to promote hydroxychloroquine “as a panacea”. The officials also “demanded that New York and New Jersey be ‘flooded’ with these drugs, which were imported from factories in Pakistan and India that had not been inspected by the FDA”, the complaint says.But Bright opposed broad use of the drug. He felt an urgent need to tell the public that there wasn’t enough scientific evidence to support using the drugs for Covid-19 patients, the complaint states.In a statement issued late last month, Bright said: “While I am prepared to look at all options and to think ‘outside the box’ for effective treatments, I rightly resisted efforts to provide an unproven drug on demand to the American public.”Last month, the US Food and Drug Administration warned doctors against prescribing the drug except in hospitals and research studies. In an alert, regulators flagged reports of sometimes fatal heart-related side-effects among coronavirus patients taking hydroxychloroquine or the related drug chloroquine.The decades-old drugs, also prescribed for lupus and rheumatoid arthritis, can cause a number of side-effects, including heart rhythm problems, severely low blood pressure and muscle or nerve damage.Associated Press contributed to this report"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/29a962165ef5955d285bfbf5fdbf940c1a419763/0_113_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0f7c93636ee2798e144dac5fc5d5b563","title":"do you believe you were infected by coronavirus at a big event in march","story":"We want to hear from those who attended mega-events such as Cheltenham Festival and the Stereophonics concerts in CardiffWe’d like you to help us document the spread of coronavirus due to some of the mega-events that went ahead during the week beginning 9 March.Those events include: the Cheltenham Festival, the Liverpool v Atletico Madrid Champions League tie, and the Stereophonics concerts in Cardiff.Do you believe that you were infected by coronavirus by attending one of these events?You can get in touch by filling in the form below, anonymously if you wish or via WhatsApp by clicking here or adding the contact +44(0)7867825056.

Germany’s six-week lockdown had confined many of the city’s residents to their flats or to struggling to keep physical distance rules in overcrowded green spaces.No more than 1,000 visitors will be allowed in the botanical grounds at one time, and the glasshouses will be closed because physical distancing rules would be difficult to keep.Petra Scharf, a regular visitor before the shutdown, said she had counted the days for it to reopen. “I have a balcony, I’m lucky, but I have missed the expanse of colour and and the smell of the blossom,” the 57-year-old said by phone after her morning visit, during which she said she had kept a safe distance from the friend who accompanied her, pretending to prod him with an umbrella if he got too close.Elsewhere across Germany cultural attractions were slowly beginning to reopen.In Potsdam, south-west of Berlin, the Museum Barberini art gallery was preparing to open its doors on Wednesday, after the lockdown interrupted an exhibition of Monet landscapes only three weeks after it opened.The museum said it had developed a “comprehensive catalogue of protective and hygiene measures”, which include limiting the number of visitors and visitors having to book online and be guided in a strict circular path around the exhibition for a maximum stay of two hours. Audio guides will no longer be for hire while security guards will warn visitors not to get too close to the paintings and each other.“We are very happy to be able to finally make the museum accessible again,” said Ortrud Westheider, the Barberini’s director. “We are also very aware of the responsibility we have towards our guests and employees.”In Dresden the Sempergalerie, one of the country’s biggest tourist attractions, holding a collection of old-master paintings, also reopened on Tuesday. It had reopened at the end of February following a seven-year renovation, only to be closed because of the coronavirus lockdown two weeks later.A lengthy queue had built up in front of the Sempergalerie’s entrance before it opened at 11am. A museum employee explained the hygiene regulations to the visitors, including the obligatory wearing of masks, or nose and mouth coverings, before entry.Commercial galleries across Germany have also started opening their doors. State museums, including tourist magnets such as the Pergamon, the Alte Nationagalerie, and Gemälde Galerie, as well as a range of research institutes and libraries, are due to reopen on 12 May. Visitors are asked, in almost all cases, to book a time slot online. Digital guided tours during the lockdown will remain available for those whose health will not permit them to visit the museums.Elsewhere zoos, several of which suggested that a lack of income meant they might have to kill their animals, have been allowed to reopen for the past week but with considerable restrictions.In Berlin, panda cubs born in September are not on public display, and all feeding times in front of visitors have been cancelled.Nightclubs, concert halls and other cultural institutes where physical distancing is virtually impossible, have so far had no indication from the government as to when and under what conditions they could reopen.A meeting between the government and the country’s 16 state leaders on Wednesday is expected to make decisions on schools and nurseries as well as sporting activities, and to indicate when and under what conditions restaurants and tourist attractions might be allowed to reopen across the country.On Tuesday Bavaria announced a phased reopening of its outdoor restaurants. Several states announced that rambling and hiking was allowed once again, as were other outdoor physical activities not requiring physical contact, such as golf.All large events, such as football matches and other sports contests, music festivals, circuses and fairs, remain banned until further notice.Hairdressers, cosmetic studios, nail and tattoo parlours were given permission to open on Monday, while print shops, and music and driving schools are also open for business again in most German states. Playgrounds have also opened their gates."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0319898e5a8dc1a858c5bc7ee955f8dd45c1b7bf/0_175_5645_3388/master/5645.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dc3e64079f1ded96558ca3a92f2732d1","title":"the high profile figures who got into hot water over lockdown rules","story":"Ministers, scientific advisers and footballers have all been criticised for their behaviourNeil Ferguson is not the first high-profile figure to apparently fall foul of lockdown rules.The housing, communities and local government secretary, Robert Jenrick, was forced to explain himself when it was revealed he had travelled 40 miles to see his parents at their Shropshire home. He was also criticised for travelling 150 miles from his London property, where he stayed at the start of the lockdown, to his Herefordshire home from where he travelled to his parents.Jenrick said that he had gone to deliver food and medicine to his isolating parents, and insisted that returning to his family home was not against the rules, as his work in London at the start of the pandemic was essential.The former Tory minister, Anna Soubry, who left the party in opposition to its stance on Brexit, accused the minister of “selfish arrogance”, tweeting that “telling cramped families in inner city high rises or squeezed suburban homes to #StayAtHome is bad enough, but justifying it by asserting he didn’t break the rules is shameful.”Early last month, the Scottish Sun revealed that Scotland’s chief medical officer, Catherine Calderwood, and her family had visited their holiday home in Earlsferry, Fife, taking walks with their dog to a local beach. She later revealed that they had also visited the home the previous weekend.The Scottish government initially maintained that Calderwood had only visited the house to check in on it and the first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, stood by her. But following mounting criticism – and a formal warning for Calderwood from Police Scotland for breaking the lockdown rules – it was decided that her position was untenable and she quit on 5 April.The Brexit party leader, Nigel Farage, was visited by police after he travelled more than 100 miles to Dover to film a video about immigration. He tweeted: “Lockdown lunacy. Two police officers just knocked on my door to advise me on essential travel. They had received a complaint that I had been to Dover to report on the illegal migrant scandal taking place. What a total waste of time and money.”It was reported that his spokesman insisted Farage was a key worker, who had made essential travel to report on a “scandal”.Former England football captain Wayne Rooney was reportedly told off by police when he was spotted enjoying a stroll with the Manchester City player Kyle Walker. The pair, who live near each other in Cheshire, were walking along Prestbury golf course with their families when they were seen. The Sun reported that the footballers’ children went to the same school and that they had bumped into each other.The story came days after Walker apologised after it was revealed he had invited two escorts to a party at his flat while lockdown rules were in place. The footballer admitted that his actions were in “direct contrast” to messages he had posted on social media, urging fans to follow the rules."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3c464bb69d009f4dc144f449f5d1b8074b8b9d37/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e2618ac23bf0c6ccbdef2b38e2a11855","title":"coronavirus latest at a glance","story":"A summary of the biggest developments in the global coronavirus outbreakKey developments in the global coronavirus outbreak today include:Researchers at Johns Hopkins University say at least 3,656,644 people have been infected since the outbreak began, while at least 256,736 are known to have died. The figures, which are based on official and media reports, are likely to significantly underestimate the true scale of the outbreak.Mike Pence has confirmed that the Trump administration is reportedly looking to wind down the coronavirus task force in the coming weeks, even as the rate of new infections continues to rise across most of the US. Meanwhile at least 70,847 people are now known to have died in the USA, according to the data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. That represents more than a quarter of all pandemic-linked deaths reported across the world.Speaking in Arizona at a factory manufacturing medical masks, Trump said it was time to reopen businesses. “Will some people be affected? Yes. Will some people be affected badly? Yes. But we have to get our country open and we have to get it open soon.” he said.Several Asia Pacific countries are aiming to ease their lockdowns and kickstart their economies, including South Korea, Australia and Hong Kong. Vietnam is also easing its restrictions but the country’s economy, in which tourism plays a major role, faces a severe test. According to the nation’s health ministry, there have been 6,935 new cases of the novel coronavirus in Brazil since Monday evening and 600 new deaths. The previous record of 474 deaths came on 28 April. Meanwhile the capital of tropical Maranhão state ground largely to a halt Tuesday, becoming the first major Brazilian city to enter a lockdown in the hopes of preventing the coronavirus pandemic from overwhelming the health care system of one of the country’s poorest states.Youth unemployment in Britain will reach the 1 million mark over the coming year, a thinktank has warned, saying that Britain faces the risk of a “dole queue” future for young people unless the government provides job guarantees or incentives for school leavers and graduates to stay on in education.The global lockdown caused by Covid-19 risks a “devastating” surge in tuberculosis cases, with nearly 1.4 million additional deaths from the world’s biggest infectious killer by 2025, new research showed on Wednesday. New disease models showed that social distancing could lead to a disastrous rebound in TB infections – the effects of which are set to persist for years. This is because social distancing will make it impossible for health care workers to test vulnerable populations and for patients to access ongoing treatments.After two consecutive days of zero new corona cases reported, New Zealand reported one new case of the virus on Wednesday, and one new death. Director-general of health Dr Ashley Bloomfield said New Zealand wasn’t out of the woods yet and needed to stay the course: “We need everyone to stick to the plan and follow the rules… not doing so risks undoing all of the good work we’ve done so far. Do not give it an inch.”Walt Disney will kick off its strategy next week to begin restoring its lucrative parks business that has suffered $1bn in lost profits from the coronavirus-led shutdown. Disney said on Tuesday it will reopen its Shanghai Disneyland park on May 11 but severely limit the number of guests and enforce strict social distancing measures on rides and in restaurants."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/05ac214293bc3086e12cc93a7bb0a47c285848d1/0_206_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=088f9069b7287fa1f062c3c129ab2869","title":"heritage list adds two sites to mark 75th anniversary of ve day","story":"Second world war command post and memorial will be preserved to demonstrate ‘debt of gratitude’ to war generationA rare second world war command post and a London memorial will be added to the National Heritage List to mark the 75th anniversary of VE Day on Friday.Buildings listed by Historic England are given special protections and are maintained due to their cultural or historical significance.The Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) said that preservation of the two sites demonstrated the “debt of gratitude” owed to the war generation.VE Day celebrates the victory of the allied forces over Nazi Germany on 8 May 1945.The battle headquarters at the former RAF Hucknall in Nottinghamshire was created in 1940 to help defend the airfield against wartime paratrooper assaults.The base at Hucknall was built as an underground command post with a visible three-storey brick observation tower and observation slits to watch for approaching enemy aircraft.Historic England said very few buildings with this early design now remain.A war memorial at St Luke’s Church in Bromley is a stylised Portland stone wheel-head cross supporting a crucifix with a bronze figure of Christ.Bromley suffered many bombing attacks due to its proximity to London and the names of 59 soldiers who died in the second world war are inscribed on a pillar inside the church.The heritage minister, Nigel Huddleston, said: “We owe the second world war generation an enormous debt of gratitude.“I am delighted that, as we prepare to mark 75 years since the end of the war in Europe on 8 May, we are protecting these historic sites in this way.”Many of this year’s VE Day celebrations have been cancelled or moved online due to the coronavirus outbreak.On Friday, Historic England will ask people to share what they know about its listed buildings and places that “harbour wartime histories, however big or small, to help them build a more vibrant picture of some of the most important sites in England and how they witnessed the war”.Historic England’s chief executive, Duncan Wilson, said: “The surviving physical evidence of the second world war is all around us, but is often unrecognised.“From the battle headquarters at RAF Hucknall airfield to the memorial at St Luke’s church in Bromley from aircraft hangars, former air-raid shelters, barracks and hospitals, to the thousands of homes that sheltered evacuees, we must ensure that the rich history of these iconic sites is not forgotten.”Historic England said that as part of the celebrations two other sites would be relisted, including an obelisk in Bath and a Grade II* listed park and garden in Norfolk.Although already granted listed status, new information linking the sites to the second world war has now been added to their descriptions on the National Heritage List for England."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4aca84d1dc718a6362c7b9edf1368fed761fe238/0_32_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e4351e428e10a88e14ddf50482442055","title":"there is a glimmer of hope economists on coronavirus and capitalism","story":"Greece’s former finance minister Yanis Varoufakis and Irish economist David McWilliams on the hope for a global new deal David McWilliams: I think it is fair to say that capitalism – in the course of this unprecedented crisis – has been suspended. We are not going back to where we were, to business as usual. The state has come back, and this episode will not be forgotten by the electorate. I don’t know where we are going, but one thing seems clear: we are not going back.Yanis Varoufakis: I like this phrase: capitalism has been suspended. The last time capitalism was suspended in the west was during the second world war, with the advent of the war economy: a command economy that fixed prices. The war economy marked the transcendence of the standard capitalist model.But what we see now is not so much the suspension of capitalism. The rules of capitalism may have been suspended – all those sacrosanct policies are gone, the neat separation of fiscal and monetary policy is gone, the idea that public debt is a bad thing is gone.But the institutions that are necessary to build “the war economy without war” so to speak – to suspend and transcend capitalism – those have not been put in place. There is a profound difference between saying: “It’s all going to shit, so we don’t expect you to stick to the rules,” and saying: “The rules themselves have changed, and we must make new ones to prevent an economic collapse.” All this talk of quantitative easing by the European Central Bank suggests that we remain very far from a war economy mindset.DM: This is a familiar category error in Europe. If you are basing your economic policy on the willingness of people who are too traumatised and sick to borrow – which is the core logic of quantitative easing – then you have a very serious problem. A common image of quantitative easing is the hose: a huge monetary hose, with water gushing out to stop the fire of crisis. But the hose of monetary policy is limited by this little valve called the banks, a little valve called the credit committee, a little valve called the “willingness of business to borrow money”. And ultimately, that hose of money becomes a trickle – and even that trickle stands to benefit the wealthy much more than the poor.So I take your point that despite the suspension of the rules, the infrastructure remains in place. But people across Europe are now saying: “Hey, there is an alternative.” This second phase will be about how we move ahead in rethinking capitalism, in rethinking finance, rethinking how economies work and for whom – potentially toward a new Bretton Woods-style settlement for the entire global economy.So that’s where we are: in the first year of the third decade of the 21st century. Looking out at the next decade, armed with history as well as economics, what do you think the global and European economy will look like?YV: We are sitting on a saddle point, prepared to tip in either direction. It is utterly indeterminate which of the two directions we travel.Let us start with the positive scenario. It builds from your point about the prospects for a new Bretton Woods – with its particular manifestation in the European Union.There is a glimmer of hope here, because there is a profound difference between 2020 and 2010. Back then, when Ireland and Greece went belly up, there were remarkable dissimilarities between what our countries were experiencing and what Germany was experiencing, what Holland was experiencing. Today, Germany’s industrial machine is broken – and was broken long before coronavirus hit. Two main industries – automobiles and machine tooling – were already in serious trouble. So the fact that Germany is now in the same pile of shit as the rest of us offers a glimmer of hope that they might say: what should we do? It’s no longer: “Your problem: here’s the Troika.”DM: And we will send you the bill as well! So that’s the positive scenario. The interruption of “business as usual” gives way to new policies and new possibilities for Europe and beyond. What’s the other option?YV: Well, we humans – and we Europeans, in particular – love to miss fantastic opportunities and end up with dystopian outcomes instead. It’s very likely that we will encounter the same recalcitrance by the same set of European ordoliberals, who will keep putting roadblocks in the way of moves toward a genuine, democratic federalism.DM: Obviously, such a roadblock will have a disproportionate impact on the southern member states of the European Union. What do you think the impact of this particular trauma will have on, say, Italy – a founding member of the European Union, and a crucial part of Europe’s emotional hinterland?YV: Every time there is a crisis in Europe, Italian growth rates fall. Every time there is a problem, Italy sinks deeper into stagnation – with Salvini waiting in the wings. If Frankfurt, Berlin, and Brussels fail again to move toward the positive scenario, Italy – not just Italy, but all of Europe’s most devastated regions – will move again toward the neo-fascist right. In that case, all bets are off.This is the endpoint of the negative scenario: a giant domino effect, leading to the disintegration of the European Union. Not that the EU will cease to exist. Only that it will become irrelevant, like the Commonwealth of Independent States.DM: Oh, I remember the Commonwealth of Independent States very well …YV: It still exists! It still has an office in Moscow. So the negative scenario is that the European Union will become like the CIS. And that will be music to the ears of the Trumps, Bolsonaros, and Modis of this world. We would move into a transactional, Hobbesian global economy: nasty, brutish, and poor for the majority of people.DM: When I was born in Ireland, the country was very poor. And then it became quite wealthy, on the back of the European project, on the back of Europe’s position in the global supply chain, and with a tax policy that attracted lots and lots of capital. My sense is this model might be gone, and this style of globalisation along with it. I fear that the period when you could travel, engage, move – we might have reached the end of that open period. People will say: “This virus came from the cosmopolitan world, from the world of international movement.” Whether it’s right or not, we might begin to blame people. We know that the Black Death resulted in ferocious antisemitism in Europe. People asked: “Who can we blame for this?” And so they blamed the one community that was already in isolation in the ghetto.This is what terrifies me most, sitting here in the first year of the third decade of the 21st century. What we saw before may come again, and we turn back to Yeats: “Turning and turning in the widening gyre  The falcon cannot hear the falconer  Things fall apart the centre cannot hold  Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world.” I fear now, unless we move quickly and in a new direction, the world that my kids will inherit is going to turn very nasty, indeed. So it’s a clarion call.YV: The loudest call in a generation. I share all of your concern for the future, although I must challenge the analysis on which it is based. The openness that you describe has always gone hand in hand with severe restriction: Nafta and the US-Mexico border freedom of movement in Europe and Frontex along the Mediterranean. This is not a contradiction it is the logic of a system that prizes the movement of capital over the freedom of human beings.If we fail now to stand together – to rally around a new Bretton Woods, to deliver the investments that humanity and the planet so desperately need – my fear is that this system will only deepen its cruel logic. Surfing on the hose of liquidity unleashed by the policies like quantitative easing, the financial sector will increase its grip on the global economy bankers are very good at getting rich from such volatility. So now is the time for us, here in Europe as around the world, to mobilise behind this shared vision of a global new deal. Because without it, the walls between us will only get taller and thicker: porous only to the money that flows through them."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6523d9bcf64cf93420cf0e95c8b5ee7d082c6b4f/782_474_2274_1365/master/2274.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9014c1a3835ded27dabcb6560ee0e54e","title":"social distance cinema drive in theatres boom coronavirus in pictures","story":"With the widespread closures of cinemas as part of measures to stem the spread of Covid-19, drive-in movie theatres around the world, where social distancing is guaranteed, have been enjoying new-found popularity"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4245839.1588705317!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"uncertainty faces 2 000 leaving cert students seeking college places abroad","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMore than 2,000 students in Ireland who are seeking college places in the UK and Europe do not know if they will be able to take up their places this year due to the decision to delay the Leaving Cert. Photograph: David DaviesPA Wire More than 2,000 students in Ireland who are seeking college places in the UK and Europe do not know if they will be able to take up their places this year due to the decision to delay the Leaving Cert.Many students have reported receiving correspondence from UK universities stating that they require their Leaving Cert results by August 31st.However, these results are unlikely to be available until late September or early October in light of the Government’s decision to postpone the exams until July 29th at the earliest.Ucas , the UK’s equivalent of the CAO system, has confirmed that about 1,700 students with addresses in the Republic have conditional offers based on their exam results.Most are seeking places in universities in Scotland, followed Northern Ireland and EnglandWales. These numbers include students have deferred taking up their places, so they should be able to take up their places based on last year’s results.In addition, it is estimated that a further 600 to 650 students in Ireland have applied for college places elsewhere in Europe.The bulk of these students are seeking places on courses in the Netherlands, followed by Poland, Hungary and other EU member states.‘Very conscious’The Department of Education said Minister for Education Joe McHugh is “very conscious” of the thousands of students taking the Leaving Cert who have applied to study in Northern Ireland, Britain, Europe and elsewhere. “Before the Minister made the announcement on State examinations on 10 April he called the UK secretary of state for education Gavin Williamson to alert him to the change and to ask for as much flexibility as possible from Ucas on these issues,” according to the department“He also wrote to the Ministers in Northern Ireland on this issue. Departmental officials are engaging directly with Ucas to work through the key issues.”It said Mr McHugh has also written to each of his counterparts across the EU to ask for as much flexibility as possible for students coming from Ireland to study in other member states.“The department will continue to work on these issues with stakeholders over the coming weeks,” it added.The Irish Second Level Students’ Union said it is raising the plight of these students in its regular contacts with the department through its seat on an advisory group for the State exams, which set up recently.Some education observers say the fact that the international student market has dried up this year means that institutions are likely to be more flexible in seeking to meet the needs of students.However, there is no formal confirmation yet on whether UK or European institutions will be in a position to accept Irish students.AlternativeSinn Féin, meanwhile, has called on the Government to spell out what alternative it has in mind in the event that exams are cancelled.“It is clear that the Leaving Cert cannot proceed unless it is safe for students. Similarly proceeding to plan for exams in July and August is pointless if this is based only on a slim possibility of exams being held,”said the party’s education spokesman Donnchadh Ó Laoghaire TD.If it is more likely than not that exams cannot be held, he said we need a “plan B” and to plan definitively for that contingency.“If the Government are going to cancel exams, they cannot announce this without telling students how the Leaving Cert is going to be awarded and how college admissions will be managed. This would – if anything – create more confusion, uncertainty and add to the stress that students are experiencing."},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

Photograph: Jung Yeon-JeGettyAFPThis is a series of regular updates from  Environment \u0026amp Science Editor Kevin O’Sullivan on scientific initiatives and developments on coronavirus.The line was: evidence for wearing face masks in public is inconclusive, people won’t wear them properly any way and widespread demand will inevitably reduce supplies of medical-quality masks. All is now changed.US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention broke ranks after droplet tests indicated transmission of a virus could go beyond two metres – and advised cloth masks be worn in public.In early April a British Medical Journal article suggested the precautionary principle should apply as masks “could have a substantial impact on transmission with a relatively small impact on social and economic life.” This had a profound effect on thinking on this side of the Atlantic.In recent days, Arizona State University scientists showed masks save lives 80 per cent adoption could reduce mortality by 24 to 65 per cent.Yet the Irish position has shifted only marginally, to saying they may be required while shopping or on public transport. In line with WHO, the view that it’s more important to ensure continuity of supply of higher-grade face masks for healthcare workers and patients prevails here.The science could not be clearer and it’s odds on everyone will have to mask up as it’s clearly important – along with “wash your hands” and physical distancing. Clarity is urgently needed, however, and time for hundreds of thousands people emerging from lockdown to make or source masks – and to get used to wearing them.There is a broad consensus now that wearing even a basic cloth mask properly along with rapid testingtracing capacity and appropriate use of effective app technology will be all needed, if crushing Covid is to be realised.For those cooped up or cocooned at home who are beginning to hear strange voices saying “this Covid thing is a vague threat and overhyped in terms of risk now we’re over the peak”, a short reminder of its medical nastiness and horrible unpredictability is merited as an antidote for those cut loose arguments: Covid-19 affects the lungs and in more seriously ill people the kidney, the gut and the brain.It increases risk of blood clotting – and there is no indication why some get the virus and others don’t. It harder to identify in older people, who are among most vulnerable to the disease, and more difficult to treat. Those exposed to air pollution are believed to be more at risk.People of all ages with Covid pneumonia can suddenly become terribly ill and have to go into ICU. In some young children, it is believed to cause a form of toxic shock syndrome. What’s more, ethnic minorities and poorer people and those with other conditions are much more likely to die. Recovery can be difficult and can take months.And we don’t know how it will live on in populations how it might re-assert itself. Will it be like winter flu or remain dormant for a while like herpes? Will it return in a more virulent form? A University of Minnesota report suggests the pandemic could stretch on for two more years with recurring spikes until roughly two-thirds or more of the population is immune. So please lift that re-emergence lid carefully.Can you teach an old drug new tricks?Mr Trump’s overhyping of hydroxychloroquine aside, the antimalarial drug serves a great purpose. But self-administering it – as many did in the US after his intervention – was a shocking example of loose words costing lives.Niamh O’Boyle, assistant professor of pharmaceutical chemistry at TCD provides a timely warning: “Your old, crumpled box of anti-malarial drugs has been lying squashed at the back of a drawer from an overseas trip many years ago. You heard that guy on the TV saying it was a miracle cure for coronavirus. It can’t hurt to take it just in case, right?“But a few hours later, you start to get stomach cramps, blurred vision and vomiting. Soon after, your heart starts to skip a beat and you’re feeling faint.”You are likely to be suffering from a hydroxychloroquine overdose.Many commonly-used prescription drugs are safe only below a certain dose. At the correct dose, this drug can be a lifesaver for treating malaria, and managing rheumatoid arthritis.Scientists have shown it could stop Covid-19 from growing in plastic containers in the lab by preventing the virus attaching and getting inside human cells.“However, plastic containers are a world away from the intricate and beautifully evolved structures that are our human bodies,” Boyle notes.There is no evidence right now for effects – good or bad – in humans suffering from Covid though it’s being tested in the WHO solidarity clinical trial involving many hundreds of patients. “Until the results from large trials like this emerge in the coming weeks and months, it is likely to be used only for severely-ill patients in hospital.”So, is hydroxychloroquine a marvellous medicine or a false hope? Right now, until those trials results are in, we just don’t know. Boyle’s bottom line: don’t take this drug without proper medical supervision: “Imagine how you’d feel being rushed into A\u0026ampE with self-inflicted injuries at a time like this.”Mind how you go on fast-tracking trialsSome scientists have proposed a way to speed up the clinical trial process by deliberately exposing volunteers to the virus to determine a vaccine’s efficacy.“This approach is not without risks but has the potential to expedite candidate vaccine testing by many months,” according to Nir Eyal, professor of bioethics at Rutgers University in the US.Volunteers would have to be young and healthy, he stresses: “Their health would also be closely monitored, and they would have access to intensive care and any available medicines,” he told the . The result could be a vaccine that would save millions of lives by being ready for use in a much shorter time than one that went through standard phase three trials.Young people might jump at the opportunity to join such a trial but this is a virus that does kill the odd young person, Eyal points out. We don’t know why yet. The final piece of the jigsaw (those large phase-three trials) are still some way off, so there is time to get the conditions right.Grounds for optimismEurope is getting it right: Much of Europe was slow to respond to coronavirus, but you cannot quibble with statistics. Almost all EU countries have now got their transmission score (a mathematical indicator, the R0) down below 1 – each case is leading to infection of less than one other person. If they don’t keep it that way, the scientist and great R0 explainer Angela Merkel will issue a swift reprimand.Defying prediction: It was predicted to claim 10 million lives in Africa. So far a continent of 1.2 billion people has suffered fewer Covid-19 deaths than the US was recording each day last week. Reasons are unclear – a young population, warm weather reducing droplet spread, BCG vaccination who knows? – a continent holds its breath.Blood test breakthrough: US military scientists have designed a new Covid-19 test that could potentially identify carriers before they become infectious and spread the disease. The blood test is quicker than the usual swab test though it deploys the same PCR technique.

This accounts for 7.58 per cent of the 2.2 million-strong private vehicle fleet in the State, MIBI found. The increase, from 7.16 per cent to 7.58 per cent, means that one in every 13 private vehicles on Irish roads is now uninsured. David Fitzgerald, the chief executive of the MIBI, said the figures “show the problem of uninsured driving has grown significantly over the last few years”.“A jump of almost 14,000 uninsured vehicles in a single year is a statistic that should worry every single Irish road-user. Uninsured drivers are a threat to road safety for the law-abiding majority of private vehicle drivers, making Irish roads less safe and a lot more hazardous.” The bureau does not believe any one factor has driven the increase. The number of uninsured drivers is taken by combining aggregate official figures provided by the Department of Transport and cross-referencing them with insurance and motor taxation data. The MIBI also flagged concerns around weaknesses in the economy associated with Covid-19. “We are certainly concerned that with the economy facing a difficult period there may be an even further increase in the level of uninsured driving.”MIBI was established in 1955, and its primary function is to manage payouts to the victims of traffic incidents caused by uninsured or unidentified vehicles. Companies underwriting insurance in Ireland are required to be members of the organisation, and the organisation’s funding comes from these companies. Licence platesThe bureau has called for the urgent implementation of a motor third-party liability insurance database, which in turn would support a system to allow the Garda identify uninsured vehicles by scanning their licence plates. The system, known as automatic number plate recognition (ANPR), is already running on a trial basis, and “has had a tremendous impact based on feedback provided by An Garda Síochána”.Such technologies, Mr Fitzgerald said, “will be a strong weapon in the fight to apprehend any iniduals who recklessly think they can treat motor insurance as optional”. “Motor insurance is a legal obligation for a reason. With ANPR those who do not respect that principle will be rolling the dice in a game where the odds will be truly stacked against them.”Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4243939.1588523161!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"britain rejects request for permanent eu office in belfast","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMichael Gove wrote to the SDLP, Sinn Féin, Alliance and the Greens saying that an EU office in Belfast was unnecessary. Photograph: Chris J RatcliffeGettyThe British government has been accused of being “petty”, “provocative” and “unhelpful” after it rejected a request for the European Union to have a permanent office in Belfast. British cabinet office Minister Michael Gove responded to the North’s four pro-Remain parties – Sinn Féin, the SDLP, Alliance and the Greens – to say that an office was unnecessary.Mr Gove said it would facilitate, where necessary, ad hoc visits by EU officials to Northern Ireland but it did not accept any permanent EU presence was required in Northern Ireland.The four parties wrote to the British prime minister Boris Johnson last month urging that an EU office be re-established. The EU also made a request for an office in Belfast.The previously permanent European Commission office closed at the end of January when the UK quit the EU.There was an expectation at the time that some form of EU presence would be created later to assist continuing EU-UK business, but Mr Gove, responding on behalf of Mr Johnson, appears to have closed down that possibility.The current stance of the British government appears in direct contrast to its position in February last year when it said it not only supported having an EU office in Belfast but in London, Edinburgh and Cardiff as well.Just over a week ago Mr Gove told British MPs there was no need for a “mini embassy” in Belfast.In the 2016 referendum, 56 per cent of the electorate in Northern Ireland voted to stay in the EU.EU fundingNotwithstanding the negative response, the Irish Government appears not to have given up hope that an office might yet be created. Previous figures from the European Commission office in Belfast show that going back to 1989 the EU supported the peace process, agriculture, fisheries, jobs and much more to the tune of more than €13 billion. It also plans to continue providing peace funding in the North.“We would see no issue in terms of the Good Friday agreement in having an EU office in Northern Ireland, not least given ongoing EU support for the peace process,” said a Department of Foreign Affairs spokeswoman on Sunday.“The Irish Government hopes this matter can be accommodated in a way that satisfies both sides’ needs and sensitivities,” she added.The Sinn Féin MP for North Belfast John Finucane said Mr Gove’s “mini embassy” comments were “provocative and deeply unhelpful at a crucial period in Brexit negotiations”.“The ongoing opposition by the British government to a European Union office in the North is in bad faith,” he said.SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said the British government response was “petty” but “unsurprising”.Alliance leader Naomi Long also described the decision as “petty”.“This gamesmanship from the UK government is reflective of their wider approach of not taking preparations for the implementation of the Ireland-Northern Ireland protocol seriously,” she said. The DUP and Ulster Unionist Party, however, supported the British government’s position. In a brief statement, a DUP spokesman said, “We agree with UK government policy.”The Ulster Unionist Party leader Steve Aiken said there was no need for a permanent office in Belfast“The idea of EU ‘perm reps’ with extra jurisdiction powers like the EU had in the Balkans is simply not acceptable in the UK – and it is inconceivable that any EU country would accept that on their sovereign territory,” he said.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Photograph:  Patricia de Melo MoreiraAFP via Getty ImagesWith its rapidly ageing population and close-knit family-oriented society, Portugal has much in common with its neighbour Spain. But while the coronavirus pandemic has wreaked havoc in Spain, Portugal has had vastly lower infection and death rates.Spain has recorded more than 25,000 Covid-19 deaths, yet Portugal, with a quarter of the population, has recorded just over 1,000. As Portugal and other EU countries begin to ease their lockdowns, Lisbon fears a second wave of infections could reverse a success attributed to its quick response, extensive testing, collegiate politics and strong social support.“Timing is everything in the early stages of a pandemic because viral dissemination is exponential,” said Pedro Simas, head of the viral pathogenesis lab at Portugal’s Institute of Molecular Medicine (IMM). “Even one week has an enormous impact.”Portugal detected its first coronavirus cases on March 2nd, a month later than Italy and Spain. The government declared a state of emergency 16 days after the outbreak began, by which time the country had recorded 642 cases and two deaths. In comparison, Spain announced tough lockdown measures about six weeks after the first case appeared, by which time it had recorded almost 5,800 cases and 200 deaths.But even before the government had ordered a lockdown, many Portuguese people had chosen to stay at home. “People were witnessing the heartbreaking images from Italy and Spain and decided to take matters into their own hands,” said Ricardo Baptista Leite, head of public health at Lisbon’s Catholic University. “This was a critical element in our response.”Isabel Abreu, a biochemist in the high-risk category for Covid-19, began working from home almost two weeks before it became compulsory. “People who could generally did the same,” she said. The government introduced a furlough scheme under which laid-off workers received two-thirds of their wages, of which the state pays 70 per cent.Health workersTesting was also key. Portugal has tested more than 350,000 people for coronavirus, having steadily built a network that can complete more than 15,000 tests a day. That equates to more than 35,000 tests per million inhabitants, proportionally more than many other European countries.More than 60 state, university and private labs have worked together to test as many people as possible, focusing on health workers and nursing home residents. “We face the same difficulties as every country in trying to buy testing materials, but our central purchasing office gives us more of a single voice in international markets and helps improve distribution,” said Marta Temido, health minister.The fact that Portugal had fewer densely populated cities, a single land border, a lower level of international traffic and less immigration also helped, as did cross-party support for the Socialist government’s coronavirus strategy. “We are focusing on collaboration, not opposition,” said Baptista Leite, also health spokesman for the opposition Social Democrats. “In times like these, unity and solidarity save lives.”This combined to ensure pressure on an under-resourced national health service was kept at a manageable level. “Due to early social distancing measures, the number of critically ill patients has never come close to breaking point as it has in some other countries,” said Maria Manuel Mota, a biologist at the IMM. But as Portugal adjusts this week to a gradual relaxation of confinement measures, health specialists and politicians fear a second wave of the pandemic could hit it hard.“Having been so efficient in controlling the first wave of infection puts Portugal in an extremely susceptible situation,” said Simas. “We are completely blind to the percentage of people that have been exposed to the virus and are potentially immune.”The government has approved a cautious, three-phase plan to ease the lockdown, including the compulsory use of face masks in many public spaces and remote working whenever possible.Small shops will be allowed to open first, followed by increasingly bigger stores in the second and third phases. Remote teaching will remain in place for most children until the end of the academic year.Portuguese scientists are close to implementing a system of serological antibody testing that will show whether people have been infected with coronavirus. This will initially be targeted at frontline health workers.“Our apparently good results in this phase could be a disadvantage in terms of the immunity of our population in a second wave,” Ms Temido said. “We will only be able to say what countries have responded well when the history of the pandemic is written.” – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2020Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"greece could welcome back tourists july 1 prime minister says","story":"The French may be deprived of their sacrosanct summer holidays after President Emmanuel Macron ruled out foreign travel and warned that people may be obliged to remain within 60 miles of their homes.The country was facing a rather peculiar summer, Mr Macron said during a visit to a school just days before France is due to start easing lockdown measures after almost two months of home confinement. Coronavirus has killed more than 25,000 people in France.“It is too soon to say whether we can take holidays. What I can say is that we will limit major international travel, even during the summer holidays. We will stay among Europeans and, depending on how the epidemic evolves, we might have to limit that even more. We will know in early June,” he said.Dozens of summer concerts, sporting events and other activities have already been canceled, and until July 24 at least, France will require people arriving from outside Europe to remain in isolation for two weeks, in a major blow to the tourism industry.Later this week, France is to update a colour-coded map of its regions, with red ones - those most affected by the virus - obliged to observe stricter confinement measures than green ones - those which have fewer cases.Mr Macron said the country must avoid thousands of potentially infected people leaving red areas, Paris in particular, to take holidays further afield. He urged everyone to respect social distancing in the coming weeks to avoid a return to lockdown and increase the hope of smiles and sun. The virus is still here. We have not beaten it, just slowed it down, he warned. We are entering a new phase: if we are all collectively responsible, I\u0027m sure we\u0027ll manage it and I want to give this glimmer of hope.Greece is also emerging from a strict lockdown, with the prime minister saying that the country could open up to tourists in early July - giving hope to millions of holidaymakers hoping to flock to its sun-soaked islands and whitewashed hilltop villages.Kyriakos Mitsotakis said the “best-case scenario” is that tourism could restart on July 1.“We’re working towards that, he told CNN in an interview. “Of course it involves airlines, because most people fly into Greece.”The exact date will also depend on the implementation of health protocols between countries.Tourists might have to be tested for Covid-19 before they board planes bound for Greece. There would be “very specific protocols,” said the prime minister.Unlike France, Italy and Spain, Greece has emerged relatively unscathed by the pandemic.The government was quick to impose a lockdown and so far just 146 people have died of the virus – compared to nearly 30,000 in Italy.Two-thirds of Greek hoteliers fear that it is likely they will go bankrupt as a result of the shutdown, according to a study by the Hellenic Chamber of Hotels.“The tourism experience this summer may be slightly different from what you’ve had in previous years, with more social distancing, maybe no bars open,” said Mr Mitsotakis.But you can still get a fantastic experience in Greece provided that the global epidemic is on a downward path.”The government has decreed that open-air archaeological sites can reopen on May 18, while hotels and restaurants can reopen on June 1.Israel, Greece and Cyprus are discussing the idea of setting up a safe zone in which each others’ citizens would be able to travel.All three countries have had a low number of deaths and infections from Covid-19.Cyprus and Greece are both popular tourist destinations for Israelis.Israel announced a de facto shutdown of all its borders in March in response to the coronavirus.The country has reported only 235 deaths and 16,000 infections - 10,000 of whom have recovered.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"least 20000 people infected coronavirus arrived uk lockdown","story":"At least 20,000 people infected with coronavirus entered the UK before lockdown, but fewer than 300 were quarantined, official figures reveal.These arrivals would have infected some 50,000 more people given the World Health Organisation’s assessment of an average transmission rate at the start of March of between 2 and 2.5.Figures provided to the home affairs committee by the Home Office show that between January 1 and the end of March 18.1 million people entered the UK without any health checks including from coronavirus hotspot countries. Of these, just 273 were quarantined.Even by conservative estimates of prevalence, this would have meant 20,000 being infected.The arrivals were only asked to self-isolate if they had symptoms unlike other countries like New Zealand, Singapore, Canada, Australia and Italy which closed their borders, quarantined or introduced supervised self-isolation.Ministers have maintained they acted on the scientific advice of SAGE that tougher restrictions would have a “negligible” impact given the domestic transmission rate then and the dramatically-reduced number of passengers now entering the UK.However, this appeared at odds on Tuesday with Sir Patrick Vallance, the Government’s chief scientific adviser, who told MPs the UK got “many, many different imports of the virus from many different places...particularly from European countries with outbreaks.”\u0027And so we see a big influx of cases, probably from Italy and Spain looking at the genomics of the virus in early March, seeded right the way across the country,” he told the health and social care committee.“Whether that was people returning from half-term, whether it’s business travellers or not we don’t know, but a lot of the cases in the UK didn’t come from China and didn’t come from the places you might have expected.“They actually came from European imports and the high level of travel into the UK around that time.”Stephen Doughty, a member of the Home Affairs Committee, said it “beggared belief” that only the 273 Britons extracted from Wuhan or who had been on the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan were quarantined when the pandemic was “already raging in a series of locations.”“On what scientific basis were a handful of flights from Wuhan and one from a Tokyo singled out for extreme attention? But not a single flight from Northern Italy, Spain or the US?“The fact that many of these people then likely arrived and travelled onwards across the UK with little or no adherence to social distancing, and with no checks or protections at the border – barely a whiff of hand sanitiser – is deeply disturbing. Let alone the arrival of 3,000 fans from Madrid as the pandemic picked up speed.“Yet arrivals continue to this day – with no formal quarantine requirements. It is simply staggering. Who made these decisions? And on what basis?”The Government has so far refused to publish its modelling or the SAGE scientific advice behind the open border approach.A Home Office spokesman said: “Our approach to tackling coronavirus is, and has always been, driven by the latest scientific and medical advice, and procedures at the border have been strictly following the latest Government guidance throughout. \u0027The scientific advice showed that placing restrictions at the border would not have had a significant impact on the spread of the virus in the UK.

This is very good news,” Prof Lothar Wieler, the head of the RKI said.The figures are the first to include reliable data on new infections since Germany began to lift its lockdown two weeks ago.New infections take time to develop and scientists assume a lag of 10-14 days before they are reflected in the figures.But Prof Wieler cautioned against celebrating too early. “We know there will probably be a second wave. The majority of scientists agree on this and many believe there will also be a third wave,” he said.The latest figures came as Germany’s regional governments announced plans to ease restrictions further.Angela Merkel is to hold talks on the lockdown with regional leaders on Wednesday but her attempts to maintain nationwide regulations appeared to be unravelling as several state governments announced plans to go it alone.Bavaria, until now the toughest lockdown state in Germany, on Tuesday became the latest to announce plans to reopen restaurants and hotels later this month.The state will also relax its ban on people leaving their homes and allow visits to nursing and care homes from the weekend.Lower Saxony is to allow people to travel to second homes or go camping from Wednesday, while Mecklenburg-West Pomerania will be the first state to reopen restaurants this weekend, followed by hotels on May 18.Mrs Merkel has previously warned the regional governments are rushing to lift the lockdown too soon.She is reportedly pressing regional leaders to agree an emergency brake rule at Wednesday\u0027s talks.Under the proposal, if the number of infections in a town or district rises above an agreed limit, the area would be placed back under total lockdown.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"sweden suppressed infection rates without lockdown","story":"Last Wednesday, the two countries\u0027 health agencies both published their report cards, giving estimates on what difference their contrasting approaches had made to the rate at which the infection is spreading - the famous \u0027R number\u0027.The result? Not that much.If the R number is 1, it means that each person infected goes on to infect an average of one other person during the course of their illness. So long as a country keeps R below one, the number of infections will steadily decrease until the pandemic comes to an end.Sweden\u0027s numbers are a standing rebuke to the Imperial College study that has done so much to influence UK policy. Researchers at the university predicted that Sweden\u0027s approach would leave it with an R of above 3, leading to 40,000 coronavirus deaths by May 1. Sweden\u0027s current death tally is just 2,769.Uno Wennergren, a mathematician and pandemic modeller at Linköping University, suspects Sweden\u0027s low number in part comes from growing levels of immunity in Stockholm, where the outbreak has so far been concentrated, and in part from social distancing.Denmark\u0027s much heavier lockdown helped push the R number as low as 0.6 in mid-April, only creeping back to 0.9 after it opened schools on April 15 - although the increase may have more to do with the weather and the effects of lockdown fatigue.This apparently small difference has had a big impact in terms of hospital admissions and death: Sweden\u0027s cumulative coronavirus death rate, at 274 deaths per million inhabitants, is now triple that of Denmark.This doesn\u0027t say anything about the rest of Sweden. Wennergren warns that the sub-1 R number for Sweden as a whole might be heavily weighed down by a high immunity in Stockholm, masking a rapid spread elsewhere.We could end up on the other side of the Stockholm peak and think we’re doing fine, and instead get a wave-like plateau that is a result of different regions overlapping one another, he said. What we are trying to do now is to model it by the different regions... Until we have done that, I think it will be really hard to know where this is going to land.At the end of April, Wennergren estimated on Swedish national TV that between 10,000 and 20,000 people will ultimately die of coronavirus in the country.

We would advocate trialling easing restrictions very gradually.To maintain public trust and support, it will be important to have acceptable and equitable criteria for selecting which activities can be resumed. For example, it may be difficult to justify easing restrictions solely for economic activities without any easing of restrictions for low-risk activities with significant social and psychological benefit.Methods that have been used successfully for helping people understand how to implement other behaviour changes (such as healthy eating) include providing a \u0027traffic light\u0027 list of examples of high (avoid), medium (do rarely and carefully) and low (do freely) risk activities and \u0027modelling\u0027 stories describing how other people like themselves in similar situations have overcome barriers to implement guidance successfully, it says. The document also suggests that health and safety legislation should be used to address coronavirus infection control risks at work. The two-metre social distancing rule is currently being reviewed by the Government in the hope that relaxing it could allow businesses and schools to reopen.But Sir Patrick told MPs that the infection risk at one metre was as much as 30 times higher than that at two metres, saying: The evidence is – as far as you can get very firm evidence on this – that essentially a minute at two metres contact is about the same risk as six seconds at one metre, so that gives you some idea of why the two metres becomes important. And the risk at one metre is about 10 to 30 times higher than the risk at two metres, so the distancing is an important part of this.In a briefing document considered by Sage on April 14, scientists said managers may prioritise those who have tested positive when offering jobs. This could lead to widespread gaming of the system in which people desperate for work deliberately get infected with Covid-19, they said.  Alternatively, a black market for counterfeit positive test results could emerge.It might also allow parts of the country to leave lockdown earlier than others, a strategy Sir Patrick acknowledged is being examined. Promises of home testing kits were quickly dashed when it emerged the technology was not accurate enough, but there are hopes laboratory-based blood testing systems will be available this month.  Sir Patrick said geographical variations could mean certain parts of the country come out of lockdown sooner, adding: We know that cities and densely-populated places have a higher prevalence than rural places... and an option that could be considered is to think about whether measures could be done locally versus nationally.Masks may have a marginal positive effect in those situations, or face coverings of some sort, he said. Where masks have a role is where distancing may not be possible. So there may be some cases where that is not possible, situations where there is undue crowding when wearing masks may be beneficial to stop the spread. Sir Patrick said scientists have now been able to sequence thousands and thousands of viral genomes when looking at Covid-19, and found cases came from Europe.One of the things that it looks like, very clearly, is that early in March the UK got many, many different imports of virus from many different places, he said. And those were particularly from European countries with outbreaks.Mass school closures would increase the likelihood of avoiding ICU capacity being breached across the country, it said, with the decision to close schools taken on the same day the paper was drawn up.I\u0027d be amazed if, when we look back, we don\u0027t think: \u0027Yep we could have done something differently,\u0027 Sir Patrick told MPs.But he insisted: It\u0027s completely wrong to think of testing as the answer – it\u0027s just part of the system that you need to get right.If we had unlimited capacity, and the ongoing support beyond that, then we perhaps would choose a slightly different approach, she said. Sir Patrick also suggested that allowing the Cheltenham Festival to go ahead may have been a an error, saying he had no doubts there would have been occasions where things could have been done differently. There will be times where you look back at and say things could have been done differently – I\u0027ve got no doubts about that. On the wider issue of the lockdown, he said: When you look at everything that has happened and the speed in which it happened, maybe days either side may have made a difference.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"pictures day 6th may 2020","story":"A boy wearing a protective face mask touches a wall of graffiti outside the New York Aquarium, BrooklynCoronavirus latest news: Donald Trump concedes more will die in reopening US economyWednesday morning news briefing: Top scientific adviser quits after meeting lover in lockdownMan, 30, arrested on suspicion of murder after another man found dead at west London flatComment: We need to start reopening our society, not just the economyComment: All these new podcasts are just a war of man-eating spidersNo sign Kim Jong-un had heart surgery his retreat was due to coronavirus concerns, says agencyComment: China’s bully-boy tactics are destined to backfireSpending time in the garden has similar health benefits to living in a wealthy area, new study findsIt\u0026#39s been a year of firsts for Master Archie – the most unroyal Windsor yetRuth Bader Ginsburg in hospital with gall bladder infectionBoris Johnson\u0026#39s lockdown speech: When is it, what will he say, and how can I watch it?When will the UK lockdown end?

Neither assessed nor substantiated that the measures provided for in these decisions satisfy the principle of proportionality,” the court said.In response, they judges said that Germany’s own central bank, which constitutes part of the ECB network, must stop buying government bonds under the programme within the next three months, unless the ECB can prove those purchases are needed.It added that, unless this happens, the German central bank must sell back the bonds already acquired, though based on a long-term strategy co-ordinated with the rest of the eurozone.However, the German judges also stressed that their decision did not apply to the\u0026nbspECB’s\u0026nbsplatest €750bn bond buying scheme designed to combat the economic impact of the Covid-19 crisis.The central decision was a surprise to analysts and direcrtly conflicts with a ruling by the EU’s own Court of Justice in December 2018 that the PSPP was fully justified in law as a mechanism for delivering stable inflation in the currency bloc.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

That was down from 34.5 in March, which had already been a record low. In the depths of the 2008 financial crisis, the survey fell to 40.1.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesAround 79 per cent of services businesses reported activity fell in April. Much of the decline\u0026nbspwas expected because restaurants, bars, non-essential retailers and other services businesses were forced\u0026nbspto shut down on 23 March to slow the spread of Covid-19.But the survey demonstrates just how drastically\u0026nbspactivity has been curtailed. Government measures such as grants to hospitality businesses and cheap loans to small firms have been designed to ensure that, as much as possible, the contraction is a temporary result of the coronavirus lockdown and does not develop into a longer-term depression.The PMI\u0026nbspsurvey\u0026nbspis seen as an early indicator of future economic performance because it polls managers in companies about what is happening to their orders and supplies.But forecasting how the economy will perform beyond the immediate time horizon has become a near-impossible task, with huge disparities between the most pessimistic and optimistic projections.The news came as the UK death toll from coronavirus surpassed that of every other European nation. Only the US – with a population five times the size – has seen more Covid-19 deaths.Tim Moore, economics director at IHS Markit, said: “April’s PMI data highlights that the downturn in the UK economy during the second quarter of 2020 will be far deeper and more widespread than anything seen in living memory.“Historical comparisons of the PMI with GDP indicate that the April survey reading is consistent with the economy falling at a quarterly rate of approximately 7 per cent, but we expect the actual decline in GDP could be even greater, in part because the PMI excludes the vast majority of the self-employed and the retail sector.“Just one in five service providers managed to avoid a drop in business activity since March and those hardest hit by social distancing measures and travel restrictions often reported complete stoppages of business operations.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Boris Johnson is expected to provide an update this Sunday on the plans to ease restrictions.“We are seeing our markets in Europe opening before ours,”\u0026nbspsaid Richards. “We are trying to work with the government to demonstrate we are not like sporting fixtures and pop concerts.”“We can control how many people come into our cinemas at any one time – we have the ability to control the exit and entrance.”The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

During their peak, as many as 30 of the meteors can be seen each hour.One of the most remarkable things about the\u0026nbspEta\u0026nbspAquariids\u0026nbspis their speed. They shoot into Earth\u0027s atmosphere at about 150,000mph, and can leave glowing lines across the sky as their glowing debris is left in their wake.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe show will be best viewed in the southern hemisphere, since the constellation from which they emerge is higher up in the sky and therefore any meteors are more easily spotted. In the northern hemisphere, they will often seem to skim across the horizon, giving them the name Earthgrazers.As ever, the key to seeing any meteor shower is to go somewhere that is relatively dark so that light pollution will not get in the way of the view. That may be complicated by coronavirus lockdowns and social distancing, and any trips should only be made if they are recommended.First credible evidence emerges of person being killed by meteorTo get a view, look up into the sky and try to hold your gaze there. Over time – after about 30 minutes or so – your eyes should be able to see better in the dark and any meteors will come into view.Meteor showers come when the Earth moves into the debris from comets that have moved around our Solar System. As those leftovers collide with the Earth\u0027s atmopshere, they break up create blazing lights in the sky.Each year, the Earth moves regularly through those chunks of debris.

Neither assessed nor substantiated that the measures provided for in these decisions satisfy the principle of proportionality,” the court said.In response, they judges said that Germany’s own central bank, which constitutes part of the ECB network, must stop buying government bonds under the programme within the next three months, unless the ECB can prove those purchases are needed.It added that, unless this happens, the German central bank must sell back the bonds already acquired, though based on a long-term strategy co-ordinated with the rest of the eurozone.However, the German judges also stressed that their decision did not apply to the\u0026nbspECB’s\u0026nbsplatest €750bn bond buying scheme designed to combat the economic impact of the Covid-19 crisis.The central decision was a surprise to analysts and direcrtly conflicts with a ruling by the EU’s own Court of Justice in December 2018 that the PSPP was fully justified in law as a mechanism for delivering stable inflation in the currency bloc.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

And while most of us are encountering the many difficulties that accompany a global pandemic, the Covid-19 crisis has thrown the good deeds of British public into sharp relief.As the UK works together to stay home, the power of kindness, generosity and goodwill have proved triumphant over the last few months: with thousands offering help and resource to the vulnerable, home-cooked food to workers on the frontline and much-needed emotional support systems to the isolated. Here, we talk to five inspirational people making a difference…Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesPhil Jones: the Chester-based chef cooking and delivering hundreds of meals each weekAfter being furloughed from his job as a chef, Chester-based Phil Jones (pictured above) decided to take the opportunity to practise his skills in the kitchen, watching YouTube videos to keep up with the younger colleagues who sometimes consider him old-fashioned.It wasn’t long before Phil realised he had a lot of food, so he decided to get in touch with some of his vulnerable neighbours. Soon, word spread and Phil heard about more and more people in need. He posted on some local groups, and things began to snowball. Now, the 40-year-old volunteer is waking up around 6:30 each morning to prepare, cook and deliver around 40 meals per day to local residents and NHS staff at the nearby hospital, the Countess of Chester. Sometimes, he doesn’t stop until 11 o’clock at night.“It’s strange really, because I get up and I step into the kitchen and just the thought of making people happy is just a massive buzz and it outweighs the tiredness,” he notes. “For someone to come along and bring some home-cooked food, it’s like winning the lottery for them – that’s what a couple of them have said.”Prav​ashini\u0026nbspRamsamy: the recent mum helping dozens of local families“I was completely devastated by the news,” says Pravashini Ramsamy on hearing that elderly and vulnerable people, as well as key workers, were struggling to access groceries.So the mother of three, who hadn’t yet returned to work as a training manager after maternity leave, set up the local community group Finchley COVID 19 on Facebook.Of the group’s 218 members, there are around 70 local volunteers who have helped 60 isolating iniduals and families, delivering shopping, home-cooked meals and running essential errands.Living in East Finchley with her fiancé\u0026nbspand children, Pravashini, 40, coordinates the volunteers and takes referrals from Barnet and Brent councils to help people at risk.They also serve local key workers. With the help of the local Indian restaurant Majjo’s, they deliver lunch to the Whittington Hospital’s midwife team every Tuesday, and upwards of 70 cooked meals to the police station in Wood Green on a Wednesday.“Our volunteers don’t know these families and go to them, and the families don’t know our volunteers and trust them, and that is so powerful. It’s almost like a salary – it’s the reward.”Frank Charles: the inspirational Londoner running a foodbank from homeAlongside a yearly appeal to help provide ill children with Christmas presents, Frank Charles also runs Feed the Streetz, a community project providing breakfast to rough sleepers. And since the pandemic has hit, the East Londoner has transformed his own home into a foodbank of sorts.Delivering PPE, food and little luxuries to the staff at Whipps Cross Hospital – where all three of his sons were born – Frank is responding to calls for aid to vulnerable families, GOSH, and care homes across East London. “I’d do it anyway, it’s in my DNA.”Discover more hereIan Alcorn: the Nottingham-based dad-of-four who has helped raise £160,000 through garden campoutsNottingham-based bathroom fitter and dad-of-two Ian Alcorn had two goals: he wanted to support the NHS and to keep his children occupied. And so the Great British Campout was born, a JustGiving page that encouraged people to camp out in their back garden and to donate to £2 to NHS Charities together. He’d never have thought that just several weeks later, the initiative would have raised £160,000 from participants across the globe.He now plans to host campouts worldwide over the May bank holiday weekends, in a bid to raise the total funds to half-a-million-pounds to support NHS workers on the front line of the Coronavirus pandemic.The support has poured in and Ian has been humbled by all the praise and thanks from NHS workers. “But I’m not the one wearing a cape – it’s just an idea come good. They are the ones I want to thank and that’s the whole reason this came about.”Discover more hereMichelle Rosewell: the Bexleyheath resident taking hundreds of calls from the area\u0027s most vulnerableIt was mid-March when mother-of-four Michelle Rosewell asked her Facebook contacts if they knew any local organisations who needed help. The Bexleyheath resident wanted to get involved, but wasn’t sure how.She then met Fiona Thompson on the Nextdoor website. And they became two of Isolation Help Bexley’s founding members, along with Dave Paul, Eugene Petzer, Liz Millmore and Colin Harrison.Michelle recounts a conversation with a local resident who had neither the cash nor means to get the essentials she needed. A box was packed for her and when she opened it she saw some flowers. “Her and her mum burst out crying, phoned me back and said ‘it’s made our day.’“It’s definitely brought people together, and I think things will change,” suggests Michelle. “They’ve changed already.”Discover more hereWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

I had a great relationship with a lot of them, not all of them but a lot of them.”In 2016, Cole was forced to deny reports that he was arguing with his then-partner, the singer Anastacia, who later revealed she was still in touch with “pretty much everyone” from Strictly, apart from Cole. “We don’t have that kind of connection. It was just for the show,” she said.Why the spectre of Crash still haunts Hollywood, 15 years onGame of Thrones actor becomes Asda delivery driver during pandemicCraig Revel Horwood says Strictly could film without audienceCole also said another of his partners, Lulu, was “blooming awful”, telling Loose Women: “But she felt the same about me, so it’s alright.”Cole’s other celebrity partners during his time on the show include Sophie Ellis-Bextor, Kelly Brook\u0026nbspand Natasha Kaplinsky, with whom he won the first ever series.The 2020 series of Strictly Come Dancing has been thrown into doubt amid the coronavirus lockdown, but judge Craig Revel Horwood recently said it could follow in the footsteps of Dancing With The Stars Australia and go ahead without a studio audience.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The government keeps saying this pandemic is a war – well, we were being killed.”At least 28 drivers in the capital have died after being diagnosed with Covid-19. Figures for the rest of the country are difficult to confirm but it seems likely at least another dozen have similarly succumbed.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesTogether, they were young and old, veterans and relative newcomers, and from a range of\u0026nbspbackgrounds. Some had underlying health conditions. One, Martin Egan, a driver in Bristol, had not taken a day off sick in more than six years.But what they all had in common was that, as Covid-19 swept the country in late February and early March – as it became clear the simple act of sharing an enclosed space with others was a health hazard – they kept driving. They kept turning up to do their job – because if they did not, says Murphy, “no one else would get to work either”.Teachers, he points out, “would not get to schools nurses wouldn’t get to hospitals”.NHS Nightingale hospital to stop admitting patients this week, leaked Suspend rent to help workers at risk of job loss, think tank saysBoris Johnson ‘thought it was over’, Trump saysCameron Mackintosh says theatres ‘unlikely’ to reopen this yearClarke fears fans unlikely to return to sport ‘any time soon’Staggered work times expected as part of UK lockdown exit strategyAs the country continues to wrestle with the coronavirus crisis, certain professions have stepped up to be counted in a way that has been a privilege to witness. NHS staff, delivery drivers and supermarket assistants have all shown themselves to be among a new backbone of Britain.And key among these key workers have been bus drivers and transport workers.In many ways, they have found themselves on something approximate to a front line. “But you carry on because, what’s drummed into you, is that it’s you who keeps the country moving,” says Murphy, a driver in London of 25 years before he took up his current post with Unite. “Whatever happens – terror attack, disaster, pandemic – it’s your duty to carry on.”Graham Vidler, chief executive of the Confederation of Passenger Transport, puts it another way: “Without all those working in the bus industry, the emergency network for key workers would grind to a halt.”Such workers have done all this, it’s worth adding, despite measures to protect their safety often being slow and limited. More of which shortly.For now, none of this has gone unnoticed by many of us.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It runs less now than it did six weeks ago. But, amid the collapsing economies and rising death figures on TV and the empty streets outside, its presence once every hour or so is a reassuring reminder that some normality still exists.The world is in crisis, perhaps, but you can still catch a First South Yorkshire from Lodge Moor up to Charnock.“It’s lovely to know you can have that effect on people just by driving your bus,” says Rebecca Holt, a staffer with Nottingham City Transport which runs 50 services a day in the East Midlands city. “People have told me what we’re doing is inspiring but it’s just my job. It’s actually quite nice having quiet roads for once.”All the same, she realised just how much she was impressing others when a van driver flashed her through a junction last week.“There were two of them in the cab,” she says. “And, as I passed through, they started clapping me. I was just like, ‘Oh wow’. I felt like royalty.”The 45-year-old is one of 173 of NCT’s 850 drivers still currently on the roads.Since the lockdown, passenger numbers have fallen across the country to around 15 per cent of pre-crisis levels. Services have been reduced accordingly with resources redirected to routes connecting high population areas to key infrastructure such as hospitals and major supermarkets.As a result, an estimated 80 per cent of the country’s 95,000 drivers have been furloughed. Stagecoach, the country’s biggest provider, has placed 55 per cent of its drivers and engineers on the government scheme.Yet the fact that many such workers were apparently willing to carry on – indeed, did carry on pre-lockdown even as infection rates soared amongst colleagues – is a sign, it might be suggested, of an unrecognised sort of heroism.“I wouldn’t call myself that,” demurs Holt, a mother-of-one who has been in what she calls her “dream job” for four years.Why did she volunteer to keep driving then, I wonder? She’s not entirely sure. Financially, she says, she would have been happy enough to take a temporary 20 per cent pay cut and have the time off.But? “I wanted to do something. I’m not a nurse. I can’t help people if they’re sick. But what I can do is get the nurses to where they need to be.”Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The sun appears to explode over the horizon in this montage of images captured by photographer Nick Lucas near his home in Ringwood, Hampshire.

Her husband Dave, a fellow staffer, went on furlough to look after their two sons but she continued in her cab.“Perhaps I’m blase about the risks,” she says. “But this is my town and I wanted to carry on serving it.”Was she not worried, given the disproportionate number of drivers losing their lives, for her own heath? “Every time you hear of another driver like that, it’s devastating,” she says. “You can’t help but think about if it could happen to you. But you do what you can to stay safe and hope you’ll be OK.”She\u0026nbspherself is happy with measures taken by companies to protect their drivers.Most are, by all accounts, now being provided with hand sanitiser and antibacterial wipes, and vehicles are deep-cleaned once a day. In London, after a concerted campaign, only the middle doors are being opened to the public. Elsewhere, holes in the plastic cab screens – which allowed drivers to better hear customers – have been filed in.“We used to call them bandit screens,” says Russell. “Now, they’re known as virus screens.”Yet, equally, there have been questions raised over whether companies – and the government – acted quickly enough.Many safety measures were not introduced until post-lockdown – when many drivers had already fallen ill with Covid-19 – while there is still no PPE provided as standard. Calls to require customers to wear face masks have gone unheeded. When some drivers blocked off the first two rows of seats on their vehicles – essentially to ensure passengers were keeping their distance – a manager at Arriva threatened disciplinary action. The company later apologised.“Safety measures are starting to appear now,” says Murphy, of Unite, again. “But if you go back to the war analogy, the enemy would have been at Hadrian’s Wall while we were still discussing defences. It was too slow, and it still doesn’t go far enough.”The union is now calling for the £60,000 life assurance payment promised to families of NHS workers who die with coronavirus to be applied to bus drivers too.“We accept that NHS staff and social care staff are in the highest category of risk,” says Bobby Morton, national officer for passenger transport. “But other key workers should be not be forgotten if the worst unfortunately happens.“What we have discovered about coronavirus is that it is an indiscriminate killer that has been responsible for the deaths of far too many bus workers who are classed as key workers, keeping the country running during this national emergency.”Back in Nottingham, it is something that Holt believes is a reasonable request – but she also has another somewhat simpler hope.“I’ve been getting more people say thank you when they get off than I’ve ever known before,” she says. “It’s lovely to hear that, it makes you feel appreciated. When all this is over, I hope that carries on.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

And that is a cost very much worth paying.“Even despite mass furloughing, unemployment is still soaring, with over 2 million new claims for benefits coming though.“This should remind us how badly needed the retention scheme is, but also that we are likely to be living with the legacy of high unemployment that coronavirus has given Britain, long after it has been phased out.”The figures came as pensions minister Therese Coffey said the government had received 1.8 million claims for Universal Credit between 16 March and the end of April.Ms Coffey said that overall, the volume of welfare claims had been six times bigger than pre-coronavirus during that period, and that in one particular week the increase had been tenfold.Additional reporting by agenciesOffice for Budget Responsibility\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

In Los Angeles, US, 700 food packages will go to homeless military veterans. Other projects are in India and Ethiopia.How we treat animals ‘still risking spreading disease’Naomi Hallum, director of the organisation, which is funded by donations, said: “We hope that the $100,000 of food we are giving will help relieve some of the suffering caused by Covid-19, but the real value of our work lies in education, in telling people how and why these pandemics emerge, in showing the destruction caused to our planet and our bodies when we eat animal products.“The coronavirus pandemic, like many others before it, is creating tragedies for families all over the world. None of us wants this to happen ever again but to prevent future outbreaks, there are some difficult lessons we must learn.“If we continue to stress wild animals by decimating their habitats and capture and cage them in markets — and if we continue to mass produce domesticated animals inside squalid factory farms and transport them long distances — there will be no avoiding a future pandemic.”T Colin Campbell, professor emeritus of nutritional biochemistry at Cornell University, New York, claimed: “A wholefoods plant-based diet can prevent, perhaps even reverse, the chronic degenerative diseases that make older iniduals more susceptible to Covid-19.”Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Smaller charities, in particular, are at risk of imminent closure if adequate support is not provided”.According to evidence submitted to the MPs, the UK has more than 160,000 registered charities with the majority being smaller organisations with an annual income of less than £100,000.Created with Sketch.How coronavirus lockdowns changed the world\u0027s most polluted cities Show all 6Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.In a warning to ministers, the report went on: “We are concerned that the support announced to date is not enough, and that a lack of transparency in how these funds are being allocated means deserving charities will lose out.“We therefore call on the government to increase the support available to charities through a comprehensive stabilisation fund, and to ensure that support is made available to charities that are not directly working on Covid-19 but facing financial hardship.”“The government must also adapt existing support schemes for businesses to ensure they provide appropriate support for the charity sector. It must take these steps urgently, within a month to prevent charities from folding.”MPs on the committee also suggested introducing a separate coronavirus Job Retention Scheme for the charity sector, in order to allow furloughed employees to volunteer for their own organisations during the crisis.Julian Knight, the Tory MP who chairs the committee, said: “The strong message that charities gave us was not that they have some sort of right to survive but that people have a right to the services they provide.“We warned the chancellor that charities told us they faced a £4bn gap in money coming in, with some smaller charities facing insolvency within weeks without immediate emergency support.”He added: “The sum of money that’s been made available goes nowhere near replacing the income that many charities have lost.“We’re urging the government to set up a stabilisation fund to assist organisations to stay afloat so that we avoid increasing hardship among those who depend on charities to help them during this crisis and beyond.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I think she might do well to take a leaf out of the shadow secretary\u0027s book in terms of tone.“I’m afraid what she said is not true. There’s been a rapid acceleration of testing offer the last few months in this country, including getting to 100,000 tests a day.“We’ve been entirely transparent on the way that that has been measured throughout, and I have confidence that the rate will continue to rise.“Currently capacity is 108,000 a day, and we are working to build that higher.“Of course, we’ve been working very hard to make the testing capacity grow as fast as possible and as more tests are available so we are able to make them available\u0026nbsp to more people and test people right across the NHS.”The prime minister\u0027s official spokesman later said: It may be at the moment there is less demand for tests from key workers because the infection rate is stablising or falling. I would hope everyone can agree that that is a good thing. If fewer people are going into hospital with coronavirus symptoms that will mean fewer tests need to be carried out in NHS setting. Likewise, if there\u0027s less community transmission, it will mean that key workers potentially need fewer tests. That shouldn\u0027t be seen as a bad thing.The key point is capacity has been really significantly increased. We can now do more than 100,000 tests a day and as we move forward into the next phase, including the rollout of \u0027trace, track and test\u0027, we have the capacity we need.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

That was down from 34.5 in March, which had already been a record low. In the depths of the 2008 financial crisis, the survey fell to 40.1.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesAround 79 per cent of services businesses reported activity fell in April. Much of the decline\u0026nbspwas expected because restaurants, bars, non-essential retailers and other services businesses were forced\u0026nbspto shut down on 23 March to slow the spread of Covid-19.But the survey demonstrates just how drastically\u0026nbspactivity has been curtailed. Government measures such as grants to hospitality businesses and cheap loans to small firms have been designed to ensure that, as much as possible, the contraction is a temporary result of the coronavirus lockdown and does not develop into a longer-term depression.The PMI\u0026nbspsurvey\u0026nbspis seen as an early indicator of future economic performance because it polls managers in companies about what is happening to their orders and supplies.But forecasting how the economy will perform beyond the immediate time horizon has become a near-impossible task, with huge disparities between the most pessimistic and optimistic projections.The news came as the UK death toll from coronavirus surpassed that of every other European nation. Only the US – with a population five times the size – has seen more Covid-19 deaths.Tim Moore, economics director at IHS Markit, said: “April’s PMI data highlights that the downturn in the UK economy during the second quarter of 2020 will be far deeper and more widespread than anything seen in living memory.“Historical comparisons of the PMI with GDP indicate that the April survey reading is consistent with the economy falling at a quarterly rate of approximately 7 per cent, but we expect the actual decline in GDP could be even greater, in part because the PMI excludes the vast majority of the self-employed and the retail sector.“Just one in five service providers managed to avoid a drop in business activity since March and those hardest hit by social distancing measures and travel restrictions often reported complete stoppages of business operations.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Below are the times for London:Muslims must fast between sunrise and sunset every day in Ramadan.However, they are able to enjoy one meal pre-dawn and one after sunset each day.Iftar is the meal eaten after the fourth prayer of the day, the Maghrib, which happens just after sunset.In Arabic, tar means break of a fast, and fatoor means breakfast.It is the second meal of the day during Ramadan as those taking part in the fast must not eat or drink anything during daylight hours.The Suhur is consumed in the morning and can be as early as .am.The Iftar is considered a blessing, often enjoyed as a community.It is thought not eating during daylight hours, as well as not drinking, smoking or indulging in sex will lead to greater taqwa or consciousness of God.The time of spiritual reflection, improvement and increased devotion and worship is thought to teach followers how to be more self-disciplined and have empathy for those less fortunate.But with lockdown measures in place, gatherings will need to be kept according to government guidelines.This year, Ramadan began on Thursday, April  and is set to end on Saturday, May .The fast is  days long and the beginning and end are determined by the lunar Islamic calendar – meaning it depends on when the new moon is sighted.Hilal, the crescent, is usually a day or more after the astronomical new moon.The night of power or night of decree is considered the holiest night of the year, as Muslims believe the first revelation of the Koran was sent down to Muhammad on this night.Its thought to have occurred on an odd-numbered night during the last ten days of Ramadan - the st, rd, th, th or th.The first day of fasting began on April, ,  and the final Iftar should take place on the evening of May .The holiday of Eid al-Fitr marks the end of Ramadan and the beginning of the next lunar month.This annual observance is regarded as one of the Five Pillars of Islam.A common greeting is Ramadan Mubarak, which means have a blessed Ramadan."},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus women equal leadership","story":"AS I have often pointed out, there are many reasons why women make good leaders.In my experience, they tend to be good collaborators because their ego is unlikely to interfere with letting other people have good ideas, and be able to voice them and take credit for them.Their emotional intelligence and empathy makes them excellent communicators.But it’s not just my view that women are good leaders. Many studies show women are more focused on building community and teams.They are more likely than men to cultivate a erse set of advisers to help them succeed. They are also more likely to follow advice.A study by management consulting firm McKinsey found that women are more people- orientated and spend more time developing and coaching other leaders in their organisation. In other words, they don’t need to reserve all the glory for themselves.There is something  at play too, though. Female leaders are more likely to be blameddecisions are unpopular or ineffective. They are questioned and second-guessed more often than men.But then Covid- entered the equation and presented world leaders with a new challenge — an invisible enemy that is highly contagious, unpredictable and deadly.This pandemic has been an unprecedented test for all concerned.And guess what  A disproportionate number of those who have passed this test — countries such as Germany, New Zealand, Iceland and Finland — have women at the helm.It is not exclusively female-led countries that are doing well, of course. But bearing in mind only seven per cent of all world leaders are women, about  per cent of countries led by women are doing well when it comes to containing Covid-. Global health experts have concluded that one thing that has led to success in tackling coronavirus is — speed.Prof Tom Bollyky, director of global health programme at US think-tank the Council on Foreign Relations, said: “Countries that have not dithered in their response, that have mobilised quickly, have done well.”New Zealand’s PM Jacinda Ardern put it simply: “Go hard and go early.”The number of Covid--related deaths is predicted to be substantially lower in areas where leaders acted sooner, even by a week, because they flattened the curve and prevented new cases.Many women acted first and made the brave decision to shut down le as we knew it, even though that was an unpopular thing to do.But it seems women leaders are listening to World Health Organisation advice and also looking at other countries for guidance.They don’t think they have all the answers but women are able to put their ego to one side and let experts guide them — something which cannot be said of Donald Trump.Incidentally, I have not seen any women leaders making unfounded or dangerous suggestions about possible cures. Can you imagine a woman leader suggesting that people inject Dettol into themselves, as dingbat Trump recently suggested Or can you imagine a woman suggesting to people that they can fight coronavirus and winthey are strong enough This pandemic is not a battle to be fought and won. It is a virus, which can affect literally anyone.No one knows how they will be affected and that bullish “fight it” approach is, in my experience, very male. Conversely, the decision to protect everyone, putting the most at risk first, is more female.It’s interesting that some male leaders seem more interested in covering up the problems. Like Donald Trump, who thinks he is an expert on everything and more fixated on garnering praise for what he has done than fixing and getting right what has not gone so well.I know I am talking in generalisations here but my experience of women is that we want to understand the mistakes and fix them, not cover them up.This pandemic has been full of dficulty and tragedy for everyone.But perhaps one good thing that will come out of it is that the world will acknowledge women deserve an equal  when it comes to leadership.The Sun has launched an appeal to raise £MILLION for NHS workers.

In fact, it’s unrecognisable after just six weeks of lockdown.The images show how the usually murky waters of the UK coastline have been transformed, which must surely be due in part to a reduction in pollution since the coronavirus pandemic stopped leisure traffic on the Solent.But other astonishing photos from all over the world have surfaced recently too.Pollution-free images of landmarks in Delhi and Beijing, which are all too often seen shimmering under a haze of smog, are a real reminder of our role in creating pollution and also in reducing it.Imagineanother silver lining to this terrible pandemic was that we all began to understand the effects of our impact on the environment, and that we took the threat of climate change more seriously – and started to take responsibility for changing our ways.I AM as keen as the next person to regain my freedom, and for things to begin toto normal.But I cannot be the only one who gave a shudder at the thought of being allowed to choose a “bubble” of just ten family members as friends, as was hinted at by some.Can you even imagine the disputes, upsets and hurt feelings that would result all over the landyour chosen bubble had chosen another group to huddle with In fact, that rule would likely cause so much offence that we would only have ten friends left. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Still, saying goodbye to their companions was devastating for people. Their dogs are their company, love, loyalty and trust – their everything. Driving the dog away, I’d burst into tears.”Six weeks into lockdown the owners are missing their dogs, but Michelle sends them daily pictures and videos to reassure them.“Some of the dogs slept in the bottom of their owners’ sleeping bags so we bought sleeping bags for them to burrow into,” Michelle says. “Others preferred to be on top of duvets. Their kennels are heated and during the day we keep the dogs busy, playing in our three acres of grounds, so there’s no time to pine for their owners.”One dog – Miss L, a young husky – is a case in point. Her owner was distraught when he said goodbye to her – they’d been together since she was eight weeks old – and he was worried about how she’d cope without him. But Michelle discovered she loves cheese, which helped gain her trust, and now Miss L is settled in, making friends with fellow lockdown pups.Some homeless people, however, couldn’t face being parted from their canine companions so remained on the streets. Michelle and her team are there to support them too.“We’re operating the mobile clinic as a food bank for dogs, and the   emergency line,” Michelle says. “We’ve had people in dire financial straits contact us saying they can’t afford to keep their dogs and we’ve organised food parcels so they can stay together.”In the current crisis, working on the streets, Michelle and her volunteers are effectively on the front line. A medical supply company donated gloves and masks and Deborah Meaden sent hand sanitisers to help them.Still, Michelle has been diagnosed with pneumonia, possibly Covid- related, and is recovering at home with her ex-street dog Brock by her side while her team continue DOTS’ work.“I just want to get better and back out there, helping the homeless community,” Michelle says. “There will be some emotional reunions when this is over.”When British schools went into Covid- lockdown, a nationwide network of teachers, including Sandra Obike, stepped up to support NHS heroes.Sandra, who is head of design and technology at Swanlea School in east London, immediately put her skills and workspace to best use – first, sourcing spare unused personal protective equipmentthat could be donated to a nearby major hospital, and then using her school design and technologylab to create  brand new visors for key workers.And she isn’t alone – DT staff at more than  British schools are now collectively involved in the fight against Covid-, manufacturing and donating more than , items of vital PPE including visors, goggles, scrubs, masks and more.“We’ve been doing things since the very first week of lockdown, communicating using sites like Facebook, sharing resources and free design templates,” explains Sandra.“I asked our school headteacherwe could use the materials, space and machinery, and she instantly said yes. I also had a contact at Royal London Hospital, and asked: ‘Can I help  Would it be useful to have some visors ’, and she jumped at the chance.“I knew immediately that we had some unused PPE like goggles, aprons and gloves – so we sent that to the hospital at the start of April, so they were able to start using it as soon as possible.”Sandra, her boyfriend and one of her DT colleagues then set to work at school, creating new visors while safely observing social distancing. They used open-source design templates – provided for free by expert companies like Kitronik and Smoke  Mirrors, who’ve also been key to this Covid- effort – and their ingenuity with the materials they already had.“We were working pretty much like an assembly line, cutting the material, sterilising the parts, assembling it all and then bagging everything for delivery,” says Sandra.“As a teacher, I’m now working from home and interacting with students, but making visors was something I could do while still continuing my day-to-day job. I felt like it was something I could do in the interim, to keep key workers safe, while there was a shortage of PPE.”It’s clear that Sandra is passionate about her DT teaching profession: “We’re educating the engineers of the future,” she says.There’s also no doubt that creating visors is for her a very personal response: “A lot of my family members and friends work within the NHS, as doctors and nurses,” she says. “My mum is retired, but still helping out in a care home. As technologists, we’re problem-solvers – we try to work around the issue, and find a way to do things. For instance, we’ve got two large-scale laser cutters at our school, which meant we could cut quite a bit in a short scale of time, and some places have used D printers – so you work to the best ability that you’ve got.”Teamwork is at the heart of this story, too. This is about colleagues and collaborators, from dedicated DT teachers to suppliers who donate materials free of charge.“Social media has mobilised our effort, on a national scale,” says Sandra. “Where there is surplus, we’ll try to logistically pass it around the network across Britain. Seeing the sheer numbers of what people have done and contributed – that’s when it hits home how amazing this is.“As a teacher, this is a small thing I can do, so that someone who’s potentially putting their le at risk can go into a safer situation at work, and do something big. Everyone is working together for that common goal. It goes to show how much we love the NHS, and how much we want to step out to support them.”Big-hearted Brits are making a dference to other people’s lives every day in this time of crisis – and sometimes it’s the little things that mean the most.Five-year-old Lucy Dawson has been busy delivering handmade paper flowers to her neighbours in Fakenham in Norfolk – leaving them with a note on their doorsteps in the hope of raising a smile and lting people’s spirits during the lockdown.“I learnt to make the paper flowers at my breakfast and after-school club before the lockdown. I wanted to cheer people up,” Lucy says.Her parents, Shelley, , and Marc, , couldn’t be prouder of their daughter, who’s received chocolate and cards from grateful neighbours.Lucy says: “I felt happy and proud that I helped to cheer people up. It gave me happy tears.”Mum Shelley says: “Lucy is creative and loves crafting. She suggested leaving the flowers on doorsteps with a note as a little surprise.”For many neighbours, locked down until the coronavirus has passed, a surprise gt has been the highlight of their day.Lucy and her mum have been careful to observe social distancing and to make the doorstep deliveries during their daily exercise session, using plenty of hand sanitising gel along the way.Shelley says: “She’s a caring little girl. Her grandad Andrew, who’s , lives next door and we can’t see him at the moment. So she leaves handmade gts on his doorstep because she misses him so much.”One note from a neighbour was wrapped around a chocolate bar, and said: “This is just a little thank you from us, it made us smile and we really needed that today.”Dad Marc adds: “We’re extremely proud of what Lucy has done for her neighbours. The look on her face when she received the thank you gts and notes is something me and Shelley will never forget.”A neighbour who works as an AE nurse in King’s Lynn was especially touched when she discovered Lucy’s flowers on her doorstep. She and her family wrote a note of thanks.The Dawsons needed something to feel good about. Shelley was meant to start a new job as a commercial property manager this month but it fell through because of the coronavirus crisis, while Marc has been furloughed from his job as a mechanical supervisor.“We’re busy home schooling and trying to keep Lucy busy,” he says. “She’s an only child and I think she’s getting a bit bored! She misses her friends but she’s working hard at her reading, writing and maths – and she and I love to play football in the garden.”The Dawsons are Norwich City fans, so they were delighted when Lucy won a Community Hero award from the club recently for her flower initiative.And she’s not stopping there. Lucy’s planning to leave handmade cards on neighbours’ doorsteps next.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

British journalism, in particular.What’s stopping you right now from falling off your perch in fits of laughter  Well, the fact that you’re currently digesting a work of journalism.This probably means that it’s an act – let’s call it that for now – which you’re used to committing on a fairly regular basis.Let’s also assume then that much of the information you gather, store and share comes from such journalistic sources.It’s likely you frequently form opinions and make decisions based on this content you consume.In fact, think really hard for a moment and try and imagine an area of your le where you haven’t been guided in some form by journalism.Buying a house, investing your savings, choosing a school, picking a holiday, deciding which box to put your cross in when you go into a polling booth .If you’re honest with yourself, you tend to make most of those decisions after you’ve digested the array of journalism available to you. And let’s also admit, disregarded too.Some of it is opinion led, some is impartial. You might not agree with all of it, and sometimes you might get ruddy cross at a paper or commentator that doesn’t chime with your world view.But together, the many erse components of British journalism create something which is profoundly valuable.The Covid- pandemic has tested our society to the limit. In the midst of a national crisis, journalists have been putting their lives at risk to keep you informed.News outlets have faithfully broadcast public health announcements – but also held our political leaders to account.The Downing Street daily conference has become a household staple, with ministerial interrogation by the press corps regularly influencing government policy.Without such probing questions and front page splashes, would you have known about the dearth of PPE or the crisis in our care homes Journalism, from local to national level, has connected communities in a way that social networks can only dream of. We have celebrated triumph in the face of adversity – and also documented tributes from the tens of thousands who have lost loved ones.But now we come to the rub.With the country under lockdown, British journalism is facing the biggest threat in its storied history.For newspapers, sales have dramatically fallen. For broadcasters and online outlets, advertising has gone through the floor even whilst audience numbers have risen.Yes, journalism joins one of many industries in financial peril right now.The work of reporters should be held up to scrutiny like any other profession. But we also need to acknowledge the sacrices its practitioners are making to keep the public informed.Everything that journalism hands to you doesn’t come for free.I’m sure that when you think about this properly, in a way you might never have done before, it really is needed more than everWe have to safeguard journalism. It is far too important to discard because it isn’t worth contemplating what the world would look likequality journalism didn’t exist.I don’t need to urge you to buy a paper or take up an online subscription, but I want you to tell everyone you meet that our sector is under a very real and present threat.I am the CEO of the Journalists’ Charity. It was founded in  by Charles Dickens and a group of parliamentary reporters – naturally in a pub.Our core mission to this day remains the same: to bring aid to journalists and their dependents who have fallen on hard times.We are stepping up to the mark, helping those in need with emergency funding and practical and emotional support.It’s why we’ve launched a #supportjournalism campaign in print and on social media.For me, a lockdown without journalists would be unthinkable.That’s why the Journalists’ Charity is standing four-square behind our industry when it needs us most.

He’s just Jamie Oliver with a skipping rope, I assumed, before this wretched lockdown business began.A character we’ve all seen in our local park, with a pair of boxing gloves and a stopwatch, charging financial managers £ a haemorrhoid to do some sit-ups over by the ornamental lake.One of Britain’s ever-growing army of personal trainers who,he wasn’t bouncing around on YouTube every morning, would be clogging up Love Island or Ex On The Beach.That’s what I thought, anyway.Then the coronavirus hit, the local swimming pool shut, the man became a phenomenon and before I could come to my senses, Joe and his infernal timing device were beeping away in my living room, every morning, as I joined in his PE lesson. Inevitably, it didn’t last.First, Joe’s routine did me what I can only describe as “a mischief”.Then, one morning, aged , I caught sight of myself, in a picture frame, doing his “reverse frog shuffle” and thought: “Stuff this for type two diabetes. I’m out.”I’d got no closer to understanding Joe’s astonishing popularity, though, which is truly global.Over , people log in just to stare at his fairly spartan living room, every Monday to Friday.Hundreds of thousands more appear when Joe starts his  minutes of physical jerks.So, in an attempt to unlock the greatest mystery of the outbreak, I kept watching Joe and swtly came to the conclusion success was not linked to his presenting skills.But while they are helping save lives, who is there to help them The Sun has launched an appeal to raise £MILLION for NHS workers.

Nah, only joking.”The jokes need to go the same way as the viewers’ poems, in honour of Joe, which he was actually reading out loud, until modesty finally prevailed.Much safer ground is the “spot the dference” competition, which borders on insulting, when he’s merely placed his wall atlas upside down or swapped his electric guitar for a ukulele, but does hint at the drive, ambition and ego behind the man.One day he replaced the atlas with a picture of himself, the next with a picture of his “other house” in Los Angeles and suddenly the penny dropped.Joe’s loaded and his head is not just on its way to Hollywood, it’s already there, making movies and doing squat thrusts with Gwyneth and Brad.The weird thing is, in other presenters, soap actors or comedians, I’d roll my eyes at the folly.With Joe Wicks, I don’t. ’Cos I can’t help it, I quite like him.Part of that may be linked to his no-frills background and a level of personal generosity that’s way beyond most of us .But I like to think it’s got more to do with the fact that, at a time when other cynical, doom-mongering TV hosts are desperately trying to read the public mood, reinvent themselves and force their agenda on viewers, Joe Wicks is just doing what he’s always done. Sit-ups.He may not be Emily Maitlis , but he’s the irrepressible and lucky optimist telling us to get off our fat a***s when we need to hear it most.He’s temporarily indisposed at the moment, of course.A gammy arm means we Rosie is leading the workouts.But I was firmly of the opinion nothing and no one could ever stand in the way of world domination, until I tuned into Sunday night’s Diva On Lockdown and there was Gemma Collins trying to contort her mighty bulk into one of Joe’s squats while she bellowed: “I wonder how Joe Wicks would feelhe knew the GC was doing his workout ”Beaten, I’d imagine.He must never know.Get Britains best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day - find out more.And her face is glued to the back of her head.So there will be hell to payit comes unstuck on The Real Marigold Hotel, where the only other one of the eight celebs who’s appeared looking as unearthly as Britt is former Dragons’ Den star Duncan Bannatyne, whose hair is now a “vibrant and colourful” shade of roast papaya orange.

But Henry was a great player, so don’t make me choose between them.”Paul Merson: “The secret to working hard is to work hard.”ON one particularly fraught episode of her Channel  show, last week, Steph McGovern was forced to let a wasp out of her living room window, live on air.Probably halving her audience in the process.A day later it was announced the show itself was being released back into the wild, or as they put it “taking a break”.Credit for this development was being given to Steph’s long-suffering neighbours, who’d objected to the disruption the production had caused and may yet get a Bafta fellowship for their intervention.Truth be told, though, Steph’s “power hour of positivity” was more likely killed by worthiness, lack of content, technical issues and the host herself, who’s a rotten interviewer, kills every good joke stone dead, has the same set response to everythingand a terrible habit of asking exactly the wrong question.“Martin , what are you doing with all that toilet paper ” “Errr . . . ”There’s talk of a brave new dawn, in a shiny Leeds studio, later this year and when I last checked, author Marian Keyes was giving some pointed advice on how to become a good novelist: “Your first efforts will be woefully appalling.

But at the end of the day we have got to get our economy back up and running and we’ve got to try and encourage as many people back to the workplace.”Health Secretary Matt Hancock said: “We obviously need to get people safely back to work so we can withdraw from that scheme.It’s been very successful at keeping jobs and firms alive ... we also need to wean people off it.”British Airways announced they would be making , people redundant, despite putting , of its , employees on furlough - triggering redundancy fears within the Government. Another option - to end furloughing sector by sector as more areas of the economy are released - was rejected over concerns of creating a clf-edge for some workers but not others.A spokesman for No said: You heard from the Chancellor last night where he said he was working on the most effective way to wind down the scheme and ease people back into work.Ultimately we do need to make sure we can get our economy fired up and people get back to work.Treasury sources did not comment on the specics of the scheme.To receive The Suns Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.Get Britains best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day - find out more.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Where, therefore, masks may have a role is in situations where distancing is not possible.”Signalling his thinking on masks last week, Mr Johnson said they “will be useful” when Britain begins to emerge from lockdown.But Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab also voiced fears about how the move could hurt the NHS without a major new supply of them.Mr Raab told the daily No press conference: “We do not want to detract from the supply of masks and PPE going to frontline workers”.Get Britains best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day - find out more.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The scheme could then be reduced even further over coming months - encouraging people to look for new jobs.The changes being considered are focused on “incentivising work,” a source said.Mr Sunak is expected to announce how the job retention scheme will change after June next week.He wants to give firms certainty about the scheme beyond June and making an announcement by the end of next week is key because employers who are planning to make staff redundant in July must give  days notice. The deadline for this is May .The Sun understands that options being considered include only making the job retention scheme available to workers who the Treasury deem as most financially unstable.This could include renters who are living “hand-to-mouth” each month and whose large proportion of income goes on rent and bills. They are also less protected than homeowners, who are eligible for mortgage holidays. Although tenants can only apply for rental deferrals, landlords are not obliged to comply, while the move would also help prevent them being evicted due to unpaid rent.This could be administered by targeting certain age groups, such as millennials - workers in their s and s who are much more likely to rent.This idea would help young workers stay attached to their current jobs and help protect their future job prospects.Treasury insiders said changes to the scheme could see only workers in sectors that are deemed vital to protect kept on the furlough scheme.This could also allow the Treasury to keep workers furloughed in industries that are likely to be closed longer-term, such as pubs, restaurants, hotels and the tourism industry in general.But industry experts warned that this would cause problems for small businesses that don’t fit into one sector.Federation of Small Businesses chief Mike Cherry warned: “Government must avoid applying a sector straightjacket that doesn’t work for small firms – there are far too many businesses who don’t fit neatly into one box who will need time to get back up and running – like small companies that mainly supply to hotels but aren’t hospitality businesses.”The Treasury is also looking at allowing furloughed employees to work part-time. The Government’s subsidy would be smaller under this option, but it would avoid employers being forced to bar staff from working in order to be eligible for the wage support.The Treasury has said that designing a part-time furlough scheme would be much harder to administer.But officials have told industry groups that it is possible and they are waiting for “political direction”.The FSB’s Mr Cherry urged the Chancellor to prioritise working on finding a part-time furlough scheme that would offer businesses maximum flexibility as they attempt to reopen in the coming weeks.He said: “Small firms must be allowed to get back on their feet one step at a time –  million jobs depend on it.“It’s a dficult situation, but the only feasible option is to allow part time furloughing where furloughed staff canto work for part of their contracted hours. This will enable small employers to stagger back theof their staff at a time when we know economic activity will be at record low levels.”He added: “We need to see these changes made from the beginning of June as small businesses restart. Orders are going unfulfilled because a few hours work doesn’t justy bringing somebody off furlough. Businesses can’t even quote for jobs once lockdown lts. Time is of the essence.”News of the plans to tweak the job retention scheme come after Mr Sunak confirmed earlier this week that he was working on the best way to gradually close it down, which is currently due to run until the end of June.He told ITV News: To anyone anxious about this, I want to reassure that there will be no clf-edge to the furlough scheme.Im working as we speak to figure out the most effective way to wind down the scheme and ease people back into work in a measured way.” Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

She said: “Whilst deaths in hospitals have been falling, deaths in care homes in the week to April  were still rising to the extent that in that week deaths in care homes were about half as many as the deaths in all hospitals. “I think what that shows us is that there is a real issue that we need to get to grips with about what is happening in care homes.” Of the , deaths recorded by the ONS, ,took place in hospitals and ,were in care homes. Dame Angela also said the latest data on social distancing showed the number of motor journeys was creeping up. It does trouble me, she told the daily No  press conference.Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab dismissed international comparisons which put the UK as having the gravest death toll from coronavirus in Europe.He said: You are asking me to speculate there. All I would just say is first of all , lives lost is a massive tragedy, something in this country, on this scale, in this way, weaposve never seen before. He added: In terms of the comparison youaposre suggesting... I donapost think weaposll get a real verdict on how well countries have done until the pandemic is over and particularly until weaposve got comprehensive international data on all cause of mortality. But, in his defence of the Government, Mr Raab said there are dferent ways of counting death.

At the moment, people over  are under pretty much the same rules as the rest of the population. The vast majority can go out for exercise, do essential shopping and pick up medicine - they just have to be more careful than everyone . But campaigners fear that when lockdown is relaxed, older people might be kept under the rules for longer than younger people, for their own safety. That proposal - which has been rumoured but is not in any way confirmed by government - has sparked a backlash among doctorsapos leaders and campaigners. Here are the current rules explained, and what might or might not happen in the future. No. Most over-s are subject to the same lockdown rules that apply to everyone  in the UK. In other words, they can go out for four reasons - essential shopping, exercise once a day, a medical need or work. The dference between over-s and the rest of the UK is they are classed as clinically vulnerable. That dference, however, just means they should be particularly stringent in following lockdown rules. The rules themselves are not tougher for over-s. However, some over-s have been told to stay at home completely for  weeks and not leave, even for exercise or shopping. These are people with a serious health condition who the NHS has told to shield themselves from society. More on this below.  My relative is over .

This group is not defined by age. But by its very nature it does include lots of people over .

A full list is here, butyou are in the shielded group you should have been contacted. Who is aposclinically vulnerableapos  The clinically vulnerable group is all other over-s. They are still at higher risk, but the only dference is they should take particular care to minimise contact with others outside their own home.

This level of suffering was not inevitable. The way the virus spread through Italy and Spain offered a warning to the Government of the need to act with speed to contain the outbreak. Unlike some other countries, we were given a small but crucial window to prepare for this human disaster. Ministers not only squandered this opportunity, they stand accused of failing to heed medical and scientic advice. We know now that on the day the Scientic Advisory Group for Emergencies warned against human contact Boris Johnson was boasting about how many people he had shaken hands with. We know advisers were urging ministers to change misleading advice on social distancing and to implement lockdown faster. And we know widespread testing was abandoned in March as there were not enough kits. The PM has repeatedly said that from the outset the Government has followed the scientic advice. That has not always been the case. The question he needs to answer is: how many lives have been lost as a result  Now think big  The shadow of coronavirus will extend over this country long after the outbreak has been contained. Each day brings yet more evidence of the damage to jobs, businesses and industry. Staff are being shed in large numbers, millions have applied for universal credit and major firms fear for their survival. The immediate task is to support as many people as possible via the Government furlough scheme.

The Duke and Duchess of Sussex broke every royal tradition in the book when it came to Archieaposs birth, keeping the key details secret and opting not to pose for photos on the hospital steps. But one thing they did do in line with other royals before them was keep us waiting a few days before announcing the name. When they did finally reveal that the new royal tot would be known as Archie Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor, they also shared a gorgeous photo of him meeting the Queen and Prince Philip. The announcement confirmed that he wonapost have a HRH title, and would instead use Mountbatten-Windsor - the familyaposs official surname used by all members who donapost have a title. However the name caused a huge row when it was first introduced back in  - decades before Meghan and Harry wrote it on little Archieaposs birth certicate. Before marrying the Queen Philip was Prince Philip of Greece and Denmark of the House of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg. However this wasnapost neutral enough so he adopted the name Mountbatten after his grandparents. When the then Princess Elizabeth had the coupleaposs first child Prince Charles, he assumed they would take on his name in the traditional way.  But Prime Minister Winston Churchill didnapost agree, and wanted them to continue to use the name Windsor, which was the official Royal Family surname. The Queenaposs grandmother Queen Mary agreed, and it caused such a row that the matter was even discussed in Parliament. In the end the Queen made the decision to go with her familyaposs views, and the name Windsor was used. At the time, Philip reportedly said: I am nothing but a bloody amoeba. I am the only man in the country not allowed to give his name to his own children. Royal biographer Sally Bedell Smith even went as far as to suggest that the upset over the name was the reason for the  year age gap between Princess Anne and Prince Edward. However when the couple fell pregnant with their third child Elizabeth was sitting on the throne, which changed things slightly. Philip reportedly refused to drop the issue, and in  she went to see the Harold Macmillan, who had then taken over as PM.

We touched the wall at the same time, panting, and I couldn’t help smiling. There was a time when tying with Sarah in a race would have been unimaginable – as would being in the gym with her. As we headed for a pick-me-up coffee, I reflected on how dferent my mornings were. Just a year before, at over st, I’d get out of breath on the stairs. When the alarm went off I’d see Sarah swinging out of bed and grabbing her gym kit. She’d ask me to join her, but I’d say, ‘No thanks, you enjoy it,’ before burrowing back under the duvet. When I woke again, I always wished I’d gone. I didn’t like being the ‘cuddly dad’ in a family of fit women.Sarah was smashing four gym sessions a week our eldest daughter, Jodie, then , ran fitness classes and Emma at  was an incredible dancer who’d won a national street dance competition as a teenager. I’d always been ‘Big Smiggy’ – a childhood nickname – but I could never find motivation to lose weight. In April , at around st, a series of events put me on the path to change. On a family grave visit, I saw the marble gravestone had toppled over. When I tried to pull it up something gave way with a snap. An operation to repair my distal tendon, detached at the forearm, didn’t go to plan. A nerve was trapped and I ended up with agonising radial nerve palsy and on strong painkillers. I was off work for eight months, watching endless TV and eating takeaways.  Even back at work, I carried on eating more fast food than before and began hiding things from Sarah, filling up on burgers or pizza on the way home, ahead of the dinner she was cooking. I’d been feeling tired all the time, so I had a check-up. My doctor seemed concerned and took blood tests. When I went to get the results, I could tell by his face that it wasn’t good news. He said my heart attack risk was raised, I had pre-diabetes and fatty liver tissue, and unhealthy cholesterol levels. But I still wasn’t in the right headspace to tackle my weight. Even when one day out with Sarah it struck me I’d stopped holding her hand because I thought she might be ashamed to be seen with me. Then a year later a work colleague told me he was going to try Slimming World to lose some weight for a friend’s wedding. I’d always thought it was for women.  Before I knew it, I’d agreed to go with him – a decision I regretted telling my mates about in the pub. I got a ribbing and was told ‘just cut down on the beer. Maybe that way you can fit into a ski suit.’ The lads had always gone skiing together, but I could never picture myself tackling a ski slope. How all that was to change. In February , I nervously went to Slimming World with my workmate only to find everyone so welcoming – but it was a shock when I tipped the scales at st ½lbs, much heavier than I thought. To give me extra motivation, I agreed to go on a  ski trip to Poland with the lads. That first week, I was so desperate to see the scales move I barely ate anything, ignoring advice from my Consultant Kate. Back at the group, I’d lost a lot of weight, but I felt weak and shaky. Kate took me aside for a quiet word, and when I told her I’d pretty much been living on fruit, she patiently went through the Food Optimising plan with me again. She promised meI stuck to the plan it would work, and after a week of eating proper food, I felt a lot more like myself – and I’d lost another ½lbs. I got stuck into the plan properly, and in five weeks I’d lost st. Soon, I developed an interest in food I’d never had before. Fish became my favourite thing to cook at home and Sarah enthusiastically threw herself into preparing meals with me.  I gave up my secret takeaways, cut back on the cans of lager and made healthy, satisfying dishes with help from Sarah – like salmon or cod with pak choi, kale, spinach and rice. Soon, with all the tips and recipe ideas I got at the group, I found I loved rustling up home-made burger and chips with salad, or a quick chicken curry with plenty of fresh chilli and coriander. In the mornings, I’d have poached eggs, beans, mushrooms fried in low-calorie cooking spray and low-fat chicken sausages. And even though I was eating way more than Sarah and the girls, I was still losing weight. A couple of months after I joined the group, Jodie askedI’d go to her weekend gym classes. I agreed. I kept myself to the back row of her Bodyattack class and felt exhausted after lots of sit-ups, press-ups, squat jumps and other high-energy exercises – but also exhilarated. “How was that ” Jodie asked. ‘Awful,” I deadpanned. “When’s the next one ”  In the group, Kate had been talking about activity a lot, and now I’d survived Jodie’s class, I’d proved to myself maybe I was ready for it. So, when Sarah’s am alarm went off the following Monday, I got out of bed and put on my gym kit. The class she had in store sounded taxing – high-intensity interval training. But I actually enjoyed myself, especially as Sarah and I were doing it together. Cooking healthy meals and exercising regularly was really paying off, and I was beginning to look leaner. My mates certainly noticed, and started messaging me for meal advice and recipe recommendations. “I think I miss my big cuddly dad a little bit,” Emma teased. Sarah had also lost a couple of stones just by eating Slimming World meals with me, and losing weight together gave our relationship an added spark. We now trained together four times a week, doing Bodyattack, boxercise and HIIT classes, cooked and ate together each day and at the weekend we’d take our two dogs, Honey and Bella, on long walks along the beach.

One hungry customer is reported to have spent nearly £ on food from their local branch in Exeter. Mammoth queues of traffic stretching  plus cars long have been forming outside the popular restaurants with locked down Brits desperate for their southern fried fix. Alongside the likes of Burger King, KFC was one of the first fastfood outlets to begin trading again last week, a month-and-a-half after closing. Fty-five restaurantsapos drive-thru lanes are now operating again, with even more offering deliveries - though customers are still not permitted to have sit-down meals inside. For updates on coronavirus, follow our live blog HERE.  Photos on social media show people with their orders - with dozens said to be queueing for more than an hour to get their food. Graeme Long, from Birmingham, uploaded a video onto his social media pages and said it was the funniest thing I’ve seen in lockdown, adding: I could not believe my eyes.” Paige Henley said: KFC opens and the whole of Exeter rush there like everybody’s been starving for weeks. Another person in Exeter reportedly spent £ on their takeaway order, reports DevonLive.David Harrison tweeted: Just fuelled up the van, drive past KFC to see  plus cars queued up in drive through! It really must be finger licking good. Tom Longley described the queues outside a KFC in Queens Road, Sheffield, as absolute bedlam since it reopened.  Saw a woman in the car park today screaming at a delivery driver for coming within m of her, he continued. She knows that social distancing is important but can’t see that going to f*****g KFC isn’t. It also appears some were taking the re-openings as a green-light to flout lockdown rules, including congregating in groups.Clf Morgan said: Caused massive queues in Doncaster and people then congregating in park opposite to eat - no respect for the NHS workers , close the lot of them now!This comes as the government is considering letting small groups of family and friends mingle, but this is unlikely to come into play for weeks.A spokesman for the chain said branches had been gradually re-opened, with  restaurants in the UK to be operating for deliveries by Monday. They added: “We are doing this responsibly and carefully, with stringent processes and hygiene measures put in place. All our restaurants will continue serving a limited menu to help the smaller kitchen teams maintain social distancing.

But some were still determined to tie the knot on the day they had planned, whether that be with a scaled down ceremony or with a virtual “wedding” online with all their family and friends tuning in.Here some brides share their stories of how love conquered lockdown...Katherine and Alex Katherine Wood and Alex Moore were one of the last couples to actually tie the knot - getting married just five hours before lockdown.They had been due to wed at the picturesque Wellbeing Farm in Bolton on Saturday March , but in the weeks before the wedding day guests started to pull out in fear of coronavirus.So on the Monday morning before their big day the couple, both PHD students from Manchester, rang the farm to seethey could possibly get married that day. Katherine, , says: “As lockdown approached we knew we had to cancel our main celebration with all our guests. But we desperately wanted to get married so we askedwe could still go ahead with the ceremony. “It was just us and our two close friends as witnesses. It was actually really lovely as we could just concentrate on us and our vows, and not have to split our time between the guests. It was sad that we couldn’t have any family there as they live too far away. But we feel incredibly lucky to have been able to get married before lockdown.  “We are going to have our full celebration next year as our first wedding anniversary.” The couple walked down the aisle to the Toy Story song “You’ve Got a Friend in Me”, and after the ceremony, which took place outside overlooking the rolling hills, Katherine and Alex, , celebrated by having champagne with some rather more unusual guests - the farm’s resident llamas. Becky and Sam Bride-to-be Becky Storey and fiance Sam Beckham found out three weeks before their wedding day that it would have to be cancelled. They were devastated that they weren’t going to be able to share their big day with their  family and friends at Doxford Barns in Northumberland, so decided to take control and have their own mini-wedding.  Becky’s niece and nephew Scarlett and Max are living with the couple at the moment as their parents are frontline workers, so Scarlett donned her bridesmaid dress and Max officiated as the registrar as the couple said their vows to each other. Council worker Becky, , explains: “We were just devastated when we got the news that the wedding couldn’t go ahead as planned. But everything happened so quickly with the virus and things just don’t seem real at the moment, so realised we probably wouldn’t have wanted to get married under these circumstances. “We decided to take ownership of the situation and turn a negative into a positive. We wanted to mark what would have been our wedding day and turn a sad day into a happy one.  “I ordered some decorations online and we decorated the house. I wore a white dress I already had and Sam wore a suit, and we said some vows to each other and exchanged our rings. “Some of our friends and family drove by our house with gts to cheer us up and it actually did feel really special.” Becky and web designer Sam, , shared a video and pictures of their home ceremony online and have received hundreds of messages of support. They have now rearranged their actual wedding for April  next year.  Lizzie and Richard Lizzie Hargreaves never expected to be cooking steak and chips in her wedding dress, but that is exactly what happened when she and finance Richard Sisson had to hastily bring their big day forward. The couple are big practical jokers, so didn’t tell a soul they were planning to get married on April Fool’s Day - even their kids were in the dark. But with lockdown looming, their wedding venue Nottingham Forest Football ground urged them to bring it forward to March . Lizzie says: “No-one ever expected me and Richard to get married, so it was supposed to be one big April Fool’s joke on everyone and the joke ended up being on us.”  They rapidly rearranged and got special permission from the registrars to allow Lizzie’s three children jack, , Noah, nine and Alice, six to attend as well as Lizzie’s mum Alison and her partner Ron. Nottingham Forest even let them tie the knot in the ground’s boardroom with all the club’s silverware in there as a special treat. Lizzie, , who runs an online gt company, explains: “I think it made it more memorable because of the circumstances. Even the two registrars cried and they said they never cry at weddings. I think it was because we all knew that the world was going to change dramatically after that day.” Unfortunately police officer Richard’s parents had flown in from Spain and had to self-isolate so couldn’t attend, and the couple had to cancel their planned reception at a local restaurant to protect Lizzie’s parents.  Lizzie says: “We just went home and I cooed steak and chips in my wedding dress and we had some champagne. It wasn’t what we had planned but we certainly have a story to tell. We just feel so fortunate to have actually been able to get married as so many couples haven’t.” Holly and Endrit Holly Lynch and Endrit Shehu had been planning their wedding for a year when lockdown meant it couldn’t go ahead. They were due to tie the knot in Albania where Endrit’s family live, but the ban on international travel made it impossible. So the couple from Colne in Lancashire decided they had to still mark the date with a virtual zoom wedding for all their family and friends from around the world.  Holly, , explains: “We met in Zante  years ago - Endrit’s family lived there and I was doing a summer season. It was a typical holiday romance. We had planned the wedding in Albania and it would have been the first time most of our family and friends would have met. “We were devastated when we realised it wouldn’t happen, but also we are very aware what a strange situation we are living in and that there are people a lot worse off than us. We are in a global pandemic.”  So on April , what would have been their wedding day, fitness manager Holly wore a white dress and her wedding Jimmy Choo shoes, and personal trainer Endrit, , donned his best suit to say “I do” online. Holly says: “We set up a zoom call and we thought it might last a couple of hours. But it was amazing and turned into a real riot. It went on until about am. In Albania the wedding tradition is to do lots of dancing, so Endrit’s parents led the dancing and people were all dancing in their front rooms.  “Endrit’s best men told funny stories about him, as did my Maid of Honour. It was really, really good. It felt like everyone connected - all of our family and friends from all over the world, with so many dferent cultures. We are really glad we marked the occasion in that way and everyone has now already met virtually ahead of the real thing in Albania next year.” Jacqui and Andrew Instead of having family and friends as witnesses to their wedding Jacqui Keiss and Andrew Reed had their pet budgies Jabba and RD watch them tie the knot. The couple got engaged on Christmas Day  and were supposed to wed at a local restaurant on April  this year, but when lockdown happened they had to postpone until August . So the pair who live in Glasgow decided to go ahead and say their vows in secret in their own front room on what would have been their big day - and then surprised all their family and friends.  Jacqui wore a lilac dress she already had at home, and Andrew, , who works in the NHS, donned a suit before they said their vows and cracked open a bottle of champagne they had been given as an engagement present. Jacqui, , who works in digital marketing, says: “We were getting married that day no matter what. When we got engaged we had planned to elope so I suppose this worked in our favour. And before the wedding was postponed we were worried that my brother and his family who live in Switzerland wouldn’t be able to make it. “I couldn’t get my wedding dress and Andrew couldn’t get his kilt as they shops were shut, so we just had to wear something we already had. But it was romantic - it was just us two and our budgies as witnesses.

Who amongst us hasn’t at some point longed for the pace of modern le to slow down a bit, to spend more time with their family, for a few more quiet nights in  And now we’ve got it. People also often wish they could go back to their carefree, responsibility-lite childhoods, as well. The best days of your le and all that. Well, great news – we’ve got that, too. Thanks to lockdown, we are now kids again. We’ve been transported back to when someone  made our decisions for us and we had no say about anything. We have to do what we’re told, relinquish control, and put all our trust in those looking after us.  Feeling like we’ve regressed to being five years old does at least make sense of why so many of us have been acting like it recently.Sulking, throwing tantrums, not playing nicely with the others, particularly those who stand less than two metres away. Having puppy fat. Who hasn’t ranted and wailed about the rules – even just in our heads – despite them being for our own good, ie saving lives  We’re going to bed early, doing jigsaws, walking around looking like our mums cut our hair with kitchen scissors.  And then – maybe it’s just me – there’s the crying. If coronavirus hasn’t utterly devastated us – emotionally, financially, or both – yet – we are grateful. Trying to keep busy, being positive, looking ahead. But every now and then I can’t help but wobble. And then come the Covid Tears. Some mornings, despite my best efforts, I wake up completely flooded with hopelessness, and then I just wait for them to come.They’re a short, melodramatic flash of depression. There’s probably a psychological term for them, and an explanation about how they happen in times of exceptional stress, when the reality of what is going on is, in the very truest sense of the word, overwhelming. It’s like a volcano of feelings, which has been bubbling away for a while, suddenly erupting. The way to deal with Covid Tears – and the fact we’re all scared, all the time – is to embrace the childhood we have been forced to revert to.  Make like a five year old.

Chiefs have issued a mysterious call-to-arms, putting a picture of a crack trooper in counter-terror kit in the publication Soldier Magazine. The regular Army is also on the hunt – asking veterans to apply to rejoin up to the age of , eventhey were thrown out on disciplinary grounds or medically dis­charged. There have been years of flagging Army numbers. The target of , regular soldiers is short by over ,. A military source said: “Special forces numbers have decreased. Even though regular forces aren’t engaged in operations at anywhere near the tempo of a few years ago, the tempo is still high in special forces. “The time it takes to get a special forces soldier trained means they need to process even more recruits right now. “The advert is a subtle reminder that the right candidate is needed to serve in the world’s most respected special force.” The Ministry of Defence does not reveal the number of special forces troops but most are currently engaged on operations in Iraq, Syria and other hotspots. The drop in numbers comes despite the threat from Islamic State, and Russia becoming increasingly aggressive towards the UK.

The government is considering letting a small group mingle and families may be allowed to leave their homes more often and for longer in time for summer. The proposals are being considered by ministers as they try to steer the nation into adopting a “new normal” routine. But any changes will not be rolled out for several weeks as the government want to see the number of Covid- cases decrease further, Sun Online reports. Prime Minster Boris Johnson ’s official spokesman confirmed ministers are looking at easing the lockdown so Brits can enjoy being outdoors in the sunshine.to get the Mirror’s daily coronavirus briefing email at mirror email -after the press conference every evening. He said: “Once we have the scientic evidence, we will be able to set out what those arrangements are. “Broadly the scientic and medical experts have been clear that there is less likelihood of transmission of this disease outdoors than indoors. “That will obviously be something we are considering as part of the review. Mr Johnson announced last week that the nation was past the peak of the killer virus and was working on his plans to loosen restrictions which he will reveal in a major speech on Sunday. A Scottish government document outlining the plan states: “We are consideringand how we could make changes to allow people to meet with a small number of othersoutside their own household in a group or “bubble” that acts as a single, self-contained unit, without connections to other households or aposbubblesapos. “It is possible that this option would be introduced first for outdoor meetings, ahead of any change to permit indoor meetings of the bubble.”  Under the aposbubble planapos people would be allowed to pick a small number of friends and family to mix with but will not be allowed to mingle with anyone . Relationships with family members and friendships will be tested as people decide who they want in their bubble while grandparents could face a painful dilemma when choosing. Everyone would still need to adhere to social distancing measures when mixing in their bubble. In addition,anyone in the group starts to suffer from coronavirus symptoms the others could be ordered to self-isolate for a fortnight. Current rules only allow people to leave their homesthey are a key worker, to do essential shopping or for their daily exercise. But ministers are considering “changes to allow people to leave their home more often and or for longer”.  Factories and more shops are expected to be among the first phase of businesses allowed to reopen when the lockdown eases. The plans have been drawn up by Scotland, but so far the devolved regions have worked with Westminster on tackling coronavirus. Schools are not expected to reopen all at once under the plans instead kids will be phased back in with Year  pupils expected to go back first. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab warned on Tuesday that sending pupils back to school at the same time could fuel a second spike in coronavirus cases. And the Scottish document backs up his fears as it states hospitals north of the border could be overwhelmed with Covid- admissions within weeksall schools reopened. Mr Raab told the Downing Street press conference: “The one thing I can say with confidence is at least today, the evidence has been that we wouldnapost be able to open up all schools, without a very real risk that the transmission rate would rise at such a level that we would risk a second spike.  “But weaposve asked Sage for the options on this and will as ever be continued to be guided by the scientic advice we get. Issuing a warning that le will notto normal after the lockdown is eased, he said: “We will need to adjust to a new normal where we as a society adapt to safe new ways to work, to travel, to interact and to go about our daily lives. “We have never experienced anything like this first stage of Covid- in terms of the scale of the lives lost but also the lockdown it has required. “As we go forward we want to make sure that the next phase is more comfortable, is more sustainable and prevents lasting damage to jobs and livelihoods.”  The news comes as senior government science advisor resigned on Tuesday after breaking lockdown social distancing rules to meet his lover. Professor Neil Ferguson sat on the governmentaposs SAGE committee, which provides advice to ministers on their response to the pandemic and told Mr Johnson a lockdown was the best way to tackle the killer virus.

Coronavirus has been a tragedy for so many people up and down Britain. As a family, we weren’t able to be with Jo when she died. Now, in very dferent circumstances, thousands of others like us are having to come to terms with not being able to hold a loved one’s hand or offer any comfort in those last moments. Our readers up and down the country are overcoming isolation by connecting with people they wouldnapost usually meet for an online chat. Do you want to join them YES IaposM IN The country responded to Jo’s death with amazing warmth and compassion. People took her words that we all have ‘more in common than that which ides us’ to their hearts. As we hoped, something good and powerful came out of tragic circumstances. Today that same spirit is in evidence in every city, town and village across Britain. People are connecting with others more often, and with more determination and creativity than ever before.Not just helping the most vulnerable, although that is vital, but simply being there for neighbours, distant relations, and folk in the community who might have been strangers a few months ago but now feel like friends.

She has sung it on radio, TV, and film, in the Royal Albert Hall and outside Buckingham Palace. But just after pm on Friday, she will open the living room window of her home in Ditchling, East Sussex, and sing it again with a new passion. And, as the strains of We’ll Meet Again ring out into the evening air, Dame Vera will be thinking of all those brave fighting men she met and performed for during our darkest hours. For, while the whole nation marks the th anniversary of Victory in Europe Day, the -year old Forces Sweetheart will feel it with particular poignancy. “I still think about those boys you know,” she reveals quietly. “And I’ve never stopped wondering how many of them actually made it home.” Her  record became a wartime anthem of love, hope and resilience. And when the Queen quoted it in her pandemic address to the nation, last month, it took on new signicance in this very dferent war. So Dame Vera – who was made a Companion of Honour to the Queen in  – joined forces with Welsh mezzo-soprano Katherine Jenkins and released a duet of the song to raise money for NHS workers and volunteers. And Friday’s VE Day commemorations will culminate with a nationwide rendition of We’ll Meet Again. “It will be lovely,” says Dame Vera. “I hope it will give us all strength and hope in these dficult times. But it’s also about remembering the sacrices of the war, and the sense of release on May , .” On that day Dame Vera was back home in Barking, East London, with her parents and grandmother. “We were in our garden listening to the wireless when it was announced,” she says. “We sat in the sun thinking ‘What wonderful news!’ We were thrilled. I don’t think we shed a tear though, you did that privately. People didn’t show their emotions.  “I think we had a cup of tea, perhaps later a sherry. We raised a toast with our neighbours across the garden fence.” A year before Dame Vera had been in the Far East, entertaining troops at a crucial point in the Burma Campaign. Hearing her sing The White Clfs of Dover, A Nightingale Sang in Berkeley Square and There’ll Always Be an England boosted the morale of the “forgotten” th Army, whose heroism in the jungles went largely overlooked during the war itself. So on Friday she will think particularly of the men who were still fighting in the Far East as the VE Day celebrations in Blighty got under way.  Looking at an album of treasured photos, she recalls: “I wasn’t allowed to take my own camera with me to Burma but after I got home all the boys started sending me their pictures. “That’s why my daughter and I wrote our book, Keep Smiling Through, about my time there. A lot found it hard to speak about the war and I used to get lots of letters from their families. Unless you experienced it you had no idea what it was like. “That’s why it’s so important that schools teach children what it was all about. So we never, ever forget.” Dame Vera grew up in East London with dressmaker mum Annie, plumber dad Bert and elder brother Roger.  She began singing in working men’s clubs at the age of seven and, in her teens, was working with big bands such as the Joe Loss Orchestra. At  she released her first record, Up the Wooden Hill to Bedfordshire, and when war broke out she was already a radio favourite. In , her Sunday night radio show Sincerely Yours became a morale booster for troops and their families. She had met husband Harry Lewis in the s while they were both in the Bert Ambrose Orchestra. They married in  and had a daughter, Virginia, in . Harry died in .  “I think of him every day,” says Vera, “He was the love of my le.” Early in the war, newspaper readers voted Vera their Forces Sweetheart. “It came as a surprise,” she says. “I’d always tried to imagine I was sitting at home by the fire, singing to people in the same room. But I became a messenger, linking separated people. It is very humbling. “I saw it as my duty to keep on singing. I thought that tag would disappear after the war and I’d just be another singer.”  Perhaps she would,she had not taken the brave step to go and sing for troops in Egypt, India and Burma in , aged . “I wanted to go where I was most needed,” she says. Getting to Burma involved a gruelling ,-mile trip via the USA, with her pianist, piano and a pistol. She then spent four months in a camp entertaining the troops as the bloody Battle of Kohima raged nearby. “It was nice to meet them in person,” she says. “I liked being one of them, living in a tent with one bucket for washing and one for the toilet. “I was never the glamorous type like Betty Grable. My make-up would run off in the heat so I only bothered with a lipstick.” "},{"url":null,"title":"woman who survived covid 19","story":"NewsWoman who survived Covid- shares how her family suffered dferent symptomsFour members of Carol-Ann Challoners family contracted coronavirus in March, and tragically mum Carol died in Aintree Hospital, where she was also being treatedShareCommentsByOlivia Tobin:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY NewsCarol-Ann Challoner has paid tribute to NHS staff on the frontline of the fight against Covid- \" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - The Coronavirus BriefingSubscribeWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Four of teacher Carol-Ann Challoneraposs family - all key workers - have contracted the killer bug, and tragically her mum died in hospital. The -year-old, who fell ill in March, praised NHS staff and told the Liverpool Echo some of the things I saw on the ward will stay with me forever. Carol-Ann said she, her father Joey an ambulance driver, her mother Carol, a social worker and her brother Joseph, who works with children who have learning dficulties, all had dferent symptoms of the contagious virus. She told how her family had symptoms ranging from a rash to cold shivers and flu-like symptoms. And that while in hospital youaposre hearing that people are dying and you forget how to breathe. Carol-Ann laid bare the traumatising reality of coronavirus and how our NHS staff are compassionately caring for people in extraordinary circumstances. Despite revealing doctors and nurses had to wear mountains of protective gear, Carol-Ann said: They seemed so deflated, but they still tried to put a smile on your face.  Carol-Ann was so moved by the compassion of Aintree Hospital staff she is fundraising for them as a thank you. Teacher Carol-Ann, from Croxteth Park, said she was first admitted to Aintree Hospital in March after struggling to breathe. While in there, Carol-Annaposs beloved mum, Carol Challoner, , was also admitted and fought coronavirus too. Sadly Carol passed away in hospital, and tributes have flooded in for the caring social worker since. Carol-Ann has spoken to the ECHO about her experience in hospital and why she wants to give back to the doting staff who cared for her. Carol-Ann, said: I developed a rash, and I just thought it was allergies. It seemed at the time when I was eating bread I was coming out in a rash, and Iaposd just changed washing powder, so I thought it was that.  I didnapost really take any notice of it. The day after my dad came home from work and I was having my tea that night with my mum and dad, I donapost live with them but I cook for them and they cook for me. He came home and he said aposI really donapost feel well, I canapost get warmapos. He didnapost join us for tea, but then he developed all signs of Covid-. The day after that I started developing symptoms as well. The morning after was the last day the Government were keeping schools open and I wanted to say goodbye to my Year s, and I was thinking of going in. Luckily I didnapost go in because I felt too unwell. We all had dferent symptoms, I had the rash, my dad got cold shivers and flu-like symptoms. So I self-isolated for a week, my dad self-isolated for a week.  In March, not as much information was known about the deadly disease as is now, and theories have since developed about its effect on families. Carol-Ann said: There are , things going round in your head because youaposre hearing that people are dying. It was weird, it sounds really stupid but itaposs like you forget how to breathe. Youaposre focusing on to how to actually breathe. I was taken up to the Amber ward, where anyone who hadnapost tested positive or were awaiting results were sent there. It was all a bit of a blur, and I slept through most of it, but I was put on an IV drip, I was put on oxygen quite high. I just remember it blasting up my nose and I think I just slept. Describing the heavy kit hospital workers were wearing to protect themselves, Carol-Ann said she was concerned about how comfortable they were.  She said: They were all wearing the plastic gowns, the gloves. They had material gowns on but all the nurses were tripping over them, they were too long. Some of them wore goggles, some of them wore visers. I know myself with the oxygen mask just above the ear, it just takes away the skin. Theyaposre putting these masks on all day, so God knows what it must be like. I felt so sorry for them because one, theyaposve got the scrubs on, then theyaposve got the gowns on, then theyaposve got the aprons on.  And then the goggles and the visers and everything. I donapost know where they could actually breathe or have breathing space. All the nurses said aposI cant wait to go home and take a shower, or go in the bath, or put my pyjamas onapos. Just watching them I felt so sorry for them. They just seemed so deflated but they still tried to put a smile on your face. Noticing the compassionate daily care doctors and nurses were giving to patients, Carol-Ann said she also overheard some heartbreaking conversations where staff had to discuss do-not-resuscitateoptions with patients.

But in  Amado Carrillo Fuentes died suddenly, killed by plastic surgery. The -year-old seemed fearless after seizing control of the Juarez drug cartel and became known as the aposLord of the Skiesapos after acquiring a huge fleet of jets to transport his narcotics. As well as being one of Mexicoaposs biggest drug dealers, Carrillo was also a prolic money launderer shting cash from Mexico to Columbia, which he used to finance his fleet of jets. The drugs trade was a family business for Carrillo, who learned how to become one of the most dangerous in Mexico at his uncleaposs knee. One of , Carrillo was clearly a favourite nephew of Ernesto Fonseca Carrillo, who was better known as Don Neto and the leader of the Guadalajara cartel. He taught his nephew everything he knew about the drug trade, and Carrillo eventually recruited his brothers and even son into the family business.

During his time as one of the most powerful drug lords in Mexico, Carrillo is said to have amassed a gigantic £billion fortune. But in the years leading up to his death, the net was starting to tighten around Carrillo as authorities upped their efforts to arrest him and dismantle his deadly empire.

It was a decision that cost him his le as he died while on the operating table in .Chillingly, the bodies of his surgeons were found some time later.

However, medics have now confirmed he is likely to be the ‘patient zero’ who became the first seriously ill person in Europe with Covid-. Mr Hammaraposs revelations come after a French hospital said it had retested old flu samples and discovered a positive test for coronavirus on December , just days before China reported the worldaposs first case. His we Fatiha Hammar, is a fishmonger who works next to a sushi counter in a hypermarket near Charles de Gaulle airport in Paris. While she showed no symptoms, researchers now believe that she could have unknowingly contracted the virus from customers from China and passed it on. Recalling when he went to an Accident  Emergency ward close to his home in Bobigny, in the Paris suburbs, on December , Mr Hammar said: At five in the morning, I decided to get in my car and I went straight to the hospital.  I told them they had to call the doctor straightaway, something was wrong, I had chest pains, and I was out of breath. He added to the BFM news channel: At the time, they said that what I had was very serious. They said I was spitting blood. It wasn’t a normal flu. Mr Hammar, who is a diabetic, left the hospital three days later after doctors incorrectly diagnosed a ‘lung infection,’ he said.  It was not until the April that Mr Hammar finally discovered that his illness was ‘a  per cent positive case of Covid-’. It was Professor Yves Cohen, head of the resuscitation service at the Jean-Verdier hospital in Bobigny, where Mr Hammar was treated, who worked this out after rechecking case files from December. Professor Cohen also believes that Mr Hammar’s we is likely to have picked up Covid- at the hypermarket where she works. She works in the fish department of a supermarket ‘next to the sushi stand with people of Asian origin,’ said Prof. Cohen.  The shop is close to Charles de Gaulle airport, so ‘visitors with suitcases’ including Chinese nationals often popped in to buy sushi. Until the emergence of Mr Hammar’s case, the first instances of coronavirus were thought to have arrived in France at the end of January, among ill people newly arrived from China.

We had very limited time to look at things. The document itself didn’t give much hope for reconstruction and didn’t do a lot of things. For me, I wasn’t just thinking of Dundee Football Club but other clubs who would be hurt in all of this. That was my main focus – I didn’t want anybody to get hurt.The change came after a lot of conversations with a lot of clubs and the appetite for reconstruction was greater than I first thought. There are other things, which I don’t want to get into, but we were trying to help these clubs who were going to be hurting. I was trying to soften the blow for everybody but also trying to use the time [between the deadline and submitting the ‘yes’ vote] to make Scottish football, through reconstruction, a better overall product that has more value going forward. That’s something we have been discussing for a long time, but we have the time now to really dig in and look at it. Getting to that stage, we had over % of the clubs vote a certain way so, in order to get going, so to speak, I changed my vote so we could get on to the next phase.As far as the Premiership goes, all we did was vote to put it into the hands of the board. They now have in their hands the chance to say what they want to do with it. They can try to play [the remaining matches] later. There are options they will have to weigh. We weren’t weighing those options.GC: What went through your mind when you saw the incomplete vote had been published JN: I wasn’t best pleased. I know there was a statement saying: “We had to put something out because we had a board meeting,” but the statement could have been as simple as: “We have an incomplete vote, there is a statutory  days and we have not received every vote.” By the way, it wasn’t just our vote, there were others that weren’t received either. They could have said it was an incomplete vote without any detail and that would have been more appropriate in my opinion.GC: At that point, you have said you weren’t aware it was your vote that was missing, what did you think then JN: I don’t know what happened, I have no idea. What they say is it got caught in the spam folder, which you have to believe. We did intend to vote a certain way and then changed it after I had more information. I talked with a lot of people. I pace when I talk on the phone. The Saturday, I walked . miles while on the phone, mostly inside my house. I averaged over the period before I voted over  miles a day, just on the phone.GC: What was the major part of changing your vote JN: The biggest thing was, the only way I could see, once we knew what was happening, that we could help anybody – it’s not just helping people but a longer-term, bigger picture – is reconstruction. Speaking with a lot of clubs, there was much more of an appetite for reconstruction than I understood going into this. That was the main thing.GC: Can you understand why other people saw Dundee as the bad guy JN: Obviously, people think we have handed United the league, Rangers think we have handed Celtic the league, although that is in the hands of the board, which they have a representative on. Over % voted for it and it was going to happen one way or the other – we represent % of that vote, total. The only way going forward would be league reconstruction. Yeah, I can see why I am the bad guy, but  or % of the league are also that same bad guy. The league did, in putting it out there, put us in a bad position.GC: The WhatsApp messages . Did that influence your thought process JN: It’s unbelievable. The way that was handled was not businesslike and was very poor. It has caused a lot of bad blood throughout the league, the way that was done, taking private messages and putting them out there. Of course, they have been taken out of context at some levels because you don’t know exactly what was going on and what the conversations were. There were a lot of conversations going on at that time, loads of them, so you don’t get the full context of it but you do get one view and that’s what they wanted.GC: You mentioned ‘handing’ Dundee United the Championship. Did that come into the thinking at any point JN: Obviously as Dundee Football Club, we don’t want to hand our rivals anything but, at the end of the day, it was inevitable that was going to happen. I had several conversations with Mal [Brannigan, Dundee United managing director] throughout this, several conversations with Rangers, with Celtic, with Hearts, I’ve had conversations with quite a few people. You could tell early on that there would be promotion relegation and there was no way around it because over % of the clubs wanted that to happen. Whether or not we wanted that to happen, it was going to happen. I’m not going to make a decision based on what happens to United – I have to make the decision on what’s best for Dundee Football Club and what’s best for Scottish football.GC: To make it clear, what was the benefit to Dundee in changing your vote JN: We were in the worst position possible – we were in third place. There’s not much benefit one way or the other that we could get out of this. When people ask me that – I ask what do you think we could we have gotten out of this  So, the best thing we could possibly get out of this is a proper conversation about reconstruction. That might not benefit us in the short-term, but in the long-term, it would benefit Dundee FC and all of Scottish football. That, for me, was the best thing we could get out of this. Does that do anything for us right now  No. But we need to look at it in a much bigger, broader picture as opposed to: “What does it do for me right now ”GC: After the whole process, are you happy with the end result JN: I’m not happy with the overall process, I’m not happy with where we are, I’m not happy football clubs are losing money, I’m certainly not happy people are dying of coronavirus in the wider world. We still don’t know what is actually going to happen. All of this might be for nought, we might be shut down for a long, long time and be having much dferent conversations in the future. You can never be happy in these situations, just be pragmatic and get through it as best as we can.GC: Are you confident reconstruction is going to happen and benefit the game in the long-term JN: We are having good conversations. We have to jump through a load of hoops and we have  clubs we have to satisfy, on some level. For me, the most important thing in this is that Scottish football – and, in turn, Dundee Football Club – comes out with a product that is better than we currently have. Sky Sports and our media partners need to be a part of this, too, and help us understand exactly what it is going to take in order for us to be a more attractive product, a more saleable product. We want to be on TV, we want more people to come to games, we need to make games have more meaning, we have to do things that might be outside of the box to bring viewers to the table – that’s the angle I come at it from. I can’t talk to you about the specics of what the group is talking about because we are trying to work through all of these things but the principle, from my point of view, is we have to absolutely make it a more attractive proposition for fans and for viewers. There are ways of doing it.What I want to get out of it all is a product that is better that, in turn, brings more money in that, in turn, makes the product even better and it turns full circle. For me, that’s the goal. It’s a long-term vision but we have the time right now to pay attention to that and work through these things. It might end up this scenario ends up being a change-stage process, whenever we get started again, for  , and then reconstruction might start in  .GC: Do you have a preference for which way the league might be set up JN: I really can’t talk about that because of the [reconstruction working] group I am in. A lot of the setups have merits, a lot have issues but as long as whatever format is setup makes it more valuable, more interesting, then I would be open to just about any type of system. At the end of the day, the top tier brings in the most money and that’s where the eyes are but we have to be conscious of down the leagues, they rely more on gate than TV money, and we have to make sure those games are maintained or even enhanced in some way. It is a balancing act, it’s not as simple as just I like this one or that one.GC: How confident are you we might get consensus at the end of this JN: I don’t know. We have only had two meetings so far. There has been a lot of work gone into those meetings. I thinkwe get to a proposition where all clubs benefit financially, the pie actually grows rather than just cutting it up in dferent ways, you’d have a better chance of getting a consensus. If the goal makes the product better and eventually the product is worth more, that makes more sense –you just change for the sake of it, it doesn’t make much sense to me.GC: Do you see it being better to make a permanent change or a temporary one like was suggested in Hearts’ first statement after the reconstruction talks were announced JN: I don’t know, that’s the problem. I don’t think it’s as simple as we can make one big change right away. I think it might be something that phases in over time. But like I said, we have to have all the stakeholders talking in order to see what that means. We have to make sure all the contracts are being satisfied and these conversations take time. It might be that we have a staged-process but at this point, we are so early in the process, I don’t know what that would % look like. We are still working through all the iterations.GC: Getting all the stakeholders talking – has that been made more dficult by the way things have happened over the past few weeks JN: I think within the group, it’s been fine. Everybody is professional. Honestly, there has been no animosity on the phone calls. Any time we run through anything like this, tensions run high and people say things and do things. For the most part, it’s just business and forgivable and off you go. There may have been one or two things that were done that will be more dficult for people to let go but, hopefully, we can all focus for the proper greater good of the game. If we have a proposition that is best for everybody, I would hope we look at the proposition and not really consider anything . months free access to our web and ePaper pack including Premium articles."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/08/dochart-terrace-stock-140x80.jpg class=attachment-small size-small wp-post-image ","title":"dundee united chief mal brannigan leaves tannadice","story":"Dundee United have announced the departure of managing director Mal Brannigan.The former Sheffield United and Dundalk chief was appointed by Tangerines owner Mark Ogren in January  to take charge of day-to-day business operations.Alongside sporting director, Tony Asghar, and first team coach, Robbie Neilson, Brannigan helped steer United back to the Premiership this season.Much of his work was done in the background, however, he hit the headlines in recent days after insisting the club would be targeting trophies and European football upon theirto the top flight.The Tangerines also raised eyebrows in recent weeks by disowning a fan group – the Dundee United Supporters’ Foundation – after a row about a potential cash injection.In revealing Brannigan’s departure, United said: “Dundee United today confirm that managing director Mal Brannigan will leave his role with immediate effect.”Chairman, Mark Ogren, extended his appreciation to Brannigan for his contribution to the growth and success achieved by the club.He said:# Since taking over the club, we have seen extremely positive changes of which Mal has been at the forefront.#We would like to thank Mal for his work during his time as managing director and we wish him the very best.#Brannigan said: #It has been a huge pleasure to have been a part of Dundee United#sto the Scottish Premiership. I wish the club nothing but success.#I would like to thank Mark, Scottand the board for their support and guidance during my time at Tannadice.“I would also like to extend my gratitude to the staff at the club who have worked extremely hard to achieve our goals and to the supporters who care so much for their club.

After an unclear club statement that later emerged to be Dundee’s notice of submitting a ‘yes’ vote, some Dark Blues fans reacted angrily to the decision.Askedhe understood the feelings of the supporters, Nelms told the Tele: “Absolutely. I don’t ever really say which way I vote, I give principles of what we’re doing and why we’re doing it.“The last daywe did a holding statement saying we’re not going to make a statement until we actually do something and then the next statement came out because we actually did something and voted.“But, people didn’t realise that we actually voted. So, we had to put out another statement.“You know how I am, I don’t talk about players# contracts, I don’t do things like that because I don’t think it’s appropriate at the time because you are negotiating. You can’t do that in the public eye because it’s not beneficial for the football clubyou do it that way.“We talked about it and I could see why the fans were concerned.“Honestly, I’m not surethe fans can see it or not but we are doing whatever we can do for the best of the football club, always. Not once in a while, not when it suits, always.“We will make decisions that might not be popular among the fans in the short-term but overall in the long-term it will benefit the football club. That’s the way we will run the business and I don’t think we’ve done anything but that. I’ll take the heat for it and that comes with the territory.”The club haven’t had any match income for over seven weeks due to the coronavirus shutdown.Nelms says Dundee are in a “stable position” but accepts there is no way of knowing what the future might hold.“At the moment, the way we have the business set up, with insurances and the way the“It is a new reality. Our business has changed from getting excited and ready for the next match to basically survival.“We are trying to prepare for when we come out of this but we don’t really know what is going to happen – we have nine dferent budget options for next year.“We don’t know when we are going to start playing again and that is the hard, frustrating part of it all.”Asked how much the club is losing per month, Nelms replied: “This is one of these things where I won’t talk about specic numbers.“Every club is going to be dferent – most clubs don’t have the insurance policies we have in place so they will be losing more than we will.“The government has really stepped in and helped out the mid-sized to lower-end clubs.“At the bigger clubs with the salaries the players are on, although the furlough helps, it doesn’t help a huge amount.“I would say Dundee Football Club and others around the size of our club are at a pucker point where it really helps us out and it helps out clubs below us but above it won’t help out as much.“We’re OK at the moment but we don’t know what is going to happen.”Despite not knowing when the next campaign will be, fans have already been putting money into the club by buying season tickets for  .An “amazing” gesture says Nelms.“You can’t thank people enough in a day and age like this where every day you are living basically day-to-day to see people step up and buy season tickets is amazing,” he added.“It’s incredible to see the number of people who have bought them with a big unknown going forward.“We will be playing football at some point in time, we just don’t know exactly when.“The fact they have faith in the club and desperately want to see their team is helpful – and also helps us build the team based on the support we have.“We know there are things that are way more important now than football butpeople want to dig in their pockets then great,not we’ll see you when we are all back together and have a good product on the park.” months free access to our web and ePaper pack including Premium articles."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/04/93ccef7b-dd6a-42de-931e-d9df25cb598f-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/04/93ccef7b-dd6a-42de-931e-d9df25cb598f-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/04/93ccef7b-dd6a-42de-931e-d9df25cb598f-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/04/93ccef7b-dd6a-42de-931e-d9df25cb598f-240x180.jpg 300w sizes=(max-width: 940px) 940w, 620w, 300w ","title":"george cran ends means dundee john nelms reconstruction","story":"Grabbing an interview with John Nelms isn’t an easy task at the best of times.During a coronavirus shutdown where he’s been buffeted from all sides of Scottish football it seemed almost impossible.The Dundee managing director prefers to do his business out of the media glare, often to the frustration of fans and journalists alike.Even before the lockdown began, I had been pestering Dundee’s media team for a chat with the American to talk about the status of the club.Then all the voting rigmarole kicked off and it was even more important to find out his side of the story.I can’t pretend I#m always in agreement with decisions made at the top of the club over the past few years but Nelms has always been polite and pleasant to chat with.I take him at his word that he wanted to improve our game as a whole – and within that, Dundee’s future prospects # though I know for certain there will be howls coming from certain parts of the country about conspiracy and all sorts.He stated clearly any Rangers accusations hold no water because decisions on the top flight have been left to the SPFL board while Dundee United’s title hopes were not his concern.Future co-operation with Inverness, meanwhile, doesn’t look very likely after private WhatsApp messages between the clubs found their way into the public sphere – “not business-like and very poor” is Nelms putting his real feelings mildly.However much I don’t agree with how we got to it through the voting U-turn, as a football fan I am pleased reconstruction is seriously being discussed.Technically there were no rules broken.

Included in this is the Isle of Jura.This is as shockingly reckless as it is offensive.The Isle of Jura is not a #bolthole# as the Daily Mail has chosen to state but a very beautul island steeped in culture and rich history.On both Jura and Islay we, like so many rural areas, are struggling to deal with all of the challenges related to the Corona virus out break. Our local health services have very limited resources as it is, along side a population that has many elderly residents who are more at risk to the virus.We have seen a local uptick in people traveling to Islay in camper vans and this is happening at a time when the UK government is advising against non essential travel.Those who are choosing to travel to our islands of Islay, Jura and the many other islands in Argyll and Bute in order to avoid the coronavirus may end up inadvertently spreading it to islands who arenot as much affected in the same way as so many built up urban areas are. Such actions are as reckless as they are selfish and I would implore people who do not need to travel to our rural constituency to avoid doing so until this global pandemic has passed.Jura, Islay and the rest of Argyll are some of the most beautul places you will ever visit and you won#t find an area where the people are more hospitable and friendly but while this crisis is ongoing I would ask everyone who is not currently living here to avoid traveling here for the time being.Councillor Alastair Redman # Kintyre and Islands ward.To the Scottish public,During this time of unprecedented uncertainty, we are all concerned about the safety and wellbeing of our families, friends and colleagues.Our hearts go out to those who have been affected personally by the outbreak of coronavirus , as well as the many communities around the world that are facing extreme measures in an attempt to slow its spread.We appreciate and are mindful of the challenges iniduals are currently facing as well as the impact this pandemic has had on our vital emergency services as well as the grocery retail sector, supply chain and producers.Like our retail partners, we want to take this opportunity to assure you that Scottish farmers, auctioneers, hauliers, processors and butchers are doing everything they can to maintain the ongoing availability of fresh, locally sourced Scotch Beef PGI, Scotch Lamb PGI and Specially Selected Pork.We would like to thank all those who work in the Scottish red meat industry and their families for their ongoing and unwavering efforts to keep our supermarket shelves and butcher shops stocked, fuelling Scotland with top-quality red meat during this challenging time.As bodies supporting the Scottish agricultural and red meat industry, we are constantly reviewing the developing situation and are doing all we can to support everyone involved in putting nutritious food on your plates.Alan Clarke, chief executive, Quality Meat ScotlandMartin Morgan, executive manager, Scottish Association of Meat Wholesalers Duncan Todd, secretary, Scottish Beef Association Jen Craig, president, National Sheep Association Scotland Penny Montgomerie, chief executive, Scottish Association of Young Farmers Clubs and Gordon King, executive manager, Scottish Craft Butchers.What on earth is going on  It was banal enough when Ben Goldsmith # English financier and environmentalist # tweeted that #overgrazing# by upland sheep farmers, was responsible for the devastating floods in South Wales, rather than record-breaking torrential rainfall.Unbelievably we now have a government official, Dr Tim Leunig, suggesting the whole of the UK does not need farming, and his comparison of the UK to Singapore in this context is absolutely ludicrous. You truly have to wonderthere is something in the water that he is drinking – could it be flood contamination Surely, every person having a full and ing set of neurons and synapses, the complete opposite is the truth, as we dearly need our hard working farming community.The UK Government should be fully supporting the farming industry and indeed, good land management. The Welsh Assembly has totally lost its way with its mindless policy of devastating Welsh forests with thousands and thousands # an understatement # of trees being felled for wind farms, and compounding the felony by covering acres of land with very limited electricity generating solar parks # Wales is not the Sahara and the sun disappears at night! Solar  will generate about  per cent of their maximum capacity in the UK.Returning to farming perhaps some kind person should tell Dr Tim Leunig that the answer lies in the soil and then lead him to a darkened and quiet room so he can lie down and contemplate the truth # wise men recognise that truth is the daughter of time, not of authority.Dave Haskell, Cardigan."},{"url":null,"title":"worldwide ceilidh community sign up for tunes in the hoose","story":"Fiona ScottUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsCapercaillie founder Martin MacLeod, originally from Oban, and his son, also Martin, have came up with an innovative way to connect musicians from all over the world and allow them to play together for the enjoyment of others.#Tunes in the Hoose# was inspired by Scottish musician, and family friend of the MacLeods, Peter Wood, who was posting videos of himself playing tunes in his home during self-isolation.Having saw the footage Martin senior, called his filmmaker son to askhe had the technology and know-how to put a video together of him playing along to Peter’s video.#I run my own production company based out of Glasgow, so it’s relatively straight forward work for me ,# said Martin Junior.#From that first successful attempt, our new idea was to create an online community for all Scottish musicians to help them connect and continue to play together during these uncertain times.#Housed in Facebook, Tunes in the Hoose amassed over  followers last week with ,+ views worldwide.

From his throne he dispensed news, advice and anecdotes – albeit not always historically accurate. His inimitable irony, perfectly-timed humour and the occasional reprimand to a wayward customer were all fuelled by a generous glass.As former president of the Scottish Licensed Trade Association and Keeper of the Quaich, Donald knew the intricacies of the business intimately from personal experience. His taste was eclectic and his appetite substantial, extending from Dom Perignon and Saint-Émilion Grand Cru to Tennent’s lager and Glen Dronach single malt. On a hot day he’d have an icy Martini or a gin and tonic, proportionately scaled up in a pint glass. Being askedhe had time for a quick ‘small one’, he would reply: #I’ll decide the size for myself,you don’t mind.#The records suggest that his frequent claim to be Scottish Slimmer of the Year, after getting his weight down from  stone to  stone, was fancul.Big D, as he was often called, was fastidious about standards in the little public bar, training his regulars to clear tables of empty glasses and plates promptly, and to keep the log fire stoked on winter evenings.If one of his regulars turned up untypically well-dressed, Donald would raise an eyebrow in mild surprise:  #What’s the occasion for the suit   A funeral   Your latest marriage   Or has your court case come up #In summer, an erratic stream of foreign tourists would have their first encounter with a Scottish pub, standing in the doorway bewildered as to what happens next – sit or stand  Fight their way to the mobbed bar or go to a table and wait for the non-existent waitress  Donald would call them over to his corner and was soon plying them with drinks, food and conversation, not infrequently paying the entire bill for his astonished guests.When a tourist asked him about the quaint red GPO telephone box in Church Square, he told them: #We have the fastest modern communications here – telephone, teletext and tell Donald.#Donald was a Francophile and loved his summers in Collioure, where #Le Grand Ecossais# was almost as well-known as in Argyll. A fixture of the local bars and restaurants, and frequently crossing the border to patronise Spanish hostelries, he revelled in the region’s seafood, wine and culture.His hobbies included cooking, opera, reading and lively conversation on a sweeping range of topics from local history to civil engineering. His knowledge was genuinely wide, but when occasionally encountering someone with a superior command of the topic in question, he would quickly change the subject and admonish: “Och, you’re showing off now.”Donald Clark was born on  July , in Rotten Row hospital, Glasgow. He was the youngest child of Donald Clark and Elizabeth Inglis, following by nine years his only sibling, Fiona.His early years were spent in Inveraray where family le revolved around his parents’ hotel in the little white-washed town.He was schooled at Inveraray Primary and Larchfield in Helensburgh, then Strathallan from  to  where he acquired his love of sports. Contrary to what his dimensions in later le would suggest, he was athletic when young, excelling at rugby and playing for his school and West of Scotland First XV and the old boys’ As.Donald also enjoyed curling, motor boating, snow skiing and water-skiing, where his party piece was to mono-ski down Loch Fyne while drinking a pint of beer.Although not a shinty player, he used his sports experience to coach the Inveraray team in the s and like his father chaired the club.

They feed on flying insects and spend most of their le in the air # including when they sleep # usually coming down to earth to breed. They are fast fliers, often chasing one another over buildings when they give a screeching call.Swts arrive back in Argyll in early May and breed in towns, villages and other buildings in Argyll. They spend around three months in Argyll, departing early-mid August to their wintering grounds in Africa.The British Trust for Ornithology’s Breeding Bird Survey indicates the population of Swts in Scotland has declined by around  per cent since . A similar decline has taken place in England and Wales. The reasons for the decline are not fully known but are believed to be related to changes in insect numbers and a lack of nesting sites as buildings are modernised.Argyll is at the north-western limit of the world range of Swts. Their distribution and numbers in Argyll is not well-known and the purpose of the Argyll Bird Club Survey is to try to find out the size of the breeding population and where they remain.If you have a Swt nesting in your building, or near you, or would like to take part in this survey further information is available at http:argyllbirdclub.org argyll-surveysFor more information about Argyll Bird Club, email Jim Dickson at Argyllbirder@outlook."},{"url":null,"title":"remembering key workers in inveraray","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsInveraray#s war memorial was lit up blue this week in tribute to the work being done by NHS staff and other key workers during the coronavirus crisis.The tribute was organised by Inveraray#s branch of the Royal British Legion Scotland.

Within a couple of days the response was staggering.There were volunteers from all corners of Mid Argyll willing to sew, donate material and give freely of their time. Local businesses were also quick to respond with offers of material, pattern printing and transport for moving stock around.I am overwhelmed by the support and generosity of people in Mid Argyll. They have risen to the challenge and far exceeded my expectations.We have around  stitchers from Cairndow to Ardfern, and villages and towns in between, producing brightly coloured ‘scrubs’ using mainly donated fabric, scrap material and jazzy duvet covers. The first donation of ‘scrubs’ is expected to be handed over to the hospital this week and we are sure they will brighten up the wards.Our crowdfunding page, ‘Let’s Get Scrubbing for Mid Argyll’, was originally set up to buy everything to make the scrubs. It has broken the original £ target and we would love to hit the £, mark so please feel free to donate.I am overwhelmed and humbled by this experience and publicly thank the group team leaders, the volunteer stitchers, those working behind the scenes and the wider community for their support and generosity.My thanks is also extended to the following businesses who have helped in so many ways: MacLeod Construction, Kit-You-Out, Mary’s Meals, Top Designer, West Coast Motors, LG Upholstery, Clock Tower, Tarbert COS Thrt Shop, Premier Laundry, Ian Y McIntyre, Willie Leitch Sailmaker, Owen Sails and the Lithgow Family at Ormsary Estate.Nikki Thompson, Ardrishaig.Sir,The time will come when we are through the turmoil of this pandemic but as we work our way through it, I wanted to share a situation that reflects the actions of many.I was recently collecting shopping in Tarbert for registered vulnerable people and, as I was taking off my gloves before getting into the car, I was aware of another#s presence close by pushing a mobile rubbish bin. It was Damon. He saw me about to put my gloves into the rubbish bag in my own car and said cheerily #You can pop them into this bin here,you like#.I was so taken by that gesture. What an example of initiative, thoughtfulness and kindness. It summed up the incredible work of so many volunteers, co-ordinated by Team Tarbert#s Fiona, with Margaret co-ordinating prescriptions, and many others.Perhaps there is no better time for us all to reaquaint ourselves with Rudyard Kipling#s poem #If#.It seems to perfectly summarise humanity working at its best, in which, during this crisis, thanks to so many, Tarbert can walk tall.

illegally withholding refunds which should be paid to customers within  days.Instead, most customers have been offered vouchers or credit notes, with many complaining that they have been unable to claim a refund online, or get through to customer services on the phone to ask for their money back.Should I ask my bank for a refund Customers who have been refused a refund by travel firms and paid for their trip using a credit card can claim the money back from their provider under Section  of the Consumer Rights Act.Credit card providers are jointly liable with the retailer or trader for any breach of contract for misrepresentation, providing the value is more than pound and less than pound,.However, Which  has warned that some credit card customers have been told by their provider that theyre not eligible for a refund through the scheme.Others have been informed that their claim wonrsquot be processed until they have tried to claim the cash from the travel firm first, even though this is not a legal requirement.Customers are also able to claim through a process known as chargeback, which allows a transaction to be reversedyou are unable to resolve a dispute, including services not delivered.This covers all card payments and is a process agreed between financial institutions and the relevant card scheme, such as Mastercard and Visa.What are Mastercard and Visarsquos chargeback rights Mastercard said there is a chargeback right where firms have cancelled goods or services, even where this is due to government restrictions, insolvency or other exceptional circumstances.It is also validthe cardholder doesnrsquot wish to accept the firmrsquos offer to rebook or claim a voucher, but the issue should first be attempted to be resolved with the firm.Visarsquos guidance also states that firms should process a refund promptlycustomers decline a credit note or voucher, and cardholders do have a right to complain when goods or services are not provided.However, Visa does make an exception where firms have failed to provide a service due to a government-imposed travel ban, stating that this ldquosupersedes Visa rules on dispute rights.For this reason, Mastercard customers are likely to be more successful when making chargeback claims for coronavirus-related cancellations.If flights are cancelled due to closed borders, customers will still have a dispute right under both Mastercard and Visa, as EU-wide rules around refunds override the government travel ban, according to Which .Which banks will refund under Section  and chargeback Banks have said that they will assess each case inidually when it comes to refunds from firms only offering credit notes or rebooking a cancelled trip.This is what the major banks told Which  about issuing refunds:Where a provider has not met their legal obligations to the customer, Barclays will consider both chargeback and Section  claims, provided the relevant criteria are met.HSBC, including First Directand MS Bank, will allow a chargeback or Section  claim to be made for goods or services not received, but customers are encouraged to contact their airline first.Lloyds Group, including Halaxand Bank of Scotlandsay thata refund is not offered by the travel firm and a customer has proof of this, the bank can pursue a disputed transaction claim under scheme rules.Bankrsquos position is that every chargeback and dispute is dferent, and each claim will need to be assessed on a case-by-case basis with the customer to work out the best solution.Nationwidealso says each case will be looked at on a case-by-case basis because it depends on the type of good services being purchased and what the terms of the agreement are with the merchant.Similarly, RBS, including Natwestand Ulster Bank, said cases would be considered on an inidual basis.If a claim made with the merchant in the first instance is not satisfactory, customers can contact Santanderto raise a claim.,params: .pushWhere the merchant has offered the chance to rebook for free and or provide vouchers and the customer is not satisfied with this then Starling Banksays it would initiate a chargeback.If a merchant is not offering a refund, or are asking customers to contact their card issuers to process a refund, Tesco Bankcustomers can raise a dispute.The Co-operative Banksays thatcustomers tried to resolve the issue with the merchant first but there was no refund or resolution, the bank would look at each case inidually to verya dispute chargeback right existed. If a chargeback right existed but the cardholder accepted a credit voucher, this would not affect the cardholderrsquos original dispute rights. The bank would also not reject a Section  claim outright in these circumstances.If customers are offered a voucher or a chance to rebook, TSBwould typically accept the claims and each case will be considered inidually.If the customer is unhappy with the solution offered by the merchant, Virgin Moneywould consider the terms and conditions. If the alternative arrangements are not covered, a chargeback would normally be successful. Section  claims will be considered on a case-by-case basis."},{"url":null,"title":"5g-mast-proposed-galashiels-council-land","story":"PLANS for a G mast in Galashiels have been lodged with Scottish Borders Council .The applicationwould see the .-metresteel pole placed on the verge of the townrsquos King Street, on land owned by the council.Residents are now able to submit their views on the proposal, put forward by Harlequin Group on behalf of EE Ltd.Galashielscouncillor Euan Jardine said: \"I believe it is important for our local economy that we are on level terms with other towns throughout the country in regards to G provision.\"It will also have some positive aspects for recreational usage and help to usher in advancements in technology that will change a lot of how we go about our daily lives.\"Mr Jardine added that he had not been approached by any residents about the application.Meanwhile, his ward colleagueHarry Scott told the Border he was not aware of the plans.Mr Scott said: \"I would need to study the application and the circumstances around it before coming to any conclusions.\"The application, ref   C, can be viewed on the council website."},{"url":null,"title":"borders-homes-can-book-virtual-visit-auctioneer-bonhams","story":"BORDERS residents have the chance to invite a world-famous auctioneer to look round their homes this week.Bonhams is delivering a free valuation service through video conferencing apps.And this week, households in the Borders are under the spotlight, with residents being asked to dig out paintings, jewellery, furniture and collectables.Bonhams Scotland managing director Charles Graham-Campbell said: \"Wersquore trying to adapt and do these valuations in a way thatrsquos safe for everybody.Appointments are available from Tuesday until Thursday , am to pm.Items that can be assessed include paintings, silver, jewellery, ceramics, glass, clocks, works of art, furniture, Asian items, and collectables such as whisky.Mr Graham-Campbell, , said: ldquoWersquove always provided valuations where people have sent in photographs but we havenrsquot actually done a Zoom, Teams or WhatsApp virtual meeting ndash a video going round a house looking at objects.ldquoSo this is something new, itrsquos the antique world adapting to the situation we currently find ourselves in.

They have now been working from home for more than a month and have continued to support vulnerable and disadvantaged young people with ious issues which has brought about some ldquounexpected outcomes.Lynne Anderson, transitions development worker, has noticed that she is able to use her time more wisely by phoning her clients instead of driving up to an hour each way to visit them at their homes.She said: ldquoWe can use this situation to learn how things work dferently. There are opportunities to continue doing some of the activities we are doing remotely when weto normal.She is one of several staff members who have had to change the way they give support over the past weeks but it still focuses on many of the same issues. They provide help with filling out job and college applications, and provide young people with emotional support and tutoring. The response has also generally been very positive, with staff members reporting engagement levels of up to  per cent from their clients.Natasha McInninie, transitions service co-ordinator, said: ldquoI am surprised by how resilient young people are. I thought we would lose a lot of young people through this situation. However, it has actually made them engage more.Emma Scarclfe, acting chief executive, is also very pleased by how both Bridges Project staff and the young people they work with have responded to the current crisis.She said: ldquoBridges Project has adapted quickly to the unexpected situation around Covid-. Engagement continues to be extremely high and the commitment and dedication from staff to change their working practices so quickly to suit each inidual young person has been a complete triumph. Wersquore all very proud of the way young people have adapted and how resilient they are.However, there are also issues which have become ldquomagnied during the lockdown, for example, people who have dficult relationships with their family members struggle with being ldquolocked up together over such a long period. Others are affected by less income and need help with accessing food parcels, Universal Credit and other types of financial support.Many young people also need help to deal with the impact the Covid- crisis is having on their mental health. This is particularly the case for those who were already struggling with social anxiety or social isolation prior to the lockdown.Lynne said: ldquoIn the beginning, the young people thought it was fantastic. Now the reality of the lockdown is settling in and it is starting to become challenging.This trend has also been observed by personal development worker, Chris Nicol, who said: ldquoThe young people were dealing with it well during the first few weeks but have seen a downturn in their mood over the last two weeks. This is due to a combination of boredom and too much time to think but also not seeing their friends. They have realised how important those social anchors really are.He highlighted the importance of keeping young peoplersquos motivation and confidence up during these challenging times.He explained: ldquoI remind them that they need to focus on the fact that this will last for a relatively short period of their lives and things will go back to normal.Thank you for reading this story.

The residential units are shown to be laid out in such a way that adheres to the normally accepted privacy and amenity criteria on overlooking and overshadowing, whilst affording the future occupants of the residential units an appropriate level of privacy and residential amenity.Access to the new development would come from Fall Avenue and James Kirk Way.A design and access statement included within the planning application notes meetings had taken place with ious local authority departments in a bid to address ious design requirements.It concludes: ldquoOverall, it is considered that the final design creates a well-considered, proportionate design that responds to the site constraints and the nearby area to create a positive design solution.ldquoThe result is a development that will make a positive contribution socially, economically and aesthetically to the area and enhance the amenity of existing and future residents within this area.A spokeswoman for East Lothian Council stressed they ldquowelcomed comments from community councils.She said: ldquoIn this case, we consulted the community council back in December, and they submitted a response detailing a number of concerns.ldquoThese included concerns over house type and layout, increased vehicle movement and parking space provision.ldquoWhilst we understand that consultees may be frustrated when planning authorities do not always agree with their comments, we must balance these comments against the other material considerations of each case.ldquoIn the case of the Hallhill application, our conclusion was that, subject to the imposition of conditions, the proposed development was acceptable.Thank you for reading this story.

Newspapers are essential for local democracy and the Courier regularly reports on issues we discuss at the council.One of the volunteers who deliver the newspaper is Susan Taylor ndash in her beloved Dolly CV which goes by the name of Myrtille.Susan, whose day job is working for the Church of Scotland as an executive assistant, is one of the team of resilience group volunteers picking up prescriptions for residents.ldquoI volunteered because I really feel for those people in our community who are at risk and isolated due to the Covid- outbreak, she said. ldquoI have met some lovely people so far and am glad I am in a position to help.The project is paid for through the townrsquos Community Emergency Resilience Fund ndash which comprises public donations, funding from North Berwick Community Council and the North Berwick Trust.Rotary Haddington was always looking for ways to support its community, said club president Malcolm Collins.ldquoOur idea to bulk-buy and distribute copies of the Courier to the elderly and vulnerable originated from one of our members who was quick to realise that a signicant number of such people would soon begin to feel isolated and lose touch with what was happening locallythey were unable to get out and buy a copy, he added.ldquoAs well as providing local news, the initiative shown by the Courier by including pages of extra puzzles in the paper was also thought to be useful to help keep folk entertained during these dficult times.ldquoWe have now taken this idea forward and arranged to bulk-buy copies of the Courier each week in advance, have them delivered to a central hub and then arranged for them to be distributed to other locations where they can be made available to those in need e.g. Our Community Kitchen, those in care homes and other locations as they become known to us.Rotary Haddington members would ensure that the papers were delivered where they were needed, he added.Courier Editor Robbie Scott said: ldquoWersquore so grateful to these groups for supporting our communities during lockdown and the amazing work they do inspires us to produce the best papers that we can.ldquoFor them to also directly support us at a dficult time for all businesses is incredible and we thank them immensely.Anyone wishing to buy copies of the Courier for delivery to communities should email rscott@eastlothiancourier.

A report is expected by mid-May.Pub chain Wetherspoonrsquos has said it plans to reopen its bars and hotels in June and said that due to it having larger than average pubs social distancing measures could be applied.RetailMinisters are thought to be considering allowing some non-essential businesses to open, such as garden centres and car showrooms, provided social-distancing could be maintained.Lobby group the British Retail Consortium has produced guidelines on how stores could prepare for the easing of restrictions.The guidance draws on lessons learned from supermarkets in recent weeks to ensure the re-opening of non-essential firms can be done safely.Advice coverslimiting entry and exit points, using floor markings to outline social distancing and keeping changing rooms closed.The guidance also suggests installing cleaning stations with hand sanitiser and disinfectant wipes at the front of stores.SportIt is understood Culture Secretary Olive Dowden has been working on a plan for major sports to be played behind closed doors when some social-distancing rules are eased.Weekly meetings are to be held between the Government, Public Health England and medical officials from sports bodies, with the issue due to be on the table when ministers review current measures next month.Key questions that need to be tackled include testing requirements, burdens on emergency services and the possible impact on fan behaviour ndash such as impromptu gatherings outside grounds.Sporting bodies are understood to be keen to resume full training safely as soon as possible.TravelLast week, low-cost European carrier Wizz Air announced plans to resume some flights from Luton Airport on May .Cabin crew will be required to wear masks and gloves on all flights and will distribute sanitising wipes for passengers, while new distancing measures will also be introduced during boarding.Mr Raab has indicated that officials are looking at possible checks at air and sea ports, with passengers arriving in the UK required to quarantine for  days.Meanwhile, the Rail, Maritime and Transportunion warned there was ldquozero chance of ramping up transport services soon, amid speculation of an increase on May  or May  when a new rail timetable is due.Last week, industry sources said no dates have yet been agreed or announced."},{"url":null,"title":"community-resilience-can-turn-help","story":"From collecting shopping and vital prescriptions to dog walking and simply being there for people, the volunteers are there for residents throughout the coronavirus crisis.Here, we look at five of the groups who are giving up their own time to help out.Cockenzie and Port SetonTHE resilience effort in Cockenzie and Port Seton has been helping launch a Fair Share hub at the Port Seton Centre this past week.The charity Fair Share delivers surplus food from supermarkets to the centre every Friday.The hub will cover the whole of East Lothian and support the centrersquos existing work to provide hot meals and food packs to families in need and children who would usually receive free school meals.Bryan Hickman, chairman of the local community council, which is leading the resilience effort, said: ldquoWe are still delivering food to those who need it but the Fair Share hub has been set up.ldquoWe receive food like coffee, cereal, milk and biscuits but this could change every week.ldquoItrsquos really good news that we have set this up as it will help us give other types of food.

There are strong, practical reasons why this should happen.ldquoIt is important, as Scotlands two governments make such onerous, dficult demands on people to stay at home and to stay away from family and friends, that we speak with the same voice.ldquoIf we can present a simple, clear, united message, it will be much more effective. The more we feel we are in this together, the more we will pull together to stay at home, protect the NHS and save lives.Mr Jack also insists a UK-wide approach will also be best for Scottish businesses and will help the economy recover as strongly as possible and will help save as many jobs as possible.ldquoWe are, after all, he stresses, ldquopart of the UK economy.The Secretary of State points out % of Scotlands trade is with the rest of the UK and as restrictions are eased, businesses will need a ldquolevel playing field to compete.ldquoSo, Im in no doubt that moving forwards as one United Kingdom will save lives and save livelihoods.Mr Jack says the two governments agree on this broad principle and acknowledges Ms Sturgeon has pointed to the advantages of taking a UK-wide approach to tackling the coronavirus.ldquoDevolution, rightly, gives the Scottish Government a key role in responding to the coronavirus outbreak. But the ability to do things dferently, which is central to devolution, does not, and never has, meant that things are best done dferently.ldquoThe coronavirus pandemic is a national emergency and has created an unprecedented challenge for the whole of the UK. We should meet the challenge together, he insists.The Secretary of State says most dferences between the two governments have been minor but he picks up on two that have caused him concern.On creating a discrete Scottish business support scheme, he says: ldquoEven now - after a U-turn forced by an outcry among businessmen and pressure led by Scottish Conservative leader Jackson Carlaw - levels of support for the retail, hospitality and leisure sector fall well short compared to England.On constructions sites, he notes: ldquoThe Scottish Government has also failed to justy its decision to shut down all building sites apart from hospitals. South of the border, the advice is to continue to go to work but only where it can be done safely and where you are unable to work from home.ldquoHere, the Scottish Government has decreed no building site can be operated safely. It has not explained why but we do know the decision is having a disastrous impact on the Scottish building industry.Mr Jack makes clear the country is ldquonot yet at the point where we are able to start unlocking our society because we have not yet met our five tests. For now, everyone needs to continue to stay at home, protect the NHS and save lives.ldquoBut I am equally clear, he adds, ldquowhen the data shows we can start easing the restrictions we are all currently living with, it will be important to do so as one United Kingdom."},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-scotland-scottish-government-advisor-backs-lockdown-exit-lifts-restrictions-majority-shields-vulnerable","story":"The approach, known as segmenting and shielding, has been recommended by a group of scientists from Edinburgh and London including one of the Scottish Governments Covid advisors.READMORE: People who test positive for Covid could be offered accommodation by Government away from their householdMark Woolhouse, professor of infectious disease epidemiology at the University of Edinburgh, said: ldquoSegmentation and shielding recognises that, although social distancing impacts on the whole of society, the public health burden of Covid- is concentrated in a subset of vulnerable people.\"By targeting protection to those that need it most, the strategy helps to ensure that the health system is not overwhelmed by severe cases, while giving policy makers greater leeway to partially relax social distancing measures for the majority of the population.It is believed to be the first time that segmenting and shielding has been put forward as a major public health strategy. It is better known as a way of cocooning infants through the immunisation of close family members against disease.The team from Edinburgh University, Imperial College London, and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine have modelled a range of scenarios to illustrate how dferent restrictions could be applied to dferent groups.They show \"the effects on the epidemic curve of a gradual ramping up of protection for the vulnerable population and a gradual ramping down of restrictions on the non-vulnerable population over a period of  weeks after lockdown\"Their findings have been made available to the UK and Scottish Governments.The strategy involves segmenting the population into dferent risk groups, based on a personrsquos medical history and potential healthcare needs.: Scotlands death rate from Covid likely to be lower than rest of UK due to lockdown timingAs a result, younger healthy adults and children, as well as over-s without any ailments associated with an increasedrisk from Covid,would resume something closer to normal le.Those most at risk - who currently fall within the shielded category - would continue to stay at home, with the added safeguard of targeted virus screening.They write: \"Intensive screening would, ideally, include daily checks for symptoms, daily tests for virus presence , regular serological [antibody] testing and monitoring of frequent contactsof shielders.\"If too large fraction of the population were to be classied as lsquoshieldersrsquo this would quickly overwhelm current testing capacity in the UK.\"Nonetheless, routine rapid testing of shielders could have a signicant impact and further increase the scope for relaxing restrictions on the entire population.\"Researchers say lockdown restrictions could be eased for most people, as long as sufficient public health measures stay in place to keep transmission rates low.These would include self-isolation of people with Covid-, quarantining affected households, contact tracing and voluntary social distancing.The most vulnerable ndash the frail elderly and those with underlying medical conditions such as cancer, heart or respiratory diseasesndash would still need to be shielded from contact with anyone potentially infected with the virus.To achieve this, people sharing a house with a vulnerable person, care workers and health professionals would need to protect themselves from infection.However, the risk to the rest of the population could be managed without resorting to lockdown.Asked about a potential \"two-tier approach\" to leaving lockdown, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said policymakers had to weigh up \"the fairness or potential unfairness\" of any approach.\"Is it fair  The judgement might be yes, it is, because we cant allow the quest for perfection to be the enemy of good progress. But we have to think about these things.\"None of us want to have a two-tier or a multi-tier society.\"The study stresses that the general non-shielding population will continue to be the \"main reservoir of infection\", therefore surveillance measures to contain the spread of the virus will be essential, say the researchers.They write: \"It is therefore vital that transmission rates are kept as low as possible, eventhis population is allowed to exit lockdown.\"Measures including self-isolation of cases, quarantining of affected households, contact tracing and voluntary physical distancing will be necessary to achieve this.\"In all our scenarios the vulnerable segment is subject to increased protection indefinitely. [Segmenting and shielding] is also more likely to succeedthere is less or no relaxation of restrictions on shielders.\"They say that contact tracing can include \"both traditional and app-based\" methods.However, the researchers caution that not enough is known about the build-up of immunity in affected populations and stress that this aspect of the epidemic needs to be monitored very closely.Dr Bram van Bunnik, Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the University of Edinburghrsquos Usher Institute, said: ldquoEasing the measures taken during the lockdown is important as they currently have a tremendous effect on our society, but this should only be done in a way that is both safe for the people that are most vulnerable as well as for the health and safety of NHS staff.\"Segmentation and shielding is a possible way of achieving this: measures could be eased for a large proportion of the population, however the vulnerable population likely still needs to be protected for a prolonged period."},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-scotland-schools-not-set-fully-re-open-foreseeable-future","story":"A new document has been published by the Scottish Government ndash setting out its framework for decision-making in lting the lockdown restrictions.The document stresses that ldquoit will not be possible to lt all the current restrictions at once, or soon and warns that ldquosome will remain part of daily le for theforeseeablefuture - until a reliable vaccine or treatment is available.Officials estimate that around , people in Scotland are currently infected with Covid- and the R-naught infection rate is ldquolikely to lie between .and..:Coronavirus in Scotland: Scottish Government advisor backs lockdown exit that lts restrictions for majority but shields most vulnerableThey add: ldquoThere is some evidence that the currentR number in Scotland is slightly above that where in the UK.The document sets out choices and options the Scottish Government is exploring in lting the restrictions, when it is safe to do so.All options ldquoremain under consideration at this stage and ldquono specic changes have been decided upon.The Scottish Government is ldquoconsideringand how we could make changes to allow people to leave their home more often and or for longer.It adds that this would mean people stay in their local area and within their own household group.Government officials are also looking at ldquochanges to allow people to meet with a small number of others outside their own household in a group or bubble that acts as a single, self-contained unit, without connections to other households or bubbles.It is possible that this option would be introduced first for outdoor meetings and the number allowed in groups is still being considered.:Coronavirus in Scotland: Covid victims could be quarantined away from householdAmid calls for health services to resume, including cancer screenings, the Scottish Government is ldquoconsidering whether and how we can resume these services, provided this can be done safely and without unacceptable risk.The document adds: ldquoThe options under consideration include resuming certain NHS Scotland elective procedures and screening services, and the phased re-introduction of a wider range of social care support such as therapeutic group activities.The Scottish Government is ldquoconsidering a phased approach to ing pupils to school, when it is safe to do soBut the document warns: ldquoWe do not consider it likely that schools will reopen fully in the foreseeable future.

Folk can do this by picking a m stretch of road or path, or by walking through a local greenspace and counting the number of instances of dog fouling in that area. You can then submit this information to Keep Scotland Beautul. The data is to be used to increase awareness and drive action to tackle what the charity has described as one of Scotland’s worst environmental complaints.Paul Wallace, campaigns manager with Keep Scotland Beautul said: “It is extremely disappointing that the thoughtless actions of irresponsible dog owners means that our shared enjoyment of our local open and green spaces, and a brief escape from the stresses and strains of the current situation, can be ruined.“That is why Keep Scotland Beautul is calling on iniduals and families to take part in #TurdTag, helping to gather evidence from communities across Scotland to get an accurate picture of the scale of this problem – it is simple and easy to take part as part of the daily exercise allowed in guidance from the Scottish Government.” Results should be submitted to cleanup@keepscotlandbeautul.org by May , and shared using social media and the hashtag #turdtag copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The academic suggested that the next stages of coronavirus containment could be developed earlier in the islands # but onlya comprehensive testing strategy was in place.Orkney and Shetland’s parliamentarians, Liam McArthur MSP, Alistair Carmichael MP and Beatrice Wishart MSP have called on the Scottish Government to provide assurances that they will engage meaningfully with Professor Pennington’s proposals and be open to considering how they might be implemented safely.Mr McArthur said: “Public safety must be paramount as decisions are taken about how and when the current restrictions might be lted.“In that context, however, Professor Pennington’s suggestions, which have already attracted a great deal of interest in Orkney and other island communities, deserve serious and urgent consideration.“If the Scottish Government genuinely want to treat the Scottish public ‘as grown ups’ then suggestions like these need to be dealt with in a transparent manner.“I have already written to both the Health Secretary and the First Minister to make this point, and to seek clarity on what consideration is being given to a more localised approach for the islands.  It is important that all options to tackling the coronavirus remain on the table during this unprecedented time.”Mr Carmichael added: “I hope that the Scottish Government will engage with these proposals seriously. That engagement must, however, also include close cooperation and discussion with local communities to ensure public confidence in safety.“This is not a plan that can be run centrally. Local input and know-how is key and islanders should be at the heart of how we translate these proposals into action.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Mr Russell’s comments come in the wake of the First Minister’s announcement of an expansion of testing.Following the exchange, Mr McArthur said: “There is an increasing level of public interest in the proposals put forward by Professor Pennington and Dr Allyson Pollock in recent weeks that the islands could start to ease lockdown restrictions sooner than mainland Scotland.“Such a strategy could only be adopted, however,a rigorous and extensive system of testing, tracing and isolating was firmly established. The First Minister’s announcement today of a further expansion of testing perhaps paves the way for such a system being put in place.“Public safety, of course, remains the priority and must underpin any decision taken in relation to how and when restrictions are eventually lted. That is true of our island communities as it is other parts of the country.“However, ministers must not discount possible options without proper consideration. I therefore welcome Mr Russell’s assurances that the government will engage actively and constructively in the debate about whether and how our islands might safely take the lead.“This is unlikely to lead to any quick decisions, not least as the stakes are so high. It is encouraging, however, that Ministers are prepared to keep an open mind over the coming week.#copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

This technology exists. If we simply used the electricity to generate hydrogen, and store it just like the old city gas, we can run all our power needs through hydrogen fuel cells. Simple, cheap and clean. Or we could let global heating destroy our children#s future because nobody wants to see a big windmill near their property. I#m old enough not to care.To give a hand to each.#To leave the oyster-bed.#The sun#s shining here and like the old oyster, I can#t be bothered, either, John. Have a nice evening, do.Love it, thanks JT 🙂No real need for fuel cells. Hydrogen was % of coal gas, can be stored in gasometers and burnt in gas fires and used to power piston engines, gas turbines and most conventional heating systems. A hell of a lot cleaner than burning wood chip. Now forget the windfarms, obsolete technology, use tidal generation and mini modular nuclear.That way we will have a living planet worth saving, not a mass of concrete, steel and fibreglass.I#m not sure windfarms are quite obsolete yet# with the technology that is available at scale onshore wind is the cheapest source of new electricity. Perhaps not on peat bogs though. That#s not to say we can#t do better with other renewables.PS circa Dads Army, I am not that old!!!At  dollars a barrel so called renewables will need to reduce costs by a huge margin to compete with oil. At the current oil price of less that  dollars a barrel wind, tidal and solar no hope.Renewable energy is not produced in barrels. Where did you hear that We continue to burn oil and gas because the infrastructure is there and the investment has been made. But when it comes to investing in new electricity generation, onshore wind is the cheapest. Also # I am not sure how such a low price is beneficial to the oil industry what with their high fixed costs As a patriotic Brit I am all for us standing on our own two feet and generating cheap and reliable energy. Shetland aside, as a nation we are net importers of oil and gas. Why rely on the likes of Russia or our Middle Eastern friends when we can spend that money at home and have jobs for Brits producing clean and plentul energy  Let#s stop living in the s. Let#s have clean, reliable British energy instead.I tend to lean in the direction indicated by John Thomas.For reasons of cheapness , safety and reliability I can’t see why wind and tidal forces should not be the primary options for energy generation. Winds are unlikely to stop blowing and sea tides are unlikely to dry up , so how can they not be major considerations Nuclear power is also in the running provided that the associated risks can be accepted. No matter what the no doubt wellintended may suggest, there ARE risks which do not raise their ugly heads with wind and water. Reliable , sustainable , and non polluting. What more could one ask for in this struggling , changed 🌎 world we occupy for a short time. Now Thorium nuclear is clean, no long half-le isotopes produced and no danger of meltdown.They are also neither cheap or reliable. Back up will also be requiredfor when the sun doesn#t shine or the wind isn#t suitable at more expense. More renewables will inevitably contribute to increased fuel poverty.Michael Moore # Planet of the Humans # a documentaryon the renewable energy scam that the left want banned # who would have thought !The more you look into the problem of energy supply against saving the environment, the more contradictory conclusion one gains. Wind and Solar maybe cleaner, but how much land and natural habitat being destroyedwould be required to power a city of several million##.and this is just  city     What energy source would be required alsothere are days of no sun or no wind. What backup technology would be in place, and would this also be clean energy  It seems ironically disturbing that cleaner energy through wind and solar, would also have a negative impact on the environmentyou take into consideration the polluting processes involved in the manufacturing of such devices.as well as the huge amount of land required , which would also be expanding as the population grows. I would assess cleaner energy via wind and solar would have a larger impact on the natural eco-systems and the environment and would still be reliant on fossil fuels. As far as I can see, disturbing as it may be, the only source for future energy demand is to go nuclear.And no , I am not a pessimistI’m a wary realist.Better than a blinkered optimist.Nuclear Energy does have its dangerous pitfalls, but we are already using this technology to generate electricity. I believe % of our electricity is produced by nuclear power  In France I believe this to be much higher  Although it may be dficult to assess the impact of solar or wind generators on the environment on a large scale, it would have to be balanced between the use of such technology to this of the environmental and eco-systems which maybe affected.I do not know how much land would be required to provide electricity to a city of several million, but I would hazard a guess it would be quite considerable  This use would also have to compete with farming and agriculture not to mention living space for housing etc etc.  from the shore would these wind turbines be  I suspect it would be quite close  Will our seashores be lined up with thousands of wind turbines I would also suspect the cost of such a scenario would be very high in adoption and maintenance.lol Hayden. Disturbing as it may be, I do not think we will have much option but to go nuclear. If it were a case of saving the environment and eco-systems, one may not have any choice We are already using this technology to produce electricity, andit is the case of minimizing our impact on the environment and eco-systems, then nuclear maybe the only way Cleaner energy may be, morally, more suited, but one must also take into consideration the impact on the environment and eco-systems and how this may change towards a negative once we realize the full influence of this compared to the potential benefits I cannot give any answers to what a large scale wind or solar scheme would be to power several millions homes, but I would suspect it would be considerably large in land area  One could use the same land for agriculture and farming and possibly housing  Shetland is suited for wind generating power schemes, but what would be the benefits to this of tourism, bird populations and property values, not to mention the visual impact of those people living near to such schemes and the consistent vibrating noise.Agriculture, farming and housing would not be adversely affected. Bird populations would be safe and tourists would be able to concentrate on spending their money which, after all, is the main reason for encouraging them to visit Shetland!! By the way,I have stood close to wind fed generators of the type we are discussing and never felt vibrations —- just the pleasant swishing sound of the rotating blades. Not too dferent from the soothing sounds of the sea.Haydn, You live in Crickhowell, Wales, nowhere near any large windfarms.The Black Mountains and the Brecon Beacons on your doorstep. Just how close is your home to the #the pleasant swishing sound of the rotating blades  .# I really doubtyou can even see a -meter turbine from your home. On Shetland people would be living under them, they would be about  meters high on high hills  meters or so plus above our heads!!! The plan is for over.Another smaller series of wind turbines is even closer to me and they are sited near Ebbw Vale on The Tops as we in the lower valley area call them.

Photo: Dave DonaldsonThe letter was backed by  MPs including former cabinet ministers and shadow ministers and highlighted the importance of local press in communicating trustworthy information and the financial strain faced by local journalists in light of the coronavirus.Mr Carmichael said: “Local press are some of the most trusted sources of news for our communities and we must support them in this challenging time.“They are vital to our efforts to respond and recover from the coronavirus and yet they are facing signicant financial dficulties.“This letter is about getting a fair share of government advertising spend for local and independent press, to reflect both their importance in our communities and their financial needs.“The secretary of state for health has an important role in deciding where these advertising funds go.“If the government takes seriously the need to get valuable and timely information about coronavirus to people in every part of the country then they should get behind this campaign, which is backed by MPs from all sides of parliament.”Among the  signatories were Tory MPs David Mundell, Greg Clark and Michael Fabricant, Labour members Hilary Benn, John McDonnell and Margaret Hodge, Lib Dem MPs Christine Jardine and Tim Farron and SNP members Tommy Sheppard and Philippa Whitford.Good. Yes. But let#s see Alastair also advocate thoroughly for zero hours workers, for parents living in temporary accommodation, for children who are feed from food banks, for people who are now, and who will shortly be living beyond their means,and for the increasing number of people who cannot meet their basic needs. A Universal Basic Income is fundamentally a liberal idea, in as much as people have entitlemment to be spared unreasonable harm. Sowe were to use existing systems to support iniduals, in a responsive and responsible way, possibly at a lower cost than the support now being offered for businesses, we would secure immediate economic stimulus, prevent unreasonable hardship, rebalance the playing field and limit damage to future generations. A heap of thinking has gone into the idea of what rights we each ought to enjoy, the things we should freely have, like affordable transport, and the things we should have the freedom to escape, like hunger. Now is a useful time to be considering such issues, the better for all.An interesting idea, Peter, and one which it may surprise you to learn was looked atseveral years ago by WIr Shetland as a possible policy option for Shetland autonomy.At the time, no country in the world had adopted it however FInland was planning to run a pilot project which it was decided to monitor. I am no longer involved and cannot comment on the current WS situation or policy.After a short, two year trial, the Finnish government decided to end the scheme last year and was reportedly considering alternatives such as a universal credit scheme, similar to that of the UK .Pleased that our MP was pressing the Chancellor on this within  minutes!Always good to see fellow Liberals backing liberal ideas.It is going to be really important to sustain a discussion on the basic rights and freedoms everyone should be able to access now. People should be free from depending on food banks. People should be able to travel freely to access skills training and broad educational opportunities.The UBI can help stop people falling through the cracks, but other ideas are neededall are to be able to live fulfilling lives of their choosing.This is because the cost of being to be able to exercise basic freedoms ies both across the country and from household to household as people#s inidual circumstances so dfer.The Universal Basic Income would help to kick start the economy and would do do fairly, , as Alistair, suggested, the tax system was used to claw the cash back from those who did not need it. Of course that would involve taxing the rich.Little wonder that the Chancellor dismissed the idea out of hand.Permanent State Fund Dividend of Alaska, the same idea. Not bad for a Trump-voting Republican state. Somewhat predates the liberal idea. Just another Red-Necked, Republican, USA idea.Ian,I value your opinions, some of which I agree with, some I don#t.What I don#t value is your judgemental uttering based on your opinions.Wikipedia # #Redneck is a derogatory term chiefly but not exclusively applied to white Americans perceived to be crass and unsophisticated, closely associated with rural whites of the Southern United States#Alaska is just a tad north on the Southern states and not all Republicans are white.NB , Redneck is a derogatory term chiefly but NOT EXCLUSIVELY applied to white Americans of the Southern States. Sarah Palin, ninth governor of Alaska. Now there is a Redneckever there was one! Alaska is strongly Republican.It seems Ian has no monopoly on what it means to be a redneck Alastair.In response to John Tulloch#s feelgood posturing on Wir Shetlandhaving #looked at# a Universal Basic Income, lets remember this: plenty comparably despicable groups have flirted with all sorts of policies the better to draw folk in.It makes the basic instinct informing Wir Shetlandand John Tulloch#s general political outlook no less reptilian.John derided Great Thunberg at the same time as a global alt-right campaign was launched against her.

Those people can then undergo further tests with the hope of slowing the spread of the disease.Soon after the outbreak, however, the national response moved from the #contain# phase to #delay# and all contact tracing was halted.This week has seen itas a key part of the national strategy.The government announced yesterdaythat a new contact tracing app was going to be piloted in the Isle of Wight as part of the first phase of the #test, track and trace# programme.When someone reports symptoms through the app, it will alert other users whom the person has been in recent contact with. Those users will then be sent advice, including how to get a test.The app is hoped to ramp up contact tracing and reduce the spread of the virus.Mr Dickson said it  was a really important part of the strategy # and he felt the Isle of Wight pilot could have useful implications for Shetland, which shares some similarities as an island community.Although the Isle of Wight is closer to the mainland and has a larger population, it has a single health board and Mr Dickson said it faced many of the same challenges as Shetland.In order to be effective, however, the app needs a signicant proportion of the population to sign-up, which could pose dficulties in isolated communities such as Shetland, where connectivity is poor in some areas.There have also been concerns raised about data privacy.But Mr Dickson said he was optimistic that folk in Shetland would support the programmeand when it was rolled out locally.#I#ve always found the people of Shetland to be hugely positive at responding to these sorts of challenges,# he said.#I#ve got no doubt that they will do the same here.#Until the app is rolled out more widely, however, Shetland#s contact tracing programme will be along the traditional approach.#Right now the digital  is not available for us,# said Mr Dickson. # So it#s back to the grind stone and the hard work of checking where people have been.#He said the programme was ready to get going.#We are ready to go, the teams are in place, we#ve got everything we need to kick off, but we don#t have a positive case to start with,# he added.Nationally, , staff have been recruited to help with the manual checking of people#s movements, as an alternative tracing programme for those who do not have access to a smartphone or good connectivity.Mr Dickson said that in Shetland, health workers who have been unable to perform their usual work, due to the Covid- crisis, such as dentists, would be ready to help with the programme.But although Mr Dickson said it was possible to carry out this method of contact tracing effectively in Shetland, he said it would be a #Herculean# task to do it on a national level requiring an estimated , staff.With the digital , he said much of that need for labour could be reduced.But while the contact tracing is a useful step forward, Mr Dickson said it must be considered as part of a wider picture.#I think it#s a really useful string to the bow of the wider orchestra that we nee to overcome this,# he said.He highlighted the NHS#s work helping care homes and delivering PPE as other ongoing parts of its work fighting the virus. raquo"},{"url":null,"title":"survey to study lockdown travel behavours ","story":"ZetTrans, Shetland’s regional transport partnership, wants to hear from residents about how lockdown has affected sustainable travel behaviour across the isles, and to understand what the long-term implications might be.Public engagement to support development of an active travel strategy for Shetland was cut short earlier this year, as a result of the coronavirus pandemic restrictions.Transport and policy projects officer Robina Barton said ZetTrans would like to thank all those who took part in the March events and online engagement.She said: “A new online questionnaire aims to capture any positive changes in travel behaviours as a result of lockdown.“Perhaps you have been exercising or making your essential journeys on foot or by bike.

But with no likelihood of visitors coming to our place anytime soon, there is something slightly morose and sad about making the buildings and cabins look neat, well maintained and tidy.It all seems a bit soulless and Marie Celeste-like with no guests.While being locked down at home, being busy, fixing and decorating, and even dare I say it, having a good time with family, there is an emerging sense of frustration, even perhaps inadequacy.Others are out there being essential, being key workers and worthwhile, ‘fighting’ the virus, supporting the vulnerable, while I….make a patio.I think for many people, there is a need to feel useful, and it is perhaps why for me the motorbike ride is so important.While there is nothing heroic about delivering a few medicines, it gets me out of the house # we might have a big cabin, but it still induces a fever.Being part of a support network and involved in helping the community works both ways and fulfils a very real need in those helping.Perhaps everybody wants to feel essential.We can laud the NHS staff, care workers, shop assistants and delivery drivers, but no one is going to clap for the furloughed hospitality workers and idle outdoor instructors.As a volunteer, however, we can all feel that we are doing our bit.There is a huge grey area surrounding the concept of key worker and essential.At first glance, it may seem obvious as to who is key # doctors, nurses, carers and the like but then there are the people who support them.Key workers need paid, so require office staff. They need fed, so also use food shops.They need to get to work, so are likely to drive a vehicle, so they need fuel. Andthe car breaks down, they will need a mechanic.They need water and electricity and the internet, and might also need a treat delivered from a mail order company during their well-deserved down time.Then there are the people who support the people who support the people who support…and so on.And so there emerges a whole network of service providers, businesses large and small # a web of commerce and production.In order to provide for the frontline, a whole system of interrelated businesses exists, many which might not appear to be essential, but may provide a key element, a small cog in the big picture.In the short term key workers can perhaps get by, but society shouldn’t allow its critical people to just muddle through, as the lockdown period extends, then the need for this support becomes more evident and relevant, and so the web of essentiality widens.As more roles, jobs and links in society are realised and considered necessary, and indispensability spreads, recreation and tourism won’t get much of a look in.We could argue that people need to visit the Old Man of Storr for our economic well-being as much as for their own health and well-being, but for the time being the beds and hot spots will remain empty.So, in order to be relevant and useful, we should perhaps look to our other skills.If tourism is our only income then we have to be creative, not only to make provision but to keep spirit and self-actualisation alive.Economically,tourism is a second income, the icing on the salaried or pensioned cake, then perhaps we just take the hit, and revert back to a less affluent lestyle.Many tourist providers left skills and talents in a previous le, perhaps now is the time to revisit and reimagine those skills.As I understand it, Skye is still waiting.Perhaps by the time this column is online, the virus will be more evident, during this waiting game now more than ever we need to be physically distant, and careful with how we operate.But it is crucial that we also need to look after our mental health and well-being, and so delivering the prescriptions is really as important to volunteer as it is for the receiver.Humans are a social animal, and we need to be part of a community, because we are all essential.The West Highland Free Press online shop is taking no new orders until st May .Sorry for any inconvenience this may cause."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/norrie-grandfather.jpg","title":"norrie t macdonald the cycle of the sea and island traditions of the","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineAlthough Shinigeadh was our training pool as youngstersand probably today seems quite safe and relatively innocuous it was also my first introduction to the concept of ‘industrial’ fishing.was strictly for deployment only by the stronger adults.It consisted of a stf polefrom which was slung a netted hoop, around - feet in diameter.It was to our mini-bamboo rods, what the Broch purse-seiner was to the Scalpay ring-netter.There had obviously been a couple of nights where our amateur, one-at-a-time, efforts to procure a decent supper had been insufficient to adequately harvest the bounty on offer.I remember the bodach and both the uncles appearing with the borrowed ‘poc’, intrigued as to what purpose it could possibly serve.’.A couple of pocketfuls of just-about-right, newly boiled, potatoes were the secret weapon.The cuddies scattered as the ‘poc’ got lowered into the sea.Crushing a potato into small pieces and scattering on the surface elicited a frenzy of activity.The timing of the hauling of the ‘poc’ was crucial.A miss, and you could maybe only land a couple.A full hit and you might struggle to lt it out of the water at all, requiring a re-submersion.This could result in losing the lot, the elusive cuddy being much quicker than the second haul.It took the knotting of the legs and sleeves of one of the standard, adult, blue boiler suits to make a receptacle big enough to take that night’s catch home.It was the first time I observed the tradition of the ‘share’.Walking back through the village, it was like we were expected.Several caileachs came to their gate with a basin, each the recipient of half a dozen dozen fish, dependent on their familysize.It was a tradition Iain ‘Scud’ MacLeod, George ‘Baba’ Richards and myself continued as we graduated onto the big bamboo in Bayble School.They were my fishing buddies as we moved onto the next level in our adventures.The full bamboo rod required technique and balance.Especially when we moved further afield onto the more dficult fishing hot-spots. every night.We were careful not to take the prime spots lest we got a mouthful, but we were tutored and encouraged, warned about any pitfalls and certainly well chaperoned for our own education and safety.We moved further up towards the Tiumpan where the rocks were more daunting, each climb steeper and requiring a working knowledge of the way down.With a -foot pole and in wellies.’ were the favourites, not too tricky a climb and with deep water just off the inside-point. were reserved for night when we felt particularly brave or even simply when they hadn’t been claimed by the adults.They were prime locations, great fishing spots, but generally could only accommodate a single rod.’ were up at the Tiumpan itself and required the right combination of tides and prevailing wind to be accessible, safe and productive. .The big rod came with several dferent options.The flywhich mimicked sand eels, consisted of usually three, four or six hooks, depending on what you were after .It could be deployed with, or without, a weight on the end.’was an issue.In the deeper water, a ‘dandy’ was best. This involved far less effort, a simple up and down motion of the tip of the rod producing plentul yields.’, basin outstretched, every night we caught more than was our fill.We also, as we got more adventurous, took to a bigger, single, hook and a longer, single trace .Barring this, a rubber eel.We were moving up from cuddy to lythe.What a fright the first one gave me!Two pulls of almighty force, then ‘I give up’.Deadweight.The sense of yet another ‘graduation’ was palpable, but the lythe was no grand fighting fish.It marked another progression up whatever the fishing ‘ladder’ was.By this time we were regulars in the town and had had our introduction to Meg’s ‘Electro Sports’ shop.He had, to our limited experience anyway, a huge assortment of rods and tackle for us to gawp at.Naturally, we moved up to spinning rods, monofilament, lures, kosters and paternosters., in competitions to see who could be the first to ,  or even .Traumatised for an hour or so, they would get ed to the water as the sun began to set.With spinning rods we learned a completely dferent set of rules.What was deep  yards out and what was disaster for your tackle.How to tie a proper knot and which kit worked best for the conditions.How to unravel a reel-tangle with three mackerel on the line .The cost of losing gear was beginning to hit the pocket-money hard.The only real solution was to get better at making your own.You learned how to make your own trace # downy seagull feathers were better, but not as practical as sheep’s wool # and how to tie knots that never ‘slipped’.Graduating onto more ‘specialist’ fish and fishing became a challenge after years of cuddies, mackerel and lythe.Fancier bait lugworm, real sand eel, salted herring even, were meant to be great to entice the bottom feeders flounder, sole, gurnard, possibly haddock and lingyou could reach with a long cast.Ok, so we mostly caught dogfish and, like every single other thing we pulled up, handling one came with its own set of rules.Mackerel have a nasty wee ‘sting’ in front of their anal fin, a small protrusion of cartilage bone which can catch the unwary out.Gurnard require welding gloves and a lesser-spotted dogfish will try to wrap its tail around your arm and give you a nasty ‘Chinese burn’.Rub your fingers against the ‘grain’ of one’s scales next time you see one.It’s like rough sandpaper.Everyone’s ambition, however, was to get out on one of the village boats.We had grown up with Roddy Alec and ‘Saight’, the last proper village fishermen who plied their trade on the ‘Fisher Lass’ out of Portnaguran.The ‘Fisher Lass’ was a substantial wooden boat, somewhere between the privately owned ‘rowing’ boats # each one now had a Seagull, Mariner or Evinrude rather than rely on such menial propulsion # and the commercial trawlers.Hers was a serious purpose we just wanted some fun.Whilst the rocks could disappoint, we were brought up with the notion that being a quarter mile offshore must come with an assurance of plenty.There were boats on the Portvoller side as well.The trick was, in the absence of having a boat in the family, knowing someone who did and whose father uncle was prepared to take responsibility for you for a couple of hours.Three a side, with mackerel or herring running, was huge entertainment.It was, necessitated by space and safety, ato hand lines again and a degree of ‘back to basics’ which felt very raw..A fish meal factory, dependent mostly on locally caught sand eels, but which handled mackerel and pout when available it could stink out the entire town given the right conditions.My father would come home, not entirely fragrant, and I would rush to get the folded-up daily paper from his lunch box.There were days, especially in the height of summer, when I couldn’t get beyond the back page .Little did I realise, until many years later, the destruction caused by overfishing of the type to assault the senses so violently..Barryhad procurement of his uncle’s boat and we made an anchor out of an old engine, attached a buoy and plastic ring, then ran yds of mm, in a loop, to the shore.The rest, you might say, is piracy.All good fun until the fishery cruiser, possibly the ‘Minna’, I couldn’t comment, came along one morning and confiscated the net, cod ‘n’ all.Now this could have been a delicious irony.I referred last week to the passing down of genes through the generations.The son and ‘heir to fresh air’ was never a guy to show his hand early, certainly not while in school.We had no clue what career path he would decide on, his head, whilst not always in proximity, wascertainly edging closer to the clouds.“I’m going to sea Da, to do marine engineering”, he one day boldly announced.Luckily, no one had a feather handy.And that’s what he did.He qualied as a ship’s engineer.It shouldn’t have been too hard to figure out where this notion came from, however., MacIver was the Chief Engineeron the old Fishery Protection Vessel, “Minna”.It is indeed a tangled web.Years later I ended up, standing on several fish boxes in the mart in Stornoway, as a fish-salesman.In my apprenticeship, under George Prince Jnr, we oversaw the landing of tens of thousands of tonnes of sand eels to HBP.The fishery was devastated, almost entirely, by local vessels and a couplefrom Barra.But while the smell was awful, the money was fantastic for all those involved.As the years progressed, the main catch moved from fish to prawns.I could tell the dference between a dab, a plaice, a brill, a turbot, a halibut, a megrim and a witch, but saw increasinglyless and less of them each year.My good pal Stuart Keyte – the local fishery officer # and I bought a small, Orkney origin, ‘clinker’-built -footer to work some creels and have a bit of ploy.You can get used to two lobsters for breakfast.But only for a wee while.Despite HBP closing down and the fishery banned, the knock-on effects of overfishing, several stocks over several decades, were beginning to take their toll.I could go to the rocks for nights on end and catch nothing.As it was, I ended up on the rocks anyway.A spell clam fishing with John Murdo ‘Easdaidh’ MacLeod was my swan song.I loved it.We left the harbour every day at am and headed for, guess where Correct, the Tiumpan.As day broke we would haul the six dredges and he would get the frying pan on whilst I sorted the catch.I could see the lights in my house going on from half a mile at sea .We had two rolls each and a cup of coffee.A huge scallop, bacon, black-pudding and fried egg on each .“If they fit through the handle of the basket, throw them over” was the rule of thumb.I’m guessing we could have been inside ‘the limit’.I’ve never fished a Loch nor a river.Not remotely interested.Given my track record, I’d have probably used a bit of dynamite, certainly a bit of mono.Just for dramatic effect.Mother Nature, left to her own devices, is a truly wonderful thing.Stocks will, eventually, recover and, managed properly could give sustainable employment for years to come.Maybe even endless fun for kids who have got too accustomed and fed up, paralysed even, from the catatonic effects of lockdown.Remember what Dougie said to Para Handy ‘The herring in Loch Fyne comes in cycles’‘Ach man’, replied Macfarlane, ‘There wass herring in the Loch long afore the cycle was inventit’.Everything goes around folks.Remember it when you contemplate your next move.The West Highland Free Press online shop is taking no new orders until st May .Sorry for any inconvenience this may cause."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/EARIE-QUIRAING-5.jpg","title":"litir do luchd ionnsachaidh an gobha ruadh agus domhnall an oir","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine..

We must test, trace and isolate to stop this virus spreading.”Last Friday the Scottish Government promised enhanced outbreak investigation measures at all care homes where there are cases of Covid- – including making testing available to all care home residents and staff, whether or not they have symptoms.A mobile testing unit, manned by the army, was set up in Broadford yesterday .Kate Forbes, the Scottish Finance Secretary and MSP for Ross, Skye and Badenoch, said she expected “full testing of care homes in Skye to be carried out”.She added: “I firmly believe that the local community should be treated with respect and informed about the scale of the Covid outbreak.“This affects friends, relatives and colleagues and so it is only right that people are given accurate and comprehensive information. I expect full testing of care homes in Skye to be carried out.“I am unaware of the situation alluded to by the worker who had to inform colleagues by email.#In light of the outbreak at Home Farm, I firmly believe that the local population deserve the full truth and public health agencies have been transparent about the situation.“This should continue as we all try and limit transmission of the virus any further.”Meanwhile, MP Ian Blackford urged people “not to drop our guard” against the virus.He said: “The spread of the virus in the Highlands has been relatively limited until now, although we certainly have got to make sure that we continue to protect people here.“A place like the Isle of Skye has a large percentage of elderly people.“In my own district the over- are  per cent of the population. We must make sure that we continue to respect the lockdown and continue to do the right things.”Mr Blackford repeated his previous call for holiday-home owners to stay away.He added: “I know this is a beautul area but my message to those will think about coming on holiday here and to second-home owners is please respect the challenges that we face.“You’ll always be welcome in the Highlands when it’s right to welcome people back, but not now.“Don’t think about coming over the course of the next few weeks and months while we battle this invisible killer.“We’re nowhere near through this.

Louise Murray , from Carrickfergus, was due to marry her American fiance Jason Charewicz , from Boston, in her Co Antrim hometown on Saturday, May .But not only has the wedding been cancelled due to coronavirus, it has now emerged that her husband-to-be may be forced to leave Northern Ireland when his visa expires.Ms Murray, whose new job has been put on hold because of Covid-, said the situation was beyond stressful for the couple, who are currently living with Louise#s parents.Jason#s visa won#t be renewed unless we get married, but we can#t get married because of coronavirus... a classic Catch  situation, she told the Belfast .We worked so hard and saved up all our money to be together and now this has happened and everything is up in the air.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseLouise Murray from Carrickfergus and her fiancé Jason Charewicz from Massachusetts FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappLouise Murray from Carrickfergus and her fiancé Jason Charewicz from MassachusettsBride-to-be Louise said that the ceremony on her big day was due to take place in the Catholic church at the bottom of my street in Carrickfergus.Our wedding has been planned for well over a year but it can#t go ahead, she said.The priest was happy to proceed with a service just for us and my parents because we live in the same household it would have been a legal marriage for us to tick that box but he was prevented from doing that by the blanket ban on all gatherings.She added: All that we#ve worked for might be down the drain. We might not even be able to stay together in the same country, let alone get married.The young couple, who have been together for over two years, met while teaching English in South Korea.Jason revealed that he is here in Northern Ireland on a fiance visa which requires him to get legally married before August .If the marriage does not take place, he cannot extend his stay or switch to a spousal visa and remain in the UK, meaning that their whole future will be thrown into question.Furthermore, Louise has had no income since February, as the new job she was supposed to start as a support worker in Northern Ireland cannot train her due to Covid-.Although she is still technically employed, her employer cannot pay her, as she cannot start work.Louise, an only child to support worker dad Hughand nurse Lorraine , who are both retired, said she is not entitled to Jobseeker#s Allowance or to Universal Credit.The pair said they have emailed the Home Office but, after almost three weeks, there has been no reply. They also said they cannot get through to officials by phone either.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseLouise Murray from Carrickfergus and her fiancé Jason Charewicz from Massachusetts FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappLouise Murray from Carrickfergus and her fiancé Jason Charewicz from MassachusettsJason told the Belfastthat the two of them were now in despair over their future.The longer our marriage is delayed the more likely it is that we won#t meet the financial requirement of the spousal visaone month of no income becomes three through no fault of our own, he said. If the pandemic hadn#t happened, we would be getting married in May, and Louise#s income over the previous year would exceed the financial requirement that the Home Office stipulates.Louise cannot, however, make income due to the pandemic, and now it looks like this will bring us below the threshold, despite the fact that Louise made well over the required threshold in the past two years.The Home Office requires the partner of the foreign visa applicant to prove their previous year#s income using the past  months.But whatthree of those  months# earning potential were lost by an unforeseen virus The decision to relocate from the Far East to Northern Ireland was the result of Louise#s preference to come home.I didn#t want to live in America, she explained.That meant Jason was prepared to leave his parents Michaeland Deborahand younger brother Brettbehind in the US to make a new le with his Northern Irish love.Jason said they believe that couples in their situation should be allowed to use the  months before the coronavirus pandemic in order to prove the sponsor#s income.He also pointed out that it has already cost them at least £, to get this far in the legalisation process.When my visa comes to expire, and we have had no chance to get legally married due to the pandemic, will the Home Office require that we spend thousands of pounds again on a new application, despite the fact that this one was made null and void by a pandemic  he said.Will they send me back to the States without my partner, where I haven#t lived for years Jason also hit out at the lack of advice from the UK Government on the issue. What does the government suggest we do  he said.They won#t release any advice about this specic situation.It#s inconvenient that British couples must delay their marriage, but for couples where one partner#s status rests on a legal marriage taking place, the lockdown is devastating.He added: We just want answers.Louise said: Not knowing is almost worse than having a bad answer because at least then you could make plans.The Belfastapproached the Home Office with details of this case.

I am concerned that the debate on the future of the lockdown is getting ahead of itself.It is getting ahead of the reality people are still facing.It would pile tragedy upon tragedyNorthern Ireland lost its way at this stage.Mr Swann urged the public to stick to the guidelines to keep saving lives and protect the NHS.We have a long way to go yet. This is no time for bailing out or doing your own thing, We must stick to social distancing. We can#t lose our way.We don#t want to look back in the future with regret, said Mr Swann. Earlier yesterday, figures released by the Department of Health confirmed that Northern Ireland#s coronavirus death toll has now reached .Six people died in the previous  hours, with a further  deaths occurring outside this period but only being reported yesterday.A further  people tested positive for the virus, bringing the total number of people infected here to ,.New figures have also suggested the UK coronavirus death toll of , is now the highest in Europe, overtaking , deaths in Italy.Meanwhile, the number of deaths in the Republic of Ireland has risen to , after a further  deaths were announced yesterday.The Republic has already published its own timetable for exiting the lockdown, while Stormont ministers are due to meet tomorrow to review regulations. But Mr Swann said putting dates on changes to the regulations leads people into the  sense of security.During the next period of time, we will not be ing to what we knew as being normal. There will be a new normal in Northern Ireland for a long period of time while we get Covid- under control, he added. Addressing the briefing, Chief Medical Officer Dr Michael McBride said there was a long way to go yet before the crisis passed and it was important people don#t regret their actions during the Covid- pandemic. Dr McBride said careful planning was needed before any decisions could be made, while social distancing would also have to continue alongside good respiratory and hand hygiene. He added that a number of things were certain, including that people who could work from home would have to continue to do so.Dr McBride acknowledged that the stay-at-home order was extremely dficult and causing social and economic issues but he said the reproductive number of the virus had to be kept below one or there would be an exponential rise in new cases. Dr McBride confirmed plans to ramp up contact tracing and that discussions were ongoing with colleagues in the Republic of Ireland and UK around digital s for doing so.He said % of cases would need to be identied within  hours for the plan to be effective. Dr McBride also urged people not to break the restrictions during the upcoming bank holiday.People are tired and we have a number of weeks to go yet before we are in a position where I believe the evidence suggests that it would be safe to step down any of these measures without seeing that R numberincrease and us getting back to that situation that we had an exponential growth.Dr McBride called for mature and respectful discussion with the public and said that now is not the time for confusion around the easing of measures when it was not yet safe to do so.We just need to ensure that we don#t give mixed messages. I would be reluctant to put in place an articial time frame for those decisions prematurely.Belfast ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

We#ve been told what we have to do.Stopping air travel is not going to stop the spread of the virus - the virus is already here, he said.The logical conclusion of doing so would be that we all lock ourselves up and never come out again.As well as an second flight between Belfast and Heathrow, Aer Lingus has advised all customers due to travel on the route to give themselves additional time to check in, as changes to the boarding procedure will be introduced and more luggage will be checked into the hold.It is expected that this additional frequency will result in reduced loads on each flight, the airline said.Belfast ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

By Ivan LittleMay   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailThe cast of the hit TV comedy Give My Head Peace yesterday raised a socially-distanced glass and gave a fond farewell round of applause to the actor BJ Hogg, who created one of the show#s most popular characters and who died last week.Observing coronavirus restrictions at his funeral, BJ#s friends and colleagues stayed well apart as they sipped their own small measures of Black Bush whiskey, the actor#s favourite tipple.The Hole in the Wall gang had been joined at a Lisburn funeral home by some other well-known actors and technicians who had worked with BJ throughout his illustrious career on stage and on screen.The star of The Fall TV series and the Oscar-nominated short movie Dance Lexie Dance died suddenly last week on his th birthday.His costume designer we Elish and their children Nathan and Abigail watched as his coffin was brought from the funeral parlour to a waiting hearse.Nathan had posted a video online of his father singing a powerful song from the Ulster Scots musical On Eagle#s Wing, and he added a message saying: Love you Dad. What a Voice.There were lighter moments on social media too. Some fans of BJ#s alter ego from Give My Head Peace , Big Mervyn, the dim-witted loyalist, wonderedhe would get a paramilitary-style funeral anda service would be conducted by the show#s fundamentalist Protestant cleric, Pastor Begbie.In the end there was no funeral service but Paddy Jenkins, the actor who plays Pastor Begbie, was among the mourners at the funeral home, along with other GMHP performers including Tim McGarry, Michael McDowell, Damon Quinn, Dan Gordon, Alexandra Ford and Marty Reid, who plays Big Mervyn#s sidekick, Uncle Andy.BBC floor manager Stephen Killen was also there, as were Game of Thrones star Ian McElhinney and his playwright we Marie Jones and actors Alan McKee and Marty Maguire.En route to Roselawn Crematorium, the hearse stopped briefly outside BJ#s old boyhood home in Westbourne Terrace, Lisburn.Some of the GMPH team went on to stand at the gates of Roselawn as BJ#s hearse arrived for cremation.No one is currently allowed inside the church there due to the Covid- crisis.Paddy Jenkins, who also worked with BJ on On Eagle#s Wing, reflected on a dficult day.He said: It was heartbreaking to realise that BJ#s loved ones didn#t get the chance to say a proper farewell. But the times we are living in mean nothing is the way it is supposed to be.There mightn#t have been a normal funeral for BJ today, but I know the family and all of us are determined that he will eventually get the sort of thanksgiving service that he so richly deserves once the current coronavirus emergency eases.

Adele Heaney has been working in the Covid- centre at the Mater Hospital in Belfast after being redeployed from the Royal Victoria Hospital to combat the outbreak. The Dungiven native recently featured in a BBC documentary called ‘First Time Doctors’ that revealed the realities of le as a recent graduate on a busy hospital ward. “The purpose of the show was to get an insight to what it’s like being a doctor for the first time and the trials and tribulations of le inside and outside of work,” she told the County Derry Post. googletag.cmd.push “So many people just see the doctor and that side of things, so the show was quite nice as it showed a bit of le outside work. “Everyone has had that experience of being the ‘newbie’ in the job and having to learn how to do things in a fast-moving environment. “It was daunting having cameras following you around but the thing that we wanted to show was what it is like for us as doctors.” Coming the end of her second year as a doctor, Adele has found herself thrust onto the frontline of the worst pandemic since the  Spanish Flu which killed an estimated  million people. googletag.cmd.push Adele has pleaded with the public not to become complacent and praised the vocal support that has come from the #ClapForCarers campaign on Thursday nights. “The first week they did that I was very emotional, to be honest,” said Adele. “When you’re in the hospital and you’re doing a dficult job, having tough conversations and seeing people pass away, it’s nice to see people appreciate the sacrices you are making. “The public have been trying to do their best to go by what the guidelines have been telling us – social distancing and staying indoors. We have to keep going with what we’ve been told. “Everybody in the community has their part to play. Your part might just be staying in the house but that is so, so important to flatten the curve and for us to beat this together. “We’ve seen the news reports from Wuhan and Italy, and we’ve seen how devastating the disease can be, so it’s important that we protect ourselves to protect other people.” While tackling the pandemic represents a ‘steep learning curve’ Adele points out that all healthcare staff are coming from a similar position. She said: “Lots of my senior colleagues who have been in the profession for over  years have never experienced anything like this. “I don’t think there is anything in training that really can prepare you. We’ve had to adapt quite quickly to a new style of working. “Coming into work and wearing a mask all the time has been dficult, but we have some amazing senior colleagues who we’ve been able to learn from. “It’s been dficult whenever we’ve had to make phone calls to families about their relatives who are really unwell, you’re not able to have those face-to-face reactions like you normally would. “Learning on the job has been hard, but it’s very humbling to be part of that and to be there for their family members when they aren’t able to be.” Born and bred at the foot of Benbradagh, Adele has already set her sights on a speedywhen the coronavirus threat finally eases. “To be honest, the thing I’m looking forward to the most is being able to come back home to Dungiven and be able to see my family and my boyfriend again,” she said. “It is very dficult when you’re doing this when you are so far from home. We have this persona of doctor but when we come home from work, we like the same things as everyone . “People have made sacrices of moving out of their family homes and not seeing their children or husbands or wives, so people are looking forward to being reunited with their families. “That contact with people is probably the thing I’m looking forward to most, as I’m sure most people are.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

At the weekend, the Irish government outlined its roadmap for reopening society and business. The British government is set to publish its plans this Sunday. Speaking at today’s COVID- press conference First Minister Arlene Foster said the NI Executive is working ‘actively’ on its plan and continues to make progress. She said people would be ‘anxious’ to know of NI’s plan but cautioned that social distancing measures are ‘likely to be with us for some time’. The First Minister explained: “In fashioning a plan ministers are being guided by the latest medical and scientic evidence. googletag.cmd.push “We are looking closely at the current rate of infection, the estimated level of transmission, and estimates of future trajectory in this pandemic once relaxation takes place. “Another signicant factor in our planning is assessing the impact on our health and social care system to deal with COVID- cases. “And also of course the resumption of other health services. The Executive is also assessing the wider health, societal and economic implications of the current restrictions to determine which areas will pose the least risk and greatest benefitwe were to relax them. “None of these decisions are easy, as we’ve said before all governments are grappling with the implications of a public health crisis that we never thought would come to pass. googletag.cmd.push “And COVID- has dramatically altered society and will have implications for the way we live for many years to come.” She added that there is a danger of the public becoming distracted and going back to what they did before. The First Minister said the country needs to be on guard and respect social distancing guidelines. She went on to say that people ‘cannot afford to be lax’ and act like coronavirus has been beaten as it still ‘poses a threat to you and those you love’. Restrictions won’t be kept in place any longer than is necessary, she concluded. Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill said any approach must be ‘cautious and gradual’ as COVID- is still spreading and taking lives. She asked the public not to take matters into their own hands. The plan will be published as soon as possible, ‘hopefully later this week’. Any plan is ‘not a green light’ for people to do as they choose as the Executive is looking at the safest possible approach, the Deputy First Minister added. She also took the opportunity to welcome Finance Minister Conor Murphys announcement of over pound million of new funding for infrastructure, regeneration, and tourism projects across the north. That includes match funding of poundm forDerry City and Strabanes City Deal Inclusive Future Fund.

Elected representatives from across the north west have called on the Executive to sign off on a medical school at Magee and match funding for Derry’s City Deal. The Executive will meet today and SDLP MLA Sinead McLaughlin today said that with three weeks to get it over the line it must be top of their agenda. “I urge all Executive Ministers to make a call this week. Let’s get it done, together,” she added. googletag.cmd.push An Ulster University spokesperson stated that it is steadfast in its commitment to establishing a Graduate Entry Medical School in a bid to address the challenges of a healthcare system at breaking point, and to future proof care provision across Northern Ireland. “The University’s completed Outline Business Case was submitted to the Department of Health on st October and we are hopeful that it will be reviewed by the Minister as soon as possible. “We continue to work with the General Medical Council to gain full accreditation. The GMC’s Stage  process can only be completed when it recommends progression to Stage , and that is only possible when a funding decision is confirmed. googletag.cmd.push “To complete the next stages with the GMC in preparation and readiness for a  intake of students, confirmation of a funding commitment is required by the end of May.” The department of health is readying its own business case for medical expansion in Northern Ireland but gave no assurances that a medical school will be based in Derry. Meanwhile, another government department, that for the economy, has told the Derry News that Ulster University’s business case for expansion to , full-time students requires ‘signicant work’. Long-running plans for a medical school at Ulster University’s Magee campus have been plagued by set-backs. A revised timeline targeted student enrolment in . The Derry News asked the department whether it expects the medical school to be approved and for medical students to enrol at Magee next year. In response, a Department of Health spokesperson said: “The establishment of a Graduate Entry Medical School is one of the priorities of the restored Executive in New Decade, New Approach. “The Department of Health has been clear that there are two separate business case processes in relation to the development of a Graduate Entry Medical School. “The first process, which has been under way since , has involved signicant assistance from departmental officials on the development of Ulster University’s own business case. “Ulster University has been grateful for this assistance, which has ensured that their business case meets the standards within government financial guidance.” He added: “The second process is the development of the Department of Health’s own business case which will outline the need to be addressed by any expansion of medical education. “That business case will be formally submitted to the Minister very shortly. It will be appreciated that the department’s immediate and overriding priority has been the local response to the Coronavirus pandemic. “The Department of Health must ensure that any proposal represents value for money for health and social care. It is for the Executive to collectively decide on the best approach for Northern Ireland as a whole.” COMMITMENTS There was renewed optimism in January of this year when a deal was agreed by Northern Ireland’s political parties to restore devolved government three years after it collapsed. The New Decade, New Approach document contains firm commitments to a Magee Medical School from both the British and Irish governments. It states: “The Executive will expand university provision at Magee in line with commitments made by the previous Executive, including through the establishment of a Graduate Entry Medical School.” Furthermore, under the section outlining the UK government’s financial and economic commitments to Northern Ireland it says: “Capital and resource funding for the Medical School in Derry subject to the Northern Ireland Executive’s approval of the project.” While the Irish government adds that it is ‘willing in principle to contribute to capital investment to support expanded provision at Ulster University Magee Campus, alongside the commitment made as part of this agreement by the UK Government.’ The commitment made by the previous Executive was for , full-time students at Magee. In   there were , full-time students enrolled at Magee – , overall. Five years previous,  , there were , full-time enrolments – , overall. In a statement to the Derry News, spokesperson for the Department for the Economysaid it is committed to engaging with Ulster University regarding expansion of its Magee campus, including taking account of priorities set out in New Decade, New Approach. “The university confirmed in correspondence to the Department in September  that it has remained committed to securing expansion of its Magee campus, and at the same time confirmed that the business case required updating prior to any consideration by the Department or Executive. “The Department also recognises, however, that the business case requires signicant work.” The Department of Finance voiced its support for the establishment of a medical school in Derry saying it is one of the priorities of the restored Executive in New Decade, New Approach. Sinn Feacutein Finance Minister, Conor Murphy hosted a meeting with representatives of the North West on April  to discuss the Magee Medical School, City Deals and the Inclusive Future Fund.

Taking to Twitter the Sinn Feacutein Vice-President said: Delighted that the Executive has agreed to match fund Derry  Strabane City Deal Inclusive Future Fund of pound million transformative for Derry and the NW  goes some way to redress decades of underinvestment after years of hard work by political, community  business leaders. In a statement to the Derry News over the weekend Derry City  Strabane District Council said that ‘all project proposals’ have been submitted to the government at this stage. googletag.cmd.push It is a year since it was announced that the Derry region will receive pound million from the UK Government. The package - pound million for the Derry and Strabane City Deal and poundm for the new Inclusive Future Fund - aims to boost the economic potential of the city and wider region. It has now been matched by the NI government bringing the overall total to poundm. Last week, deputy chair of the Northern Ireland Assembly’s economy committee Sinead Mclaughlin asked Minister Diane Dodds for an update on Derry’s City Deal. The Minister said the North West deal is ‘still being worked on’ and she ‘hopes Heads of Terms will be signed off in May or June’. She added that ‘signicant work has gone into it’. googletag.cmd.push Heads of Terms is a document which sets out the terms of a commercial transaction agreed in principle between parties in the course of negotiations. In November of last year the local council stated that this document would be signed-off within weeks. Once it is signed, work will progress on the preparation of a portfolio of outline business cases for the full range of projects, a process expected to take - months. Alongside this, confirmation is needed of required revenue funding to support capital investment, in particular in relation to the proposed Graduate Entry Medical School. A spokesperson for the local council said it is continuing to engage with partners and stakeholders to progress with a pathway and timeline for bringing forward the City Deal to the next stage. All project proposals have been submitted to government at this stage and Council continues to work with Government to advance with the signing of the Heads of Terms. She added: “Much has already been achieved in terms of the scaling and prioritisation of projects, the proposed governance structures and the processes and timelines involved since the initial City Deal funding announcement. “Discussions in relation to Northern Ireland Government ‘match funding’ to the UK Government poundm Future Fund element of the funding package are continuing.” In terms of the Graduate Medical School and the much-needed expansion of the Ulster University Magee Campus, the council spokesperson said that these are ‘key catalyst regeneration projects’. They have been described as critical to achieving growth and prosperity for Derry and the wider North West City region. “The Mayor last week led calls for the immediate sign off on the approval and long-term commitment of funding for the Graduate Entry Medical School at Ulster University’s Magee campus. “The project has cross party support and there is widespread acknowledgement that it is a hugely important project for the city and wider North West region. “Derry City and Strabane District Council has voted unanimously on a number of occasions in support of the project, acknowledging its signicance to the North West and to Northern Ireland as a whole. “The development of the Medical School and the expansion of Magee are intrinsically linked and will contribute to the overall growth of the City Region alongside the City Deal proposals.” Meanwhile, the Department of Finance voiced its support for the establishment of a medical school in Derry saying it is one of the priorities of the restored Executive in New Decade, New Approach.

Speaking in Westminster in November  Mark Durkan made the case for a City Deal for Derry. In my own constituency, people would love to see city deal status even within our devolved settlement for the city of Derry. We need to look at this in a more fluid way and to get away from the politics and find the democracy, he said. Today, SDLP Leader Colum Eastwood has welcomed the announcement of Executive match-funding for City Deals after the party first raised the proposals over five years ago. googletag.cmd.push Mr Eastwood said that Derry’s City Deal has the potential to transform the North West economy, driving new investment and attracting new jobs. Colum Eastwood MP said: “The SDLP has been fighting hard for fully charged City Deals with the power and potential to transform the North’s economy for over five years. Despite the initial disinterest from the Executive, we have always maintained that these deals would have a signicant impact on our ability to reimagine infrastructure, attract new jobs and stimulate economic growth. “In the talks that restored the Executive, I made it a personal priority to secure resource for university expansion in Derry. Investing in skills and providing our talented young people with the opportunity to live, work and set down roots here is essential to building sustainable communities that thrive. googletag.cmd.push “This has been a long time coming. We have been forced to wait for far too long for the chance to build more for our people and our communities. Now that we’ve secured the potential of the City Deal, we can’t take our foot off the pedal. We need to turn the page on the years of neglect and underinvestment by expanding our university, investing in our young people and delivering new opportunities.” Executive confirmation of a multi-million package for Derry has been warmly welcomed by Sinn Feacutein MLA Martina Anderson as ‘transformative for the entire north west region’. The Foyle MLA was commenting after the Stormont Executive today confirmed match-funding for Derry’s planned City Deal and Inclusive Growth Deal. “This is a hugely positive day for the north west and represents the culmination of a great deal of work over the last number of years,” Martina Anderson said. “Confirmation of the match funding means we now have a package of pound million between the City Deal and Inclusive Growth Deal. “This package will be transformative for the entire North West region and required the collective attention and action of the Executive, both governments and other partners. “Following years of unrelenting Tory austerity which has deprived Derry, Strabane and the wider region of much-needed public services and investment, we can see the clear benefits of having a local Executive in place. “Crucial to this has been the role of Sinn Feacutein Finance Minister Conor Murphy and his determination to ensure that this administration redresses regional inequalities by investing where it is required. “While we will always have much to do, particularly in the face of a global pandemic crisis, this funding and last week’s rescue package for City of Derry Airport will be central to our economic recovery when the crisis has ended. “It will also be fundamental to ensuring we realise the vast economic potential of the entire north west region in the longer term.” Meanwhile, Foyle DUP MLA Gary Middleton also welcomed the approval of match funding for the City Deal and Inclusive Future funding package by Executive Ministers this afternoon.Mr Middleton said,“I wholeheartedly welcome the announcement today of match funding for the Londonderry and Strabane City Deal and Inclusive Future Funds. This doubles the total funding pot to over poundmillion, adding to the funding already secured through the UK Government.This will allow for progress on some of the key projects such as the Maritime Museum at Ebrington, the Walled City Experience and the redevelopment of Queens Quay.The DUP ensured that City Deals were part of the Confidence and Supply agreement in  with the aim of ensuring that all of Northern Ireland benefited. The additional funding for all City Deals announced today is welcome news during this dficult time.I particularly want to put on record my thanks to my party colleagues within the executive and all parties who worked collectively with all of the key stakeholders over the past few years to get this over the line. This is a signicant step forward.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Chair of Derry Trades Union Council Niall McCarroll has taken the opportunity to express his views on the coronavirus pandemic, current political system, the legacy of deprivation in Derry and to launch a workers’ charter. If the last few weeks have shown anything, it is that workers need unions. The low pay and bad conditions of many who are now praised as heroes cannot be tolerated any longer. We will have to be organised to push forward for real change. On May Day - International Workers’ Day - we raised the Red Flag of workers’ unity and socialism and launched our Workers’ Charter. We take this initiative in solidarity with the ordinary people of Ireland in a quest for a world where every child has a decent chance and workers are equal citizens, not powerless to shape their own destinies. googletag.cmd.push The charter calls for the Living Wage for all and a sht in the balance of wealth and power away from corporations and the rich and towards the rest of us. TheCovid- crisisis a threat to humanity. It has also laid bare the huge inequalities which have been covered up by a political system which gives an illusion of fair play and equal rights but deprives huge numbers of working people of rights and basic needs. Now, faced with the possibility of their whole system grinding to a halt, the establishment has found vast sums of money for emergency funding and relief schemes. The money was there all along - even when they were crying poverty and saying they couldn’t afford a boost to benefits or tiny wage rises. googletag.cmd.push Nurses, health service and frontlineworkersare going beyond all reasonable expectation to keep our families safe and the number of deaths down. Yet these are people whohave been undervalued for decades by consecutive governments and employers. Our health service, our care homes, our domiciliary care workers have been treated as it they were expendable, when they are actually crucial. The most precious of our public services have been vandalised by cuts while our unions, the only practical means of defending ourselves and fighting back, have been systematically weakened and marginalised. The community response to the crisis has been brilliant.Care, solidarity and cooperation have been the hallmarks of public response. This contrasts with the actions ofgovernments and corporationswhich have put protecting the “economy” and profits ahead of protecting people and public health. We want all workersto receive a tax-free payment of pound,, plus four additional bank holidays per year. That would be an acknowledgement of all that workers have been put through. Fine words from Government are no longer enough. Globally, one percent of the population holds almost half the world’swealth. We need a new system. But this will onlycome about through working class people across national boundaries beginning to shout out as one. The COVID- pandemic has begun an awakening. People are analysing and questioning the lives they live and the world they live in. Traders, hedge fund and private equity managers carry on regardless, hiding behind their buddies in government while being portrayed in much of the media as the only people who can pull us through the present predicament, get the economy moving again and so forth. If they are not on board, we are told, no recovery will be possible. Our political system has done nothing to challenge this devious assumption. There are few politicalparties which genuinely represent the interests of working-class people. Politics has taken power away from the people moved towards the major corporations. This is a reality all over the world, our world. This takeover of control by a ruling class comes with a decline in real wages and a raft of laws to hamstring union organisation. We need a determined fight back. Under the old way of doing things, PPE was not seen as really important. But the same establishment had no problem when it came to stockpiling private wealth or extracting profit from wealth created by the labour of working people. The NHS, social housing, education, mental health services, community-based social care have been deprived of funds and support while obscene amounts of money are spent on missiles, bombs, drones and all the high-tech machinery of war, which benefits no one apart from arms manufacturers and war-mongers. The UK has the sixth biggest defence budget in the world. It is set to reach pound billion this year. A fraction of this, pound. billion, could more than cover the cost of a year’s furloughing of workers.  The total spend on UK military bases is pound million a year - enough to double the supply of medical ventilator machines. Military budgets and the arms trade are causing untold misery. A government of the people would invest this money in areas such as green energy, creating jobs which would encourage global solidarity and protection of the planet. In Derry and the North West, the crisis has unied people - but has also put a spotlight on the local legacy of deprivation, poverty wages and a run-down of public services. We also have the unreasonable situation of two erging public health responses toCovid- on a small island, increasing the threat to lives. Our lives cross the border every day. But we have erging health services, erging employment laws and erging welfare systems. We cannot allow working people and communities to bear the burden of Covid-on top of a public health and economic crisis. We need a new direction for society, towards equality and justice.

Sport Psychologist Dr Noel Brick is currently involved with Slaughtneil hurlers and has worked with Derry senior footballers. Michael McMullan asked him how athletes should approach lock-down. Its been  days since Leo Varadkar stood on the steps of Washingtons Blair House and insisted that all outdoor mass gatherings of more than  people be cancelled. Our world, has we knew it, has changed. Within hours of the announcement, sporting bodies put their wheels in motion to cancel games and clubs closed their gates to collective training. googletag.cmd.push While Brick, a Kerry man living in Ballycastle, accepts most athletes are driven by the desire to compete and beat others, they often have a dference psyche. He is a lecturer in Sport and Exercise Psychology at the Coleraine campus of Ulster University, has studied to PhD level at University of Limerick and holds a Masters from Staffordshire University. Brick has a background in long-distance running and has managed his own fitness testing business. He is well-placed to assess the needs of the sporting world, albeit in very surreal circumstances. “A lot of athletes are self-driven in the goals that they set for themselves,” he said. “A lot of those goals are not just about competition, they are about improving themselves by getting fitter, getting stronger or improving their skills.” googletag.cmd.push The important thing now, Brick feels, is to reset any goals. Special consideration should be made to aspects an athlete can measure. “Even though competition is very important, through the normal training cycle, there is that competition with themselves and it is about getting better. It is those type of goals that become really important now. These are things that are under your own control and you can reference yourself.” WHAT NEXT  So much of sport planning is about tapering down and peaking at the business end of competition. Coaches often have plans broken down into weeks and even days. Thats all up in the air, but any work done will be worth it, as Brick explains. “Itwill pass and we will come to a time when we do get back to competition. Normal might be dferent for a while, but eventually we will get back. It is recognising that too. Whatever training athletes are doing right now, it will become beneficial.” “Through a normal season you dont always have the time to improve on the things you might get better at. Now, you can reframe it as an opportunity to work on something to get better at and when we do get backyou are a better player.” Inidual work would be aerobic fitness, increasing strength and acceleration, as well as working on technical skills. Its about getting your weak side up to a level you can use under pressure and speeding up the execution of skills. It could be something as simple as rehabbing an injury. What that target is, is irrelevant, but Bricks message is consistent. “It is that competition with yourself and looking at your own improvement. It is something you can control and work on and measure. “There are so many things about this situation at the minute, and this is le in general, that we dont have control over. We dont know when it will end. “We have control over the small things, like washing our hands, but we have no control over when sport happens again and le gets back to normal. “It is about the things you can control right now...working on things like your touch, on your acceleration – you have complete control over these things.” “It is hugely important as we manage our emotions, as we go through this. If you are focussing on things you cant control...you are going to feel anxious, down and all those negative things.” CONNECTIONS Aside from the competitive streak, the sporting environment is one of inclusion. Dressing room banter and the slagging around training breeds a team spirit. After a stressful day at work, exercise and collective training is a welcome release. Without the regular bond, it presents a mental strain. “For our own mental health, it is so important to stay connected to people we normally connect with,” Brick stresses. It is important for team environments to still foster that togetherness, evenit is an articial way, via video conferencing. “You are apart from each other, you are doing a bit of training together but separately. That connection is massively important. “We all take part in sport because we love taking part, but we also enjoy the company of the people we take part with. Keeping that companionship and connectivity is so important. “We are physically distancing and socially isolating, but through that, it is important that we dont completely socially disconnect from other people. It only has benefits and one is for our own mental health.” To conclude, Brick highlighted an non-sport theme he has noticed with many of his students and clients. “People are taking the time to slow down to a certain extent, to reconnect with what is important in le and spend time with family. “That is a positive. We get wrapped up in our work bubble or our sport bubble, we forget about the important things.” RELATED - Derry GAA doctor on the importance of exercise. Click here...

Most of the club football I have watched over the past decade has been senior league matches my own club Ballinascreen have been involved in or the club championship, when I try to attend all the games as I love watching them. So apologies to some of the great players out there who have been outstanding at intermediate and junior level, I’ve kept it to the senior club  here. Michael Conlan Dedication and a serious quest for goalkeeping excellence were his traits, a key part of the three in a row Ballinderry side in -. The final of , in particular, Mickey C’s width and accuracy in his kick outs to his teams ‘four in midfield’ tactic was key to their victory that day. Fine shot stopper too, made his body big, gave the forward less to shoot at. Edges out Antoacutein McMullan and Thomas Mallon. googletag.cmd.push Ciaran Mullan Selected not so much for his defensive skills, as his attacking runs from the full back line for Eoghan Rua, playing a key part in their two county titles of  and . Loved to win ball out in front of his opponent and destroyed many a forward’s resolve by racing forward repeatedly, often up the right hand side of the pitch. Loved the wide open space at Owenbeg, in particular, where his pace was there for all to see. Brendan Rogers With serious pace and raw talent, Brendan transforms the way we think about modern full backs. His forays up the pitch often veered over to the sidelines and racing - yards up the pitch and nobody could catch him. Instrumental in Slaughtneils four in a row and his importance to the team was illustrated last year when he was hampered by injury. Incredible dual player. googletag.cmd.push Karl McKaigue Best man marker in the county, his one on one stats are astonishing against star opponents. Can play a bit too, but tends to keep it simple and save his energies for his defensive duties. Keeps it clean too, quiet, no-nonsense, great reader, interceptions, timing of the tackle superb these are his main traits. Ciaran McFaulBetter known for playing at midfield for Glen, or even in the forward line, but he is as complete a player as there is in Derry club football at present. Great ball carrier, his pinpoint passes often put it on a plate for his full forwards. Great long range scorer as well, but it’s his ‘lead by example’ attitude with Glen that impresses me. Chrissy McKaigue Undoubtedly the driving force behind Slaughtneil’s phenomenal run to four county and three Ulster titles. Fierce will to win, excellent athlete, a ball carrier, dictates the play, his tour de force against Diarmuid Connolly and St Vincents in the  All-Ireland semi final was as good an inidual display as I have seen, racing forward to score four outstanding long range points. Sean Leo McGoldrick Another great ball carrier, an orchestrator, extremely comfortable and elusive on the ball, plays almost like a quarter back at times for his club. Part of the famous McGoldrick clan that have played a huge part in putting Eoghan Rua on the footballing map with an incredible two county titles in  and . Enda Muldoon Big Enda had it all, great fielder, outstanding passer, long range points of either foot, excellent free taker. Played well over two decades with Ballinderry winning eight county titles and, of course two Ulster’s and an All-Ireland club. Always did the business when it counted most as well. One of the all time greats of Derry football, and modest with it. Privileged to have been a team mate for several years. Patsy Bradley The most spectacular sight in Derry football was Patsy taking off and ‘leppin’ above and across several opponents, attempting a miraculous catch. You never knew where, or even how, he was going to land, but more often than not, he either emerged with the ball or got a big fist to it. A fierce competitor, and tremendous athlete, he was the Slaughtneil folk hero that got the crowd roaring and inspired his team every match without fail. Danny Heavron Danny has been a shining example for his club right throughout this decade. Has played effectively in defence as a sweeper, at midfield, or anywhere in the forward line. A great athlete, a playmaker, a great score taker from play and frees, Danny came back from several career threatening injuries to lead Magherafelt to a memorable county title win in . Mark Lynch Extremely powerful runner with the ball, two great feet, fine fielder, accurate free taker often putting up a big scoring total. Could play equally effectively at midfield, number  or full forward. Another player who has combined an outstanding county career whilst giving his all for his club, Banagher. I chose Mark just ahead of Christopher Bradley who was majestic at number  in Slaughtneil’s run to their first Ulster Club title in . Conleith Gilligan Along with Enda, he was the outstanding club player in the county for at least  years from  until his seventh county medal in . Extremely hard to dispossess , evasive, some absolutely outstanding scores of either foot. Brushed off a lot of crap from opponents and just got on with the football. Infectious character who was an outstanding servant for Ballinderry. Paddy Bradley Paddy was still a seriously good forward for Glenullin in the first six or so years of the past decade. His first touch was outstanding. Raced out to the ball, sometimes double marked, controlled it first go either with a catch or palm down to himself, then literally fired it over, straight as an arrow, with unerring accuracy, often from - yards out. Derry’s best ever forward in my letime. If it was a team of the last four years alone, young Shane McGuigan of Slaughtneil would undoubtedly have been chosen, a class act. Colm McGoldrickDeceptively languid style, but Colm has been a consistently top club player for Eoghan Rua right throughout the past decade since their vivacious first county title in . Always finds space against even the tightest opponent, the target man, wins serious ball down the channel, good in the air and has scored umpteen goals for his team over the years. A real pity he was never tempted to give the county team a proper rattle as I believe he would have been a huge asset. Just ahead of Emmett McGuckin. Benny Heron Outstanding player for Ballinascreen over the past decade, a fantastic ’turn on a sixpence’ style has destroyed many an opponent. Great finisher, goals and points, he has rattled up some serious tallies. If I was managing Benny I’d have him up top close to goal every time, where he is a deadly assassin. However, a sublime playmaker further out the field as well, with great stamina.Eoghan Brown, another great club forward, was also considered here. RELATED - Michael McMullans selection.

Her death on Saturday morning at Altnagelvin Hospital has left a profound sense of sadness among her friends and neighbours in the street, which she called her home for so many years. As her remains were brought to Long Tower church on Sunday evening, neighbours stopped to remember a special lady, known for her warm generosity and heart of gold. It was a journey that Bridget Carroll had made thousands of times before, to a church that became her second home. googletag.cmd.push Affectionately known as ‘Wee Bridget’ to all her family and friends, Bridget was a daily Communicant until chronic illness took hold several years ago. At every Benediction service, Holy Hour, Parish Retreat, and Stations of the Cross, Bridget could be found in her familiar seat at the back of the church. Indeed she was a particular devotee of the yearly parish retreat and loved getting the traditional new outfit for the last day. Born in Kilkenny on July , , Bridget came to live at Nazareth House in Fahan as an infant, and received her education at Nazareth House in Bishop Street. googletag.cmd.push Her first job was working in the Nazareth House care home where she loved caring for the elderly residents and listening to their stories. Bridget moved to Dublin to work in the Mater Hospital with her best friend Kathleen, and stayed in the Fair City for  years. However Bridget missed the sense of home she felt in her adopted Derry, and ed to the city where she settled into le working at a number of cafes in the town, becoming a familiar face to many. For many years she lived in the iconic Rossville Flats in the Bogside, and she was delighted when she was relocated to her new home in Bishop Street when the flats were marked for demolition. Bridget’s many friendships formed the centre of her le, always staying in touch with her childhood friend Kathleen Smith who is now living in Dublin, Rita McDaid, Monica Gransha, and Kathleen Doherty from Sunbeam Terrace. You knew she had come for a visit when you heard the doorbell ring, the door open, and her familiar voice shout out – ‘It’s only me!’ The  year old loved to have a chat and always kept up with the local news buying every local newspaper each week. Bridget was a member of many groups often giving her time as a volunteer in Termonbacca, with Cursillo, St Joseph’s Young Priests Society, as a regular chapel cleaner and a parish reader. Bridget also loved travelling and was the first to sign up for any bus runs in the parish. Her favourite run without question was to the pilgrimage site of Knock, but her trips also took her as far as Lourdes on six occasions, Fatima, Buncrana, and Lough Derg. She spoke often of her devotion to the Blessed Mother and Padre Pio, it was this faith that helped her in recent years as she battled her deteriorating health. Several years ago she moved from her flat at the bottom of Bishop Street, to Alexander House at the top of Bishop Street. Here, Bridget found a new sense to the meaning of home. She formed new friendships with the staff and fellow residents, and received dedicated and loving care around the clock. Bridget Carroll will be remembered for her straight talking, unforgettable laugh, loyal friendship and beautul spirit. She often said that even though she was not born here, she felt that she was a Derry woman at heart. Many will miss chatting to her and giving her a wave as she made her way to and from the city centre for her shopping. Bishop Street will never be the same again without her.

This follows commitments made by ministers over the weekend that the government will meet with the two representativebodies for publicans over course of the coming week.As part of their discussions with the government, the two organisations will be pressing for pubs to reopen at the same time and on the same basis as cafes and restaurants. Recognising the challenge of maintaining social distancing in a hospitality environment, the organisations will also be putting forward radical changes to the normal operations of barsin order to protect public health.These measures include: googletag.cmd.push • Bars will become dispense bars only with no sitting, standing, ordering, payment or drinking at the bar allowed. • Table service will be a requirement with pubs only serving customers seated at tables. • The numbers on the premises would be confined to no more than  per every  square metres. • A maximum of  people would be permitted at any one table. • Customers will be required to use hand sanitiser upon entry. • All customers must remain seated. • Staff will be fully trained in the new procedures. They will also be asked to maintain a safe distance from customers when taking orders and to wash their hands thoroughlyevery  minutes. googletag.cmd.push • The utilisation of outdoor spaces to enhance social distancing. • Procedures implemented to ensure safe use of toilet facilities, which may include limits on the numbers using toilets at any one time. • No live music or DJs. Speaking about the proposed measures, Donall O’Keeffe, Chief Executive of the LVA said, “We fully respect the need to continue to protect the public health. We have repeatedlyproven this commitment, not least in the fact that our sector was the first to close across the country. We also believe thatother venues who serve food and alcohol are allowed toreopen in Phase , then pubs should be granted the same opportunity to trade. We don’t believe it is in any way appropriate that the Government should apply one rule for somehospitality businesses and another rule for others.“We are making a series of radical proposals to how bars should operate for the reopening scenario. Trading will be extremely dficult under these circumstances. There is no doubtthat the pub experience as we know it will have to change dramatically. Many pubs may choose not to reopen as it simply won’t be financially viable under these conditions.However, for those who want to trade, these measures will have the essential impact of protecting the health and wellbeing of staff and customers alike,” Mr. O’Keeffe said.

Mr Dallat, one of Northern Irelands best known politicians, died earlier today after a period of illness. SDLP Leader Colum Eastwood has led tributes to Mr Dallat, who he said was a fierce and forensic champion of people and the public interest as well as a good and loyal man. Mr Eastwood said that John will be remembered for his defence of the public purse and his famous good humour. “John Dallat lived and breathed to serve others, said Mr Eastwood. “For over  years he was the most loyal servant to the people of East Derry and a fierce friend to everyone in the SDLP. googletag.cmd.push I know I speak for everyone in the party when I say his good humour and wise advice will be sorely missed. “John entered public le at a time and in a place when it was dficult to be an SDLP representative. I know that, despite his tough exterior, he was often hurt when the hand of friendship he extended across the sectarian ide in the late s and early s in Coleraine Council wasnt always accepted. But it never stopped him trying and only strengthened his lelong resolve to oppose violence and its supporters. “As a public representative, John struck fear into the heart of anyone who dared misspend a penny of public money. His forensic skill as a member of the Public Accounts Committee may not have won him many friends in the higher levels of the public sector but it won him respect across political lines. It was a respect he maintained with a fair hand as Deputy Speaker of the Assembly. googletag.cmd.push “Even retirement couldn’t stop him and I’m glad that he came back to the SDLP Assembly team in . We will miss his infectious laugh and his deep experience. “My thoughts, and the thoughts of everyone in the SDLP, are with his we Anne, his children Helena, Ronan, Diarmuid and his eight grandchildren. John’s family meant everything to him. We’re thinking of them at this dficult time and I hope they are comforted by the knowledge that he made an immeasurable dference.

Mary Rogers was born in  at the tail end of the Spanish Flu’s effects and reaches her latest milestone as the word is reeling from another pandemic. Unable to enter the home due to Covid- restrictions, Mary’s family joined in the celebrations through the window of the care home where she has spent the last two years. Staff were able to ensure social distancing regulations were adhered to as popular singer Wayne Rodgers serenaded Mary, her family and the other guests.  The former Burns factory worker has been looking forward to her birthday for months and was delighted to receive telegrams from the Queen, President Higgins and her grand-nephew in Australia. googletag.cmd.push Mary began working in Burns shirt factory in Draperstown in the early s and travelled the three miles back and forth by bicycle, beginning a lelong interest in sewing and needlework. The camaraderie in the factory resulted in many friendships and she recalls them fondly while telling stories of her childhood and working le. Mary nursed her father and step-mother during their final illnesses and with less support available back then, had to give up working in the factory to become a full-time carer. Once joking she was the only person to have been carried out of a graveyard after breaking her ankle visiting a grave, she has attributed her long le to having never married. googletag.cmd.push  She has a great rapport with her grand nieces and nephews and is constantly involved in their lives and hobbies, sometimes learning the rules of unfamiliar games in order to stay engaged.

He sat down with Michael McMullan to talk about how he almost missed out on Derry’s greatest hour. When Brian McGilligan shakes your hand, it stays shook. Locked, like a wench. It reminds you of the toughness of a man who turned the midfield battlegrounds of Ireland upside down. A man who Ireland manager Kevin Heffernan took one glance at and knew he would not need baby-sitting when faced with any form thuggery the Australians could heave at him. The man that, alongside Anthony Tohill, formed the perfect midfield partnership. A duo that dozed all before it. googletag.cmd.push He is one of six players to start and finish all five games on the way to the historic summit of . It is put to him that he played a central part in something that has never been equalled. “Do you think so sur ” came the instant reply. With  minutes of the All-Ireland Final gone Niall Cahalane’s mis-directed fist pass is too high and squirms through the fingers of Teddy McCarthy. McGilligan laps up the gt before slotting over his third score of the campaign. Four minutes previous, with Cork - to - ahead, he was involved in the move that led to Johnny McGurk’s point - Derry’s first of a jittery start. googletag.cmd.push The midfield warrior’s input didn’t end there. Wing-forward Barry Coffey had a height advantage over Johnny McGurk. The pre-game chat suggested that goalkeeper John Kerins was expected to exploit it. Kerins’ th minute kick-out was angled towards Coffey, who was hugging the Cusack Stand sideline. McGilligan scampered across - effortlessly almost - before thundering through Coffey for the breaking ball. His physique didn’t suggest he was fast. He was deceptive. “Over  metres nobody could touch me,” McGilligan states. “Tony Scullion would be close, Joe Brolly over the first  or  yards would have been fast but I would have stuffed them after that. “Every evening after school you were running and feeding sheep. I was naturally fit and was carrying no weight.” In Coffey’s wake and with the leather in his grasp, McGilligan thumped the ball goalwards. It was the days when you had to fight your own corner. He had done his bit. Now the forwards needed to man up. Enda Gormley nipped ahead of Cahalane to flick the wet ball into the path of Damian Cassidy. Cassidy’s left-footed kick evaded Cahalane’s intended block and hung in the air above full-back Mark O’Connor before Seamus Downey punched to the net and Derry were two points ahead. The measure of a leader is how they respond to adversity. As Derry’s landmark Sunday flirted with failure, before it had left the starting blocks, McGilligan was involved in three of the game’s key moments. The craved All-Ireland title would follow, but it so nearly passed him by. *** It’s a Wednesday night in the McGilligan household. Like a scene from game day in any corner of Ireland. Brian Oacuteg and Fiontan are gathering their gear for a game. Cathair points me in the direction of the farmyard. After a day on the site, Brian senior is out feeding the stock. In full view below, through the open side of the shed, is the Benedy. We head up to the house. Traversing back through the living room is like walking through a museum. The walls are scarcely visible, around framed pictures of Dungiven, Derry and Ulster teams. Charting the career of one of the Derry’s most famous sons. But hurling was his first love. He was reared in the cottages at Owenbeg and went to Dernaflaw school which, despite its small size, also produced Joe Brolly to Derry’s winning team. “The Damperwas there and we had a pretty good hurling team and won a couple of Feacuteiles,” McGilligan recalled. It was pre-Kevin Lynch’s and Dernaflaw would always be beating Dungiven at underage. McGilligan’s football career began as a goalkeeper at U and U. The genuine interest wasn’t there but with flailing numbers, he played almost out of necessity. Now at ‘the big school’ in Dungiven, the oldest of a family of six was now needed on the farm. Spare time was a limited commodity. “You had to go and look sheep and feed them. That was every evening. My fatherwas working and it was up to me. My motherwould lt me at the school gates.” An U title in  was followed two years later by U glory but it wasn’t until the minor grade, under George Murphy, that he made the breakthrough. A championship game with Magherafelt came around the corner and his dual with Joe Beattie, who had a huge reputation at the time, changed the direction of McGilligan’s career. “They threw me out at centre-half back to mark him,” he outlined. Dungiven went on to win two minor championships, but he never was able to break into the mould at county level. In his final year, , he watched on as an unused substitute as Cork beat Derry in the All-Ireland Minor Final. “They put on every Tom, Dick and Harry. It was all about who you were, who your father was and what pedigree you had. They weren’t going to put a rahery like me on,” McGilligan said. As he admits himself, there is a stubbornness. He stuck at it and took his chances when they came. One Sunday, Dungiven reserve manager Liam Harrycoaxed McGilligan from a corn field to make up the numbers for a trip to Ballinderry. Never an easy place to go to. “It was like something from a ‘Carry on’ film,” McGilligan described. “A boy was going to hit a penalty and somebody would run up behind him and trip him. It was the Wild West - there is no other way to say it.” The experience of the reserve and senior games on a Sunday was a lesson for a decorated career that would follow. Andy Murphy came in as manager in . He saw something in McGilligan and pushed him towards the team. His instincts paid off. A year later at Ballinascreen, a star-studded Magherafelt side led Dungiven - to -, as the county final ticked into the final moments. Liam McElhinney’s kick hung in the air. It was the last hurrah. Out of nowhere, McGilligan got a fist to the ball – punching to the net. It lives long in Dungiven folklore and that winning goal helped him to the first of five county medals. His career began to take root. *** It was Sunday, June   at Omagh’s Healy Park. Derry were trailing Tyrone by ‘five or six points’ and Jim McKeever called Brian McGilligan from the dug-out. There was no warm up required. “I was mad keen to get on. I thought I should have started,” McGilligan recalls of his debut. “I went on and I won a couple of balls and we turned it, but Noel McGinn hit a wonder strike.” The goal ended Derry’s hopes but Tyrone would later have a major part to play in McGilligan’s summer. The Kevin Barry’s club in Philadelphia came calling and he headed across the pond. As time went by, he felt he may never . “I wasn’t for coming back. I had work and plenty of money...everything…and the weather was favourable. I was playing football and hurling – it was a home away from home.” With no mobile phones, communication wasn’t as it is now. The weekly phone call kept tabs on how everyone was back home. “Every time I would ring, my mother would say ‘that boy Heffernanwas ringing again’ you would need to ring him.” If the Ireland manager wasn’t ringing the McGilligan household, ‘Heffo’ was ringing then Derry official Patsy Mulholland. The calls continued. Homesickness began to creep in ‘a wee bit’ and with the chance to represent his country, it eventually swayed McGilligan and he dialled Heffernan’s number. Still in Philadelphia, would he be guaranteed a seat on the plane to Oz  Onlyhe was playing the football he was before be left, insisted Heffernan. “You know yourself - boys go outand go off the rails and are messing about. I wasn’t at that. Yes, I enjoyed a beer but I was working hard every day,” McGilligan continues. The football was a good work out, ‘a couple of’ evenings a week. The system wasn’t abused. After a weekend of thinking and a Mondayhome, Heffo booked McGilligan and Dermot McNicholl, who had also spent the summer in Philadelphia, into Tyrone training on the Tuesday night. Art McRory was putting the finishing touches to their  All-Ireland Final with Kerry and had a savage routine in place for McGilligan. “It was strange because we were two Derry men. There was no love lost but we were well looked after – we were treated as part of the .” McGilligan battled with Plunkett Donaghy, Audi Hamilton and Harry McClure in the training games. “The only dference was -we were doing  sprints, I was made do five or six more. If there was half a dozen sI would be doing  of them.” It was the same in the gym sessions. The first set was fine, the second and third set had McGilligan going around on his knees. “I got a lot of abuse. It was bordering on brutality. I remember Art talking to Fr Brian D’Arcy, who was down watching training. “Art said ‘look at the big Derry b*****d, that’s the place for him – on his knees’ and I felt like getting up and striking him.” As the Tyrone sessions were tapering down, McNicholl and McGilligan’s time was up. They thanked Tyrone for having them there and wished them well for the final. McRory was appreciative of the bite the two Derry men brought to their preparations but had a final word of apology for big Brian. The extra training was ‘preferential treatment’ at the request of Heffernan. “The whole thing was pre-planned but it worked,” added McGilligan. He was on the trip to Australia, where he played at full-back as Ireland recovered from a first test defeat to win the series -. Playing in front of average attendances of ,, McGilligan was now an icon. Home for good, he was midfield in Derry’s Ulster winning team. The seeds for Sam were sown. *** The summer of  was his first time playing in the mecca of GAA. It was ‘a privilege’ but age wasn’t on their side. “We had an old team. Plunkett Murphy and Joe Irwin – boys like that. They were all good footballers but there was no youth coming in. “I quite honestly thought we’d never be back in an All-Ireland semi-final even. Holy Jesus, to get playing in Croke Park, this is unreal. “Ulster was very hard to win. It wasn’t like Munster, where it was down to two teams.” Following his All-Star and a trip to America, rubbing shoulders with the best Ireland had to offer, McGilligan began thinking. “They were no better than you, but they were in a better set-up – a better oiled machine,” he offered, referring to the players from other counties. “They weren’t superhumans, when you were playing with them, you were every bit as fast as them.” Back home, it was a lot dferent. “Derry was in turmoil. You were going to matches and counting to seeyou had enough men to play. We played Down at Drumsurn and we were down to the bare bones. “We hadn’t even a manager. Mickey Moran had to step in to take the team. There was  or  out at training.” Fr Sean Hegarty, a confidant of Eamonn Coleman, managed Armagh against Derry in  would act as an intermediary of sorts. “Wee Hegarty came in and I honestly think he steadied the ship. I didn’t know a lot about him but he was a gas man. He was the sort of man I would go to give my confessions to – he was a shrewd man.” With minor teams beginning to produce players, the recipe began to thicken. But like most of his career, McGilligan had to wait. Down and Donegal would feast at the top table first. “Tohill and these boys were coming in at the start of the s but by  they were starting to come of age.” Handing Down an  point hammering in the first round was the perfect tonic. “You start to believe in yourself but it could have gone pear-shaped. We rode our luck in a couple of games.” “Even the bad dayin Clones, it could’ve went either way. There was a ball that went down the field and I went like mad after it. Martin McHugh passed it and I got my hand to it and it came out again.” The small margins where games were won and lost. In the All-Ireland semi-final, Derry were in arrears against Dublin and McGilligan’s  doubts raised their head again. “It was the same auld story. It’s not going to be back again,” he recalled thinking. In the lead-up to the game, he had asked his fatherhe was going to the game. He wasn’t. It wasn’t a surprise. “My mother was dferent,” McGilligan outlined. “But he was never at a match in his le. He didn’t have an interest. He was a typical workaholic and farmer, but he said he’d go to the final.” Whatthey didn’t get there  His father’s answer was the perfect comeback. “He said ‘well,that’s your attitude, then don’t you go either’ – it was as quick as that,” McGilligan added. His son did show up alright. Few can forget the thunderous shoulder on Jack Sheedy. The two met later in the year, by chance, and the Dubliner told McGilligan he was still sore. That’s the brute strength he brought. The Dubs couldn’t move it and neither could Cork. So Gerard McGilligan would get a chance to see his son play. And on the biggest day of them all. “My wewent down,” Brian recalled. “Our young girlwas only a year and Brian Oacuteg was only born. She had more bother with the auld boy than the two weans.” Following the final whistle McGilligan still recalls heading towards the Hogan Stand, where there was a cordon of Gardai surrounding the steps. “I mind crawling on my hands and knees, in between somebody’s legs. I wasn’t fit to walk, I was beat black and had people jumping on me.” The celebration banquet in the Shelbourne Hotel was similar. It couldn’t cope. McGilligan, Tony Scullion and Kieran McKeever – with their partners – were among those unable to get a seat in the mainroom. “It was like something out of a Monty Python sketch - it was hilarious. There were no seats for us. It wasn’t big enough to hold thefor starters. I actually saw somebody move name pieces and sit on the Bishop’s seat.” Seated in dferent room, upstairs, they began to tuck into their soup, one of the RTE staff came upstairs. The Sunday Game was about to go on air but McGilligan was reluctant to go downstairs. He was ‘embarrassed’ as others were forced to give up their seat in the middle of the . Even back at the Airport Hotel, later that night, where Derry were staying, there was only a ‘wee hatch’ open to serve up to  people, including Henry Downey and a certain Sam Maguire. With the cup needing filled, McGilligan issued a ‘bit of advice’ to the night porter and eventually two shutters opened on the bar. It was Monday before the occasion began to seep fully into the mind. Now it was real. *** The Moy was packed and when Derry bus-driver Benny Vincent opened the door - in came Plunkett Donaghy. The previous season, he spilled Anthony Tohill’s ‘’ into the net in the league final to start the ball rolling on Derry’s odyssey. This was dferent. This was a tribute to the sons of Ulster bringing home the Sam. “You had the Garda escort coming out of Dublin and you were stopping in every town,” McGilligan recalls. “There were thousands of people waiting on us on a lorry in every town on the way up.” In Cookstown there was a Loyalist road block. Plan B was to ert via Coalisland. But McGilligan instructed Vincent to head on up the town – as far as they could go. There were thousands of Tyrone people wanting a glance at Sam. “It was unheard of for a team from the North. Down had done it before and it wasn’t new to them - it was new to Derry.” The homecoming seemed to go on forever. In every town, before they were greeted by the huge crowd in Maghera, outside Glen club, before the cup was taken to the four corners of the county. When it was McGilligan’s turn to have the cup, he paraded it around the homes of the Benedy. Back to the days when Liam Harry came rounding him up to make up the numbers. His career had now come full circle. He hosted a night in his house. It was packed, with cars strewn alongside the road. “There was a death up in the Benedy,” added McGilligan, remembering the night vividly. A stranger to the area saw the commotion and stopped off. “He said to somebody ‘where’s the remains at’ – he saw all the cars and thought it was the wake house. He laughed and away he went.” *** The glory days ended abruptly. With Ciaran McCabe’s winning goal for Down in , Derry’s world came crashing down. There was no back door and Derry’s All-Ireland dreams were in tatters. McGilligan laments the  years since meeting Sam. “Any other county would have got their act together. Too many boys partied, lived the high le and thought it was only matter of turning up. “We definitely should have won another one. The players were good enough, you can’t pinpoint any one thing. It was the perfect storm. There was a whole lot of things going on behind. You see where things have gone,” he continued. “We are still as far away from winning another one. We are starting from the bottom again – we are in ision four.” That aside, McGilligan is content on how his GAA career panned out. “It kept me on the straight and narrow. Everybody has their vices and the GAA was a vice for me. If it wasn’t football it was hurling.” Nulling the impact of Joe Beattie, punching home a county final winning goal and answering Kevin Heffernan’s call tofrom America. The important markers in the career of one of Derry’s famous sons. RELATED - Gerry McElhinney - the greatest showman. Click here...

Leo addressed the nation on Friday evening after his plans were approved by Cabinet. The measures were earlier discussed by the National Public Health Emergency Team. There has been a very slight lting of measures announced on March .Over s cocooning can exercise outdoors within km of their homes from May . The general population can take exercise within km of their homes instead of km from next Tuesday, May . The government have also included, in their road map for reopening society and business a plan for the phasedof sporting activities on the island. googletag.cmd.push The roll back on restrictions will be done over five phases. Phase one begins on May  and there are three weeks between each roll back.  In phase one, the government plan to open tennis courts, golf courses and sports pitches, as long as social distancing is still observed. A maximum of four people will be allowed to participate in an activity at the one time. Phase two will permit training, in small groups, but no matches. Phase three promises behind closed doors activities where arrangements are made to maintain social distance, while in Phase four, soccer and GAA canwith a limited number of spectators. This would hopefully mean, from a local perspective, that the Desmond and Limerick District soccer leagues could , while in GAA the football and hurling, club championships, could make a welcometo the playing pitches too. Phase four also allows for swimming pools to open. googletag.cmd.push Phase five, August , will allow gyms, contact sports such as boxing, wrestling and rugby to . There too will be restrictions on large sport gatherings, but it seems that inter county matches in the GAA could be back on the cards in August. It is vital to remember however, that should the virus resurface or one of the phases sees an increase in Covid- cases, there is the possibility that the government would roll back a phase and start from there once more. However, there does seem to be light at the end of the tunnel for sports fans and bodies at this time.

The response to the classes has been brilliant and I have kept it on, even though I am teaching PE full-time in Assumption Grammar in Ballynahinch.ldquoObviously with COVID- I am off work now and with no GAA or fitness classes I have more time on my hands.ldquoI put out the idea on social media on Friday morning and then spent the weekend putting together the first class to upload Monday morning.ldquoI honestly didnrsquot know what to expect really. I was thinking maybeI managed to pull in a hundred people at pound each, pound would be a reasonable target.But I have really been overwhelmed by the response.Members of her usual weekly classes in Pilates for Paula responded immediately, but her school quickly weighed in behind the effort and her many acquaintances in GAA and camogie.Despite her organisation of the fundraiser, in her words being ldquoa bit last minute, her target was realised eight-fold and she presented a cheque for pound, last week.ldquoI couldnrsquot believe it really. When I saw Instagram stories of Sophie Colgan in New York taking part, Eiliacutes Niacute Chaiside [the Slaughtneil camog], who has been in New Zealand for the past year, signing up, and Sarah Donnelly, the Tyrone footballer in Australia, it just shows you that the people you meet through the GAA will always support each other.Paula last year captained Clonduff to the All-Ireland club title and she has played for Down and Ulster over many years, while her husband Darren is the Down football captain.ldquoThe GAA camogie community is absolutely fabulous. They rallied around my family after Christmas and provided a lot of comfort and again the response has been phenomenal.ldquoCOVID- has challenged the family once more. Clodaghrsquos parents, my brother Darren and his we Carol, live in Coleraine and it has been very dficult for us as a family to support them. What has happened over Easter week has given us all a huge lt and we are very thankful for all that support from our GAA family.ldquoI have got a lot of messages since the last class on Friday and everyone seems to have enjoyed them. A lot had never done exercise like that and now want me to provide more classes online and keep it going for as long as we are all prevented from going back to work.ldquoI think plenty of people are finding the lockdown very tough mentally and I got that back in the messages too, about how they felt a lot more positive after doing the exercise, a lot fresher and ready to face the day.She added: ldquoThe people who supported the fundraiser have helped themselves, helped Leukaemia  Lymphoma NI Research and really supported the Gribben family.You can still contribute to Leukaemia Lymphonania Research by searching for Carol and Darren Gribbenrsquos fundraiser in aid of Leukaemia  Lymphoma NI on Facebook or follow this link https:www.facebook donate  .prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29th April 2020 Delamont.jpg","title":"Delamont remains closed in lockdown  ","story":"DELAMONT Country Park outside Killyleagh is to remain closed to visitors.Newry, Mourne and Down Council has confirmed that the gates to the stunning park on the shores of Strangford Lough will not reopen, despite last weekrsquos decision by Stormont agriculture minister Edwin Poots to reopen Tollymore and Castlewellan forest parks.The decision not to allow visitors into Delamont was taken by the leaders of the local councilrsquos main parties during a meeting held via Skype last week and has been welcomed by local councillors Billy Walker and Dermot Curran.Cllr Walker said all the party leaders agreed that is it too soon to reopen Delamont, confirming that the closure decision will be reviewed next month.ldquoThere are real concerns that allowing the public to access the country park could lead to a major surge in visitors which is not what anyone wants at this particular time. The last thing we need is for family picnics and hundreds of other visitors arriving at a time when coronavirus remains a very real and present danger, continued the Rowallane councillor.Cllr Walker described the decision to reopen forest parks as ldquopremature and said Newry, Mourne and Down Council deserved praise for keeping all its country parks closed for the time being.He added: ldquoThe closure decision is being kept under review and I believe that there is still some way to go before council-owned parks will be open to the public.ldquoThere will be people upset that Delamont remains closed, but we all have to adhere to the public advice we have been given in relation to social distancing and, where possible, to stay at home, protect the NHS and save lives.Cllr Curran said he supports the decision to keep Delamont closed and praised what he described as the local authorityrsquos ldquocourageous decision.He argued that the big danger with warmer weather and clearer evenings now here is that reopening the country park could lead to a major influx of visitors and that enforcing social distancing measures would be particularly dficult,not impossible.ldquoThere was perhaps a temptation to reopen Delamont given the decision to allow people to access Tollymore and Castlewellan forest parks, but the local council has stood firm, putting the safety of people front and centre and is to be applauded for doing so, said Cllr Curran.ldquoErring on the side of caution is the right thing to do at this time. It would be an awful situation to reopen the park and for someone to contract coronavirus as a result. The park will reopen at some stage, but not just now. Peoplersquos health and safety must come first.A Newry, Mourne and Down Council spokesman said despite the decision by Mr Poots to reopen parks managed by the Forest Service all those that the local authority is responsible for, including Delamont, will remain closed.Council officials say that the decision to close Delamont taken on March  remains in place for the time being, but will be reviewed as public health advice guidance develops.ldquoMembers decided that it was too soon to consider reopening parks at this time, said a council spokesman.In addition, he said it was felt that reopening local authority-owned country park would encourageresidents from outside the district to make a non-essential journey to these facilities for exercise, thus increasing the volume of traffic and congestion at these locations and increasing the risk of further spread of COVID- across the district.ldquoThe focus of the council at this time must be the safety of our citizens and implementing measures to reduce the spread of the virus, said the spokesman.ldquoThe council continues to advise our citizens that the single most important action they can take is to stay at home in order to protect the NHS and save lives..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29th April 2020 Doreen.jpg","title":"Doreen to step down after 20 years as leader at Leitrim playgroup  ","story":"A LEITRIM woman, who has been the driving force behind a local playgroup for almost  years, is stepping down.Doreen Shahmohammadi is a familiar face around the village, especially to young people as the leader of Leitrim Community Playgroup.Doreen, her Iranian husband, Reza, and twin sons, Michael and Colm, settled in Leitrim a few years before she began the playgroup in January . She soon experienced a strong sense of community and friendship that has kept them there ever since.She started the playgroup with the support of the local GAA club, Liatroim Fontenoys, which offered her use of their premises to begin with.ldquoIn the first year we went from having five children to  children, she said. ldquoWe had no funding in the first year, but the Fontenoys were very good to us by covering the cost of heating and telephone charges.ldquoBy the second year funding was made available by the Southern Education and Library Board for  pre-school places and it wasnrsquot long before we secured funding to build a purpose-built playgroup which sits within the boundary of the Fontenoys club.ldquoWithin a few years and thanks to additional funding enrolment rose to  places. Depending on the birth rate it has usually remains around the same number each year.Doreen loves to have children around her. In fact, Reza reminds her all the time that she is a magnet in attracting them wherever she goes.Doreen is a very proud mother. Her sons, now , graduated as doctors five years ago and both are working on the frontline during the COVID- pandemic. Colm is working in intensive care, while Michael works between cardiology and intensive care.ldquoOver the years, I have loved, cared for and educated every child that has come to the playgroup as though they were my own children, he says.ldquoI am going to miss them all very much, more than you can ever imagine. I hope Irsquom not to be a stranger to the playgroup after my retirement.Doreen says the current playgroup team, made up of deputy leader Michelle McCabe and temporary assistant, Danielle Clarke, have worked well together over the past few years. Other long term members of staff were Janet King, Tina Owens and Diane Baxter.ldquoThe playgroup has been my le and I have enjoyed welcoming hundreds of children to their pre-school year experience. It is a lovely learning environment to be part of, she continued.ldquoWe are blessed with the children and their families in the community who have entered our setting and I would like to take this opportunity to thank the staff and committees past and present, children, grandparents, childminders and, of course, the wider community who have supported me and who have been so generous over the years.ldquoMost of all, I would like to thank the trustees who have supported me for all these years and provided me with the opportunity to establish an excellent learning environment for pre-school children, not forgetting my sincere thanks to the Fontenoys for all their support and encouragement.She added: ldquoI wish my successor every success and I hope they will enjoy and appreciate every single minute they spend with the children as I have done..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29th April 2020 Life.jpg","title":"Ex Drumaness man praises Kiwis as country comes out of lockdown  ","story":"A FORMER Drumaness man who has been living in New Zealand for the past  years has this week revealed what le in lockdown has been like Down Under.Barry Brennanrsquos adopted homeland has been praised for its response to the coronavirus pandemic, with the country this week emerging from a strict five-week quarantine which included the strictest constraints paced on New Zealanders in modern history.The countryrsquos prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, hailed New Zealanders for their incredible work to ldquobreak the virusrsquos chain of transmission which has allowed the country to downgrade its highest alert level from four to three, with amendedrestrictions expected to be in place for around two more weeks.The move means that many shops have reopened while public gatherings of  people are now permissible for weddings and funerals, with schools also set to reopen. In addition, Kiwis can now fish, hunt, surf, swim and play golf.New Zealand has suffered only , confirmed coronavirus cases and  deaths after moving quickly to impose a lockdown last month, with the easing of quarantine measures paving the way for around , people toto work under a more relaxed regime.Barry mdash who specialises in home renovations and employs several people mdash has not ed to work yet, but is more than happy in the idyllic rural setting of Mangawhai in the North Island just five minutes from the beach, where he lives with his we, Sian, and children Sean, Danny and Liam.The New Zealand government is still asking citizens to stay at home and to practise social distancing, with Barry hoping that it wonrsquot be long before the country again enjoys some sense of normality.And he has the praised prime minister for her approach to COVID-, with Arden arguing that a drastic short-term action would benefit the countryrsquos economy in the long run.On Monday, it was confirmed that there is no widespread underlying community transmission in New Zealand, with Ms Arden warning that the country was not yet out of the woods.ldquoWhen you look at what happened where in the world in relation to coronavirus, the prime minister did a good job, said Barry, who headed to New Zealand with his friend Barry Armstrong in .ldquoI was a qualied carpenter and Barry, who lived just up the road from me, was a bricklayer who had a contact in New Zealand so we headed off on a -month visa to Auckland. Barry stayed for  months before heading home but I am still here, married with three boys.ldquoThe coronavirus has had a worldwide impact and while many people were wondering what would happen in New Zealand, I always had a feeling that the prime minister would go at the pandemic hard and fast and that is exactly what she did.Barry revealed that New Zealanders were told to prepare for lockdown on March  and that two days later a series of strict measures were introduced.ldquoClearly the prime minister had a look at what was happening in other parts of the world before the virus got a hold here and she moved to minimise its impact. I think that she has done an amazing job to be quite honest.ldquoFour and a half weeks after the lockdown measures were implemented, there was only one confirmed coronavirus case in New Zealand at the start of this week. Indeed, the government knows exactly where every case is in the country.Barry said anyone arriving in the country and is suspected of having the virus is quarantined and believes thatthere was ever to be another pandemic in the future, countries would do well to take a close look at what New Zealand did to halt its deadly spread.ldquoEverything really happened so fast here and we did not have that much time to think about what was going in, he continued.ldquoI played golf with the principal of the school my youngest boy attends and he said he did not think NewZealand would go into lockdown. Forty eight hours later we were told it was happening.Barry said the country rightly decided that it wasnrsquot taking any chances and locked everything down, apart from supermarkets, with strict social distancing rules in place.ldquoWe have gone from a level four alert to level three but I am still not back at work as there a lot of iables that I need to consider, explained the former Drumaness man. ldquoIn my line of work I would be close to homeowners so I will just wait until the restrictions ease a bit more.Barry relocated from Auckland to Mangawhai six years ago and home is now a three and a half acre plot where he built a shooting gallery and what he describes as a ldquobit of a golf course. He also looks after a few animals.With no immediateto work on the horizon, Barry is keeping busy mowing lawns and feeding his animals, with a little help from his sons.With his parents, Sean and Mary, still living at the family home at the Cumber Road in Drumaness, Barry says he is in regular contact with them. He said his dad is good with Whatsapp and regularly tells him that New Zealand lamb is cheaper in Ireland than down under.ldquoWe have lots of contact with my parents and are in touch once or twice a week. I also have an older brother, Seamus who lives in Auckland. We both played for Loughinisland GAC. I also keep up-to-date with what is going there via social media and stuff, he continued.ldquoMy brother, Mark, is a former Loughinisland club chairman who was involved in the plans for building the new clubhouse. I also keep tabs on Down GAArsquos fortunes.As Barry waits for the right time toto work, he said that during the lockdown, New Zealanders mostly did what they were told.He added: ldquoThey were sensible and the approach has worked as things are slowly ing to normal, but we know that we have a little way to go yet..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29th April 2020 C Diary.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C April 29%2C 1980  ","story":"NEWCASTLE ndash A new library for Newcastle is to be given priority soon by the South Eastern Education Board, it was claimed this week.The claim came from Castlewellan councillor, Mrs Ethel Smyth, a Board member, who said she believed that Board members realised they had made a bad mistake and are now prepared to reverse their attitude.Mrs Smyth, addressing a meeting of Down councillors on Monday, explained that she had recently asked the Board for an undertaking that the Newcastle Library project would be given a priority rating for new capital schemes.ldquoI think the whole Board realised they made a bad mistake and they are quite willing to go ahead and get something done quickly, said Mrs Smyth.Mrs Smyth made her surprise announcement after Newcastle councillor Mr Paddy OrsquoDonoghue attacked the Boardrsquos attitude over a new library for the seaside town.Mr OrsquoDonoghue claimed that an original Board decision to put Newcastle on a low priority rating was taken without consulting the Boardrsquos chief librarian who was in favour of early attention for Newcastle.He called the lack of consultation and criticised the Board for not responding fully to points raised by a council deputation several months ago.BALLYNAHINCH ndash Ballynahinch Chamber of Commerce is beginning to draw up plans for another trade week ndash and such was the success of the last venture that itrsquos been decided to extend this yearrsquos event to ten days.The dates being set aside for the trade week are Thursday, June th to Saturday, June st, and it is hoped that the townrsquos traders will offer many bargains to help attract business.Last yearrsquos trade week was a major success and most businesses in the town have reaped the benefit since. New customers were attracted to the town and quality goods and competitive prices have encouraged many toon a regular basis.The growing stature of the town as a shopping centre has been helped by the introduction of new shops, particularly in the Dromore Street area, and by the good car parking facilities on offer.Market Day every Thursday brings hundreds of people from the surrounding district flooding into the town ndash and with two Market Days cropping up in the new extended trade week this year, the Chamber is hopeful that shopping will hit a new peak in June.QUOILE ndash A concerted effort is being made by the Northern Ireland Tourist Board and Down District Council to make the -mile stretch of the Quoile River into a fishing paradise.Regarded as one of the best fishing waters in the province, the Quoile is hardly known nationally, and itrsquos the aim of the Tourist Board and the council to make it as popular as the Fermanagh Lakelands, the current number one fishing haven.The joint effort to put the Quoile on the fishing map is being spearheaded by Ian Heaps, the former inidual world champion angler and current member of the English international team, who has been carrying out a survey over the past ten days.And his report could influence the Tourist Board to pump more money into publicising the Quoile to world-wide anglers.Already Heaps has spent ten days fishing the Quoile and its ancillary waters ndash and his expert opinion is that itrsquos one of the best that Northern Ireland has to offer.KILLYLEAGH ndash The Vikings ed to invade Killyleagh this week ndash but this time it was a more peaceful visit.The invaders, instead of arriving by longship to pillage and plunder, came to look over youth provision in the area and they left totally impressed by the friendly reception they received.The unlikely invaders were a group of youth workers from Norway and Spain, who visited the area as part of a five-day study of youth work and facilities in the province.Local stops were at the Seaboard Sailing Centre in Killyleagh, Ardnabannon Outdoor Pursuits Centre in Castlewellan and Downpatrick Folk Club.Tuesday afternoon and night was spent in the area, with the first stop for the Norwegians being at the Seaboard centre.STRANGFORD ndash The recently formed Strangford Village Improvement Committee is to seek public support to have an order enforcing the one-way system in the village revoked.The committee discussed the system at their monthly meeting on Thursday and, after hearing of the failure of a meeting between the Department of Environment officials, traffic police and RUC representatives to have something done about it, they decided that the support of the public is needed.The committee chairman told members that the top level meeting had fallen on deaf ears and that nothing could be done about the situation.They had discussed the possibility of altering the system, the ious proposals which the committee had made as alternatives to it, and the fact that the majority of residents did not want the system.Unfortunately the Department rejected all the committeersquos proposals and insisted that the system, in its present form, would have to remain, said the chairman.The chairman had askedthe one-way system would not be made permanent until all attempts to accommodate the residentrsquos wishes had been made but the Department replied that the systemis already permanentand had been made so by Government order.

The online sales are set to continue as marts across the province begin to reopen.Cllr Lewis said the marts have a crucial role to play, allowing farmers to buy and sell livestock, at what is a traditionally a busy time of the year for them. Crucially, he said reopening marts will help with their respective incomes.He said there was ldquosignicant concern when the marts closed last month, with farmers expressing concern that they could find themselves overstocked with animals, particularly store cattle and ped calves.ldquoNews of the gradual reopening of local marts is an important development and will be widely welcomed across the agricultural sector at this time, said Cllr Lewis.The Slieve Croob councillor said DAERA was to be applauded for its decision, particularly given the key role farmers play in supplying the local food chain.ldquoIt is essential that in these uncertain times that farm production continues and that the local supply chain of quality food products can be available to the public, he continued.ldquoAt this time of year, many farmers are seeking to purchase stock for the grazing season and obviously others are selling their stock through the marts. Dairy farms will also find themselves overstocked with dropped calves that they would normally be selling.Cllr Lewis said there were farmers wishing to sell and buy livestock and it was ldquovital in these uncertain times that farm production continues and that the local supply chain of quality food products can be available to the public.A DAERA spokesman said farmers were key workers and were continuing to provide food for everyone in ldquovery challenging circumstances with part of the food supply chain the ability to trade and sell animals.ldquoStaff within the department have maintained regular contact with livestock mart operators over recent weeks and have been reassured that robust operational protocols, developed by the marts in conjunction with other stakeholders, will enable them to conduct business in a manner that is safe for staff, farmers and buyers and adheres to social distancing requirements, he continued.ldquoFarmers, like all businesses, are facing financial dficulties as a result of COVID-.

In many ways, itrsquos strange to think that by staying home I can save a le.My sister, Martina, loved le, but she was only  when she passed away in . Seasonal flu was the culprit which overwhelmed her body. COVID- is a frightening virus for the world to contend with. But it is especially frightening for people like me.Martina and I were born with spinal muscular atrophy , a genetic muscle wasting condition which robs people of the ability to walk, eat and breathe.I now live an active, productive le, thanks to many interventions that started in my childhood. I had a tube ed into my stomach to ensure that I could get the nutrients I could no longer eat as half of the muscles I use to swallow became paralysed. I also began using a non-invasive ventilator.COVID- has been on our radar since the beginning of January. I could do little but watch and wait. The plans would not be much dferent than my usual flu-time plans which ensure that I am in protective bubble, which allows my family to do everything it can to maintain an infection-free environment around me.Sure enough, almost  days ago, it was time to take action, with the Hollywood lockdown coming almost two weeks before it was implemented for everyone . And within a few days of the official lockdown beginning, I was also furloughed from work at a leading charity for people with conditions like mine.This has been one of the most emotionally and mentally dficult parts of the pandemic for me personally. Since I was  I have been working with and for this charity to improve lives. But within a few short days my le had drastically changed.Last September, I took eight flights in three weeks as I was selected for an Emerging Leaders programme by the US State Department for my work with disabled people and for a national conference for people with conditions like mine in London.Now, I have to stay within the bounds of my driveway. I can only go outside because my neighbours are all so far away. A small mercy.It quickly became obvious that getting food and other essential supplies was not going to be easy. Large supermarkets only started offering registration to extremely vulnerable customers a few weeks in to the lockdown.Before lockdown began few,any supermarkets offered a dedicated shopping time to extremely vulnerable customers, making getting food dficult during a time when it was flying off the shelves in panic buying.Crossgarrsquos SuperValu store got us through those first few weeks as it was able to deliver some essentials, while Gordons Pharmacy in Downpatrick has been delivering to us for some time now. But the pharmacyrsquos willingness to collect our preions has been a huge weight off our shoulders.I have now been able to register the family with Sainsburyrsquos for deliveries of other items we need to keep us ticking over, while Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos food delivery package service has been much more successful than those in other parts of the UK.The one that we have received included food that I could eat ndash something many of my friends in the rest of the UK are not so lucky with. The parcel is one small, yet very important part of the support our government is offering that it has got right, even though it has only been in place for us for three weeks.It took us several weeks to set up everything we needed, but I know that many others are still trying and are having to take drastic, le-endangering measures to keep it going.However, COVID- is not just a negative in the lives of disabled people.Virtual concerts, musicals on YouTube for all and even online quiz nights have become the new normal of socialising.Many jobs and educational institutions have moved staff to work from home and online, something that some disabled people were often refused when they asked for it. Even the community spirit and volunteering has left us feeling overwhelmed with offers of help.It is my hope that we can use this opportunity to see what our future can be.A more accepting and inclusive society, where disabled people can fully take part. Creative thinking mdash both economic and social mdash have taken a cannonball to the social infrastructure that was a climbing wall and turned it into an accessible lt.I want us all to realise how positive this can be for society and act upon it, even when the pandemic is over..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29th April 2020 Laura.jpg","title":"Laura takes chair  ","story":"CASTLEWELLAN woman Laura Devlin is to become the districtrsquos new first citizen.The Mournes SDLP councillor is set to take over at the helm of Newry, Mourne and Down Council when the local authority holds its annual meeting next month.Cllr Devlin will replace Sinn Feinrsquos Charlie Casey in the council hot seat, while two Ulster Unionist councillors mdash Robert Burgess and Harold McKee mdash are in the running for the councilrsquos deputy position.She was chosen as her partyrsquos nomination for the top council post last week, with the councilrsquos Ulster Unionist members set to confirm shortly their preferred choice for the vice-chairmanrsquos position.Cllr Devlin has been a member of the SDLP since  and is a highly respected politician who was co-opted to replace Eamonn OrsquoNeill on the former Down Council in .With her position as the new council chairman confirmed, all eyes are on the UUP to see which councillor the party will pick to be her deputy.Slieve Croob councillor Alan Lewis and Slieve Gullionrsquos David Taylor have ruled themselves out of the running for the post due to work commitments, leaving it a straight fight between Cllr Burgess and Cllr McKee, two of the UUPrsquos most experienced councillors.Cllr Burgess is a former Down Council chairman and is also the current chairman of the Ulster Farmersrsquo Unionrsquos Co Down Branch, while Cllr McKee was a former South Down MLA and member of Newry and Mourne Council.The annual meeting is traditionally held in the debating chamber at the local authorityrsquos Downshire Civic Centre in Downpatrick, but alternative venues are currently being examined to comply with social distancing guidelines in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic.The council debating chamber is not large enough to ensure that the districtrsquos  councillors, council staff and the media can safely stay two metres apart.The Recorder understands that several options are being explored on the way forward, with a formal announcement expected shortly.Down Leisure Centre, which is currently closed to the public, has been touted as a possible base for the annual meeting, with proceedings taking place in the expansive four court sports hall on the first floor.It is being suggested that the large area would allow councillors, officers and the media to comfortably comply with social distancing legislation.An alternative suggestion which some councillors believe could be a potential runner is an annual meeting attended by just the leaders of the councilrsquos main parties and the leader of the Independent members.Ahead of the AGM, the main parties have already selected which councillors will be appointed to the local authorityrsquos ious statutory committees and who will fill the top two positions on each.And, in keeping with public health advice to maintain social distancing, it is understood that the formal ceremony to present the new chairman with the chain of office will also not take place.

Unfortunately after all of the hard work of labour, I had to have a C-section and James Patrick was born at .pm on Tuesday. Ryan was allowed into the recovery room with me for two hours, but after that he didnrsquot see me or the baby until Thursday afternoon when we were allowed home.Prospective parents have been told that only one birth partner is currently allowed into the delivery ward, but onlythey are well and show no signs of coronavirus.Mrs Lawlor said: ldquoApart from the labour and the C-section, it was a positive experience. I think I was more anxious in the days coming up to the birth as I didnrsquot know what the restrictions would mean. In hindsight, it wasnrsquot that bad and it was probably worse for Ryan sitting at home. He rang his sister who has four children and asked when she thought he could do and she said clean the house.Baby James Patrick was only one day overdue, but Mrs Lawlor was delighted that he decided to make an appearance when he did. A clue to his birth weight may be due to his mother being ft  inches tall, while dad Ryanis ft  inches.While Mrs Lawlor did not have to wear a face mask during her labour, but the midwives who attended her afterwards were masked.She said: ldquoI suppose as this was an all-new experience for both Ryan and I we have nothing to compare it to.ldquoI remember waking up the next day, not that I slept that much in the night, and thought, lsquoOh no, I have a whole day by myself in here with this brand new babyrsquo. But the nurses and midwives are coming that often to do a iety of checks that the days went quite fast.ldquoHowever, I remember that I felt the second night in hospital was awfully long and I really struggled with dealing with James. Normally,you have a bit of help during the day and night, you can manage better to get a bit of sleep.ldquoThe strangest thing was seeing quite a few of the staff with masks and visors on. While they were all lovely, you lost a bit of the personal touch and connection with them because of the masks. Sometimesthey were maintaining social distancing and werenrsquot close to you, you couldnrsquot actually see who it was. The staff were all wonderful but you didnrsquot know what they looked like.As a sportswoman, who used to play for Loughinisland GACrsquos senior ladies and at county level, Mrs Lawlor is recovering well after the birth. Her husband is also well-known in local sporting circles as hersquos on the executive committee of Loughinisland GAC.They are becoming accustomed to the lsquonewrsquo normal at home of being first-time parents amid the lockdown.Mrs Lawlor said: ldquoWe have had visitors to the house looking through the window at the baby. Itrsquos still hard for everyone as my sister is itching to get a wee cuddle and all our family members want to hold him. That canrsquot happen for very good reasons and I donrsquot know when that will change. Thatrsquos one of the strange things about having a baby in the lockdown.ldquoHowever, the simplicity of le today is quite nice. I think itrsquos possibly the best time to have a baby. We have plenty to keep ourselves busy with James Patrick in the lockdown and therersquos nothing  to distract us. Ryan is a self-employed plumber andit wasnrsquot for the lockdown, he probably would have been ing to work sooner so itrsquos good for us to have this time together..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/6th May 2020 Go Digital.jpg","title":"Paddy Mo’s greatest Down side of all time  ","story":"p.pp.pspan.s Paddy Doherty was a key member of the historic Down All-Ireland-winning team of . In a glittering playing career, the Ballykinlar man went on to win two more All-Ireland medals and established himself as one of the legends of the Gaelic football. Here, he selects his greatest Down team of all timeHIS name alone is enough to rekindle treasured memories of a time when Down football reigned supreme.Paddy lsquoMorsquo Doherty had the deadliest left foot in Ireland and he used it to maximum effect as Down swept all before them.Incredibly, itrsquos  years ago that Down took the sporting world by storm when they defeated Kerry to win the All-Ireland senior football title for the first time. It was also the first time that a team north of the border had won the Sam Maguire Cup.To reinforce their emergence as a new power in Gaelic football, Down retained their title the following year with Paddy as captain of the side which defeated Offaly and he was also a member of the Down team which won a third All-Ireland for the county in , Kerry again falling victim to the Red and Black machine in the final.As well as his three All-Ireland medals, Paddy won seven Ulster Championship, seven Railway Cup and three National League medals. He was the leading scorer in Ulster for eight seasons and in Ireland for three years.Now in his s, hersquos followed Downrsquos fluctuating fortunes ever since, relishing in theof the glory days in the early s, sharing in the disappointment of the barren times and casting a critical eye from the sidelines, though always with the optimistic outlook of the true fan.So what does he believe is the greatest Down team of all time Not surprisingly, given their accomplishments, hersquos largely selected his choice from his team-mates from the Sixties mdash though with typical modesty, he has not picked himself for the starting .ldquoYou have to remember that the Down team of s was the first to bring the Sam Maguire over the border, he says.ldquoThat was a really big achievement and we had beaten Kerry in the final. We had shown we were the best team in Ireland and we proved that again the following year in the final against Offaly after beating Kerry in the semi-final. We also beat Kerry in the  final, which meant that we had beaten them three times.ldquoKerry have always been the benchmark. If we had not beaten them, they would have won another three All-Irelands.Asked how his Down team would fare against present day sides ldquoItrsquos a dferent game now, what with the blanket defence and other things, but the Down teams of the s would have won in any era. Well, thatrsquos what I think, though Irsquom sure there are many people who would disagree. Eddie McKay Eddie won two All-Ireland medals with me in  and . He was a very good goalkeeper believe me, always safe, dependable and brave. He was an excellent shot stopper and made many excellent saves. I also played against him many times when Ballykinlar took on Dundrum. These were local parish derbies and everyone was trying to kill each other, but somehow Dundrum never managed to beat us. George Lavery George also won two All-Irelands in  and . He was the quiet man on the team, but there were few better man markers in the game and he would have been a star in any era. He had played a match of two for Antrim, but Maurice Hayes, who was secretary of the Down county board, persuaded him to sign for Down. He played as sweeper and was a good, tight marker. Leo Murphy Leo was a terric full back, tough and reliable. Not too many players could get past him and he could kick the ball a long distance. He also won two All-Irelands in  and . Pat Rice There was no one better than Pat Rice at catching a ball. His high fielding was magnicent and he was quick at clearing the ball. He gave away few chances and often kicked the ball out for Eddie McKay. He missed little and he wasnrsquot a dirty player at all. Dan McCartan One of only three Down players to win three All-Ireland senior medals along with Sean OrsquoNeill, Joe Lennon and myself, Dan is one of the all-time greats of Down football. He had outstanding ability, tackled hard and always looked for the quick clearance up to the front men. He could play anywhere as he showed when he moved to full back in the  final. Joe Lennon He was our captain in , though he did not play in the second after getting injured. He was a great captain and a terric leader. Joe placed a great emphasis on fitness and pioneered new coaching practices. He thought greatly about the game and was possibly ahead of his time. He was a very talented player. Tom OrsquoHare Tom played in the  team, but was good enough to get his place on any team. He was probably one of our best players that year. He was always steady and was great at delivering a ground ball. Jarlath Carey Jarlath won two All-Irelands in  and . He was a tireless worker, who was at home either in midfield or in attack. He was always forcing his way into the forward line and would wag his finger at me to go back into midfield to cover for him. I didnrsquot mind one bit, because he was good enough and I was fit enough to do what he asked. Colm McAlarney They called Colm lsquoThe Mighty Arklersquo after the famous racehorse because of his long strides up the field. Colm and Tom OrsquoHare were our two outstanding players in  and Colm was definitely one of the best midfielders in Ireland at that time, or any other time. Tony Hadden Tony won two All-Irelands in  and . He could fist the ball further than many players could kick it and he could also move into midfieldthings were going bad. He was tall and well built and could score a point as well as anyone. James McCartan A very strong player. Down would not have won anything without him because he took a lot of the abuse which would otherwise have been directed at me or Sean OrsquoNeill. He played a critical role in the  final against Offaly. We were two goals down in the first half and getting beaten. I crossed the ball to James who turned in mid air and put into the back of the net. Two more goals from Sean OrsquoNeill and Breen Morgan had us a goal up at half time, but it was his goal that turned things around. Sean OrsquoNeill You would have to say that Sean was the greatest Down footballer of them all. He was named in the GAA Team of the Century which says it all. We played well together, wherever I kicked the ball, Sean was there to get it. He had a wonderful sidestep and took a lot of abuse, but he never retaliated. He went on to become a successful manager and won the Sigerson Cup with Queenrsquos University. Mickey Linden Mickey was a flying machine and one of Downrsquos best ever forwards. He could blow defences away with his pace and score with either foot. He was also very versatile. You could play him anywhere and he would still be a threat. Perhaps his only failing was that he was too nice a player. He rarely made a foul. Won two All-Irelands in  and . Patsy OrsquoHagan Full forward and winner of two All-Irelands in  and . He could have played full forward, full back, or just about anywhere . He was that good. One of his best performances was Wembley Stadium during one of the Wembley Cup tournaments when he scored four goals against Galway. Breen Morgan They made them tough in Annaclone and for his size Breen was one of the hardest men on the field. He had broken his jaw before the  All-Ireland final, but went to the field without the protector which was made specially for him. He just threw it on to a chair. He was marked by Offalyrsquos Paddy McCormick, who was made of iron, but Breen was afraid of no one.Paddyrsquos substitutesDanny Kelly , Greg Blaney , Barry Breen , James Milligan , Ross Carr , Paddy OrsquoRourke , DJ Kane , Dan Gordon , Benny Coulter , Paddy Doherty ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29th April 2020 Ciara.jpg","title":"Portaferry athlete takes lockdown in her stride  ","story":"CIARA Mageeanrsquos Olympic ambitions may have been put on hold owing to coronavirus, but shersquos taking the lockdown in her stride mdash almost.The  year-old Portaferry runner, who is currently holed up in Manchester, says the current restrictions arenrsquot that far removed from her normal training regime.Even so, she says there are days when she does not want to run and she also misses her family and friends back at home.ldquoWersquore all struggling mdash therersquos days I donrsquot even want to go out and run now, and that the thing I have to do and the thingI always look forward to, she said.ldquoTherersquos days Irsquove cried and been like, lsquoWhat the hell is this rsquo Irsquove chatted to my team-mates about that and you justhave to find little methods ad mechanisms to try and help yourself.Last Thursday, Ciara was one of a number of leading sportsmen and women at the virtual launch of Sport NIrsquos Wellbeing Hub in response to the COVID- challengeThe hub provides instant access to helpful information, guidance and screening that is tailored specically to help care for wellbeing needs.It offers a range of innovative tools and resources, including guided self-assessment via lsquoChatbotrsquo, self-help programmes and digital intervention tools, a searchable five ways to wellbeingrsquo map and a wellbeing information library.Ciara said: ldquoOur mental health is so vital and right now is a challenging time for all of us.A full-time athlete and a member of Team New Balance, Ciara lives in Manchester in the same house with fellow athletes Jip Vastenburg and Adam Craig.

Irsquom not quite sure when Irsquoll get to see him next as Irsquom in Manchester and he is in Dublin so itrsquos a nice way to start my day and always puts a smile on my face.Q Whatrsquos your favourite exercise A Oh I feel like I should say running, as I am an athlete, butI was to think of my favourite it would probably be a few things. I do miss playing a team sport so probably camogie, I absolutely loved dodge ball in school sothat was an option Irsquod pick that, and I do enjoy my gym workouts getting to lt weights.Q Is there one particular skill you practice every day A Running, every day! Running is a gross motor sport so fine skills arenrsquot really a part of my daily training, but I do work on dferent areas of my fitness every day. I have to work on things such as flexibility and fine muscle control every day to keep myself injury free. In the athlete house though we have been honing dferent skills while on lockdown, trying out dferent Tik Tok dances, press ups, and trying to get our eye in with the sling shot in the back garden!Q Netflix and chill or a nice evening jog A Both, usually we have an evening run, easy four miles... then we chill and watch a movie after dinner. We have had to mix training up a bit with the changes but in an ideal world we get both in.Q Name one book you want to read.A Irsquom making my way through a few Malcolm Gladwell books. I love coming away with new information and enjoy a book that challenges my thought process. Then when I need to flake out Irsquod pick something like A Man Called Ove. Soanyone could recommend books like this to me theyrsquod be on my ldquowant to read list.Q On a scale of  to , how good are your DIY skills A Ohhhh, Irsquom going to give myself an . -  here. My daddy is a joiner so I spent my le watching him make and fix things, and soon learned the names of tools and how to use them. I do know my limits though so I stay away from the plumbing... luckily in Portaferry my dad has a lot of friends who are alsotradesmen so they all help each other out.Q Have you a favourite pre-training meal to help you through a tough session A We usually train in the morning so I tend to eat an OTE DuoBar, the vanilla flavour in my favourite, and a cup of tea. When it come to racing in the evening, something easy to digest is usually what I go for... rice is always a winner.Q Name one movie you want to watch.A , I was planning on watching it in the cinema before the lockdown.Q Whatrsquos the best way to stave off boredom A Oh as a full-time athlete I feel Irsquove been preparing for lockdown for years. My le is basically train, eat, sleep. For me therersquos a few things I enjoy. I love chatting with my family, Irsquom usually on WhatsApp most of the day chatting or messaging and keeping in touch. I also love arts and crafts, Irsquoll be making postcards to post to my boyfriend and siblings to make them laugh, and currently my little cousin is teaching me the guitar via WhatsApp. She is a tough taskmaster, I have a lesson every Thursday and Monday and homework in between so that keeps me busy Q Have you any tips for training at home A Set yourself some goals that you can realistically achieve from home. We are allowed out for our daily exercise so you can get some cardio in outside, find a route that works for you and follow the guidelines. When it comes to working out inside, have fun. Find new alternatives, there are so many exercises we can do with body weight, or with stuff we have about the house so be creative and have a bit of craic. If you need any ideas check out social media, so many people are sharing home workouts. Give yourself a plan or schedule and try to stick to it. Being home means we can fall into the habit of sitting about and it can be hard to feel motivated. At the beginning of each week set out your plan for the week, what day, what time, and what exercise. Write it down and stick it somewhere you can see. Creating a routineduring these strange times means we can take back a little control.Q Name one documentary you want to see.A Anything with David Attenborough, I absolutely love animals and nature, and could listen to his voice all day.Q Have you discovered any new music or podcasts A My music taste is so ied but my wee sis and cousin Tara introduced me to Beoga and I absolutely love it. A lad from my hometown, Ryan McMullan also features in some of their songs, always a nice surprise hearing a weePortaferry accent as Irsquom listening.Q Is there one piece of housework you can no longer avoid A My own room!

There is a transition period where you are not really the Archbishop of Armagh but you want to be as helpful as you can and you are also I suppose trying to work out what and how you are going to approach the task.The Archbishop-Elect explained the three facets to the roleHe said there was the appointment of Bishop of the Diocese of Armagh, which has a larger population with a great number of large towns in it than Clogher Diocese.In addition, there is the role of Primacy of All Ireland, considered lsquoFirst among equalsrsquo acknowledging there is another Primate in the southern province but to some degree to be an ambassador for the Church of Ireland.He added: ldquoThe third element is your place within the wider Anglican Communion which I have relatively little experience of. You become a member of the Primatersquos Meeting which is one of the instruments of communion within Anglicanism. There are a number of ways we hold ourselves together, the Lambeth Conference, the office of the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Anglican Consultative Council and more recently, the Primatersquos Meeting.So what type of church do you see under your leadership ldquoItrsquos dficult to speak for the church as the Church of Ireland General Synod is the body which has that authority. There is a saying that the Church of Ireland is synodically governed and episcopally led. What the Archbishop of Armagh can do is to speak to the Church and suggest can concern itself with. It sets a bit of a tone as well. Itrsquos about its spiritual le and its own governance and the need to acknowledge that like probably all institutions and all bodies some bits of it do well and some do not do well some bits are growing and some bits are shrinking some bitsvery well and some bitsnot so well and to maybe try to discover that the bits that do not do well could do a bit better, in terms of spiritual le and acknowledging there is a huge ersity within Anglicanism and to remember that thatrsquos all part of the Anglican heritage.ldquoThere are obviously particularly challenges at the moment, what the church says to society and what it does for the society in which it is placed. You cannot pretend it doesnrsquot live in a political context. Politics is not something that just happens in Parliament. Democracies are places where political discussion or dialogue are about what we can do together or decisions which are deeply embedded. There are institutions which are recognisable bodies in civil society such as the business community, trade unions, voluntary sector and churches are one of those. I think they have their particular things to say and its perfectly legitimate for them to say it.ldquoThe big imponderable at the moment is coronavirus and we have no idea how deeply that will affect the patterns of society. We could come out the other side of that challenge a changed society, with maybe small changes and maybe some very profound changes. Of course the other big external issue is Brexit which involves the relationships between the dferent regions within Ireland and the United Kingdom.ldquoI could be in both parts of that jurisdiction in one day praying for good governance for both of them and for their leaders, he said.In terms of reaching out to people in the Church of Ireland, the Archbishop-Elect recalled how a Northern Ireland Le and Times survey revealed around  per cent of people in Northern Ireland attend church at some point. He said the heyday for attending church was in the period from the late th Century to the period to the middle of the s. But he thinks current attendance is ldquoback to the old norm with fewer people committed to regular churchgoing.He rightly points out that churches are among the very few inter-generational bodies with people of dferent ages attending.The Archdeacon-Elect says people in very small rural parishes are committed to their churches in the sense that they are contributing to their community who feel it is being enriched with their presence. He said the church finds its place in the community.ldquoThe second challenge is what we are for ourselves as a group, as a faith community, how we build up the church, which canrsquot live in isolation but we have our particular family traditions - how we contribute to the ersity of Ireland, how we build up the church to be confident communities of faith and not hesitant or fearful or invisible communities of faith.He said for the Church of Ireland, there was tremendous heritage from Anglicanism.ldquoThe Church of Ireland has a particular way of doing things, liturgically. Liturgy is both the expression and source of our belief. Our vocation may be to hold together what on the face of it appear to be contradictory things is maybe one of our roles in religious and spiritual le. I have no ideait is the best way to be a Christian but it is our way and it seems to contribute something to the catholic church, the wider church.ldquoHarry McAdoo, a well-known Archbishop of Dublin and a great scholar, once said, lsquoIf I hadnrsquot been born an Anglican, I would have had to become one.rsquoThe Archbishop-Elect leaves Clogher Diocese after forging and maintaining good relations with other denominations.He said: ldquoI think the vast majority of committed Christian people see more in common with other Christian traditions than separating us. There is a very long history of ecumenism in the diocese of Armagh as well. There is a long association and friendship with Archbishop Eamon Martin and I hope we can continue to build relationships and friendships.The Archbishop-Elect trained for Church of Ireland ministry after a career in industry in which he held a senior role in Shorts and was for a time, Assistant Director of the CBI in Northern Ireland.ldquoThat probably give me some skills in organisation and about leadership. Irsquove been very lucky here. Irsquom not very fond of the word lsquoleaderrsquo in the ecclesiastical world but one of the things a leader does is to build a team around him. It is almost a contradiction in terms to be involved in a leadership role in Christianity, to do it on your own.ldquoThere are certain things as a bishop that end with you. There are plenty of lonely moments in that sense where you have to make decisions. But by and large business acclimatised me to working with all sorts of dferent people from all sorts of dferent backgrounds in dferent ways and to experience what every parishioner experiences, normal working le with those pressures.As Bishop of Clogher the new Archbishop-Elect held a number of positions nationally and internationally representing the Church.He was the Church of Ireland contact person to the Churches of the Porvoo Communion which represents the Scandanavian and Baltic Lutherans as well as the Spanish and Portuguese Anglicans and other Anglican churches and provinces from these islands making contact at senior level travelling with them.He has also held senior roles on the Irish Council of Churches, the national ecumenical instrument and also the Irish Inter-Church meeting, the latter which includes the Roman Catholic church.He said those bodies were important especially as ecumenism was becoming bland and it was important to keep going and keep talking.These inter-church bodies contribute to providing resources for churches around Brexit, homelessness, welfare reform and subjects churches would be expected to have a voice in.ldquoI enjoyed that hugely, I am coming to the end of that, six years in total two years as vice-President, two years as President and two years as outgoing Vice President. I will be involved again as a member of the Church Leadersrsquo Meeting.The Archbishop-Elect says of his time in Clogher Diocese ldquoItrsquos always been an aim of mine wherever I have worked to try to create a family atmosphere where there are degrees of mutual respect and degrees of mutual accountability. I remember saying that the diocese of Clogher is big enough to do thingswe all pull together in the same direction and small enough for everybody to be necessary for that to happen and to be accountable for what the contribution is. If you treat people with respect, then relationships are easier.ldquoBy and large I felt people were for me rather than against me. It helpsyou are reasonably interested in people and their families and what they do and acknowledge that as an important factor in their faith. Whoever the next Bishop of Clogher is theyshould allow him or her to be his or her own bishop of Clogher and not that they should be like me, Brian Hannon or Michael Jackson or like St. Macartan.The Archbishop-Elect says he enjoys reading history and poetry and in terms of music, takes particular pleasure in the tradition of Anglican anthems . He does admit to particularly enjoying the Psalms which are poetry.The Archbishop-Elect acknowledges that his mother who had a profound influence on his le, reciting the Daily Office at home and was happily committed to God and His Church and would have sung the Te Deum while washing the dishes. One of her favourite biblical phrases was from the Gospel of St. John, Chapter  ldquoI come that you would have le and that you might have it more abundantly.Relaxation for the Archdeacon-Elect is visiting one of his favourite places, the Ulster Museum to see the collection of Irish Art and reading.ldquoThe thing I am looking to reading most is I took possession of the third volume of Hilary Mantelrsquos Wolf Hall trilogy about Thomas Cromwell, lsquoThe Mirror and Light,rsquo an historical novel, he adds.The Archbishop-Electrsquos we Mary teaches in Enniskillen Royal Grammar School and his daughter, Dorothy, is at the University of Oxford.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

IFI Chairperson, Paddy Harte commented on the funding: “The journey towards a peaceful society takes many forms and this funding is essential to help boost community spirit and leadership at an extremely challenging time.Keith McCann from Regenerate said: “During the current crisis we are working hard to deliver for our town. We have a telephone helpline working with over  people each week providing conversation, support and signposting to services. We are also working on new video content and running zoom online sessions to help reduce fear and anxiety. Finally, we are delivering food hampers and around  hot meals every week to those who need it the most. “For us, community engagement and support from the IFI is more crucial than ever. People are watching news and social media more and this information can often create fear within the community. Our work is very important and this funding will ensure we continue to keep connecting on a personal level and building trust with people.”A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.
