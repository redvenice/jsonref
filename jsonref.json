Midtown Manhattan is seen on the left while Brooklyn and Queens are seen on the horizon         Constructing the deck was a tremendous feat of engineering which entailed building 15 separate modules the size of small yachts in Italy and then shipping it 4,000 miles across the Atlantic Ocean         When assembled, the pieces comprising the deck weigh a combined total of 765,000 pounds - or 383 tons‘We had all of this work to do at an elevation of 1,131 ft, so it led to us deciding to build this like a big jigsaw puzzle and assemble 15 modules the size of small yachts off site.’Kelly told Fast Company that the modules of the deck were built in Italy and shipped across the Atlantic Ocean.When assembled, the pieces weigh a combined total of 765,000 pounds - or 383 tons.‘We all stepped back and we looked at an observation deck that was upside down and sitting on solid ground and said to ourselves, “How are we going to take that apart and put it up in New York?”’The deck made a 4,283-mile journey across the ocean from Italy.But the engineers found that the long ocean trek was the easy part. The most challenging aspect was the final 10-mile leg in which the deck needed to be moved from the Port of New Jersey to Manhattan’s West Side.To get the modules across the Hudson River and on to the West Side Highway, Kelly said that officials needed to remove street signs and traffic lights in order to accommodate their sheer size.

The heart of a new village has been created,\u0027 she said.Developers Related Companies and Oxford Properties said the project, which is more than half finished, includes 100 stores, 25 restaurants and a planned 4,000 residential units, in addition to 10.4 million sq feet (about one million sq meters) of office space. Tenants include luxury retailers Neiman Marcus, gourmet markets and world-class chefs such as Thomas Keller.This being New York, the project is not without its critics, who have called it too glitzy, too commercial and too much a slap in the face to the city’s lower-income residents.         The highly anticipated Hudson Yards development opened on Friday to the public after 10 years of construction.

One of the ways they communicated was by grooming each other. But when humans arrived and wanted to form much bigger social groups, they realised you couldn\u0027t do it simply by touching each other for hours on end. Nor did they have the luxury of words. So they developed a language of intonation. We would call it singing.It is estimated, says Dunbar, that even now, more than 90 per cent of communications between humans is non-verbal. We do it through body language and, above all, by intonation. But who needs anthropologists to make the case for communicating through music when we have babies?         The 76-year-old (pictured during the first broadcast of the Today programme) said he \u0027finally had enough of going to bed very early\u0027 and getting up in the middle of the night to present Psychiatrist Dr Iain McGilchrist is in no doubt that when children learn to communicate, it is the musical aspects of language that come first: the intonation, the phrasing of the sounds — all crucial in the development of music.Newborn babies, he points out, are already sensitive to the rhythms of language. You can hear it in their baby talk. Their mothers respond to it — with sounds that make no linguistic sense but which the baby recognises.As a boy I liked to sing. Everyone knows the Welsh can sing, right? Wrong. At the end of my first choir practice in St Saviour\u0027s Church in Cardiff, the choirmaster took me aside for a quiet word.\u0027I think you\u0027d better not come to any more practices, bach... you\u0027re putting the other boys off.\u0027I was nine and scarred for life. Whenever I belted out Mae Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau, the Welsh national anthem, at a Welsh rugby international, I could feel 80,000 supporters edging away from me. When we went from door to door singing carols, the leader would suggest that perhaps I should scout out the next house while they did the actual singing.Eventually, I took singing lessons from a teacher who assured me that I was not actually tone deaf but, on balance, I should stick to speaking. So I did — until my firstborn, Christopher, decided he wanted a career in music.He was eight when he started learning the cello. He left it until he was 17 before announcing that he wanted to make a career of it.He got an audition at the Royal College of Music, with me turning the pages as he played. The tutor paused when he\u0027d finished and said: \u0027I\u0027m not at all sure you should consider a career as a cellist...\u0027Christopher looked devastated. So did I. The tutor paused again and added: \u0027...unless doing anything else would make you desperately unhappy.\u0027Today, 35 years later, he is a star cellist with a Greek baroque orchestra (the Armonia Atenea), enjoying rave reviews at many of the greatest musical venues in Europe. But his success has not been achieved without pain.I remember the day we were on holiday at our house in Greece. He was in the basement practising, learning to convert from playing a classical cello to playing a baroque instrument. I was upstairs when I heard the music stop abruptly, then a howl of pain followed by silence. I rushed down and Christopher was lying on his back, his face white, clearly in agony.The baroque cello has no spike to balance the instrument on the ground: you must squeeze it between your knees, moving with the rhythm of the music. Christopher had put his back out and it took months to recover.He suffered far more, poor chap, when he tried to teach me to play the cello. He did his best, but it\u0027s fair to say I had no natural talent and eventually gave up. But my brief attempt boosted my love for the instrument, and to this day I can feel a tingle in my upper arms from squeezing them so fiercely as I sat in the front row when Christopher played his first solo: the sublime Elgar Cello Concerto.Elgar wrote it in 1919, after the Great War. Like millions, he was devastated by the slaughter in the trenches, and that pain was conveyed so strongly it has become one of the two cello concertos performed most often since. The other was written by Dvorak.I was in my mid 20s when I first heard the Beethoven Violin Concerto and the slow movement reduced me to tears. It still does.I remember taking a very close friend to a performance at the Royal Festival Hall in London. She had no interest in classical music and no real idea what to expect, but it had precisely the same effect on her as it had on me.There are no tears shed in the audience at another of my favourite pieces: Mozart\u0027s Piano Concerto No. 21. It\u0027s better known now for its glorious second movement, which was used in the theme of the film Elvira Madigan.I\u0027ve no doubt most reasonably sophisticated classical music buffs will pour scorn on me for my populist tastes. But so be it. They have become popular because they are wonderful pieces of music. They make the hair stand up on the back of your neck. Which is why I expect to be playing them on Classic FM next week.On the other side of the ide are those who reject classical music because, they say, they really don\u0027t understand it.If you are one of them, I\u0027d say give it a chance. It will speak to you. Don\u0027t forget: music is the ultimate form of communication.     "},{"url":null,"title":"US Air Force hires French British Russian jets adversary air support contract","story":"Share this article          An Air USA MiG-29UB, one of the fighter jets that will be used in training, pictured above         A Draken International A-4 Skyhawk pictured supporting a US Air Force training exercise under a previous contract.

It\u0027s unclear what the South can do if the North starts destroying them.

Kim said the \u0027refreshing\u0027 buildings of Yangdok County Hot Spring Resort were in striking contrast to Diamond Mountain\u0027s \u0027architecture of capitalist businesses targeting profit-making from roughly built buildings.\u0027Experts are ided over whether the North really intends to independently develop tourism for Diamond Mountain or is pressuring the South to restart the tours and upgrade aging facilities.Some say North Korea would struggle to develop the area on its own under heavy sanctions. Any tours to Diamond Mountain, located on the eastern coast near the inter-Korean border, would be dependent on South Korean travelers as the North\u0027s poor transport links make it difficult to bring Chinese tourists there, said Lim Soo-ho, an analyst from South Korea\u0027s Institute for National Security Strategy.         Kim is trying to create a North Korean tourism industry, with a host of new resorts being built including international airports         An aerial view of the Yangdok County Hot Spring Resort, which was visited by Kim Jong-unSeoul can\u0027t restart the tours or any other major inter-Korean economic activity without defying U.S.-led sanctions against Pyongyang, which have been strengthened since 2016, when the North began speeding up its nuclear and missile tests.The Diamond Mountain tours were a major project of Kim\u0027s father, Kim Jong Il, who gave Hyundai the rights to construct a resort town and operate tours. South Korea\u0027s government and Hyundai have built about a dozen tourist facilities in the area, including hotels, restaurants, and spas, to accommodate the tours that began in 1998.North Korea said it took steps to freeze and confiscate South Korean properties at the resort in 2010 and 2011 while blaming Seoul for continuing its suspension of tours.In a summit last September in Pyongyang, Kim and South Korean President Moon Jae-in vowed to restart South Korean tours to Diamond Mountain and normalize operations at an inter-Korean factory park in Kaesong when possible, voicing optimism that sanctions could end to allow such projects.Kim raised the subject again during his New Year\u0027s speech this year, saying that Pyongyang was ready to restart the projects \u0027without any precondition\u0027 while making a nationalistic call for stronger cooperation between the Koreas.But without a breakthrough in the nuclear talks between Washington and Pyongyang, the economic projects remain shelved. "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c708b5375bf96898406b687cc0ea754e9a3c000f/16_348_5019_3012/master/5019.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=61b164f19d01c5c01de9e918c6994851","title":"sculpture by the sea take an inspired stroll along sydneys coastline in pictures","story":"Spring in Sydney marks the launch of the annual Sculpture by the Sea exhibition, brightening up a 2km stretch of the city’s beaches from Bondi to Tamarama.

On Wednesday and Thursday it was closed intermittently because of the heat, as temperatures went well above 36C.Nevertheless, from early Friday a long line of visitors queued as busloads more cruised the car park. A cheer went up when rangers took down the “high winds” sign mid-morning and allowed tourists to climb in small groups. About 200 people had begun the ascent within half an hour of the opening.An Uluru-Kata Tjuta national park ranger, 28-year-old Tjiangu Thomas, said it was “easy” to wake up this morning knowing the climb was about to close for good.“This is really important for me and for Anangu and for the region. It’s a strong example of Anangu making decisions for their land,” Thomas said.“It’s rather emotional, having elders who picked up this long journey before I was born to close the climb. They’re no longer here, but we’re carrying their legacy to close the climb. So there’s a bit of sadness there, but also happiness knowing that the climb will be closed and respect is going to be given to Anangu’s wishes.“It takes a lot of our resources to manage the climb and it does take away from the cultural value of this place,” Thomas said.At the front of the queue a couple from Adelaide, who did not want to be named, said they would have waited the day to see if they could make the climb, which was “important to them as Australians, because the rock is a symbol for all of us”.Immediately behind them Callie Derks, her daughters, Madison and Georgia, and husband, Noel Derks, said they had done the climb three times before. This time, the family made it a short way up the rock for a “photo opportunity” before they had to leave for the airport.“The views from up there are worth it,” Callie Derks said. “I go up respectfully and don’t stray from where we’re allowed to go,” she said.The Japanese tourist Hikaru Ide from Nagano, who is on a working holiday in Australia, said he had come to Uluru to pay his respects by not climbing. Ide said Uluru was sacred, and to walk around the base was enough.Watching the last of the climbers, the Anangu man Vince Forrester from Mutitjulu said the discoloured and damaged rock along the climbing route was like a scar that would not go away in his lifetime. Forrester said tourists using the top of the rock as a toilet had poisoned waterholes and wildlife, and he was glad the climb would soon be over.Forrester also called for greater involvement of Anangu in the economic opportunities that tourism in the park generates.The climb closes for good after 4pm local time."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/18e8606fb48181f319e4082c825ab7053afc2115/0_0_3894_2336/master/3894.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6961c7cdda321fa2e86888eba535176a","title":"tell us south african cities after apartheid","story":"We would like to speak to people about their views and experiences of city life in the country since the demise of the brutal political regimeThis year marks 25 years since the end of apartheid in South Africa, a brutal political system that enforced the segregation of people of different races.From 1948 to 1994 the ision was formalised by law, ensuring the minority white population controlled wealth and power, while black people were oppressed and stripped of basic rights, such as the right to vote.Twenty-five years after the fall of the brutal apartheid regime, South Africa\u0027s cities remain hugely ided, both economically and racially.

When powerful people say things, too many journalists simply convey them, acting not as critical interlocutors but convenient conduits. The fact that a politician has said something, apparently, makes it news. This is all too often conveyed neat – uncritiqued, unfiltered and unprocessed. It is then injected into the conversational bloodstream caffeinated by social media. It’s as though the act of journalism is limited to getting the quote and distributing, and does not extend to verifying it, contextualising it and making sense of it.When those quotes are non-attributed – “a senior No 10 source” or “sources within the cabinet” – the risk of the journalist becoming an enabler and participant is real. By giving voice to those who are unnamed and, therefore, untraceable, they allow those with an agenda to broadcast it without taking responsibility for it. Mistaking power for perspective and forgoing analysis for access, they can end up not reporting on the machine but making it run more smoothly.This is in effect what happened on Tuesday, as Downing Street became aware that the government would probably win a meaningful vote on the second reading of Boris Johnson’s Brexit deal but could lose the programme motion, and have to concede more time for parliamentary scrutiny. A “Downing Street source” – we do not know who – told journalists that if the government lost on the programme motion it would withdraw the bill and demand an election. Journalists duly tweeted this as though it were a fact.This had a material effect. As the day progressed, the MP Oliver Letwin – who’d lost the Tory whip over his opposition to no deal – responded on Twitter: “Getting seriously worried that HMG will pull Bill if Programme Motion is defeated. Surely best for all of us who regard this deal as the least of the evils to vote for the Programme Motion, whatever we really think of it.”But it was not a fact. It was a ploy. Johnson’s brinkmanship in getting this far had, in effect, been to threaten everybody with everything: making enough Brexit hardliners fear that if they didn’t accept his deal there would be a second referendum and makingenough remain MPs fear that if they didn’t accept his deal there would be no deal.On this thin and fraying thread hung his strategy to push through his deal by the self-imposed deadline of 31 October. But when faced with defeat, the government did not pull the bill. It paused the process. It was an empty threat. The only thing that made it plausible was the uncritical, unattributable reporting of it.Johnson did not invent playing the media in this way – though given his reputation for brazen dishonesty, the media’s gullibility was particularly egregious. But with a general election imminent, it’s worth casting a critical eye over the role journalism is playing in our politics.When the polling industry gave us misleading predictions in the run-up to the 1992 and 2015 elections, it understood that the reputation of the profession was at risk and set up inquiries to work out what had gone wrong. After the Iraq war, several outlets, including the New York Times and the Washington Post, published lengthy internal investigations into why and how they had misread the war’s buildup and the claims over weapons of mass destruction. Despite a series of clear failures, the British media has gone through no such process.Many of the inequalities we see in our political class – its concentration in London, its class and racial bias – are replicated in the media class, shaping what Gramsci termed a prevailing “common sense”. A report by the Sutton Trust and Social Mobility Commission this year shows there’s a higher proportion of Oxbridge graduates writing columns at present than there is sitting in the House of Lords. Between them they settle on a consensus of what, and who, matters and then subject those outside their sphere to coverage that is more akin to anthropology than journalism.The upshot was most clearly witnessed during the 2017 general election, where the prospect of a Labour rout was not so much an opinion as a fact waiting to happen. Minutes before the polls closed, Piers Morgan tweeted his prediction: “Conservatives to win by 90-100 seat majority.” Four minutes later the Sun’s deputy political editor Steve Hawkes shared: “Rumour Tories could be looking at 400 seats.” When the exit poll suggested a hung parliament, in which Labour had actually gained seats and vote share, the televised choreography could not have provided a clearer metaphor. “Well, now let’s go back to the studio to ask those who got everything wrong so far what will happen next.” They still have the mic. There was no reckoning. They are still out there forecasting the future.The mea culpas that followed that debacle were too narrowly tailored. Commentators lamented that they had predicted the wrong result, as though their job was to foresee the future. It wasn’t. The problem was that they had chronically misportrayed the present, mistaking their own political prejudice for the situation they were actually covering.There are important differences between the kind of malpractice behind the cavalier use of unattributed quotes by a few senior journalists, and the wider failure to interrogate and understand the shifts in British politics. The former comes from a place that is craven – suggesting a greater desire to be trusted by those in authority than by readers or viewers. The problem is not that they don’t know how to be sceptical: they were sceptical of Saddam Hussein when he said he had no WMD, or of Mark Duggan’s family when they said he didn’t have a gun. But when it comes to those in power they all too often err on the side of defence and credulity.The latter has been the result of a chronic lack of curiosity, underpinned by crippling cynicism towards new orthodoxies and possibilities. But where the two transgressions meet is in the belief that the establishment is to be trusted, either in its pronouncements or its framing, and always given the space to make its case unchallenged in a world where its legitimacy and credibility is withering away.With attacks on journalists on the rise, when the profession finds itself in the crosshairs of authoritarians, it is important to defend the media and those who work in it from the despot and the populist. Being honest about our shortcomings is central to that defence. In a period of rampant inequality, entrenched ision and diminishing trust, we are most effective when we challenge the powerful, not when we embed ourselves among them."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/da1d098ebcf6723990aada8a167a677293a502f3/0_151_4000_2401/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cdb0306d75cc7e2d1833ccfb84655cb6","title":"tribe next door tv shows","story":"TV shows have moved on from poverty porn to poverty romance, pretending there’s something noble and valuable in going withoutThere are so many ways in which The British Tribe Next Door is offensive that it’s arguably amazing the TV programme ever made it to the screen.The first episode of Channel 4’s series – which sends the British reality TV star Scarlett Moffatt and her family to live with a traditional Namibian tribe, and both sides examine the material excesses of the family’s western lives – has aired to a chorus of outrage from activist groups such as the anti-colonialism group No White Saviors. Chief among its sins is peddling the spectacularly dated myth that all Africans live in mud huts and wear tribal dress. But the crassness of building a replica of the Moffatts’ suburban semi, complete with running water and wifi, in the middle of a tribal village comes a close second. (Is the house going to stay after filming, a strange monument to the days when someone thought this was a good idea? Or will the producers simply demolish it?)Yet this show presumably got commissioned against all the odds because it satisfies a contemporary hunger for simplicity. In a complicated, over-stimulating and sometimes overwhelming western world, there is something seductive about the idea of stripping down and paring back of having not merely fewer possessions but fewer choices – fewer demands on our attention and more time for each other.But beware the urge to romanticise simplicity, all the same. The idea of the noble poor, who by virtue of having nothing somehow achieve a level of enlightenment or moral superiority denied to those wallowing blindly in their creature comforts, has deep historical roots. It’s there in biblical lectures about a camel’s failure to pass through the eye of a needle, and in the personal asceticism of monks or in mediaeval idealisation of the peasant. It’s in the Victorian concept of the “noble savage”, or the idea that primitive peoples uncorrupted by modern civilisation represent some kind of moral ideal, and in the backwoods American romanticism of Henry Thoreau and dreams of a return to living off the land. It’s still there today in every city commuter fantasising about moving to the country and buying chickens, just as it was in their parents glued to The Good Life’s version of suburban self-sufficiency after all, a mud-spattered Tom and Barbara might not have enjoyed the material comforts of Margo and Jerry next door, but despite living off nettle soup, they were clearly happier. Back in 2010, the Conservatives audaciously tapped into the same spirit by portraying their austerity programme as a virtuous, almost enjoyably thrifty, process of cutting back on stuff the nation supposedly didn’t need.Now it’s politics itself that is being simplified, stripped back to easy slogans – take back control, get Brexit done – which belie how impossibly complicated it is in practice. In corporate life the new buzzword is “single-tasking”, or just concentrating on one thing at a time, while Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg has famously reduced his wardrobe to identical grey T-shirts to save time thinking about what to wear in the morning. Even the Duke and Duchess of Sussex apparently long to swap the prying photographers’ lenses and the gilded cage of Buckingham Palace for a vaguely defined but simpler existence somewhere in Africa.Luxury has come to mean less, not more purging, not accumulating. But somewhere along the line we risk forgetting that for most people, less is generally the very opposite of luxurious.The nonsense in Namibia is just an extreme version of the craze for “life swap” shows like Channel 5’s Rich House, Poor House, in which a rich family trades houses and budgets with a low-income one for a week, in a supposed examination of the wealth ide. Invariably, the poor family boggles at the ridiculous amount of money their alter egos burn through every week, before cheerily blowing a fortune on the food shop because for once it’s lovely not to have to think about the cost. Meanwhile, the rich family blanches at their budget before bravely concluding that they can do without his’n’hers massages this week, and actually isn’t it quite jolly to stay in and have a family games night for free? They generally go home chastened to their swimming pool and rolling acres, professing deep respect for how the other half manage and sometimes even vowing to tone it down a bit.We have moved on from shows like Benefit Street, deemed cruel for holding the poor up to ridicule, into shows that use them to teach the rich a lesson. It’s less poverty porn than soft-focus poverty romance – smothering the reality of what it’s like to scrimp week after week under cosy homilies about how money can’t buy happiness. Which is invariably the sort of thing rich people say in order to ease the guilt of knowing that other people are poor.You only have to watch a few episodes to realise why these shows have to end on a cheery teachable moment otherwise, the overall effect would be somewhere between intolerably bleak and enraging. It never seems fair that the kids in one family are spoilt while in the other they’re struggling, and it’s deeply uncomfortable to watch children who have tasted a very different kind of life sent back to their tiny shared bedrooms. The only way to defuse the situation is to pretend there’s something noble and valuable about poverty, as if to go without was some kind of precious gift.So beware the cult of simplicity, at least when it glosses over things that need to be complicated. Even a simple life is rarely as simple as it looks."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0da52b33fd17c69849835c6a4ae7789219b17ddf/92_304_3314_1989/master/3314.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b97e67fead2ee3a916f0b65c5647c3d8","title":"auckland castle durham to open after restoration","story":"Three-year renovation has returned building to its Georgian gothic splendourA magnificent and historically important castle that is the centrepiece of one of the UK’s most eye-catching cultural regeneration projects will open to the public next week after a three-year restoration project.Auckland Castle was a palace for the prince bishops of Durham, surrogate kings who governed the north of England for more than 750 years.It was bought from the Church of England by wealthy investment banker Jonathan Ruffer in 2012. The price included the castle’s contents, not least a spectacular series of paintings, Jacob and his 12 Sons, by the Spanish painter Francisco de Zurbarán.The castle has become the heart of the Auckland Project, which is using art, faith, history and heritage to transform the quiet and – since closure of the mines – rundown town of Bishop Auckland in to a leading tourist destination.The castle’s three-year restoration project, with £12.4m of National Lottery money, has focused upon returning the castle to its Georgian gothic splendour.David Madden, chief executive of the Auckland Project, said the reopening on 2 November would be a huge day. “This is a very big moment for us – it puts us on the map and there is more to come.”Visitors to the castle will learn about the various bishops who have lived and entertained at Auckland Castle over the centuries.The interior walls are more vibrantly coloured than some might imagine lilac, pink, a cheery blue.“It’s not what people would expect of Georgian interiors,” said Clare Baron, head of interpretation and exhibitions. “We think of Jane Austen and pale and restrained but actually the interiors were quite gaudy. When we read a description, blue and crimson curtains with pink walls, we thought: ‘will that work?’ But it does seem to.”The long dining room with the Zurbaráns was about to be painted red before a crucial receipt was found indicating the room would have been green.The internationally important paintings have returned to Auckland Castle after a tour to the Meadows Museum in Dallas, the Frick Collection in New York and the Israel Museum in Jerusalem, where they have been seen by more than 390,000 people.Among the surprises during the restoration was the discovery of a Tudor fireplace in a lift shaft and a whole wall of historic late 19th-century wallpaper in the morning room. The unusual pattern, of a brown and blue exotic plant, is entirely fictitious, botanic experts have decided.Visitors are also told about the more recent, less authoritarian, bishops of Durham who have lived at the castle such as David Jenkins, a regular character on Spitting Image, dismissively called the “cuckoo in the establishment nest” by Margaret Thatcher.Ian Ramsey, a 1960s bishop, is shown in a Tyne Tees documentary visiting a trendy boutique and joking how his cassock is basically a maxi-skirt.Other visitor offerings from the Auckland Projects include a deer park, a viewing tower, a gallery for temporary art shows, and a nearby mining art gallery. Opposite are hoardings in front of a former bank and school proclaiming “Spanish art gallery opening soon”. There will also be a faith museum, a new shop, hotel and restaurant, and in time a revamped Roman fort destination.Bishop Auckland is also home to the Ruffer-backed Kynren, which stages thrilling London Olympics-style live shows telling Britain’s history.It all makes for a compelling if unusual offer for tourists, one which does not follow any known model. “We keep looking,” said Madden. “We are a young organisation and really keen to learn from others – we are very alert to that – but there is no single thing that we’ve come across that allows us to say: ‘that’s us and they’re years ahead and this is what we should do.’”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bc0f8385e421753efcece36d2c66a6785a9bc921/0_127_4612_2767/master/4612.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=71500187cb82888907dbe4bc03baa38e","title":"guardian editors climate emergency pledge","story":"Editors from across the  explain how they are putting the climate emergency front and centreThe climate crisis is a story that reaches every corner of the world and on the international news desk our team of correspondents report on it from around the globe.For many readers, it is something they experience to varying degrees of intensity at first hand – a hotter summer, an earlier spring, floods in autumn – but by linking up those experiences, we are able to show how interconnected this crisis is.In the past few months we have covered stories ranging from the record-breaking European heatwave, where temperatures of over 45C were recorded in France for the first time, a heatwave and drought in India, where thousands abandoned their homes, and the unprecedented Arctic wildfires that could be seen from space.Such events are not just “weather”, however, and we follow their impact: the buckling European road and rail infrastructure not suitable for the new climate era, the desperate search for water in Chennai and the Greenland residents traumatised by the climate emergency as life becomes more precarious and social problems such as alcoholism intensify.In Italy, the Planpincieux glacier in the Mont Blanc massif is changing so rapidly that avalanches and debris falls have led to deaths and evacuations, leaving residents in the town of Courmayeur fearing how much longer it will hold.Our reporters have also travelled to where governments and iniduals are making it worse. Latin American correspondent Tom Philips took a 2,000km journey through the Amazon to see the new age of wrecking ushered in by Brazil’s president, Jair Bolsonaro, where the environmental agency is being dismantled and gold seekers and soy farmers anticipate an economic boom from deforestation.There are also those attempting to make it better. On 1 September 2018 we published an interview from Stockholm with a 15-year-old who just two weeks earlier, after Sweden’s hottest ever summer, had gone on strike from school in protest at the lack of action by politicians on the climate crisis. Now much better known, thanks in part to articles like this, Greta Thunberg’s solo protest has since become a global movement.Climate can also lie at the root of other stories. Failed harvests and rising food prices can often be the final straw that triggers political upheaval, in recent years notably the Arab spring, but we are now seeing in real time how the climate emergency is affecting migration patterns. As Donald Trump attempted to close the US border to Central American migrants, in some cases separating children from their parents, we spoke to those in Guatemala who after a decade of intense droughts and late rains have seen crops fail and wages fall one too many times. “I have to find a way to travel north, or else my children will suffer even more,” subsistence farmer Esteban Gutiérrez told reporter Nina Lakhani.Business and economics are right at the centre of the climate emergency. Companies are among the biggest polluters in the world – and are key to meeting the Paris agreement’s target of limiting global warming to 1.5C.From giant fossil fuel companies to agricultural and food businesses, retailers, airlines and car manufacturers – all must make big changes, for the sake of the planet, the global economy and their own future sustainability, providing goods and services and employment.These are huge questions, and  readers know there are no easy answers. So we will nurture the debate on what a sustainable economy looks like.Our economics writers are questioning whether traditional capitalism, which aims for perpetual growth, can ever deal with the huge challenges of climate emergency, or whether a new slow-capitalism or green growth – which does not pursue profit at all costs – must come.We are reporting on the changes being made by corporate executives – and alerting readers to those who fall short.Writing in the  earlier this year, the governors of the Bank of England and Bank of France – Mark Carney and François Villeroy de Galhau – underlined the importance of change. “If some companies and industries fail to adjust to this new world, they will fail to exist,” they said.Without action, the climate emergency poses the risk of huge losses for insurance companies as a result of catastrophic weather-related events. Last year’s Californian wildfires, for instance – the worst in the state’s history – cost insurers more than $12bn. Banks that have lent vast sums to fossil fuel companies could be left with mammoth losses if those investments decline in value and become “stranded assets”. The Bank of England has warned that as much as $20tn of assets could be wiped out by climate change if the problem is not addressed.Many companies are making changes. Global businesses including Nestle and L’Oreal have committed to reducing their carbon emissions to zero. We will track and report on their progress.We are reporting on climate crisis initiatives, and our journalists will ask if they go far enough. Last week we reported that British Airways is to offset all emissions from domestic flights from next year, and questioned whether offsetting can ever be the answer.Our reporters will expose companies that are not walking the talk. Last month Amazon announced a series of initiatives, from putting 100,000 electric vans on the road to handle its deliveries to reforestation projects. But, as our reporters also revealed recently, Amazon has also recently introduced plastic packaging that cannot be recycled in the UK.Most corporate bosses know they have to make changes. But progress is nowhere near fast enough. Oil companies are still seeking new oilfields. Giant new coalmines – like Indian billionaire Gautam Adani’s Carmichael coalmine in Queensland – are still being developed. Airbus recently predicted that the number of aircraft in the sky would double in the next 20 years.Investment groups that manage pension funds around the world can exert pressure on companies to clean up their businesses. Legal \u0026amp General, Europe’s second biggest fund manager, admitted earlier this year: “The effects of climate change will soon be irreversible. This will affect economies, politics and, as a result, our clients’ assets all around the world. We all need to move faster.”However, not every investment group is using its muscle – and we are calling them out. BlackRock, the world’s biggest investment manager, with $6tn under its management, says climate change is a big risk to the value of its investments. But it remains at the heart of fossil fuel investing and, as we reported, its chief executive, Larry Fink, still insists that BlackRock’s job is to make a profit for investors. He added: “Our personal views on environmental or social issues don’t matter.”They do matter, and our reporters are now treating the climate crisis as the default setting for how they approach business reporting.Fashion is about the zeitgeist, and climate change is the mostimportant issue of our age. And we know that our readers really *do* care. (Sorry, Melania.) So more than ever before, we want to put sustainability front and centre of our fashion coverage.We aren’t perfect and we don’t pretend to have all the answers. Wewill continue to listen to a wide range of voices – our readersparamount amongst those – to guide us. But we do know that we want to talk about sustainability how we have always talked about fashion – in a way that includes everyone in the conversation, whatever their age, budget, gender or background.We have always championed ethical fashion brands, but now we want to go further. The future of our planet isn’t a niche interest. We aim to continue creating fashion content that is accessible and appealing, desirable and democratic – but now with sustainability as a fundamental metric. We want to inspire our audience to enjoy fashion while being mindful of the impact on the planet.What does that look like? We try wherever we can to include vintagepieces in shoots and gift guides. When we report from London fashion week we talk to the Extinction Rebellion activists outside the shows, as well as having backstage chats with the designers. We championed Secondhand September and a year ago we updated my column in Weekend magazine so that you now see me wearing old clothes from my own wardrobe, and vintage pieces, alongside new clothes. This party season we will be reporting the best places to rent your dress, or source it pre-worn, rather than buy it.None of this means compromising on bringing you compelling, gorgeous, original fashion content. We are passionate about the latest fashion – and about the future of our planet, too.There’s an obvious connection between food and the climate emergency. Look at the deforestation of the Amazon to provide grazing for cattle and soy to feed it. But wherever cows are raised, they generate atmosphere-heating methane. As the global human population grows, it’s clear that we need to think about how to feed it, how to use land and what impact our choices have.Meat eating and animal farming have seized the headlines and the public’s focus. There are many reasons why veganism – or at least flexitarianism – is growing fast and sustainability is one of them.It’s important to talk about all this but what people eat is always going to be a highly personal decision. In many countries where we have the luxury of food options, we are in anxious, uncertain, ided times. Food is joyful. It brings people together – families, friends, communities and strangers – and reminds us both of our uniqueness and of what we have in common. It’s also a time when it’s difficult to know who to believe and to trust. I hope people can be sure of the ."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/afe269d9ec06740a551d25fa8d8e07c902892cd2/0_260_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=08d6b0d86d0b03a66ff9f5ee4bdec8e2","title":"guardian climate pledge 2019 images pictures guidelines","story":" picture editor Fiona Shields explains why we are going to be using fewer polar bears and more people to illustrate our coverage of the climate emergency At the  we want to ensure that the images we publish accurately and appropriately convey the climate crisis that we face. Following discussions among editors about how we could change the language we use in our coverage of environmental issues, our attention then turned to images. We have been working across the organisation to better understand how we aim to visually communicate the impact the climate emergency is having across the world.Our goal is to provide guidelines for anyone working with images at the . We are also asking the agencies and photographers we work with to provide images that are appropriate to the changing narrative.The concern over how best to depict the climate emergency led us to seek advice from the research organisation Climate Visuals, who have found that “images that define climate change shape the way it is understood and acted upon”.It was important to address our own use of images and understand the processes that lead to image selection for our environmental and weather stories. When given a story, a picture editor or subeditor may have a short time to choose an image from our database, which is why the availability and prominence of climate crisis photography is a key element in the process. It can also be difficult for photographers to capture images that reflect global heating, weather patterns and wildlife extinction, especially when trying to depict what cannot always be seen.We know, from years of experience, that people love polar bears and pandas, so it is easy to see how these appealing creatures have become the emblems for the topics of endangered species and what we previously termed as global warming. Often, when signalling environmental stories to our readers, selecting an image of a polar bear on melting ice has been the obvious – though not necessarily appropriate – choice. These images tell a certain story about the climate crisis but can seem remote and abstract – a problem that is not a human one, nor one that is particularly urgent.So it made sense when we heard that research conducted by the team at Climate Visuals has shown that people respond to human pictures and stories. Images that show emotion and pictures of real situations make the story relevant to the inidual. Rather than choosing, say, an image of a smoke stack pumping out pollution or a forest on fire, such as this: … we should consider showing the direct impact of environmental issues on people’s daily lives as well as trying to indicate the scale of the impact, such as these:In the UK, the weather is a national preoccupation and as such a subject of tradition for British newspapers. People enjoying a sunny holiday weekend, or a fresh fall of snow at home or abroad can deliver some delightful and beautiful images:But as we have reported, the science tells us a much more sinister story of regular heatwaves and unseasonal weather being a defining indicator of the climate crisis. So, although scenes of children playing in fountains and everyone racing to the beach can be uplifting and irresistible, we have to be mindful of the tone of our journalism. This summer, the British media published dramatic headlines issuing climate warnings and covered in detail the negative impact of the crisis, but the images were typically of people taking pleasure in the environment. The contradiction in messaging, between the headlines and imagery, can undermine the effect of the reporting and how we perceive the risks.In June this year we published a picture gallery on the heatwave across Europe. In its original form, this was of a lighter tone, but we felt on reflection this was wrong and disregarded the current context, so we amended the publication to include images that covered a range of human experience of the extraordinary temperatures.The photographer Brook Mitchell made an impactful series about the drought in Australia affecting families in New South Wales, which we published as a photo essay in July. The environmental scenes of the scorched landscape were striking, as were the suffering animals, but the portraits and stories of the people battling the catastrophe really anchored the piece and drove the level of engagement.It is an example of how, as picture editors and photographers, we are having to think again about finding the right focus. Many of the impacts to communities, bioersity, agriculture, water and food supply represent the escalating crisis our planet faces, yet visually they can be far more challenging to depict. We need new imagery for new narratives. This can be challenging in a fast-paced newsroom but it is important to be nuanced and creative with search terms to unearth photography beyond the usual keywords of climate change, heatwave and floods.As our stories make a journey from their initial point of publication through the various networks of social media we also have to be mindful of how the image is connected to the headline. We have to consider that the two must work together to allow the reader to make a broad sense of the article often simply at a glance. Relatable images that are not overly abstract have become a good choice.However, in its simplest form, getting the emotional tone of imagery in line with the issue is critical, rather than the visual overload of society universally having fun in the sun. We hope that if we keep having these conversations, we will be able to have even more of an impact with our climate coverage, and others will follow suit.If you are a journalist, a photographer or work with other news organisations depicting the climate crisis, please contact membershipeditorial@ to join our conversation."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6aa18d2a32dce609d4eb036565424fe22b3b0a8f/0_78_4256_2553/master/4256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=75e821f5ce30ae6fcdc4646cb012cff8","title":"guardian climate pledge 2019 air travel advice","story":" travel editor Andy Pietrasik explains how a flexitarian approach can enable us to enjoy exploring the planet without increasing our carbon footprintWe recently published a guide to Helsinki in which we gave details of how to get there and back without flying. In the comments below the article, a reader wrote: “I think you have to concede that it’s a little disingenuous to pretend that people will be going to Helsinki by train and boat … very few will be willing to allocate six days of the holiday just for the journey. It’s simply not a practical suggestion.”The rise of low-cost flights over the past 20 or so years means we have become so accustomed to flying everywhere for our holidays and short breaks that the idea of taking so long over a journey has become unthinkable. We expect to maximise our time in a location and minimise our time in transit. But maybe that has to change.Another reader put this into context: “In the 70s it was customary to travel around Europe by train (or bus, or hitchhiking). I’ve travelled between Finland and the UK many times by train, and it is quite a pleasant experience.”Travel can have a magical transformation on iniduals and communities. We hope through our pages to encourage people to explore the world, to discover, first-hand, locations they may only have read about in history books or novels to open themselves up to new experiences and tastes to meet people with different ideas and perspectives to try out alternative lifestyles to immerse themselves in beautiful landscapes to have fun. Our writers tap into the joy of new experiences, whether it’s the exhilaration of swimming through a city, as our writer did in Basel, or the thrill of tackling Ireland’s Big Five adventures. And we know that our readers are adventurous and well-travelled because every week we feature their tips from around the world. But we also recognise the need to help tackle the climate emergency by reducing the number of flights we all take. Environment journalist John Vidal explored the dilemma that “people like me, cursed with loving travel” now face, when he reported on the Swedish concept of “flygskam”, or fly shame. And he referred to people applying the idea of the “flexitarian” diet – where they cut back on their meat consumption dramatically but not completely – to flying.The majority of locations we feature in the ’s weekly travel section do not rely on flying to get there, with most easily accessible by train and public transport. These range from Greek island-hopping odysseys to cycling holidays through Europe and city breaks served by train or ferries.Our Local’s Guide series is one of the most popular and widely read features because each one is written by a local resident in the spirit of showing a visitor around their favourite affordable haunts, rather than the big-ticket attractions. Food and drink is probably the easiest way into another culture, and there can be no better recommendation for somewhere to eat and drink than from someone who lives there. We’ve been tapping in to local people’s tips since Twitter started more than 10 years ago, and have found bloggers all around Europe to compile lists of their favourite cheap places to eat and drink.On our website, we have a long list of guides to alternative cities – Łódź, Genoa and Utrecht, Berne, Burgos and Bristol, for example – rather than perennial hotspots affected by overtourism, such as Barcelona, Amsterdam and Venice.One of the benefits of flying less, of course, is the opportunity it affords to explore the rich and varied landscapes of our own islands. Over the summer, we ran a popular series of stories called car-free coast, in which the writer Phoebe Taplin explored the British seaside on foot and by bus. An avowed public transport enthusiast and non-flyer, Dixe Wills, shared 20 of his favourite campsites accessible by train and bus. And Kevin Rushby set out on a UK expedition to less-visited locations that would have been impossible or prohibitively expensive to get to by car.We still occasionally run stories on long-haul destinations when there is an important initiative or project that benefits the environment or local community, such as the development of community-led tourism startups in Chilean Patagonia following the launch of new national parks in the world’s most ambitious rewilding project.Tourism accounts for one in 10 of the world’s jobs and is vital to some destinations. Kevin Rushby, our principal travel writer, explains: “All around the world, people in disadvantaged communities have been working to set up projects that rely on tourism, and so flying. I’ve met hunters who’ve become wildlife guides, fishermen who are now ing instructors, farmers who get cash for showing visitors their land and life. In Kenya the great migration route has been saved by Maasai herders clubbing their land together as conservancies rather than selling to hoteliers and intensive farming interests. Those conservancies are reliant on overseas visitors who pay to see wildlife.”The Travel website now also features a carbon calculator, and we have written about various carbon offsetting schemes – which allow people to balance out their carbon footprints by investing in clean energy projects such as solar or windfarms. Our travel section is printed and distributed in the UK but our articles online are read by a worldwide audience, so in some instances readers do not need to fly to the places we are writing about.John Vidal’s article about reducing the number of flights we take quotes Kevin Anderson, professor of energy and climate change at the Tyndall centre in Manchester: “I don’t have a no-fly policy, but rather a fly-less one … If we are going to fly, it should be for truly extraordinary and important reasons. Otherwise we shouldn’t go, or we should take a slower form of travel and arrange for a longer visit.”Returning to that article on Helsinki, there’s another Scandinavian lifestyle trend that has emerged as a positive counterbalance to “flygskam”, and that is “tagskryt” (train brag). Another reader of the article captured its spirit perfectly in the comment: “The journey is the holiday. Just think of all the places you see along the way.”Because, of course, we’ve been doing long-distance slow travel since the 1970s, as was pointed out. That was the decade when the Interrail scheme was launched. And, as Wills said when he revisited the Interrail experience this summer after a 30-year gap: “How many of us have cherished memories of zipping inexpensively across Europe – delving into new and thrillingly esoteric cultures, befriending the locals, mangling their language beyond all comprehension, and enjoying all manner of mind-broadening episodes.”That is the spirit of adventure we hope you take away with you after reading the travel section."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3858d96ea129929c09d1781ed401f522605d3b80/218_2651_3014_1809/master/3014.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=32a34a700de9e45906839302b85b17e9","title":"have you spotted any new buds or flowers in october","story":"If you have seen any plants flowering unusually this month, we would like to see your photosAccording to former  environment correspondent Paul Brown, “new research published in Geophysical Research letters show that so-called “cold” days in European winters are on average 3C warmer than 70 years ago”.Some people have reported seeing new flower buds in the unseasonal temperatures, leading to worries the flowers will be killed by the winter weather and may not bloom again in spring.If you have seen any plants with new buds or flowers appearing we would like to hear from you.When did you first see them and do you have any concerns about what it might mean for them come spring?

This clean energy boom would easily meeting the current global demand for electricity of 23,000 terrawatt hours.The study predicts offshore wind will grow 15 fold to emerge as a $1tn (£780bn) industry in the next 20 years and will prove to be the next great energy revolution. The next generation of floating turbines capable of operating further away from the shore could generate enough energy to meet the world’s total electricity demand 11 times over in 2040, according to IEA estimates.The report predicts that the EU’s offshore wind capacity will grow from almost 20 gigawatts today to nearly 130 gigawatts by 2040 and could reach 180 gigawatts with stronger climate commitments.In China, the growth of offshore wind was likely to be even more rapid, said the IEA. Its offshore wind capacity is forecast to grow from 4 gigawatts to 110 gigawatts by 2040 or 170 gigawatts if it adopts tougher climate targets.Birol said offshore wind would not only contribute to generating clean electricity, but could also offer a major opportunity in the production of hydrogen, which can be used in place of fossil fuel gas for heating and in heavy industry.The process of making hydrogen from water uses huge amounts of electricity but abundant, cheap offshore wind power could help produce a low-cost, zero-carbon alternative to gas.In the North Sea, energy companies are already planning to use the electricity generated by giant offshore windfarms to turn seawater into hydrogen on a floating “green hydrogen” project, backed by the UK government. The clean-burning gas could be pumped back to shore to heat millions of homes by the 2030s. The UK has committed to reaching net zero carbon emissions by 2050.The overlap between the UK’s declining oil and gas industry and the burgeoning offshore wind sector could offer major economic benefits for the UK, Birol said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7dc65f053742b02d3160397d4d36fe99a9b0657b/0_91_3200_1922/master/3200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=826779dc4eee8ad1a1f5463920566fc0","title":"citizen army needed to tackle invasive species mps suggest","story":"Environmental committee says government funding ‘fails to match scale of threat’A citizen army is needed to help tackle invasive species that threaten the natural environment and in some cases human health, MPs have said.The cost to the economy of non-native species taking hold in the UK is estimated to be £1.8bn a year, a report from the environmental audit committee says.Among their recommendations, they call for an army of 1.3 million volunteers to be trained across the country to identify and respond to the threat from non-native species, in a scheme modelled on one developed in New Zealand.The report says urgent action is needed to slow the rate of arrival of invasive species and prevent them from becoming established. It estimates that about 40 non-native species will become invasive within the next 20 years.The report says ministers have missed the legal targets on tackling invasive species and have failed to give the threat the same priority and funding as animal and plant health regimes.Invasive non-native species are those that have been moved as a result of human activity. They are considered one of the top five threats to the natural environment.Invasive species and their effects currently in the UK include:Labour’s Mary Creagh, the chair of the committee, said: “If we’re to beat this, we need people power, with an army of volunteers trained to spot and stop an invasive species before it becomes established.“We’re witnessing changes, from climate change, that put the future of our natural landscape at risk. Oak processionary moth caterpillars can strip an oak tree bare, as well as posing a hazard to our own health. We face losing half of the UK’s native ash trees to ash dieback within a century, costing £15bn. New regulations to halt their progress are welcome but they are too little, too late. Government funding to tackle invasive species is tiny and fails to match the scale of the threat.”Richard Benwell, the chief executive of Wildlife and Countryside Link, said: “These invaders can choke out native species, spread disease and strangle industry. Yet the government’s defences against invasive species are decades behind animal and plant health security. It’s time to dedicate the funds and personnel needed to hold the line to defend wildlife.”The UK has one of the highest numbers of invasive species in the world, MPs on the committee heard in evidence.A significant increase in the numbers of invasive species across the globe is attributed to a threefold increase in travel and a rise in air and sea transport of goods. The species arrive in the UK in a variety of ways, including by attaching themselves to the hulls of ships or “hitchhiking” within ballast water, as contaminants of ornamental plants, or on fishing equipment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1d829c498ae228a4c65db4521a734d0305f71eb5/795_320_4883_2930/master/4883.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fad1badfb94b6547a9e8e34ba9e3ad46","title":"world lemur day a photo essay by bristol zoological society","story":"Friday is World Lemur Day. Lemurs are the earth’s most threatened larger group of mammals there are more than 100 species and almost all are under threat of extinction. Bristol Zoological Society has been studying lemurs and working on their conservation in north-west Madagascar for over 10 years Lemur species vary enormously in their size, appearance and behaviour, from the strange-looking nocturnal aye-aye to the sideways-leaping Coquerel’s sifaka. All species are endemic to the island of Madagascar, where they are under severe threat from fragmentation and loss of their forest habitat, due to logging, subsistence agriculture and forest fires, and are also at risk from hunting and the rapid recent increase in the human population.Crowned lemurs are classified as endangered and are found only in the far north of Madagascar, making them susceptible to extinction. They get their name from the bright orange crown pattern that males and females have on top of their heads. One of the most unusual-looking primates, Coquerel’s sifakas are leaf-eaters from the dry north-western forests of Madagascar. Sifakas are perhaps best known for their unique upright, leaping run, using their back legs to propel themselves along the ground or to leap up to 20 feet from one tree to the next.Very little is known about this critically endangered species and it is not kept in any zoo, but researchers from Bristol Zoological Society and the universities of Bristol and Turin found that it uses the alarm calls of birds and other lemurs to detect the presence of predators. These lemurs roost during the day, often in exposed locations such as tree holes, and therefore risk falling victim to predators from the air and the ground.The aye-aye is the largest nocturnal primate, easily recognisable for its unusual appearance – a long, thin middle finger, continuously growing fused teeth, yellow eyes, big ears and a long, bushy tail. Their major threats are forest degradation and fragmentation, slash-and-burn subsistence agriculture and local communities that believe the aye-aye is an evil omen and often kill them when they are near their villages. Exact numbers remaining in the wild are unknown but aye-ayes are rare. Bristol Zoo Gardens has a breeding group in its nocturnal house.Ring-tailed lemurs are classified as endangered on the IUCN red list of threatened species. In the wild, they are only found in the dry forests and bush of southern Madagascar. The wild population is declining and most live in small fragmented forests. Habitat destruction is the biggest threat to the survival of all lemur species.The blue-eyed black lemur (or Sclater’s lemur) is classified as critically endangered, due to hunting and habitat loss. There are thought to be just a few thousand left. These lemurs all have striking blue eyes, but males and females look very different males are completely black, while females have a reddish-brown coat. Bristol Zoological Society works with local Malagasy organisations to protect these animals in the wild.The Lake Alaotra gentle lemur is the only primate that lives exclusively in wetlands. Despite legal protection efforts, the population has been declining continuously since the first published census in the 1990s. They now number about 2,500 iniduals, due to poaching and annual marshland burning. Reconnecting isolated subpopulations is a priority conservation measure.This highly distinctive black-and-white animal is the only lemur that communicates through long, complex songs, including a group chorus. Numbers are declining due to habitat destruction for slash-and-burn agriculture, logging and fuelwood gathering, all in protected areas. Illegal hunting is also a major threat, despite the traditional tribal taboos that used to protect them in some villages, the skins are worn as clothing and the meat fetches a premium price.The Sambirano mouse lemur is one of the smallest primates in the world and is only found at a few sites in the north-west of Madagascar. We know very little about this species, but it seems to prefer to live in secondary forest, trees along water courses and the forest edge. It is believed this is because the vegetation in these locations is denser and offers more places for these tiny animals to hide."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c360b6db88dd12f0f8eafa47bba9c28f98bf0c38/0_0_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=393fa324178e44eddef16bb0d0466dbf","title":"the guardians climate pledge 2019","story":"We want the  to play a leading role in reporting on the environmental catastrophe.

In a situation like this, I don’t want people to feel comfortable.”Bachman, along with fellow comedian Amber Rollo and actor Zoe Stuckless, confronted the disgraced producer, who has been accused by more than 80 women of rape, sexual assault and harassment, at an event called Actors Hour on Wednesday night.Weinstein was in attendance, sitting at a table along with several young women and two body guards.“I’m a comic, and it’s our job to name the elephant in the room,” she said, in a video posted on her social media accounts. “It’s a Freddy Krueger in the room, if you will. I didn’t realize I needed to bring my own mace and rape whistle to Actors Hour.”Members of the audience booed her, and shouted “shut up”, to which Bachman responded, “Sorry, that killed at group therapy for rape survivors”.At intermission, Struckless and Rollo approached Weinstein at his table. “Nobody’s going to say anything? Nobody’s really going to say anything?” Struckless screamed, in a video posted on their Facebook page.“His bodyguards herded me out,” Struckless said in a post. “When I left the building, crying out of fury and frustration I was quickly surrounded by a group of mostly women who expressed the same fear to raise their voice that I had. They thanked me for speaking up.”Weinstein, who posted $1m bail after being arrested on rape charges, has appeared in public only a few times in recent months.In a statement to Business Insider, the producer’s publicist Juda Engelmayer said: “Harvey Weinstein was out with friends enjoying the music and trying to find some solace in his life that has been turned upside down. This scene was uncalled for, downright rude and an example of how due process today is being squashed by the public, trying to take it away in the courtroom too.”Weinstein has denied all accusations of non-consensual sex.Engelmayer did not immediately respond to ’s request for comment.Bachman said she had been overwhelmed by support from strangers online and fellow comedians since she confronted Weinstein, though things had “been a little crazy”. A rape survivor herself, Bachman recently produced a show called ‘Rape Jokes: By Survivors’.“I was really feeling triggered and in a state of flight or fight,” she said of her experience at Actors Hour. “But I felt like I had to say something.”“We shouldn’t be accepting that this monster can just come attend an industry showcase,” she said. “I wanted to make people feel uncomfortable about it. And I just hope people stay uncomfortable.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/07f07a2f8c8ad527669a78e74e96e387e6cd53bb/0_64_3320_1992/master/3320.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4d424d0044691ac009d1778b0432e309","title":"hoop dreams review basketball doc slam dunks the power of hope","story":"This heartfelt and affecting film follows two teenagers chasing scholarships that hold out the chance of a brighter futureTwenty-five years ago, documentary-maker Steve James had a sensational success with his engrossing and moving film Hoop Dreams, now on rerelease in the UK. It was his epic three-hour study of two African American boys from tough neighbourhoods in Chicago: Arthur Agee and William Gates, whose heartbreakingly open, intelligent, trusting and hopeful faces beamed out from the screen. James boiled down 250 hours of footage shot over five years, showing them growing up from 14 to 19 years old both basketball-mad, both hoping for basketball scholarships to college and to a dimly perceived better life after that, maybe even being actual super-rich-and-famous basketball stars in the NBA.Hoop Dreams received the kind of passionate response that Michael Apted had got for his Seven Up! documentary TV series or that Richard Linklater would later get for his real time coming-of-age epic Boyhood. It was famously championed by the legendary film writer Roger Ebert, who argued fiercely for it to get an Oscar nomination (Steve James repaid the compliment with his own celebratory documentary about Ebert, Life Itself, in 2014) and Hoop Dreams struck a chord in the early years of the hopeful Clinton 1990s. It is candid enough about poverty, crime, drugs, fractured families and about racial tension, especially when Agee and Gates get a scholarship to the prestigious and predominately white St Joseph High School in Illinois, famed for its basketball and for its star alumnus, Isaiah Thomas. There is also a jaw-dropping look at a “basketball house” at a junior college: a very grim accommodation block reserved for basketball scholars (that is, black students) – a highly unfortunate, ghettoised institution.But the film is not about racism as such it is not angry and racist cops do not play a part, and there isn’t a rap soundtrack. Hoop Dreams was realistic but it certainly did not rule out the possibility of these boys simply and uncontentiously making a success of their lives through the classic route of college education — and of course sports are a huge part of that. It is that hope which unlocked people’s hearts in 1994 and will do so again I think in 2019, despite the fact that Googling these boys’ names for their situation now reveals something darker and more complicated.Quite early on in the filming process, James must have realised that he had a great story on his hands: Gates and Agee got scholarships to the same posh school. But Agee’s schoolroom grades weren’t good enough – and he had to quit. But as his own family darkly hint: if he was doing better on the basketball court, then the school would have found a way not to worry about his fees. So poor Arthur has to go to a much rougher and more down-at-heel school, with his confidence having taken an almighty bash.But wouldn’t you just know it: Arthur’s basketball prowess in this underdog school in an underdog team starts surging back up. Meanwhile, back at St Joe’s, things are difficult for William. Some things look different now. The TV show with cigar-smoking white sports reporters making their judgments on which kids are going to be big stars looked funny in 1994. Now there is something a bit seedy about it. Could Steve James make Hoop Dreams now, in the age of #blacklivesmatter when the idea of “dreams” looks more naive than any time since the 1970s? Perhaps a white film-maker would be self-conscious of doing anything of the sort. But perhaps James’s biggest achievement is his unshowy emphasis on the poetry of basketball itself: the jump shot, the slam-dunk, ecstatic physical expressions of pure transcendental success."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a2b2b1ce0395cd1c5d778bafe8f368e539b337fd/279_811_4842_2905/master/4842.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f9aa36a12176dfdecceeecedf847af23","title":"burnley miracle premier league success story poorest owner","story":"A Frenchman, a Spaniard and two Belgians walk into a pub in Burnley. There is no punchline. The four are drinking in the Royal Dyche before Burnley’s win over Everton and their presence gives a little demonstration of the impact close to four years of Premier League football and seven years of Sean Dyche have had on a club that takes neither for granted. Whether others outside Turf Moor recognise the scale of achievement is open to question.“A number of years ago I used to think: ‘Does anyone recognise the enormity of where this club was to where it is now?’” admits Dyche, who will mark seven years as Burnley manager on Wednesday. “But I’m really not that precious about it now. The staff, the players, the board and chief exec know what we do and I think the fans do too. They are the important parties. We work authentically and honestly.” Qualities that might appear unfashionable amid the glitz of the Premier League have made Burnley something of a role model.Stephane Blach, Camilo Guerra, Bernard Brasseur and Laurent Titeux are the overseas visitors for the Everton game. Work colleagues in Luxembourg, the four take in two Premier League matches over one weekend every year and have chosen Burnley for the second season running because, they insist, the atmosphere inside Turf Moor is superior to most other stadiums visited. And because they love the Royal Dyche, re-named last year after a joke about celebrating the Burnley manager if he took the club into Europe became a promise.There can be no greater honour for the man whose face adorns the claret and sky blue walls, the Henry VIII-style sign above the door and has even been carved into a tree stump in the beer garden. “I don’t think we would have heard of Burnley if it wasn’t for the club being in the Premier League,” admits Guerra. “We went to London for a few years, then Manchester and from there we discovered Burnley. It is amazing here. The people are super friendly.”The four are staying the weekend in Manchester, where they watch City’s defeat to Wolves the day after Jeff Hendrick’s winner against Everton lifted Burnley briefly into fourth in the richest league on the planet. Burnley can not compete with Manchester or Liverpool as a draw for football tourists, nor does it measure itself that way, and the town centre is relatively quiet – numerous empty shops on St James’s Street reflecting the problems on the high street nationwide – considering a Premier League game is an hour from kicking off nearby. Yet its football club continues to thrive, not merely survive.Burnley’s Barnfield training ground, its pitches once prone to flooding, has been rebuilt and brought into the 21st century at a cost of over £10m. The club’s last published accounts, for 2017-18, showed a record profit of £45m and no outstanding bank or directors’ loans. A turnover of £139m was the joint 13th highest in the Premier League but only two clubs had a smaller wage bill than Burnley’s £82m. Wages have since increased but to progress in a league where Manchester United’s turnover and wage bills were £590m and £296m respectively in 2017-18, and to do so for four seasons (one season more than Jimmy Adamson’s team enjoyed in the top flight in the 1970s), is testament to the meticulous planning and decision-making of Dyche and the Burnley board.“The main thing you ever have to get right as a chairman is to pick the right manager,” says Mike Garlick, the Burnley chairman. “If you do that you are halfway there at least. Sean has been key. We had Eddie Howe before that but location-wise it just didn’t suit Eddie and his family, so it didn’t quite work out. Another great manager.”Garlick is speaking in the London office of Michael Bailey Associates Group, the workforce project management and consulting company he founded in 1989 and now heads as Global CEO. His roots are unmistakably Burnley, however, and most of his fellow directors are from the area. The club’s success has been homegrown.“I was born in the town, about 400 yards from the club,” the chairman explains. “I went to school there, then went to uni and came to London to seek my fortune. When I was 18 I told my dad I wanted to be chairman of Burnley one day. He said: ‘You must be bloody crackers son.’ It was a lifelong ambition to do this. I think one of the reasons we do so well is that myself and the other directors are all fairly local and we all really care. We are not there to pick up a wage. No director gets paid. You get a night in a hotel paid for but that’s it.“I proudly state that I am the Premier League’s poorest owner. Everyone else is a billionaire, virtually. But I am proud of that and what we have achieved because we have had to sweat every asset both on and off the pitch to get the best from it. That means working really cleverly in the transfer market, looking for value – and if we don’t see that value we don’t buy. Sometimes that drives the fans up the wall but we have to have value in everything we do.”He adds: “It could be a young player that we think could do well for us and we could sell on for a profit or an older player we think could add value to the squad now. All we can do is live within our means. We don’t have the lowest budget in the Premier League anymore – other clubs who have come up have a lower budget this season – but it is certainly not top half. I can’t go into real detail but we probably have the most aggressive bonus scheme in the league in terms of staying up and finishing higher up the Premier League. We stretch our players as much as we can on the pitch to achieve the best and if they do that they get the rewards.”Garlick recoils at the suggestion that Burnley have established themselves in the Premier League. “No such thing,” he insists, but chairman and manager are clearly aligned on what Dyche described as the “incremental improvements” that must be made in a fiercely competitive field.“Priority number one was the training ground,” the Burnley chairman says. “Priority number two is probably to expand the corporate facilities because there is a long waiting list. One of the plans in the medium term is to build more executive boxes because we just haven’t got enough to meet demand. We are selling out every game. Maybe refurb or rebuild some of the stands because some of them are quite ageing now but we will do it slowly. It has to be when the time is right for us but things will happen slowly but surely.”One of the criticisms levelled at the Burnley board by supporters is their spending in the transfer market – or indeed, lack of – with Chris Wood and Ben Gibson the club’s joint record signings at £15m apiece. Dyche himself admits: “There are still challenges because we have to look at flexing the financial model because the game is out-running us financially. It is an on-going challenge but if you looked at it on a piece of paper, about how to plan out a possible successful period, then I think we are a good model for how to build something.”Garlick says: “We have seen so many clubs locally who have fallen on hard times – Bolton, Bury, even Blackburn to a degree. The fans don’t want that to happen to our club so I think they appreciate the sensible approach. But ultimately fans want to win things. I’m a fan too. Managers always want to spend too because they are ambitious for themselves and for the club. We just have to be realistic, that’s all.“We are a solid club now. We are profitable, financially healthy why can’t anyone else do it? I think it’s just sticking to your core principles and not wavering from them and getting all the key decisions, such as the manager, right. Getting the right players to fit in with the team. Sheffield United I think have done very well over the last few years. Norwich, they haven’t spent a lot of money. Huddersfield did it as well. It is possible.”Back at the Royal Dyche, Justine Lorriman, the owner responsible for the pub’s transformation from The Princess Royal, is preparing for her regular 2.55pm sprint to Turf Moor for the Everton game. Lorriman, a lifelong Burnley fan who travelled to all three away Europa League qualifiers last summer, will be back behind the bar before 5pm but measures the impact of four years in the Premier League on a much wider scale.“If Burnley are winning and doing well it has a big impact on the morale of the town,” she says. “Little Burnley are doing well in the Premier League and people recognise that now when you go away. I wore my Burnley shirt in the Philippines and several people recognised it. Beating big teams like Chelsea helps you get recognised abroad.“We had a few Norwich fans in here recently who loved what we have done. They were saying that we are role models to them, that we are the club they are looking to be like, and it’s really nice. We get the cliché of ‘you’re just a long ball team’, or they don’t like Sean Dyche, but the point is we are still here four years later. We are definitely doing something right. We are an example for small town clubs.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/51dd047eb61344c31a9d7004311f35f135a870fb/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3eeb078134ad0508af9ab511c2208027","title":"premier league 10 things to look out for this weekend","story":"Unai Emery is under pressure despite Arsenal beating Vitoria, while there is a huge clash at AnfieldDid Arsenal fans really humiliate the great Arsène Wenger … for this? At no point in Unai Emery’s tenure has it been possible to fathom a plan, and the longer things go, the worse they look. There are just so many questions: why is he so reticent to play Lucas Torreira in his position? How can he leave Mesut Özil out of his matchday squads when his team struggle to create chances? Watching Arsenal’s youngsters play in the cups, you can’t help but wonder if their abandon and cohesion will last only as long as it takes for him to impose himself upon them. Realistically, to make the club competitive again will require someone brilliant, and none of the key markers in Emery’s career so far suggest he is that. Whether Stan Kroenke cares about any of this no one knows, but if Emery isn’t on the brink he should be, and another poor performance against Palace would constitute yet more evidence for an already overwhelming prosecution. DHOle Gunnar Solskjær has copped for a lot of unfair flak lately: clearing up the mess he inherited needs more time than he has had and more money than he has been given, on top of which any team would struggle without six first-choice players. But United’s lack of ideas against opponents who do not oblige their fast players by leaving space in behind for them to run into speaks badly of the work done in training, and until that improves, playing for United will be as much of a struggle as watching them. At Norwich, though, this should not be a problem, because the hosts will look to ask questions of a defence that struggles to keep clean sheets – United have led against Wolves, Southampton, Arsenal and Liverpool, only to end up drawing all four games. The problem here is not one of preparation but of application, and responsibility for that lies not with the management but the players. It is about time they stood up, and for Harry Maguire to grow into as indomitable, influential, inspirational a leader as his reputation tells us he already is. DHSpurs badly needed their midweek win, but it is hard to gauge how well they played because their opponents were useless. It did, though, seem like Mauricio Pochettino finally found the formation which best suits his best players. The 4-2-3-1 he deployed against Red Star protects what is now a shaky back four, allows Tanguy Ndombele the freedom to attack, and gets Heung-min Son and Dele Alli close to Harry Kane, with Érik Lamela picking up any slack in workrate. We can be sure that Liverpool will test this theory. Whatever happens, they will have an extra man in midfield, and whichever trio Jürgen Klopp selects will have the legs to run Spurs off the pitch. Without Christian Eriksen – upon whom Pochettino seems to have taken a definitive view – they lack the touch and nous to pass around them, so must be prepared to spend a lot of time chasing the ball. They can still win by defending well and hoping for Kane or a counter, but the likelihood is that it will take a cleverer plan than that. DHThere’s a lot to like about Dean Smith’s Aston Villa, in particular their midfield axis of Marvelous Nakamba, Jack Grealish and John McGinn. Nakamba’s calm intelligence provides the perfect balance to his more energetic partners, who play with the perfect combination of entitlement and desire, McGinn a tenacious tempo-setter and Grealish an intuitive improviser. Against City, they will be extended like never before, but will know that if they can compete, there are goals to be taken from a vulnerable home defence. Of course, the likelihood is that City will be too good for them, but do not be surprised if Villa give them a run for their money. DHA draw at Molineux enabled Southampton to end a run of three consecutive top-flight defeats, but with back-to-back visits to Manchester City looming in the Carabao Cup and Premier League they could really do with taking at least a point when they host Leicester. Southampton have averaged exactly one goal per game in the league and have recently become overly reliant on Danny Ings to score them since he replaced £15m summer acquisition Che Adams as first-choice striker. “I would like to have three, four or five players who are always able to score because this is more important for the team,” said Saints boss Ralph Hassenhüttl, before name-checking Ryan Bertrand and Yan Valery as players who should be contributing more. They are not the only ones. Adams is yet to get off the mark and with just one goal, a penalty against Bournemouth, to his name so far this season, now would be a good time for the curiously out-of-sorts James Ward-Prowse to step up. BGDespite being without a win in their past three games, Bournemouth are likely to be full of confidence as they travel to Vicarage Road to take on a Watford team already on their second manager of the season and winless at the bottom of the table. Or are they? Against Tottenham last weekend, Watford were vastly superior in almost every department apart from the scoreboard and had every right to feel extremely aggrieved at being denied all three points by the reluctance of officialdom to implement VAR as they should. Rather than stew on the comical injustice of it all, Quique Sánchez Flores is likely to have spent the week instructing his players to dwell on the positives of an excellent performance. A repeat at home ought to be enough to see them past their visitors. BGHis Premier League career may only be six matches and 540 minutes old but the early evidence is that there is another Brighton defender worth Gareth Southgate keeping an eye on in the form of Adam Webster. It is almost a year since the Brighton skipper Lewis Dunk was capped by his country but, on current form, one of his colleagues could usurp him in the England stakes. Signed for £25m from Bristol City this summer, Webster is comfortable in possession, adept at playing out from the back (so much so he has also operated in defensive midfield) and happy to waltz forward and kick-start attacks – staples of Southgate’s mantra. That Tyrone Mings was called up to the England squad in September suggests Southgate is open to looking at defensive alternatives, with Michael Keane and John Stones not covering themselves in glory in recent outings. Webster, who scored his first Brighton goal at Aston Villa last weekend, has impressed in blue-and-white stripes and it may not be long before the clamour for the 24-year-old to appear in an England shirt builds. BFThings were looking relatively rosy for West Ham but three defeats from their past four matches, including a 4-0 loss at Oxford United, has given Manuel Pellegrini’s side something of a reality check. It has been a case of one step forward two steps back for some time at West Ham and an insipid performance at Everton was the latest infuriating result. A home match against Sheffield United represents a chance to get back on track but if Chris Wilder’s side, who upset Arsenal on Monday, were to earn successive wins, they could leapfrog West Ham in the table. If West Ham are serious about cracking the top six, they must develop some consistency. “They’re one of those teams in that bracket,” said Wilder. “They’re an established Premier League team and when you’re in that position you’ve always got to be looking ahead at what’s above you and trying to climb to that next bracket. West Ham will definitely have ambitions and ideas to climb into the top six.” BFMartin Dubravka signing a new shiny six-year contract at Newcastle was well received on Tyneside but such a reward will inevitably bring back memories of the decision to hand Alan Pardew and his staff eight-year extensions until 2020. Pardew left Newcastle for Crystal Palace two years later but fans will hope Dubravka, who will be 36 when his contract expires, is there to stay. The 30-year-old has started every Premier League game since joining Newcastle from Sparta Prague last year, keeping 17 clean sheets in 59 appearances. Karl Darlow and Rob Elliot are both out of contract next summer so it will likely fall on Freddie Woodman, the 22-year-old who has impressed this season on loan at Swansea and whose godfather is Gareth Southgate, to compete with the Slovakian for the number one jersey. BFWith Callum Hudson-Odoi returning to the fold and another three academy graduates central to Chelsea’s six-match winning streak – Fikayo Tomori, Mason Mount and Tammy Abraham – it begs the question as to which youngster could be next in line to flourish in the first team. The 18-year-old Billy Gilmour was on the bench in Amsterdam in midweek and Frank Lampard handed the Glaswegian, who joined Chelsea from Rangers for an initial £500,000 two years, a start against Grimsby last month after giving him his debut off the bench at Bramall Lane. Lampard rates the defenders Reece James and Marc Guehi very highly but it is in midfield where he is blessed with a wealth of options, including teenagers Ethan Ampadu and Conor Gallagher, who has impressed on loan at Charlton, but there was a reason the Chelsea manager was reluctant to allow Gilmour to head out the door on a temporary basis in the summer: because he felt the teenager could make a splash in the first team.

The manager has been encouraged by the formation and explained how having 11 players out forced the shape upon him.“The injuries made us get into a position where the performances didn’t come and we had fit centre-backs, quality centre-backs, and it just made it easier to go to a back three against Liverpool and again against Partizan.United struggled once more to create opportunities against Partizan, the winner coming from an Anthony Martial penalty, this again showing up Solskjær’s lack of midfield options.“We’ve not created as many as we like, we’ve not scored as many as we’d like,” Solskjær said. “Anthony’s back, got a goal and I’m sure you’ll see us improve as a team with Anthony in it because he does give us something different.”Solsjaer is wary of Sunday’s opponents, who this season impressed against Liverpool before losing, and defeated Manchester City, the champions."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dce1f3b3ed7f7941c6a7020d12035092c3a14222/0_21_2000_1199/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5e2fd54b812d8efeb5ecc1f3cebc7a35","title":"west ham carlos tevez javier mascherano sheffield united premier league","story":"Lingering bad blood with Sheffield United over Argentinian duo’s role in 2007 survival season masks the reality of a toxic Upton Park dressing room under Alan CurbishleyPeople who were there remember Alan Pardew’s disbelief quickly turning into ecstasy. It was August 2006, four months after Pardew’s young West Ham side had come within a whisker of beating Liverpool in the FA Cup final, and the final day of the transfer window was about to take a turn for the surreal in east London.At first it seemed like a prank, the idea that two of the hottest talents in South America were about to join West Ham, and Pardew’s response was predictable when the idea was put to him. “Don’t be ridiculous,” he said. “It’s never going to happen.” Only, it was. One of the most controversial transfers in the history of English football progressed at dizzying speed and by the end of day Carlos Tevez and Javier Mascherano had left the São Paulo club Corinthians for West Ham.“I remember watching it on Sky Sports News,” Matthew Etherington, who played for West Ham between 2003 and 2009, says. “None of us expected it. We thought: ‘Maybe this is the way the club’s going’. We didn’t know how the deal was structured at the time.”Sheffield United, who visit the London Stadium this afternoon, have not forgotten. They have faced West Ham once since the bitter row over the Mascherano and Tevez deal, winning a League Cup tie at Upton Park in August 2014, and have not forgotten an independent Premier League commission handing the east Londoners a record £5.5m fine instead of a points deduction for breaking third-party ownership rules when they signed the Argentinian duo.An FA tribunal would later find in United’s favour, arguing that Tevez’s role was crucial in West Ham staying up at their expense, and the Hammers ended up paying the Blades £20m in compensation following an out-of-court settlement.However, while the coverage down the years has largely focused on United being cheated out of a Premier League place, something lost in the conversation is how West Ham’s dream turned into a nightmare. Far from helping them challenge the elite, signing Tevez and Mascherano almost got them relegated, caused long-term financial problems and disturbed dressing room harmony. Mascherano played seven forgettable games before joining Liverpool during the January transfer window and it took Tevez 1,142 minutes to score a goal.It was one of the strangest seasons in West Ham’s history. Pardew had won the Championship play-offs in 2005 and for a while he was the perfect leader for a youthful, boisterous group. If Bobby Zamora arrived early to nick Pardew’s parking space at the training ground, it was seen as part of the fun. After a while, however, off-field issues began to lower the squad’s discipline.West Ham enjoyed their first season back in the Premier League, finishing ninth and reaching the FA Cup final. Their hearts would be broken by Steven Gerrard’s last-minute equaliser for Liverpool, who won it on penalties. “It took a lot out of everybody,” Etherington says.Nothing was the same after Gerrard’s thunderbolt. Dean Ashton, the team’s best striker, broke his ankle shortly before the season started and some players had grown cocky. There were doubts over Nigel Reo-Coker’s attitude after stories linking the midfielder with Arsenal and Manchester United. Reo-Coker was pally with Anton Ferdinand, Hayden Mullins, Marlon Harewood and Zamora, all of whom had been central to the side’s rise. When Tevez and Mascherano arrived, the latter took Mullins’s place in midfield.“Hayden definitely didn’t react in a negative way but it did upset the apple cart at the time,” Etherington says. “It was a good, young team with a sprinkling of experience and quality. Were two high-profile signings like that needed?”The so-called economic rights of Tevez and Mascherano were owned by four companies represented by Kia Joorabchian, who was expected to buy West Ham. A belief grew that Tevez and Mascherano were anticipating a change of manager. Pardew had been fatally undermined and the team knew it. Teddy Sheringham, one of West Ham’s few experienced players, privately remarked that they were in trouble.Results noseed following the deal. West Ham went out of the Uefa Cup in the first round and were knocked out of the League Cup by Chesterfield. As for the Argentinian stars? Tevez was unfit and out of his comfort zone in a strange new country, while Mascherano was struggling with the pace of the Premier League.“Mascherano was brilliant in training,” Etherington says. “Tevez took some time to adjust to life in London. In training he didn’t seem that dedicated. Mascherano adjusted really well. He was doing English lessons from day one. Tevez just had an interpreter with him all the time. He had no interest at the time to bed into the culture.”Tevez was actually doing extra drills with Zamora after training but the situation showed no sign of improving. Chances went begging and he became so frustrated that he stormed out of Upton Park after being substituted during a home win over Sheffield United in November. Pardew let the rest of the squad decide Tevez’s punishment: they made him train in a Brazil shirt.An £85m takeover had been completed by then – but not by Joorabchian. Terry Brown had sold up to Bjorgolfur Gudmundsson, an Icelandic billionaire, who installed Eggert Magnusson as chairman. On 3 December Mascherano made his final appearance for West Ham, coming on in the 84th minute of a 2-0 defeat at Everton. He was at fault for Everton’s second goal, summing up his time at the club.Three days later West Ham were beaten at home by Wigan Athletic, after which Pardew was called into Magnusson’s office and told that the board were fully behind him. Yet Pardew’s charm had worn off and he was sacked within a week, a 4-0 defeat at Bolton proving the final straw for Magnusson. “I texted Pardew and said I felt the players had let him down,” Etherington says. “We lost our way and I felt the players had a lot to do with that, not so much the manager. People believed in their own hype. We took our eye off the ball, me included.”Gudmundsson was rarely seen at Upton Park, but Magnusson was panicking. He appointed Alan Curbishley, an experienced pragmatist. The former Charlton manager had an unforgettable first game, beating eventual champions Manchester United at Upton Park, but it was a temporary high.West Ham followed the win over United with three draws and nine defeats. Curbishley, who was reluctant to use Tevez at first, was aghast at his side’s attitude. There was talk of a gambling culture within the club. “We were probably enjoying ourselves a bit too much,” one former player admits.Curbishley ripped into his players after a 6-0 defeat against Reading on New Year’s Day, criticising their flash lifestyles and fast cars, which led to them being dubbed the Baby Bentley Brigade. “Curbishley was very forthright, which sometimes isn’t the best thing to do,” Etherington says. “He called players out. It was a bold move. Was it right? I’d say no but eventually we got our act together.”Curbishley spent in January, signing Luis Boa Morte, Calum Davenport, Lucas Neill, Nigel Quashie and Matthew Upson. Kepa Blanco also joined on loan from Sevilla. Upson had dropped everything to join West Ham from Birmingham on deadline day. The centre-back did not even have his boots with him. His agent had to buy a pair from a shop near Upton Park. No wonder Upson limped off on his debut, a 1-0 defeat by Aston Villa. Injuries meant he only played another 11 minutes before the season was over.Everything was going wrong and West Ham looked down after a 4-3 home defeat by Tottenham. They were 10 points off 17th place with eight games left. A teenage Mark Noble, finally given a chance in midfield, wept after the final whistle.Yet something changed that afternoon: Tevez scored his first goal, bending in a free-kick from 25 yards. West Ham ended their winless run two weeks later, coming from behind to win at Blackburn. Tevez won and scored a penalty and Zamora scored a winner that would not have made it past VAR. The striker’s shot failed to cross the line because it hit Tevez, who was offside.West Ham built on their moment of fortune and the argument that they were a one-man team, utterly reliant on Tevez, overlooked vital contributions from other players. Ferdinand struck up a good partnership with James Collins in central defence. Yossi Benayoun found his creative spark. Noble excelled. Robert Green had the game of his life when another Zamora goal saw West Ham win at Arsenal in April, making save after save.Neill’s leadership was also invaluable. “Lucas had a big say in our revival, more than the manager I’d say,” Etherington says. “Carlos got the headlines but there were other factors that led to us staying up. That’s what people forget.”That is lost on Neil Warnock’s Sheffield United, who moved 10 points clear of West Ham after beating them 3-0 at home on 14 April. Yet United froze and West Ham rallied. A Zamora stunner brought them a 1-0 win over Everton. Boa Morte, Benayoun and Harewood scored in a 3-0 win at Wigan. Momentum had swung their way and they were out of the bottom three after winning their penultimate game, a double from Tevez destroying Bolton.West Ham were in the driving seat on the final day. They only needed to draw at Old Trafford to shift the focus to Bramall Lane, where Sheffield United and Wigan were both in danger of going down. One of them needed a favour from Manchester United.Yet Manchester United had already won the league and the FA Cup final against Chelsea was less than a week away. Alex Ferguson’s team still included Wayne Rooney, though, and he introduced Ryan Giggs, Cristiano Ronaldo and Paul Scholes early in the second half. West Ham spent most of the game defending. The champions battered Curbishley’s side, who stole a win when Tevez clipped home on the stroke of half-time.At Bramall Lane, meanwhile, Warnock’s team stumbled against Wigan, who stayed up thanks to a penalty from David Unsworth. Sheffield United were down and Tevez was off to join Manchester United. “By the end he spoke a little English,” Etherington says. “The interpreter was still with him, standing by the training pitch and helping with the manager’s instructions.” Tevez had done his talking on the pitch."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ecc81b1add2025a700adfe17bd4d5ee4c114ea59/0_336_6016_3611/master/6016.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c8fabdb8840075b52b0010f2e3c15651","title":"dressing afghanistan young designers get creative in kabul","story":"In a deeply conservative society ravaged by years of war, Afghan women still want to be free to wear clothes with stylePhotography by Ivan Armando FloresThere’s a steady stream of customers coming through the doors of Rahiba Rahimi’s fashion studio. The 25-year-old’s bold, intricate designs are fitted on mannequins and hung on rails around her showroom in Kabul.Rahimi is the lead designer and co-proprietor of Laman, a clothing label she helped build in the Afghan capital five years ago.Her customers are mostly Afghan women and men, together with a few foreign nationals who work in Kabul’s aid-driven economy.“A lot of times we collaborate and co-design with customers because Afghans are very good at fashion. Even now, if you see on the street, you will see how Afghans express their creativity in colours and styles. We are here to help with the quality of that expression, with design, details, fabric,” she says, walking around the multistorey building that doubles as a workshop and studio.“I haven’t studied fashion designing, this came about based on my love for colours and patterns and, in a broader sense, my love for the culture and heritage.”Her designs are a world away from what might be considered, outside the wartorn country at least, the norms of Afghan fashion. Clothing styles in the country have traditionally been influenced by social norms formed over decades of conflict, violence and extremism. Yet that hasn’t deterred a younger generation of Afghans from pushing the boundaries, while also attempting to revive traditional handicraft and art.“Fashion for me represents a strong statement in a conservative society. It is an expression of myself as a woman and as an Afghan youth. I should have the right to wear the colours I want to wear. It is a sign of freedom,” Rahimi explains.Rahimi talks about the new Laman designs, many of which featured in a fashion show in Milan in June.The clothes aren’t entirely traditional, but a fusion of modern styles using lighter fabric. “We are making Afghan fashion global while also keeping certain things and values the same,” she says, picking up shirts with vintage Baluchi-Nuristani hand embroidery and coats edged with embroidered leather. There are brightly coloured long dresses adorned with intricate beadwork and a very specific embroidery design with sharp edges, like a dagger.However, she has noticed a significant shift in how Afghan fashion is perceived since she first started the company. “I do get a lot of surprised reactions to my designs when I am abroad, but that is changing. Even in international fashion, there is so much ersity – and Afghanistan’s fashion is finding its place,” says Rahimi, who employees two dozen Afghans, including female designers, tailors and sales staff.Hasina Aimaq, 26, another designer breaking taboos and stereotypes, also showcased her work at the Milan show, held in the historical Salone Dei Tessuti.Aimaq’s bold designs attracted both acclaim and criticism. Her signature piece, a hand-embroidered blue dress inspired by the traditional blue burqa worn by women in Afghanistan, was much discussed in the country, and stirred the ire of many conservative Afghans.Sitting in her small studio in the basement of a house in the west of Kabul, a much more basic operation than Rahimi’s showroom, she shares the motivation behind her most controversial, yet also most commissioned design from the Milan set.“My aim was to share a positive image of Afghanistan and specifically showcase the talents of Afghan women through these designs,” she says, sitting next to a large working table where samples from the Milan fashion show are laid out. “Everyone recognises the blue burqa as Afghan clothing, so I thought: ‘Let’s make something else out of this and show them what Afghan women are capable of.’”Dismissing the critics, Aimaq says she was encouraged the support she got, especially from women in the rural north: “I also received some positive comments, because many Afghan women acknowledge that the chader is not really part of our culture. It’s just a fabric and we can make anything out of that.”She started designing in 2011, inspired by her mother, a widow who secretly worked as a tailor during the years of the Taliban regime, defying its prohibition on female workers. “She taught herself to sew and stitch, got better with practise and set up her small, discreet business,” Aimaq says. “My mother would stitch clothes for the neighbours and slowly started to move her products to the local markets, despite risks of being punished by the Taliban. Since I was young, I have known that she wanted to turn this into a proper business and together we did it,” she adds proudly.Aimaq’s business provides work for more than 100 women across the Kabul and Afghan provinces, who work from home and help produce wholesale quantities of regular clothing, as well as specially designed dresses and boutique garments.Being women pioneers in their field comes at a cost for Aimaq and Rahimi. Both have received threats and intimidation on- and offline. Aimaq was forced to move her studio because of the threats. But they remain determined. “We survived worse times during the Taliban regime. We are more empowered now than we were back then,” Aimaq says."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/42b2d9aae4fef4272e4b44aac7d99f73f349bfdf/0_173_4290_2574/master/4290.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c1a603598092306d6181ed640887ca36","title":"boats burgers and whale bones cambridge for kids","story":"From playgrounds to punts, mazes to museums, animals to afternoon tea, Cambridge is packed with kid-happy things to see, do and eat. Get insider’s advice from local Oisín Higney, seven (with the help of brother Milo, 17, and mum Kate) Cambridge is brilliant and my Granny Eva lives there too. It has a river and loads of museums and parks. It is fun to travel there by train. I’d like to be a train driver when I grow up, or maybe a pilot. Last time, we shared our seats with another family and I got to watch Paw Patrol on another boy’s iPad. So I made a new friend, which was awesome. Do you want to know what I like to do in Cambridge?Cambridge University Botanic Garden is very near the station and is great to run around. It has a fountain, a mini-maze and stepping stones over a little lake. I think that the tall yellow grass plants look like fur. I like to hide behind the trees. You can’t climb them as it might hurt the branches. I like to make up games in the rock garden instead. The greenhouse is not green but it is hot and made of glass. Go to see the big cactuses and pretend you are a cowboy. They have very prickly spines so watch out. Also, there is a lily pad big enough for a frog the size of me.From here you can walk into town by following the river. You go over lots of bridges. If you want you can play in the Lammas Land playground. In summer, there are brown cows in Coe Fen and Midsummer Common. Real cows, you say, in the middle of Cambridge? Yes there are, and it’s kind of cool.At the Mill Pond, by the Mathematical Bridge, there are lots of people on small boats called punts. An adult has to stand up with a long pole. It looks like they are fishing but really they are pushing the boats along. We went on a punt and ate strawberries. The man who pushed us was really good at ducking down under the bridges and not falling off. You can even go at night on a Bat Punt Safari. Spooky!Do you like skateparks, tennis or playgrounds? Jesus Green has them all, right next to the river. Sometimes we go to the family runs on Sunday morning in Milton Country Park. I can run really fast. The Science Centre has a cool marble run, and the Centre for Computing History has a lot of retro games that my dad knows all about.There are lots of buildings that look like castles in the middle of Cambridge. King’s College looks like a church castle and Trinity College is where a man called Newton went. He had an apple fall on his head, and then he invented gravity, which is very cool. Did you know that there is a banana tree in Cambridge? It’s in Pembroke College. See if you can find the big Corpus Clock made of real gold. I think it is funny as it doesn’t even tell the time. It has a mechanical insect on the top, and if you wait for ages, his eye blinks. If you like climbing high you can see the whole of Cambridge from Great St Mary’s Church Steeple. Just don’t get stuck next to the bell when it rings! It can be fun to to explore the small streets in the centre, you could even do a treasure trail. If I get tired of walking, we go into Heffers, Waterstones or the Central Library and look at children’s books.Did I say that there were loads of museums? Just on Downing Street there are three, like the Sedgwick Museum of Earth Sciences. Find the bronze statue of Mr Sedgwick. He is holding a hammer and a trilobite shell that is 500m years old, which is older than my mum. My favourite is the huge fin whale at the Museum of Zoology. It hangs on the ceiling and it’s ginormous. You can look up and see all its bones and teeth. I also like the stuffed animals, games, and big screen with tiny square TVs of different creatures. My brother says we have to look after animals or they just get extinct. There is a museum that also looks like a castle. It is the Fitzwilliam and when you get in the ceiling is really high. You have got to see the Egyptian mummies, the knight’s armour and the swords – they are awesome. If you like real animals, then the red pandas in Shepreth Wildlife Park are really cute. It is right next to Shepreth train station, just a few minutes outside Cambridge.Aromi has tasty Sicilian margherita pizza that you eat from a wooden plate. I love the dark chocolate ice-cream. My brother likes Bill’s restaurant, as he says it has delicious buttermilk pancakes with bacon and the staff are really friendly. They are only served at brunch so you must be early. He also likes the spicy chicken rolls in Pho (Vietnamese). La Margherita has nice pasta, and is near Kettles Yard Art Gallery. The MillWorks has a real gigantic wheel in the middle and is right next to the river. My favourite is a plain burger and fries at Byron Burger or Honest Burger, but it has to have ketchup. If you want some treats for the train home, there are Chelsea buns in Fitzbillies. On Mill Road, near the station, you can get nice cakes in the Urban Larder or Norfolk Street Bakery. And if you want an apple to fall on your head and have a big idea, you can go to the Orchard Tea Garden in Grantchester for strawberry jam scones and sit under the trees in a deckchair.Take a trip to Cambridge.

We had been running a pub in Hertfordshire and looking for an opportunity to return to our Welsh roots the Skirrid offered that. With its reputation for paranormal activity, it couldn’t have been more different from the beautiful thatched pub we were leaving but I love places full of history and intrigue. I enjoy horror films, too.Walk in and it’s like entering a castle, with stone-flagged floors everywhere. It’s said there was a building here as early as 1110 and, though it’s impossible to verify, we do claim to be the oldest pub in Wales – most of the main bar dates from the Tudor period, and upstairs, where our guests stay, was a courtroom until Cromwell’s time. Many of the alleged ghosts are connected to that room. Local legend has it that George Jeffreys, the notorious 17th-century “hanging judge”, may have heard cases here, and that 182 people have been executed in the building. We keep a noose on the staircase, hanging from the beam that was supposedly used it has score marks on it said to have been caused by the weight of hanging bodies.Though I’m sceptical about these stories, during the 14 years we’ve been here, I’ve experienced my fair share of unexplained phenomena. On our first night at the inn, before we’d even taken over, we were sleeping in a big four-poster bed when Sharon complained of something tugging on her leg. It happened several times during the night and we had to keep turning the lights on. Of course, there was nothing there, but we barely slept. Later, we learned that relatives of people who were slow to die during a hanging would yank on their loved ones’ legs to end their suffering. I was quite shaken by that.Not long after that, my young grandson went to the toilet and came back complaining, “The man in the long dress won’t let me in!” There was no one else in the place at the time – even Sharon was out. Brave man that I am, I made him hang on until she came back.I’ve only once seen a full figure – a coachman-like character in a tricorn hat, standing in the porch in broad daylight. He caught my eye for a second or two, then was gone. That was about eight years ago and since then I’ve sometimes thought, “Did I really see that?” Obviously it would be great for business if I kept coming out with these stories, but I do question everything.The pub attracts a lot of psychics, paranormal investigators and TV crews. I’ve seen a few dodgy spiritualists over the years, but the ones who genuinely seem to believe in what they’re doing and don’t take themselves too seriously are always welcome. Our bar regulars get on well with the visitors – they love showing them around and telling their own uncanny stories. Most of the staff have had strange encounters, too – we’ve had glasses and customers’ change flying off the bar, unexplained cold spots in rooms, and one young woman who said an unseen presence whispered, then roared in her ear.Our best-known former resident is an 18th-century barmaid called Fanny Price, who died of consumption and is buried in the local churchyard. She has been spotted frequently and people often say they can smell lavender just before she appears. There have been more troubling manifestations – on half a dozen occasions, guests have shown me strange marks that have appeared around their necks – but there’s only been one instance of outright malevolence that I’m aware of. A woman came running down from one of the bedrooms, hair wet and dressed only in a coat, saying, “She tried to kill me!” Apparently she’d been in the bath and something had held her down under the water. I thought it was interesting that she said “she” rather than “he” or “it”, but she didn’t stick around to explain and I’ve been unable to contact her since.Sceptical as I am, I don’t take any chances and I do maintain the local tradition of every night putting out the Pwcca Cup, a special tankard filled with ale to appease the devil. On a windy night this time of year, when I go outside and the pub sign is swinging and the wind’s howling, I do look over my shoulder. One day I’m going to turn round and something’s going to be there. I think it will be the end of me. Especially if it’s a clown. They scare me to death.  • As told to Chris BroughtonDo you have an experience to share?

You’d be mad to rule it out. On Monday night, Channel 4’s Dispatches broadcast a programme that aired claims by Virginia Roberts Giuffre – who alleges she was kept as Jeffrey Epstein’s sex slave while a minor and beyond – that she had been required to have sex with Epstein’s friend Andrew three times. Once was in London, she alleged, shortly after the infamous picture was taken of Andrew with his arm round the waist of the 17-year-old Roberts Giuffre. Once was in New York, she also claimed, and once was in an orgy with other young women on the billionaire financier’s private Virgin Islands property, reportedly known locally as “Paedophile Island”.Prince Andrew absolutely denies all these accusations, which were struck from Florida court records in 2015, having recently said he was “appalled by the recent reports of Jeffrey Epstein’s alleged crimes”. Even though he continued to be friends with Epstein after the latter had served more than a year in prison for procuring an underage girl for prostitution. Only a discredited plea deal prevented multiple further accusers, whose existence was publicly known, from being part of the case.So, yes, Dispatches was Monday night. On Tuesday, the Duke of York was unusually accompanied on a formal engagement by his eldest daughter Beatrice, who is not a working member of the royal family, having a separate career. She is to be married next year, as her sister Princess Eugenie was last October. The taxpayer dropped a couple of million on security for the latter event at Windsor, with the local council stumping up a further undisclosed sum for services such as stewarding and parking facilities. Eugenie’s wedding was televised on ITV, although it remains to be seen whether the family will decide that it’s worth going down that route again. Perhaps it depends where the whole investigation-into-Andrew’s-dead-underage-sex-trafficker-friend thing is at that particular moment.Either way, there is some speculation that her father feels the need of the protective charm of family members at this time. Certainly, anonymous friends have been working hard on his behalf for a couple of months. These friends began by addressing the aforementioned photo of Andrew with Roberts Giuffre, his hand resting on the teenager’s bare hip as the duke and Epstein’s mutual friend Ghislaine Maxwell smile away. According to these “sources close to the duke”, the picture may be a fake, because Prince Andrew has “much chubbier” fingers.If you’ve never heard such rubbish, you will likely boggle even more at the close sources’ more recent tack. Namely, that Andrew only flew to stay with Epstein in New York in 2010 in order to tell him they could no longer be friends. This was the same trip that took place after Epstein had been released from an 18-month jail sentence. This was the same trip where he and Andrew were photographed strolling and chatting together in Central Park, and where Andrew was photographed and filmed grinningly answering the door of Epstein’s mansion to a young woman. Was this the same trip where literary agent John Brockman reported being in the same room as Andrew and Epstein as they received simultaneous foot massages from two young, attractive Russian women? It’s not clear. Even without that, though, you have to think it’s EXACTLY how you too would end a friendship with a Tier-1 sex offender who you knew had recently got out of jail.Then again, for all the radioactive horror of the Epstein story, the bizarre reality is that Andrew barely needs to bother coming up with weird or absurd explanations that keep making it worse. Because, once more, people are looking in quite another direction. Despite airing a full 24 hours later, the Dispatches details were almost entirely drowned in the continuing tide of media coverage of the documentary the Duke and Duchess of Sussex had participated in the night previously, in which they spoke of their struggle to deal with their media coverage.Given the sheer volume of stuff already punditted about this, I won’t add much to the pile. Personally, I’d resign from being sixth in line to the throne or whatever Harry is, and do one to Hollywood, where Meghan can be the biggest movie star in the world for her 40s, and he can be wheeled shyly out at her premieres, like Hugh Grant at the end of Notting Hill. But I’m willing to accept it might be more complicated than that.Ultimately, though, we should be more interested in what happened to the courage, moral and otherwise, of those who continue to regard the decor of their baby’s nursery or whatever as a bigger story than persistent allegations of Andrew’s relationship with Epstein, which has been very far from satisfactorily resolved.Alas, there does come a point where we have to consider what kind of hive mind reckons the one story is so much more worthwhile than the other, despite the obvious misery of Harry and Meghan and the enduring misery of the likes of Roberts Giuffre. As part of this column’s tireless – tireless! – commitment to public service journalism, this feels like the time to psychologically profile the most dedicated and virulent Meghan-haters, who somehow haven’t a word to say about Prince Andrew’s extensive links to a massive, raging, paedophile sex-case. To wit: GUYS, WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU? DON’T LOOK THERE! LOOK OVER HERE INSTEAD!Listen, no one’s saying that you’re a paedo if you have spent at least 30 times more broadcast energycolumn inches on condemning Meghan for such things as etiquette infractions in the royal box at Wimbledon than you have on Prince Andrew being repeatedly linked to a huge international underage sex-trafficking scandal involving his deceased close friend Jeffrey Epstein (denied, as above).Or wait – am I saying that? Of course not! Well, pretty sure. But seriously: if that’s you, you DO have a problem. And you DO have to go on a kind of register that I am compiling, with the working title “The Meghan Offenders Register”. Don’t worry, I’ll sign it for you. At present, you don’t have to go door-to-door in your neighbourhood and tell people who you are. Namely, a person who has tipped all over a new mother for relatively minuscule things, while not really thinking Prince Andrew being accused of being embroiled in something so much bigger is worth your timeword count.As I say: at present, you don’t have to go house-to-house. Ultimately, though, we kind of know what you are. And that thing is pretty hideous. Something has gone very badly wrong. And listen, I’m a liberal. If it were up to me, society would set aside a lot more money for research into how people like you get to be people like you. You could then be helped via state-of-the-art treatment programmes, because, in a lot of ways, it is a mental deficiency. Unfortunately, people are so grossed out and incensed by how you are that they don’t want to rationally deal with the problem, put money into it and begin the difficult work of trying to fix you for the greater good. So, yeah, it’s a cycle. Others will offend because of you.In conclusion, then, what follows can only be a cut-price care plan. But here goes: every time you hear Virginia Roberts Giuffre, now a mother of three herself, telling her story, but decide there’s something about it that makes her not worth listening to … please try to chemically castrate those thoughts. Please don’t act on your perverse urges to attack Meghan and Harry instead for things that just aren’t that big of a deal. And once more, please, in the name of basic decency: DON’T LOOK THERE! LOOK OVER HERE INSTEAD!"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bbda5ec0a3ee7ccc75f81fe26aef5fdea7b493c3/0_47_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5f7c34d066e6ebd15dd680d5d02d42ac","title":"fox news watching what i learned","story":"As a media critic, I’ve had an intimate look at the channel’s morning show – and how it poisons the national conversation“Everything should calm down a little bit in seven months,” they said. It was 9 February 2016, when I began my career as a critic of Fox News at Media Matters for America, a not-for-profit progressive research center dedicated to monitoring, analyzing, and correcting conservative misinformation in the US media.Most people, eventually including Donald Trump, assumed Hillary Clinton would be elected the 45th president of the United States that November. Most people were wrong about a lot of things.Nearly four years later, the US political world revolves around the tweets of an erratic Fox News-watching grandpa who just so happens to run the most powerful country on Earth. Like any avid TV viewer, Trump has his favorite stories, and few rival the morning show Fox \u0026amp Friends, where he spent years making frequent appearances before ing into politics.Since July 2018, I’ve been one among a lucky few live-tweeting the show along with the president. And after consuming thousands of hours of Rupert Murdoch’s finest drivel, I’ve learned a few things about how America’s No 1 news network is dragging the United States into ruin.Fox \u0026amp Friends’ main hosts – Steve Doocy, Ainsley Earhardt and Brian Kilmeade – are a consistent train wreck of shameless hackery, even managing to turn a report about Trump’s $1bn in business losses into a glowing endorsement of his bold, wealthy brilliance.Officially, Fox \u0026amp Friends is an opinion show, but the ostensibly separate news side – which also lies daily – pops up a lot.Ed Henry’s role in the news ision is chief national correspondent, but in the opinion ision he’s a co-host of the weekend edition of Fox \u0026amp Friends and occasional guest host of the main weekday show – on which he once led a segment asking whether climate change and “extreme weather” were the same thing (they are not).Recently, the chief national correspondent reported that the CIA whistleblower had a political bias against Trump Henry reported this not on one of Fox’s “news” shows, but with the pro-Trump propagandist Sean Hannity.Later, while guest-hosting Fox \u0026amp Friends, Henry discussed how “important” it was that his reporting on Hannity was helping Trump distract people from the impeachment inquiry.Henry’s fellow correspondent Griff Jenkins also sometimes co-hosts Fox \u0026amp Friends, where he gets to ulge exclusive reporting like his allegation that ethnic studies classes aren’t educational. Rather, he said, “they’re making social justice warriors out of children” – a blood-red culture-warrior attack absurd enough to prompt a chuckle from the guest.Jenkins often does field reporting on immigration for Fox \u0026amp Friends, a lowlight of which involved him literally hiding in the bushes along the US-Mexico border to help border patrol detain a migrant family.After they were caught, a seemingly celebratory chyron read “Illegal admits to knowingly breaking the law”. Jenkins closed his report by discussing a wanted murderer and a known gang member who were caught trying to cross the border. Neither had anything to do with the family he helped arrest.Fox \u0026amp Friends’ combination of sloppy news coverage and fierce rightwing opinion is a microcosm of how much Fox values each side of the network.Take, for example, the legitimate journalist and former chief news anchor Shepard Smith: after he had a dramatic on-air feud with the opinion kingpin Tucker Carlson, both Fox News’ CEO and its president reportedly threatened to take Smith off the air if he criticized Carlson again.A few weeks later, Smith resigned from the network he had renewed his contract with last year. The sudden end of his 23-year Fox career shows what happens at that network when news and opinion irreconcilably collide. But on Fox \u0026amp Friends, as with most of the rest of Fox, the “news” knows its place.One of the ways Fox News corrodes politics is by influencing the larger conversation in fact, you may be essentially consuming Fox propaganda without knowing it.And as the network’s flagship morning show for over 20 years, Fox \u0026amp Friends often sets the tone for how the network as a whole discusses any given issue. This line from the pastor and Fox contributor Robert Jeffress sums up a lot of Fox’s abortion coverage:Jeffress’s unhinged comment highlighted a debate you may have heard of about so-called “post-birth” abortion, a procedure disproved by its very name. If the abortion happens after a child is born, then it’s not abortion it’s murder, which is already very illegal everywhere.Yet, as Vox’s Anna North recounted, the idea that there’s such a thing as “post-birth” abortion – and that there are people who want it to be – became such a potent meme that the president spoke against it and congressional Republicans made more than 70 attempts to protect abortion “survivors” with legislation.This abject nonsense spiraled into a mainstream debate because of modest attempts to loosen restrictions on reproductive rights in New York and Virginia. The efforts spurred numerous attacks, including from Trump, who falsely claimed the governor of Virginia had said he “would execute a baby after birth”, and from Fox \u0026amp Friends commentators, who rabidly declared that “infanticide” and “fourth trimester” abortion were actual progressive policy goals.Fox prime time has rightly earned a reputation as a cable TV haven for white supremacy, but, as with all things Fox News, Fox \u0026amp Friends also plays a prominent role.In October 2018, Fox News became a wailing siren on immigration, claiming that the US was under “invasion” by undocumented immigrants – specifically, a group of Central American migrants traveling (mostly walking) over 1,000 miles to the US-Mexico border.In one week, Fox ran nearly eight hours of content on the then distant caravan. Fox \u0026amp Friends started nearly every morning with anti-immigrant hysteria, eventually suggesting the US take military action to “protect our sovereignty” from families fleeing gang violence and endemic poverty.The very day after that comment aired on Fox \u0026amp Friends, a white supremacist murdered 11 Jewish worshippers at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh, because he blamed Jews for helping the “invaders” in the caravan.Caravan hysteria eventually passed, but Fox News’ dangerous and false melodrama about an immigrant “invasion” continued.Some months later, yet another mass shooter struck – this time murdering 20 in El Paso, to stop the “Hiic invasion of Texas”. Kilmeade passionately defended using the dangerously hyperbolic term “invasion” just three days later.Did Fox News inspire two white supremacist mass shootings? Probably not directly. Is it disturbing that America’s number one news network discusses immigration like bloodthirsty white supremacists? Yes.A Fox News executive reportedly told Vanity Fair that the network’s “power comes from” its viewers, and it must defend them.That sentiment neatly encapsulates how and why Fox inspires a strong sense of brand loyalty among its viewers – more so than other cable networks. On a number of issues, from recent (false) allegations of anti-conservative censorship on social media to the tried-and-true (and misleading) trope of “Dems are coming for your guns”, Fox News consistently tells viewers that there are hostile groups that want to revoke their rights, undermine their values, and cause them harm.Breakfast with Friends is a frequently recurring segment in which secondary hosts and correspondents travel to diners across the country, usually shadowing a Trump rally or election debate, to get the pulse of the people.Strangely, when devoted Fox fans go on Fox to offer their opinions, they typically echo the conservative, pro-Trump line you can find from Fox mainstays. Breakfast with Friends has a similar goal to the live audience shows: offering Fox fans an opportunity to appear on TV and enjoy validation from their favorite personalities over sometimes-absurd amounts of breakfast food.Fox News is now attempting to expand its footprint in viewers’ minds with the subscription streaming service Fox Nation. Fox Nation offers original documentaries on favorite rightwing media scandals, shares hot takes from opinionistas like Tomi Lahren and Diamond \u0026amp Silk, and gives some on-air talent a chance to show another side of themselves to the Fox viewer.For example, Kilmeade has an American history series that calls Andrew “Trail of Tears” Jackson a “hero” the contributor Rachel Campos-Duffy has a show about motherhood and Ainsley Earhardt hosts Ainsley’s Bible Study. The aim is to show Fox News superfans what their favorite “Fox News personalities do outside the newsroom”, drawing viewers tighter into the network’s destructive embrace.People who watch Fox News with an open mind can find themselves sucked into a destructive and alienating lifestyle. The writer Luke O’Neil collected several examples of families, his own included, ided by Fox News’ partisan garbage fire. O’Neil and his mother “have agreed to not talk about politics any more. The cognitive dissonance between this lovely woman finding something appealing in the most xenophobic pundits on TV is too hard for me to reconcile.”Others told him about no longer visiting their home towns “because my family and friends all have broken Fox brain” or about not sending their children to see their grandparents because, thanks to Fox News, “their toxic anger and resentment is slowly becoming their entire identity”.I can tell you from personal experience that when I say Fox poisons minds, I’m not being that hyperbolic. While watching Fox \u0026amp Friends every morning, I struggle to unearth or at least assemble even shadows of fact-based arguments from the unhinged nonsense that is vital to the brand.It can be so intense on Fox \u0026amp Friends that I sometimes have what could be called propaganda hangovers – after finishing the show, I feel as though I’m trapped in a fog of disinformation, and my mental processes feel sluggish for a few more minutes.My strongest bulwark against succumbing is strident opposition. Once you know you’re watching stupid bullshit, sometimes that stupid bullshit becomes must-see TV:Fox News is ridiculous, stupid, and – when it doesn’t mean to be – hilarious. Most importantly, it’s an extremely influential stream of conservative misinformation. And the president’s favorite show, Fox \u0026amp Friends, encapsulates the totality of the rotten network’s inherent conflicts and contradictions.It shows how news and opinion is blurred – but opinion wins – and the lengths the network goes to ensure a devoted audience. Fox is a shameless counterfeit of a news organization, and Fox \u0026amp Friends leads the fraud bright and early every morning."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e38614d4480d7678c15e18b7a0bc58561fe94126/30_0_1980_1188/master/1980.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aa05248663eb4760859ceaa76f8cb9dc","title":"revealed the plan to end gazumping in house sales","story":"Homebuyers and sellers could be required to sign £1,000 reservation agreements to make it harder to walk awayCould this mean an end to the heartache and expense of a house sale falling through? A revolutionary new scheme that would require a homebuyer or seller who pulls out of a transaction without a very good reason to pay compensation is set to be trialled by the government early next year.Between a quarter and a third of all house sales fall through, resulting in huge amounts of stress and wasting hundreds of millions of pounds a year.The latest idea to try to make the housing market work better, is a new type of agreement that would “lock” people into the process a lot earlier and make it much harder to walk away or move the goalposts – for example, because they have changed their mind or decided to accept a higher offer.The agreement would involve one or both parties putting down cash at the outset. You would get some money back if the other side later pulls out.So what’s this scheme all about? It’s called a “reservation agreement” and is designed not only to cut the number of house sales that fall through, but also to reduce the fear that something will go wrong. The government has been thinking about this for a while but is now moving closer to it becoming a reality.This sort of agreement is already used by a few estate agents, while those buying new-builds are often asked to put down a reservation fee.How would these agreements work? Maybe like this: once a sale has been agreed, the buyer and seller would both be asked to put down some money, which would go into an “escrow account” probably held by lawyers, says Mark Hayward at estate agent body NAEA Propertymark.Both parties would sign the agreement, which would last for a set period. If either side withdraws for a reason that is judged to be not acceptable, they will forfeit the deposit.Perhaps the “wronged” party would simply have their costs covered, or maybe they would get the entire deposit as compensation.Notably, the government’s recently updated online guides to buying and selling a house both refer to “reservation agreements” and explicitly talk about compensation.However, it seems likely that different types will be trialled. For example, some might involve only the buyer putting down money.What might be acceptable – and unacceptable – reasons for pulling out? Acceptable reasons might include a bereavement, losing your job or an inability to obtain a mortgage. Presumably, a buyer would have to be able to pull out without penalty if the survey came back with serious structural problems or similar – but coming up with a workable definition of a bad survey could be a challenge.Unacceptable reasons for a buyer to pull out are likely to include reducing an offer at the last minute, while for a seller they would presumably include accepting someone else’s higher offer.How much is this going to cost? There’s no clarity on that yet – it could be a small percentage of the purchase price or a flat fee and could depend on where in the country you are.A news report this week on website Estate Agent Today suggested that some of the agreements tested may involve a non-returnable deposit of £500 put down by the buyer, some may require £1,000, and some may not involve any initial payment.If the amount is set too low, a seller in a buoyant market, whose house is going up in value almost by the day, may decide to take the hit because they could get more by accepting a higher offer than they would lose by defaulting on the agreement.But if the amount is set too high, it could be unaffordable for those such as first-time buyers who are already under pressure to amass a deposit and meet all the other costs.Will I get my money back? As outlined above, it may be that the deposit is non-returnable. Or it might be that you pay a non-refundable fee but get your deposit back if everything goes to plan.So what about this trial? The government commissioned consumer research and, assuming this comes back positive, a pilot scheme to trial the agreements will be launched in a number of areas across the UK. This could happen as early as the first quarter of next year.“This research, which is still under way, will help inform our decision on whether to roll out reservation agreements as part of a trial, potentially as early as next year,” says the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government, which seems to be trying to dial down the excitement on this.Phil Spencer, who presents Channel 4’s Location, Location, Location and is co-founder of advice website Move iQ, believes the pilot “would be a welcome step forward”.Does anything like this exist already? Yes. Spencer promotes Gazeal, a property technology company that offers a reservation agreement allowing buyers and sellers to lock in their deal with a legally binding arrangement."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a9e2e240ef261b5bd3e7719f00eb807868e63993/0_211_3456_2074/master/3456.jpg?width=1010\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=1096479b5991a1fa23d25ea58a1cbfbc 2020w","title":"pond best track this week","story":"This week we’ve got a psych-disco banger, a slice of sensual and sultry pop, and ‘a love song between a spider and a moth’Once more, we imagine how brilliant Tame Impala would be if Pond’s Nick Allbrook never left.

Now, 30 of his songs are getting a second life from ShakespeareEven in a completely empty theatre, Max Martin manages to disappear, choosing to perch himself on the back row, almost completely hidden in shadow. If you didn’t know whom you were looking for, you would assume the long-haired, 48-year-old Swede, dressed in a black T-shirt, was taking a break from shifting props for that night’s performance of the new jukebox musical \u0026amp Juliet.It seems inconceivable that someone so unassuming could have dominated pop music for more than 20 years, but the statistics speak for themselves. Martin has co-written and co-produced 73 US Top 10 singles for the likes of Taylor Swift, Ariana Grande, Katy Perry and Britney Spears. Twenty-two went to No 1, with 12 also topping the UK charts. Collectively, these have sold more than 150m copies globally, earning Martin an Oscar nomination, five Grammys and the 2016 Polar Music prize (previously won by Bob Dylan and Patti Smith). Martin’s 22 US No 1s make him the third-most successful songwriter in US chart history, behind only Paul McCartney (32) and John Lennon (26).He is the man who introduced the imperishable, if occasionally linguistically questionable, choruses “Hit me baby one more time”, “I kissed a girl and I liked it” and “Backstreet’s back, all right!” to karaoke booths everywhere, with songs that were at once dramatic, melancholic and never less than relentlessly catchy. The hugely ambitious \u0026amp Juliet – a modern re-telling of Shakespeare’s Romeo \u0026amp Juliet in which Juliet decides not to kill herself , but to head to Paris in order to live a little – is woven expertly around 30 of these hits, originally written for artists ranging from Celine Dion to ‘NSync, the Weeknd to Pink.Martin hardly ever gives interviews. “I’m not a shy person,” he clarifies as we sit in one of Manchester Opera House’s tiny bars, his accent a mix of Swedish and the Los Angeles drawl of his adopted home. “I just like to stay in the background as much as possible.”Ever since he earned his first US Top 10 hit in 1997 by co-writing and co-producing fellow Swede Robyn’s Do You Know (What It Takes), Martin has been a self-confessed “studio nerd tucked away in a basement somewhere”. One rock star due to get the Max treatment assumed the quiet man he had met was an engineer and asked him when Martin was due to arrive.We are joined by the writer of \u0026amp Juliet’s book, David West Read, who, much to Martin’s delight, has shown up in a vintage Britney T-shirt. “You’re about to find out I love talking,” Martin continues, popping a snus (a moist tobacco bag, popular in Sweden) under his top lip. “We’ve been putting a lot of work into \u0026amp Juliet and it’s a new field for me, so I don’t mind talking about this.”Martin had been toying with the idea of a jukebox musical for years, inspired by Abba’s global behemoth, Mamma Mia! If a feminist retelling of a Shakespeare soundtracked by Spears sounds like the work of someone who has just had a bump to the head, well, that is because it is. “I had hit my head on a kitchen cabinet and couldn’t look at screens or light for a while,” West Read says (he was concussed). “So I made a playlist of Max’s catalogue and realised that so many of the songs are about young love … of course Romeo \u0026amp Juliet came to mind.”As well as getting involved in the auditions and workshops, Martin also recorded the cast album. “I couldn’t be like: ‘Oh, just do it,’” he says. “A lot of the songs were written with the artists and co-writers, and so I feel responsible for all these people that have been involved throughout my career.” It also represented something that has perhaps been missing from his, as he calls it, “day job”: risk. If you have done it all, your songs turning Swift, Perry and Grande into superstars, where do you go next? “There was so much for me to learn here,” he smiles. “It’s easy to go on autopilot. If I’m feeling uncomfortable then that’s probably where I should be, rather than in a place where I’m like: ‘I totally got this.’”The foundations for Martin’s empire were laid during an apprenticeship with Denniz PoP, whose 90s productions for Ace of Base had become international hits. Martin (born Karl Martin Sandberg in Stockholm) had played the French horn at school when he met PoP (born Dag Krister Volle) he was the frontman of It’s Alive, a Kiss-inspired glam rock band. Discerning that Sandberg had an ear for pop music, PoP – a fan of pseudonyms – rechristened him Max Martin and employed him as a songwriter and producer at his Stockholm powerhouse, Cheiron studios. Cheiron’s records would fuse R\u0026ampB grooves with happysad Abba-esque melodies. The former glam rocker Martin brought an edge of bombast and some weapons-grade melodies, soon employed on records for the Backstreet Boys and the British boyband Five.PoP died of cancer in August 1998, two months before the release of what may be Martin’s most famous creation. ... Baby One More Time, which he wrote singlehandedly, got to No 1 in just about every country it was released. But it almost came to nothing. The demo, Martin remembers, sat lying around for “maybe six months, a year” and attempts were made to pitch it to “really established artists”. Eventually the Backstreet Boys’ label, Jive, offered it to their new signing, Spears. “When I heard her singing, I just knew instantly,” he says. “The way she recorded that song, she added another dimension.”Among the artists who turned it down were TLC, assuming that the line “Hit me baby one more time” advocated domestic violence. Martin and his fellow Swedes at Cheiron had meant it simply as slang for “call me”. Other Martin lyrics of the era also presented problems for West Read when he was weaving them into \u0026amp Juliet. “It’s really kind of confusing,” he says of the Backstreet Boys’ I Want it That Way, a song that seems to undermine itself at every turn.“You know that’s a thing, right?” Martin beams proudly. “Like: ‘What does it mean?’ There were forums of people discussing it.”While the grammatical error that appears in Ariana Grande’s 2014 EDM stomper Break Free (“Now that I’ve become who I really are”) may have been placed there on purpose – including a “juicy line” that sticks in the listener’s memory is a very Max Martin move – the Backstreet Boys song is a clearer example of Martin’s obsession with words serving the melody, a concept he calls “melodic math”.“Growing up, I listened to songs by Abba, Elton John, the Beatles, and I had no idea what they meant, so to me phonetics have always been important,” he explains. “I felt something hearing this music, and it meant something to me. If you can have a great lyric that also phonetically sounds amazing, then you’re golden. But it’s also kind of cool if you write a song and people are emotionally moved without understanding what’s being said. That, to me, is as powerful.”You can hear this technique on Taylor Swift’s Shake It Off, for example. “That’s a mathematical way of thinking, it’s not about doing it by feel,” he concedes. “But if it’s flowing, you don’t need any of that stuff.” He thinks for a moment. “Also, if there was a hard rule then all of my songs would be huge and, trust me, they’re not.”Martin’s early hit rate largely depended on Spears. A handful of their collaborations forms the backbone of \u0026amp Juliet, tracing a narrative arc that runs from ... Baby One More Time’s “my loneliness is killing me” to Stronger’s assertive declaration of the opposite (“My loneliness ain’t killing me no more”). Did you allow yourself a little high five in the studio when you linked those two songs? “Er … maybe,” he laughs, self-effacing as ever.He sighs. “I’m so thankful that someone actually still wants that job. I’ve seen it many many times, what fame does. And it goes back to why I don’t do interviews. Especially now with social media: our lives are on display all the time and when you’re famous it’s on a whole other level. We’re not made to be that famous, it’s not normal. It’s not in our DNA.”His more recent work with the likes of Normani and Grande have seen him embrace the fact that pop’s pendulum has swung away from pop and towards R\u0026ampB and hip-hop, a shift that – when it happened in the early 00s with the rise of Pharrell Williams’s songwriting and production outfit the Neptunes – briefly knocked Martin off course. Does he have similar concerns this time?Suddenly, the musical’s in-house band starts up next door, a sign that Martin is free to stop doing something he is still learning to love. As we get up to leave, we are joined by a PR who needs to speak to Martin about that evening’s opening press night. One-sided discussions are had about red carpets, photographers and local press, with Martin looking increasingly nervous. “I can still arrive via the side door right?” he says, edging back into the shadows.\u0026amp Juliet transfers to the Shaftesbury Theatre, London on 2 November. The cast recording is released on 15 November.Martin’s landmark hits, by Ben Beaumont-Thomas1996: Backstreet Boys – Quit Playing Games (With My Heart)His production would get more sophisticated – the claps sound like the punching sounds from Street Fighter 2 – but the songwriting is already rock solid on his first US Top 10 single.1998: ‘NSync – I Want You BackWith this and Tearin’ Up My Heart, Martin cemented his style of keeningly melancholic minor-key pop despite their crotch-grabbing tempos, they are among the most savagely sad breakup songs ever.1998: Britney Spears – ... Baby One More TimeThe shamelessly provocative video helped her break through, but the song is what matters: one second and three piano notes was all it took to become unforgettable.2004: Kelly Clarkson – Since U Been GoneMartin’s ultra-synthetic pop was innovated out of the zeitgeist by R\u0026ampB, so he wisely took a different tack. Strident, compressed guitars now underpinned his biggest hits, including another breakup masterpiece with Kelly Clarkson, as well as a string of songs with Pink.2008: Katy Perry – I Kissed a GirlBy riffing on a bit of classic pop – Gary Glitter’s Rock’n’Roll Part 2, currently causing controversy in Joker – and adding Perry’s lipstick lesbianism, Martin created one of his most muscular, brilliant hits.2012: Taylor Swift – We Are Never Ever Getting Back TogetherMartin runs the acoustic guitars forwards then reverses them, the perfect sonic symbol for Swift stepping back from country and facing forward into pure pop.2014: Ariana Grande feat Iggy Azalea– ProblemIn Grande, Martin found a Britney-level foil: someone adept at both his traditional melancholia as well as exuberant sass. A string of brilliantly varied hits ensued.2016: Justin Timberlake – Can’t Stop the Feeling!With this good angel to the coke-snorting devil that is the Weeknd’s Can’t Feel My Face, another Martin smash the same year, the producer brought an ass-shaking disco sensibility to the middle of the decade.2019: Sam Smith – How Do You Sleep?With Grande, Martin has helped to define pop’s current dominant mode, where intimacy and sensuality is prized over trashy bombast, and yet still works in the club. This cut with Sam Smith is a beautiful example."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8215b3df20901c6054eb0dd94335b599f6e2125a/0_0_5336_3201/master/5336.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bb11ec463087a8a88915762d47651bf7","title":"labour poised to block offer of 12 december general election","story":"MPs may be told to abstain in Monday’s vote, with Jeremy Corbyn to make call on FridayLabour appears poised to block Boris Johnson’s offer of a pre-Christmas general election on 12 December by telling MPs to abstain in Monday’s vote.The party previously said that it would back an early election when a no-deal Brexit scenario could be firmly ruled out, and has twice rejected attempts by Johnson to go to the polls before 2022.But Jeremy Corbyn told the BBC he still wants to make sure a no-deal Brexit is taken off the table. It is understood that he will make a final decision on how to instruct MPs once the EU27 have confirmed what extension the UK will be offered.One Labour MP said they had been told they could abstain or vote against the motion for an election.Corbyn said: “No deal is a threat that Boris Johnson has been using all along, and indeed it’s included in his legislation that’s before parliament at the moment, the legislation that he’s paused.The prime minister said an election was needed to try to help the country move on after parliament voted for his Brexit deal but rejected the timetable for scrutinising it and asked for more time.Johnson’s offer is to allow MPs to debate his EU withdrawal bill agreement until 6 November. He will ask them to vote in favour of this option on Monday with a motion under the Fixed Term Parliaments Act.Labour MP Barry Sheerman said the party would not be bounced into an election and the earliest they should consider is next spring. He said: ‘“I think it’s crazy to agree to this. This is a usual Boris tactic of trying to bounce us into a Brexit election and we aren’t buying that. I’d want a post-Brexit election on the economy and health and everything that really matters.“We had a meeting of the parliamentary Labour party two weeks ago where right across the range of opinion in the party we said we wouldn’t support an early election.”However, Momentum, the campaigning group that supports Corbyn, said it would back an election now, though it was not specific about whether it wanted MPs to back Johnson’s offer.Laura Parker, Momentum’s national coordinator, said: “Bring it on. Our campaign will see tens of thousands of people talk to millions of voters across the country. In 2017 Momentum’s campaign swung key seats for Labour. This time we’re going to run the biggest people-powered campaign the country has ever seen.”Corbyn denied that Labour’s position on a general election was confused, given that they have consistently said they want voters to go to the polls to oust the Tories.He said: “We are not resisting the chance to have an election. We want an election because we want to take our case to the people of this country, but we do not want this country to be in any danger of crashing out of the EU without a deal because of all the damage that will do to jobs, services and trade all over this country.”He said rather than keeping Johnson in office by not backing an election, Labour was holding him to account and continually defeating the government in parliament.The Labour leader also declined to answer questions on recent polling for Labour, which puts them behind the Tories.In the hours leading up to Johnson’s offer, Corbyn’s most senior ally, the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, was upbeat about the prospect of a winter election.At lunchtime on Thursday, McDonnell said he was ready for an election “whenever”, but the party had been trying to pressure the government into giving them more time to scrutinise the Brexit deal to make sure there were better protections for the economy, jobs and living standards.He also appeared to suggest that he wanted to see an amendment added that would enable the deal to go to a public vote. “We’re being accused all the time trying to prevent the Brexit process happening. We’re not,” McDonnell said. “We’re just saying we want a proper process, but that must include the ability to put amendments up and an amendment up to enable it to go back to the people.”McDonnell added that he was not worried about Labour’s chances or the unusual time of year. “I want a majority Labour government and I think that’s what we’ll get. It’s a bit cold. Anything could happen … I’ve ordered a winter coat.“My preference is to get an agreement in which we could consider the bill properly, but I’m always up for an election whenever it comes and I’ve got my winter coat ready.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d81e8671f3d64a281e1deec42b12545590ccee1f/0_406_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dc5fc4060a7ee02c528f0229e4fe9f36","title":"talking horses punter gutted as 189000 case turned down by ibas","story":"David Smith says that circumstances show he clearly intended to include Bialco in a bet in June, when he wrote BailaricoA 60-year-old punter from Loughborough says he is “gutted” that the betting arbitrator IBAS has ruled against him in a dispute with Betfred worth £189,000. David Smith was paid £23,000 for a six-horse bet he placed in June, as five of the horses won, but believes he should have had £212,000 on the grounds that he clearly intended to include Bialco, a winner, rather than Bailarico, the bet’s only loser.Smith says he confused himself over the similarly named horses. But he wrote “2.15 P” next to Bailarico’s name on the betting slip, a reference to the 2.15pm race at Perth which Bialco won, whereas Bailarico was third in the 3.40pm at Goodwood. He also wrote Bialco’s odds, 7-4, next to Bailarico’s name, while Bailarico was 10-1 at the time.But IBAS ruled there was no ambiguity, in that Smith had clearly written Bailarico’s name, and the bet therefore had to be settled on that horse, in line with established bookmaker practice of giving precedence to the horse name stated on a slip over other details, a precedence also referred to in Betfred’s rules.“I really am gutted by this,” said Smith, who wants to appeal. “It was so obvious which bet I wanted. They didn’t look at my case at all, really. They’ve just looked at Betfred’s case.”Fairhead added: “In terms of fairness, there’s a solid argument here for acknowledging it could be one of two horses and therefore the stakes should be split. There’s nobody who could look at this dispute and say Betfred have treated that customer fairly.”Arguing that it is not too late for Betfred to do the right thing by Smith, Fairhead said he would even give up his longstanding Twitter handle, BoycottBetfred, if the firm did so.But, for now, his argument is with IBAS, as he pointed to a decision it made this summer, in which, for once, it decided against strict application of a bookmaker rule. That was a Lucky 63 naming five winners at the Cheltenham Festival, with a unit stake of 50 cents in the ‘win’ box but a total stake of €63 for a bet that should only have cost half that.The punter argued this should be settled as an overstaked bet under Paddy Power’s rules, in which case it would be treated as if his unit stake was €1 to win. But IBAS referred instead to surrounding circumstances in deciding it should be settled at 50 cents each-way, saving the bookmaker tens of thousands in the payout.“I’m just astonished at the inconsistencies in their rulings,” Fairhead said. “The point of IBAS is to make sure people are treated fairly and avoid the need for a court case.”Hurray for the return of Cheltenham and hurray in particular for fancied runners from the Fergal O’Brien yard, which has proved profitable to follow at the great track over the years. Today, O’Brien fields Benny’s Bridge (5.30) in the closing handicap hurdle and the 7-2 is acceptable, though well done to you if you got that bit of 8-1 that was briefly offered last night.This race is for conditional jockeys and O’Brien may be a force in those over the next few months as he tries to help the capable Connor Brace in the conditional jockeys title race. Bennys Bridge won a better race than this here in January and is not to be harshly judged for two subsequent defeats in very valuable contests at Sandown. He remains well treated.Meldrum Lad (3.10) is such a good price for an earlier handicap hurdle that I’m rather put off him. Admittedly, this is his first run over hurdles for years but he is lightly raced for his age and has looked well handicapped since joining Justin Landy. At 33-1, he has each-way potential, even in a hot-looking race.Pick of the card at soggy Newbury may be Teruntum Star (4.35), formerly a very useful handicapper for Kevin Ryan and now threatening a comeback with David Griffiths. He ran well over five furlongs twice this month but today’s six might be more like it and 14-1 is fine."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/49b6e13e410c32800e5663e9df4c5d9621721689/82_0_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a7718aa3b4be98c226e340c6b1beb040","title":"hannah gadsby review nanette follow up doesnt surprise but delights","story":"New Theatre, OxfordFollowing the success of her 2017 smash hit, the Australian comedian returns triumphant with a confident routine about her dog, her body and her out-and-proud neuroersityHannah Gadsby’s not in America any more: she leaves an applause break after the first mention of her smash hit show Nanette, and no applause comes. But Nanette is why we’re all here. A fierce exposé of the trauma and abuse (homophobic, sexist) she’d sublimated in her standup, that tense anti-comedy became a totem of the #MeToo movement and made her a global celebrity. It’s also guaranteed her biggest ever audience for this follow-up, Douglas, which toured the US and now arrives in the UK. But “if Nanette brought you here,” asks Gadsby, “what the fuck do you want out of tonight?”In a real coup, she begins the show by telling us what we’re going to get. Post-support act but pre-interval, Gadsby offers up an itinerary of the set she’s about to deliver. There will be an anecdote about walking her dog, an awkward sex story, and some “gentle, good-natured needling of the patriarchy”. She’ll indulge in a little “hate-baiting”, winding up the trolls who branded Nanette a “lecture”. And there’ll be a big reveal, about Gadsby’s recently diagnosed autism – which we’ll have to pretend she hasn’t just told us about.It’s a superlative opening, predicting not just when we’ll laugh but how, and inverting the usual structure that places big callback laughs at the end of the show. It’s got chutzpah in spades, as Gadsby revels in (and sends up) the confidence accrued from Nanette’s success. And – as an example of organising, sequencing and avoiding surprises – it tees up the show’s theme, which is Gadbsy’s out-and-proud neuroersity.The show lives up to the preamble. It finds Gadsby having more fun than she did in its predecessor, without stinting on Nanette’s key qualities of angry anti-sexism and fierce assertiveness of her right to be herself. Even ardent Nanette-bashers would have to acknowledge Gadsby’s skill in combining laugh-heavy standup with trenchant argument, as her goofy story about oversharing on a dog walk shines a light on men’s zeal for claiming and naming things. The pill? “Balls” for testicles? The so-called Pouch of Douglas, a cavity between the rectum and the uterus? Gadsby is indignant – and funny – about all of them.The subject of her autism is introduced via an anecdote about school-age Gadsby missing the point – by a wide margin – in a lesson on prepositions. Finally, the show proposes her autism as an answer to what Gadsby’s comedy is – neither lecture nor monologue, but an autistic woman’s way of sharing her idiosyncratic perspective. This is demonstrated via an irreverent art history tour, singling out (usually chauvinist) details in Renaissance painting. Elsewhere, there’s less idiosyncratic material, in a middle section where Gadsby proves “I don’t need hormones to be unreasonable” by grouching about Where’s Wally? and men who golf. An attack on anti-vaxxers, however justifiable, is distinguished more by heat than light.But Douglas remains a rich and entertaining show from Gadsby, one that achieves the impressive feat of both living up to Nanette and moving on from it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3a1a41be6c78b8c655debe3005e8eca000b80ccc/468_235_3800_2280/master/3800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c25d512164fae948b32d554c47eb588e","title":"mold riots review","story":"Various locations, MoldA brass band, choir and cast of more than 100 gathered for a heartfelt re-enactment of a dark day that left four people deadPerformed in the town’s streets and squares, Mold Riots, written by Bethan Marlow and directed by Katie Posner, is a promenade performance that restages the riots that took place there in June 1869. Four people were killed when the military opened fire on a crowd protesting at the sentencing of two miners, jailed for allegedly attacking the manager of a local colliery after workers’ wages were cut.Acted and sung with commitment and aplomb by a community cast of more than 100 (with a particularly game lineup of children), a choir, a brass band and four guest actors – Gethin Alderman, Lauren Fitzpatrick, Amy Forrest and Kai Owen – it’s an impressive feat, technically and theatrically.Whether in nuanced scenes of drama, or as parts of arresting physical sequences directed by Natasha Harrison, or even simply herding the audience from one location to the next, the community cast was completely present and vital throughout. The evening’s greatest strength was a clear sense of collective ownership that the performers have of the work – both the story and its telling.With the dialogue shifting fluidly between English and untranslated Welsh, tensions between communities and classes were effectively threaded throughout. It all ended a little too neatly with an earnest call for peaceful coexistence, but this was a persuasive act of recognition, allowing us, if only temporarily, to occupy the streets and stand in places where usually we cannot, to hear the stories that would otherwise have been unheard."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9e9f74510ad61b0b22176e9950b53fc1ec98f909/0_278_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2c6d963d05e30cbe086b8b65f097231e","title":"tiktok foreign interference chuck schumer tom cotton","story":"Chuck Schumer and Tom Cotton urged inquiry, noting app reportedly censors material such as Hong Kong protest contentChuck Schumer, the most senior Democrat in the Senate, has urged the government to investigate TikTok, describing the China-owned social media app as “a potential counter-intelligence threat we cannot ignore” and warning it could be used to interfere in US elections.TikTok, which allows users to share short videos online, has enjoyed wild success since it launched in 2017, and has been downloaded more than 1bn times.They wrote: “TikTok reportedly censors materials deemed politically sensitive to the Chinese Communist party, including content related to the recent Hong Kong protests, as well as references to Tiananmen Square, Tibetan and Taiwanese independence, and the treatment of the Uighurs.“The platform is also a potential target of foreign influence campaigns like those carried out during the 2016 election on US-based social media platforms.”But in September the  revealed how ByteDance, the Beijing-headquartered technology company that owns TikTok, is using the app to further Chinese foreign policy aims abroad.

Vodafone, Singapore Airlines and Intel are among other companies to have used similar systems.A citizens’ jury convened by the charity to explore AI concluded that the growing practice needed independent regulation and warned of public anger at “tech creep” unless citizens were given a greater role in designing systems.Last week the United Nations special rapporteur Philip Alston said the world risked “stumbling zombie-like into a digital welfare dystopia” in which artificial intelligence and other technologies were used to target, surveil and punish the poorest people. reported on how the UK’s Department for Work and Pensions was accelerating the development of welfare robots for use in its flagship universal credit system, and how more than 100 councils were using predictive analytics and other artificial intelligence systems to aid interactions with their citizens.“New technologies are being adopted at a rapid pace, and regulators and the public are struggling to keep up,” said Asheem Singh, acting head of tech and society at the RSA.“An increasing amount of decision-making – in our public services, the job market and healthcare – is taking place via ever-more opaque processes. This is a source of anxiety for the general public. The measures we are proposing – such as a new watchdog to scrutinise decisions made by AI on behalf of the public – are crucial first steps in increasing clarity and accountability.”Last month in a report commissioned by the government’s Centre for Data Ethics and Innovation, the Royal United Services Institute, a security thinktank, warned of “unfair discrimination” by data analytics and algorithms in policing. Meanwhile, the high court ruled that South Wales police’s use of facial recognition software was legal, despite a claim it breached data protection and equality laws.The RSA panel spent four days examining the spread of AI and automated decision-making into recruitment, healthcare and policing. Members of the panel voiced hopes that algorithms could make fairer, less-biased decisions on things such as pay rises or promotions, and that facial recognition programmes might be more objective than human police officers.But they raised questions about whether automated decision systems would reinforce an organisation’s existing profile, for example as traditionally white and male, and how the public would know the technology was being used.The jury was convened by the RSA in collaboration with DeepMind, a London-based AI firm owned by Google’s parent company, Alphabet.Unilever is using software from a US-company, HireVue, in the UK and abroad, having first trialled it in 2017. HireVue has previously said the software scans the language that candidates use – for example, active or passive phrases, tone of voice and speed of delivery – as well as facial expressions such as furrowed brows, smiles and eye-widening.“It is helping to save 100,000 hours of interviewing time and roughly $1m in recruitment costs each year for us globally,” said a Unilever spokeswoman. “It is, however, just one of many tools we use for our graduate recruitment.”She said video interviews were optional and candidates were asked to allow or disallow automated decision-making being used to evaluate their video interview. They were sent information about how to prepare beforehand and could choose to speak to a “talent adviser” instead if they preferred.The system is now used across Unilever’s entire graduate recruitment programme, and HireVue claims it has resulted in a more ethnically and gender-erse workforce.Unilever said that at the early stage in the recruitment process when HireVue was used, it was not compulsory for candidates to give their gender or ethnicity so it was not able to provide representative data.

The seemingly standard blue-and-white patterned china dish, on closer inspection, includes this tiny message. Behind me is a lamp with rabbit feet and ears and, by the reception, beaded Darth Vader helmets top birdcage-style cabinets. Across the restaurant’s black ceiling, graffiti by graphic designer and artist Beniloys is a mix of bright patterns and ancient city rules: “A Freeman of the City of London may drive a flock of sheep over Tower Bridge.” In the basement, not a gym, but two karaoke rooms with 50s-style microphones.It’s these design touches that make Mama Shelter different from other city hotels of the same size. The brand was created by Club Med co-founders the Trigano family and designer Philippe Starck in 2008, and there are now 12 globally. The group’s first UK hotel is a prominent, matt-black building with black-and-white striped awnings on a corner of Hackney Road, near Bethnal Green. The ground floor is a living space that doubles as the restaurant, with comfy sofas, Aztec prints, ceiling-mounted fireplaces and vintage lampshades. It’s a cabinet of curiosities with a buzzy, already popular restaurant and internal courtyard cocktail bar with a retractable roof. There are 194 en suite rooms, across four floors. Mine, a medium double on the second floor, is compact, modern and unfussy.What about breakfast and dinner?Food is made for sharing at Mama Shelter, with a variety of smaller plates and platters, some influenced by the local area. My favourites include pork belly baos with char siu sauce, pak choi and ginger (£6) tuna crudo with pickled kohlrabi, ponzu and calamansi dressing (£12) and a truffle ricotta pizzette (£9). Larger plates on the menu range from French classics and vegan dishes, to posh kebabs and a pie, mash and liquor platter (£26).There’s a lot of choice at the buffet breakfast (7am-10.30am a la carte breakfast 10.30am-12.30pm): big trays of smoked salmon, pastries, muffins, cereals, yoghurt, a juice-it-yourself stand, and all the usual cooked suspects along with a vegan bean mix in tomato sauce and flavoured rice. It’s not included in the room rate, however – it costs £15pp – and there are a multitude of cafes to explore along Hackney Road and Cambridge Heath Road.What’s on the doorstep?Cambridge Heath Overground (two stops from Liverpool Street) is a few minutes’ walk, or get to Bethnal Green, on the Central line, in 10. E Pellicci (open since 1900) is the classic choice for a fry-up and two famous 24-hour bagel shops are on Brick Lane. Take a wander around east London favourites such as Columbia Road Flower Market, Broadway Market, and Hackney City Farm. The V\u0026ampA’s Museum of Childhood is also just a few minutes’ walk away, or head to indie gallery land Vyner Street. There are plenty of places to drink, ranging from traditional boozers to taprooms and speakeasies. Notables include the award-winning Marksman pub or Sager + Wilde under the railway arches. For late-night beats, head to Oval Space and the Pickle Factory, or polis for LGBTQ parties.How much?Doubles from £99 room-only. Two-course dinner for two from around £60.What’s it like?To get to “London’s first mindful boutique hotel”, as Inhabit calls itself, I walk from Paddington station, mid-construction frenzy, along some of the capital’s least zen streets, past fast-food joints, souvenir shops and roadworks. The hotel, set across six Georgian townhouses, is covered in scaffolding (the hotel is still in a soft-opening phase) but once I’m through the door, Inhabit’s Scandi-inspired interior dotted with plants exudes calmness.The first thing I notice is the wellness programme at the front desk (of which more later) the reception, dominated by a woollen wall hanging, leads into the library, painted grey and blue, and furnished with Danish chairs, and bespoke pieces by Goldfinger Factory, a local social enterprise. Cushions are by Hertfordshire-based Aerende, which sells homewares made by vulnerable people in the UK. The hotel is clearly paying more than lip service in its commitment to wellbeing, thinking about its responsibilities beyond its guests: during the renovation, a link-up with Globechain helped reduce the amount of waste sent to landfill in keeping with its aim to be single-use plastic free there’s bottled water on tap on each floor and re-useable glass coffee cups for sale in reception.Daily wellness sessions include morning meditation (free), yoga (£10 a class) and guided walks (£10) into nearby Hyde Park. This week, meditation pods with headphones are being installed providing a space for guests to have a 10-minute guided session. I’m booked in for a Yin yoga class, which involves lying down for a series of very gentle stretches – or “constructive rest” as the teacher puts it. It does the trick: the muscle tightness after a day sat in front of a computer screen disappears. A session in the infrared sauna (free) compounds my sense of relaxation. I’m all set for an early night – and to see if Casper mattresses live up to the hype.What about breakfast and dinner?Food is by Yeotown Kitchen – a spin-off of the Devon-based luxury retreat of the same name – and is mainly plant-based, healthy and seasonal. Instead of the usual cereals and pastries, the breakfast buffet offers rice porridge with coconut milk, roast vegetables and frittata. I pour what I think is orange juice but get a surprise when I take a slug of tart, tumeric-infused ginger “elixir”. I decide I like it. Tumeric appears in several of the à la carte breakfast dishes, too (such as eggs royale, which comes with a dairy-free hollandaise, smoked salmon optional, £9).Smashed avo is a given, of course, but there are more exotic dishes too that take almost as long to say as to eat: orange blossom tigernut-flour muffin-top pancakes with coconut yoghurt and berry compote, for one. The drinks are even more intriguing: a “medicinal mushroom latte” made with mushrooms and maple syrup. I have a moment picturing Patsy from Ab Fab ordering a smoothie the morning after the night before, and I admit, I ordered a plain old coffee with normal milk, but as more of us give up meat or take a flexitarian approach, it’s refreshing to see a hotel offering something other than croissants and fry-ups. If you’re on the hotel’s room-only rate, and don’t want to pay to eat breakfast in (£15 for the buffet or dishes from £6 on the a la carte menu), there are plenty of nearby options: giant sticky pastries at Bonne Bouche on Praed Street, and an array of artisan coffee shops around Paddington Basin and Little Venice, including the Department of Coffee and Social Affairs and Beany Green. From next month the hotel restaurant will offer a dinner menu (until 9pm). Until then recommended restaurants are in your room directory.What’s on the doorstep?Some of London’s most tranquil spots are within walking distance: Hyde Park is a 10-minute stroll south, with acres to explore plus the Serpentine Gallery, the swimming and boating lake and Princess Diana Memorial Fountain and Kensington Palace is in the adjoining in Kensington Gardens. Walk by the water from Paddington Basin (now a popular SUP spot) to Little Venice, another enclave where you almost forget you’re in the city a stroll north-east along the canal, past John Nash’s grand Regent’s Park houses and London Zoo, brings you to Camden.How much?Doubles from £150 room-only.Value for money?The area has cheaper options if a bed for the night is all that’s needed (relative newcomer Pilgrm, for example) but I checked out feeling like I’d been on a mini-retreat – and that seemed like a result considering I hadn’t left London.• inhabithotelsIsabel ChoatWhat’s it like?A handsome 200-year-old pub on the Harrow Road, which had already been a main highway out of London for centuries when this establishment opened during the year of William IV’s death in 1837. Ground-floor spaces now flow into one linked bar and dining area, where low lighting gleams off polished wood and the patina of vintage-style leather sofas. Nautical knick-knacks, including splendid model ships, are a nod to the eponymous monarch, called the Sailor King.Three venerable Harrow Road pubs closed recently for redevelopment as flats, so the determination of the William IV’s new owners late last year to recreate a pub from what had become a shisha bar, DJ venue and grotty bedsits is to be applauded. The 15 spacious en suite rooms are plain and simple, with feature fireplaces and pale walls. They have carpets so thick you could almost sleep on them rather than in the comfy beds. White tile-and-marble bathrooms are also minimalist. Ask for a room at the back if you’re a light sleeper: the Harrow Road traffic is noisy.What about breakfast and dinner?The walk along Harrow Road from Kensal Green station (Bakerloo line and Overground) yields not a single cafe, pub or restaurant, so the imaginative gastropub-style menu is particularly welcome. A starter of wild mushrooms with crispy kale and white bean hummus (£5) is so tasty I forget it’s vegan, and my husband’s chorizo and cannellini on sourdough is like beans on toast’s more delicious self. Sunday lunch is particularly good, with meat for the whole table on big platters, with tureens of veg. Dorothy’s Gin Garden offers outdoor seating, exotic gins on display and an interesting cocktail list.Breakfast in the dining room is excellent: coffee, with sourdough bread and pastries, plus a good cold selection of cheeses, meats and fruit.What’s on the doorstep?Opposite stands verdant 72-acre Kensal Green cemetery, inspired by Paris’s Père Lachaise, with the Grand Union canal on one side. Notable residents include Isambard Kingdom Brunel, Wilkie Collins, Anthony Trollope, William Makepeace Thackeray and one WH Smith, “merchant”. The stucco mansions and leafy squares of Notting Hill are about a mile away. Buses run from outside the pub to Wembley Stadium (25 minutes).How much?Doubles from £110 B\u0026ampB.Value for money?Pretty good given the period surroundings and friendly welcome, particularly for those who need to be in west London.• williamiv.londonLiz BoulterWhat’s it like?A red-brick and stone building on Osborn Street at the bottom of curry mile Brick Lane. It’s a new venture by the people who run The Culpeper, less than 200 metres away on the corner of Commercial Street. The handsome late-Georgian building has been smartened up, with a bar-restaurant on the ground floor and 15 bedrooms spread over the upper four storeys. The bar area is now light and airy with floor-to ceiling windows, yet retains the feel of a pub – open doors, and stools round the bar, with a good view of the small open kitchen, and at a handful of high tables. Once the Archers Tavern, it has been renamed after Thomas Buxton, campaigner against slavery and capital punishment, co-founder of the RSPCA and all-round good egg, who lived up the street. The bedrooms are bijou, with a clean, functional feel: bare brick painted brilliant white, wiring hidden in aluminium tubes, TV, coffee and tea things on a small chest of drawers. The washbasin is in the room, making the shower and loo less of a squash – the obscured-glass sliding door on the looshower affords, well, only minimal privacy, however. Despite the urban location, double-glazed sash windows keep the night passably peaceful.What about breakfast and dinner?Busy leather-aproned chefs in the open kitchen produce modern European dishes from a short menu, including a fish of the day dependent on what has just been landed on the south coast. Bar snacks are a million miles from the East End’s traditional pickled eggs: rillettes (£5), terrine (£6), radishes with cod roe – though there is a portion of chips for £4. From four starters we choose a chilled pea soup (made extra special with perfectly roasted hazelnuts), and scallops with garlic butter and samphire. Equally seasonal is a plate of fresh tagliatelle with courgettes, ricotta and shaved raw asparagus. Husband’s fish of the day (£15) is a good-looking chunk of cod in a deeply sweet-savoury shellfish jus, but I do find the lack of any vegan main surprising given this is east London in 2019.Breakfast is equally imaginative – though with nothing for vegetarians or vegans: ham and eggs with ethereally light and crispy rösti for him, while I make a veggie option by declining the merguez sausage with my tasty harissa-baked eggs. Excellent coffee and nice pastries, though.What’s on the doorstep?It is Ramadan when we stay, so there is a celebratory air at sundown as Muslims break their fast and head to the mosque on Brick Lane, which is also, in sharp contrast, home to late-night bars and clubs such as Big Chill and 93 Feet East, as well as myriad curry houses and two famous bagel joints. By day, Petticoat Lane and Spitalfields markets are minutes away, as is Whitechapel Gallery.Value for money?Excellent, given the location close to the City and party-central Shoreditch, particularly with breakfast included.• thebuxtonLBWhat’s it like?On a dark, stormy Monday evening, the Red Lion is a welcoming beacon on a corner of Leytonstone High Road. Inside, to a 1960s soundtrack, we have a relaxed dinner, drink Malbec over Scrabble – and have the bonus of rolling into bed just upstairs. The pub’s 10 new bedrooms are finished in heritage-green tones with floral papered walls, heavy velvet drapes, exposed brickwork and antique furniture. My room is a superior double on the second floor, accessible via the main pub or a side door. It is boutique hotel meets Peaky Blinders: clean lines with 1920s details, unpretentiously cool and a little bit sexy. The room is at the front of the building, which, being on a night-bus route, proves noisy at times. The overall location, though, is great: just three minutes’ walk from Leytonstone tube station, which takes you to the city in 10 minutes.First established as a pub in 1670, the Red Lion has been through several incarnations – including a salsa bar and music venue, and was one of the first places Led Zeppelin played in London – before becoming a pub again in 2011. The building was rescued by Antic (the team behind pubs across London, among them the Dogstar DJ bar in Brixton) who gave the space a living-room vibe, with mismatched vintage seating and a big beer garden. There’s a quiz night on Mondays, DJs (Fri and Sat, 9pm-2am), and roasts served on Sundays.What about breakfast and dinner?The food is great. There are seasonal menus for lunch and dinner, plus bar snacks including cauliflower-cheese croquettes (£5.50) and venison-and-chorizo scotch eggs. We have the smoked mackerel paté with pickled beetroot (£6) mussels, in a creamy saffron and parsley sauce (£6) a pearl-barley risotto with slow-roast tomatoes, kale, baked ricotta, artichoke and beetroot crisps (£11) and a mammoth plate of sausage and mash with savoy cabbage and onion gravy (£8).Also on the menu, slow-cooked lamb ragu rigatoni (£12) a beetroot and quinoa burger with caramelised onions and goat’s cheese (£10) and a chocolate pot with rosemary biscuits and candied orange peel (£5.50). You can make tea and coffee in the rooms, but breakfast isn’t served here.What’s on the doorstep?For breakfast, the Wild Goose Bakery is a few doors down, or Le Petit Corner is a five-minute walk away on the same street. Head to nearby The Birds for themed, bottomless brunches peruse limited-run prints at Hooksmith Press and sip cocktails at the Heathcote and Star. A few miles down the road, in Walthamstow, the William Morris Gallery and Vestry House Museum provide culture between eating and drinking. Favourites here include Eat17, Orford Saloon tapas and In Vino Veritas wine bar, in the village And, close to God’s Own Junkyard neon art gallery, Ravenswood industrial estate has microbreweries and a gin palace.How much?Doubles from £83 room-only. Two-course dinner for two with wine, around £50.Value for money?For the location, yes, and dinner and drinks won’t break the bank, either.• theredlionleytonstoneAW This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

The strike will disrupt waste collection and trains, buses and trams, as well as schools, museums and pharmacies.Raggi urged the unions on Tuesday to cancel the strike “for the good of the city”, arguing that its citizens did not deserve the ensuing mayhem.With opposition politicians and residents calling for her to resign, as well as criticism from members of her own party, frustration over the city’s management is mounting.Massimo Tabacchiera, president of the Lazio unit of Confapi, the union representing small and medium industrial companies, said the strike originated from “a city that is tired and lacks perspective”. He added: “There has never been a plan for Rome and this administration continues to navigate only by undertaking small measures and neglecting every long-term infrastructure project.”Both the Democratic party and the far-right League have launched separate petitions seeking Raggi’s resignation. The League’s leader, Matteo Salvini, said 10,000 people had signed its petition within a few days.Rome’s residents have organised a “passive march” along the Tiber river on Saturday morning under the slogan “enough of Raggi”. The protest comes exactly a year after thousands demonstrated outside the local authority to decry the city’s scruffy condition. “Raggi’s administration has transformed the city into one to escape from instead of one that enables us to live with dignity,” the organisers wrote on a flyer advertising the protest.Some of Raggi’s initiatives have had a positive response, including introducing an Uber bike-sharing scheme, and recycling machines at three underground stations that people can use to exchange plastic bottles for metro tickets.Until recently, she continued to be backed by the party, but Vincenzo Spadafora, M5S’s minister of sport, admitted this week the administration of Rome had been “difficult” and that the whole party should take responsibility. Barbara Lezzi, an M5S senator, defended Raggi, arguing that she had “inherited the destruction that all other parties had committed over the course of decades”.Neither Raggi or her spokesperson were available for comment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/446f478600fbc246f3a93592a45ef4299ed7ddb5/0_0_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0f568bde9612cf86c2502603359d9f5d","title":"us military syria tanks oil fields","story":"The US is reportedly planning to deploy tanks and other heavy military hardware to protect oil fields in eastern Syria, in a reversal of Donald Trump’s earlier order to withdraw all troops from the country.The most likely destination for US armoured units is a Conoco gas plant near the city of Deir Ezzor, the site of a February 2018 clash between US special forces and Syrian regime-backed militias fighting with Russian mercenaries.Fox News reported such a deployment was “likely” and that the tanks would come from units already in the Middle East. CNN said it would happen relatively soon.Trump has justified his decision to stand US troops down to allow a Turkish offensive in north-eastern Syria at the cost of abandoning Kurdish partners, by saying he was “bringing the troops home”.However, it is quite likely it would take more troops to deploy, maintain, supply and protect armoured units in the middle of the eastern Syrian desert than the roughly 1,000 that were in the country before the Turkish invasion.The contradiction has been apparent in Trump’s remarks in recent days, in which he claimed the US had “secured the oil” even while withdrawing its forces.“It would mean walling off eastern Syria as a US zone,” Aaron Stein, director of the Middle East programme at the Foreign Policy Research Institute in Washington, said of the plan to put tanks around the Conoco plant. “You would have to protect it from the air. You have to supply it and then you have got to protect the road, presumably from Iraq. You can easily see a scenario where we end up with more troops in Syria than we started off with.”On Thursday, Trump added to the confusion on Thursday by tweeting: “Perhaps it is time for the Kurds to start heading to the oil region!”The remark seemed to endorse a population transfer from the Kurdish areas along the border with Turkey southwards to the almost entirely Sunni Arab area of Deir Ezzor. Such a mass displacement of Kurds from their homes would fit with Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s plans to resettle north-eastern Syria with Syrian Arab refugees to create a buffer zone against Kurdish insurgents. Kurdish refugees in Turkey are already reported to be subject to forcible deportation.“The president of the United States is now helping Turkey achieve ethnic cleansing by telling the Kurds to flee their homes,” former US ambassador to the UN Samantha Power said in a comment on Twitter.On Tuesday, Erdoğan struck a deal with Vladimir Putin on a 30km-deep “safe zone” in which Russian military police and Syrian border guards would oversee the withdrawal of armed Kurdish units from the area.Such mass demographic changes – carried out at the barrel of a gun – risk prolonging Syria’s multiple-front conflict indefinitely, said Jan Egeland, head of the Norwegian Refugee Council and the UN’s former humanitarian chief.“This was an area of relative stability, before all of these deals,” said Egeland, who was also the UN’s special adviser on Syria. “We need to remind all of these people with the power and the guns that this is no chessboard. It is a place where people live. There are two to three million civilians in this area. I cannot see how this can be a safe zone for long with so many different armed parties.”Egeland said about 180,000 people, half of them children, had been displaced as a consequence of the Turkish incursion. He added that Kurds arriving at overcrowded camps in Iraq said that many more would join the exodus from the north-east but could not afford to pay people-smugglers who charge hundreds of dollars per person.Egeland said the mass displacement of populations was being brought about as a consequence of “explosive, improvised deals”.“For many, the move will not be voluntary and they will displacing the original population there. No problems will be solved and new problems will be created,” he said.The US special envoy for Syria, James Jeffrey, admitted on Wednesday that “a bit more than 100 Isis detainees have escaped” from captivity as a result of the chaos triggered by the Turkish incursion. Trump claimed on the same day that the escaped Isis fighters had been “largely recaptured”. Jeffrey told Congress: “We do not know where they are.”There was also considerable uncertainty on Thursday of the fate of nearly 70,000 people, almost all women and children in the al-Hawl camp in north-eastern Syria. Some of them are families of Isis fighters, but many are civilians swept up in formerly Isis-run areas.The UN’s assistant secretary-general for humanitarian affairs, Ursula Mueller, said the situation in the camp was “desperate”. In a warning directed largely to western nations, Mueller said: “Member states have the primary responsibility for their own nationals, and policies and actions that lead to statelessness should be avoided.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/debd8bf4e072dc526b0f89775aee494692795626/0_198_2999_1802/master/2999.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=10ecc698d26f4e1e553ca112e6981b09","title":"passion is extreme new zealand rugby fans brace for world cup semi final","story":"Nerves, excitement and wall-to-wall coverage as All Blacks prepare to take on England in do-or-die match in JapanTwenty-four hours out from the do-or-die Rugby World Cup semi-final in Japan, All Blacks fans across New Zealand are beginning to feel a quiver of nervousness.The country’s state broadcaster assured fans on Thursday that the game would still broadcast on free-to-air TV despite its headquarters suffering smoke damage from a fire at the nearby Skycity convention centre. Meanwhile, watching parties are planned around the country, with a long weekend and 9pm kick-off delighting fans, many of whom must travel from remote areas to pubs and hotels to ensure they get decent coverage.One fan is so confident of an All Blacks win, he has already had a tattoo celebrating the victory inked, while those working night shifts are turning their phones, internet and TV off to avoid spoiling the outcome. As the game approaches, rugby talk has hit saturation point, with the New Zealand Herald examining the UK media’s analysis of the All Blacks and turning advertisements on its homepage black, while Stuff ran a national world cup “RWC Mood-O-Meter”, rating the current station of the nation as “No Worries”.At parliament house in Wellington politicians were also gearing up, with the speaker of the house, Trevor Mallard, donning a signed All Blacks jersey to deliver his weekly Facebook update.Sports and recreation minister and mega-fan Grant Robertson will be watching the game live at Yokohama Stadium and said he was beginning to feel jittery about the outcome.“Like I imagine a lot of New Zealanders will be, I am a bit nervous but I am also quietly confident the All Blacks are going to take the win,” Robertson said.“It’s always important with games at this stage of the World Cup to take nothing for granted – England will be giving it everything they’ve got, but so too will the ABs.”The prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, will be watching too. Following New Zealands win against Ireland last week she posted an Instagram picture of the victory.“We’re right behind you for the semis,” Ardern said.William Nelson, 27, a rugby fan from Hawkes Bay, said England was the only team who could potentially spell defeat for the All Blacks.“I’m much more nervous about this game than I was about Ireland – I think England are the only team that have a decent chance of beating us and I think whoever wins the semi-final will go on to win the World Cup,” Nelson said.“I’m excited too as I think it will be a super entertaining game. I just hope the game doesn’t get decided by a controversial referring call – but in saying that I’m glad we’ve got Nigel Owens as the referee – he’s the best referee in the game by a fair margin in my opinion.”Sports psychologist Steve Jackson has advised fans to keep expectations low to avoid disappointment.“People forget, they think the All Blacks are the favourites, but New Zealand has a lot less money and resources than many other countries,” Jackson said.“The All Blacks are actually the underdogs, they are expected to win, which is a lot of pressure, but the reality is they do amazingly well with very little. And I think trying to reframe things as ‘we’re the underdogs going in’ is probably a better way of looking at it in terms of managing anxiety about the outcome.”Jackson said in New Zealand “more people go to rugby games than go to church the passion for the game is extreme”, but also that some Kiwis were growing fatigued of rugby’s dominance in the cultural psyche and fed up with the violence and excessive alcohol consumption that is often associated with match nights.“I do see a growing number of people resenting the prominent place rugby has in New Zealand’s story – that it has displaced almost any other form of culture.”Jackson said there had been no definitive studies linking poor mental health outcomes in fans if their favourite teams lose, though there was strong anecdotal evidence that more violence could occur in homes and pubs, and moods could dip for days following a significant loss.Sean Cuttance of Methven in the South Island is a rugby coach and former professional player. He said he would be disappointed if the All Blacks lose on Saturday, but he’ll survive – partly due to his professional rugby training.“But I know listening to the All Blacks themselves and coaching and management staff, they’re very pragmatic about a win or a loss and they’re not so emotional and that’s a good way to lead it..”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/da3f3aab15748203f267da16a0344244b3f0cd6e/774_554_2226_1336/master/2226.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8af3fcb897132fee0cea30f75b01d18b","title":"seven days that shook chile in pictures","story":"Crowds gathered in the capital, Santiago, set up fiery barricades and clashed with riot police in protest against rising subway fares and to demand better education, healthcare and wages"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Local Sinn F\u0026eacutein TD says far-right speech has \u0026lsquotaken root among people who would otherwise be decent and reasonable\u0026rsquoTaoiseach says it would only be with the consent of people in Northern IrelandCase concerns judge\u0026rsquos finding that State failed to properly implement a European DirectiveMan for court over incident during school group\u0026rsquos visit to Dublin\u0026rsquos Guinness StorehouseCrisis management meeting to assess whether water services can be returnedClothes were donated in 2017 to Waterford-based disaster relief charity for use in PakistanVideo footage \u0026lsquostretches political credibility\u0026rsquo, says Mary Lou McDonaldHSE confirms investigation of case in Galway city accommodation and defends responseArmagh man (25) briefly towed trailer in which 39 Chinese migrants found deadMonaghan-based company leased refrigerated trailer to other Border firmResearch suggests ultra-competitive coaches can bring out the worst behaviour in athletes\u0026lsquoPrecautionary measure\u0026rsquo taken after consultation with HSE and Fingal County CouncilTen youths in care of Belfast Health Trust after arriving illegally via city\u0026rsquos harbourMichael Malone (50) assaulted children in Wexford, including one boy in cub scouts\u0026lsquoWe are not so much selling the family silver as paying someone to take it off our hands\u0026rsquoPrisoner, under supervision of two prison officers, got out window of Limerick hospitalFormer taoiseach says \u0026lsquotalking through\u0026rsquo Border solution will help ease loyalist fears"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4061783.1571936533!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"fianna f%C3%A1il ends week of tribal mud slinging with sigh of relief","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tClare TD Timmy Dooley and Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin. Photograph: Gareth ChaneyCollinsStatements on the Dáil voting controversy heard Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin, while condemning the actions of Timmy Dooley and Niall Collins, erect a straw man defence and Martin Heydon, chairman of the Fine Gael parliamentary party, imply that further investigations should involve an examination of telephone records.Dooley, Collins, Lisa Chambers and Barry Cowen all apologised for their part in the controversy, and Martin confirmed Dooley and Collins would not be restored to his frontbench.Although clerk of the Dáil Peter Finnegan’s report into the controversy did not make findings against the iniduals involved, Ceann Comhairle Seán Ó Fearghaíl’s statement before Leaders’ Questions on Thursday was an oratorical arched eyebrow.“Politics is a profession,” he said. “It is an honourable profession, but, as politicians, we must conduct ourselves professionally. It is a matter of deep personal and professional regret to me that this did not happen last week.”He said the facts, as laid out by Finnegan, were “stark and unpalatable”, and he added that the failure last week was “not of a technical nature … the failure was political”.It was probably as much as Ó Fearghaíl could say while staying within the boundaries of the report from Finnegan, and, seen through a neutral lens, perhaps the most accurate view of the controversy.Martin deflectionIn his Dáil statement, Martin said there is “simply no question” but that Collins should not have cast votes on Dooley’s behalf. But the Fianna Fáil leader also claimed there was no evidence that the actions of any of his TDs had influenced the outcome of Dáil votes.“The main case involves a series of isions where the average margin was over 45,” he said, in an attempt at deflection. “The lowest margin involved was 31. The idea that there is any question over the result of those votes is manifestly nonsense.”Nobody in recent days had suggested the votes were on a knife edge. All the focus was justifiably on whether it was appropriate to vote in place of someone else.With Taoiseach Leo Varadkar staying above the fray and away from the Dáil chamber, Heydon listed out a series of questions for Fianna Fáil and suggested Dooley and Collins produce “their phone record”.Independents Maureen O’Sullivan and Catherine Connolly correctly criticised both Heydon’s attack and Martin’s defence, with Connolly expressing disbelief at the Fianna Fáil leader’s statement and what she characterised as Fine Gael’s desire for a “star chamber”.Yet Fianna Fáilers know the past week has been damaging, and the sight of four of its TDs apologising to the Dáil is not one Fine Gael will let it forget.With Varadkar having helped secure a new Brexit deal and Fine Gael rising again in opinion polls, the Fianna Fáil benches are relieved the general election is now likely to take place next year rather than next month."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4057998.1571674594!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"the irish times most nominated in newsbrands shortlist 2019","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tRosita Boland with her trophy at the 2018 Newsbrands Ireland journalism awards Photograph: Simon CarswellThe  has received 32 nominations in the shortlist for the NewsBrands Journalism Awards 2019 – the highest number for a publication in this year’s competition.The NewsBrands Journalism Awards are open to any work published in print, website, online, mobile, video, audio or any other news delivery format from any NewsBrands Ireland member title.Five of the six journalists shortlisted in the Foreign Coverage category write for The : Sally Hayden Derek Scally Suzanne Lynch Lara Marlowe and Patrick Freyne.The  received four of the six nominations for Best Use of Video, citing the work of Simon Carswell, Kathleen Harris, Enda O’Dowd and Bryan O’Brien.Jack Power of The  was nominated in three categories Business Story of the Year Investigative Journalism and Young Journalist of the Year.  reporter Sarah Burns was also shortlisted as Young Journalist of the Year as was current  reporter Shauna Bowers for her past work at The Times, Ireland edition.Markets Correspondent Joe Brennan is shortlisted for Business Journalist of the Year.In the Campaigning Journalism category, The ’ No Child campaign has been shortlisted.Fintan O’Toole and Hilary Fannin are both nominated in the Broadsheet Columnist category, while in the Critic of the Year category The  has four writers shortlisted: Catherine Cleary Patrick Freyne Niamh Donnelly and Fintan O’Toole.Three  writers are shortlisted in the Features Broadsheet Writer of the Year: Rosita Boland, Conor Gallagher and Conor Pope.Carl O’Brien is nominated, along with Power, in the Investigative Journalism category.

Photograph: Colin KeeganCollinsAn update on whether normal water services can be returned to some 600,000 people in the greater Dublin area is expected on Friday afternoon with a crisis management meeting due to take place in the morning.“We would hope that we would have some positive news but we can’t pre-empt that decision,” Irish Water’s head of customer operations Yvonne Harris told RTÉ’s Morning Ireland.The meeting will take place between officials at Irish Water, Fingal County Council, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Health Service Executive (HSE).While there has been disruption for a number of days, businesses will be keen to see a return to normal services for the busy bank holiday weekend.A “boil water” warning notice was put in place earlier this week after a mechanical issue at the Leixlip treatment plant first caused concerns about the quality of supply on Tuesday morning.Some initial water sample tests have been found to be “satisfactory”, according to Irish Water, although the boil water status was kept in place as a precaution.Plant auditThe EPA conducted an audit of the plant on Thursday which will be assessed on Friday, while follow up test results are also expected.The ongoing situation means that those in the affected areas can only use boiled or bottled water to drink and in food preparation.Drinking the water carries a risk of gastrointestinal infection, with symptoms including diarrhoea and stomach cramps.“Everyone has different tolerances,” said Ms Harris. “We would be particularly concerned about vulnerable people, older people and if babies ingested bathwater.” Anyone who feels they may have become ill from drinking the water is advised to see their doctor.As well as domestic customers, the situation has considerable consequences for businesses, particularly in the catering and hospitality sectors.Advice issued this week included that boiled water should be kept in clean containers, should not be kept indefinitely, and that ice is also only made from boiled or bottled water."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4062038.1571998323!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"ballinamore group claims government has paused asylum seeker plans","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSome people in Ballinamore are opposed to plans to move up to 130 asylum seekers to the town.

Group spokesman Gordon Hughes told Shannonside Radio they were pleased with the meeting and welcomed the Minister’s commitment to reappraise the situation.“We outlined our concerns to him and we felt he certainly was listening to us. We met with him for over an hour-and-a-half, and we outlined the various issues we had and how we hoped to engage constructively with the Government in relation to this. “In the interim the Minister agreed to pause any further developments at that location until he has had time to have further discussions with his officials.”A spokesman for the department could not be reached early on Friday. CampaignersCampaigners said on Friday they would continue their protest in the town. Leitrim county councillor Enda McGloin said he was not optimistic a stand-off between the Department of Justice and some residents would be resolved. Speaking after the meeting Mr McGloin said volunteers were rostered until December 24th to protest outside the apartments. It is understood Mr Stanton indicated 130 was the maximum capacity of the proposed centre but not necessarily the number that would be placed there. He is also understood to have stressed that apartments where families could support each other while living independently were considered a better option that direct provision centres, which campaigners have criticised for being inhumane. Nearly 400 people have signed up to man the round-the-clock protest in Ballinamore over the department’s plan, with locals concerned about a lack of consultation over the move and that the town of some 900 people does not have the facilities to take in more than 100 new residents. Far-right speechSinn Féin TD for Sligo-Leitrim Martin Kenny told the Dáil on Thursday far-right speech and tone had “taken root among people who would otherwise be decent and reasonable”.He said the genuine concerns that people have about education or health services being stretched when it comes to asylum seekers arriving “are being twisted into reasons to be empowered”.Mr Kenny criticised those “who peddle far-right ideology” as he described shipping containers and trucks as the coffin ships of the 21st century following the deaths of 39 migrants in a container found in Essex on Wednesday. He said “one of those people was the last to die and watched 38 die before them. This is an unimaginable horror.” Mr Kenny said Ireland had its own tragic history in this regard and that “the owners of the coffin ships exploited Irish immigrants by cramming them into holds and under the decks”. He said tackling criminal gangs behind people smuggling must be prioritised. He claimed “it is the secretaries and chairs of Fine Gael branches and even Fine Gael councillors who lead the protests to block” direct provision centres despite it being Government policy to develop such facilities to house asylum applicants.Hate speechHe said it was “absolutely outrageous that hate speech is becoming normalised and is allowed to become normalised, and it is”.“And those of us who are victims of it and getting the text message and threats are not going to stand down. We need to stand firm. And we need to know that the people who are putting the policies in place are also going to stand firm.”Tánaiste Simon Coveney paid tribute to Mr Kenny for the stand he was taking in relation to Ballinamore and said elected representatives had a duty to stand firm and “educate and convince people of the dangers of that indirect prejudice and what it produces”."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4061961.1571947128!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"collins and dooley accounts of voting draw tds scepticism","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tNiall Collins TD and Timmy Dooley: If it is found they have breached ethics laws, the Dáil’s committee could recommend a suspension for up to 30 days.  Photograph: Gareth Chaney CollinsFianna Fáil’s Niall Collins and Timmy Dooley have been criticised by Government and Opposition TDs over statements they gave to an inquiry into the Dáil voting controversy, with one deputy claiming their stories “do not stand up”. The two men have been removed from their positions on the party’s frontbench over Mr Collins last week voting six times on behalf of Mr Dooley, who was absent from the House at the time. In a report compiled by the clerk of the Dáil, released on Thursday, Mr Dooley denied asking his colleague to vote for him and Mr Collins denied being asked to cast the votes. Ceann Comhairle Sean Ó’Fearghaíl said the facts as laid out in the report were “stark” and “unpalatable”. While the report made no findings against any inidual, the Dáil’s ethics committee is expected to meet next week to consider a complaint made by Fine Gael TD Noel Rock on the issue. If it is found the TDs have breached ethics laws, the committee could recommend sanctions including a suspension for up to 30 days. Face vs handsVideo footage of the vote in question showed that before Mr Dooley left the chamber, he pointed towards the front row of the seats at which point Mr Collins nodded. “When asked what he meant by pointing at the seats, Deputy Dooley was indicating to Deputy Collins that he would see Deputy Collins when they were voting,” the report states. Mr Collins said he did not know what was meant by the pointing because he was looking at Mr Dooley’s face and not his hands. Fine Gael parliamentary party chairman Martin Heydon said that “there are many people outside this House who would find it difficult to believe many of the accounts included in the report”. Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald said “both deputies claim they acted on their own initiative and that they were not requested or coerced to vote for other colleagues. Problem with story“This stretches political credibility, particularly in the case of Deputies Niall Collins and Dooley, as video footage strongly suggests an exchange relating to votes took place.” Rise TD Paul Murphy said he “did not buy” the statements. “There is a real problem with that story based on the evidence given to the review.” Social Democrats co-leader Catherine Murphy said, “We are being taken for fools with the story. It does not stand up. It is not a question of brazening it out. If there is to be integrity in this process, one should fess up. That is what is needed.” Mr Dooley and Mr Collins apologised to the Dáil for their role in the controversy, as did the party’s Brexit spokeswoman Lisa Chambers and public expenditure spokesman Barry Cowen. Ms Chambers said that she made a “genuine mistake” by inadvertently sitting in the wrong seat in the chamber and pressing the button in error while Mr Cowen also apologised for not voting in his designated seat."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4061675.1571936508!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"martin formally removes dooley and collins from ff front bench","story":"The Dáil voting system needs to be reviewed, according to a report into the recent  controversy involving Fianna Fáil TDs Timmy Dooley and Niall Collins, but no sanctions or disciplinary action were recommended. Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin said the sanctions, introduced earlier this week, would remain in place. He was speaking in the Dáil during a debate on the controversy which erupted when Mr Collins, the party’s former foreign affairs spokesman voted six times on behalf of Mr Dooley who was absent from the House during votes last week.Mr Martin had initially asked them to step aside pending the outcome of the report commissioned by the Ceann Comhairle into the controversy.Government Chief Whip and Minister of State Seán Kyne said the TDs involved “have done a grave disservice to their mandate, to their constituents and to their colleagues”.He said “it was wrong. It was thoughtless. It was cavalier. And it was arrogant.“This behaviour has damaged the Dáil. It has damaged the confidence that voters should, and must have, in how our parliament plays its pivotal role in our democracy.”Mr Martin said “at the core of what has happened is the fact that we, unlike other parliaments, do not require members to use a card or other device during voting and we have a common practice of members speaking and voting from different seats”.This was bad practice and should stop. But he accused Fine Gael speakers in the debate of making partisan comments.To jeers and heckles from the Government benches he said there was no evidence they were “addressing any matter that had any impact on deciding the outcome of a Dáil vote”.But Mr Martin added that it did not diminish the fact that “what happened was wrong”.The Fianna Fáil leader also defended party colleague Lisa Chambers who voted twice in the Dáil but did not tell the teller at the time. Mr Martin said he was satisfied with her “good faith and the apology she made”.The four Fianna Fáil TDs apologised for their role in the controversy including Offaly TD Barry Cowen who apologised for the “informality and carelessness” when he and Deputy Collins sat in each other’s seat and voted for each other.Misleading the DáilMr Martin hit out at the notion that a “Fine Gael-Sinn Féin coalition” were seeking an extreme sanction “which would mean that Dáil Éireann would introduce a greater sanction than has ever been applied” for those misleading the House or libelling members of the public.But Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald said “one can only imagine the outrage of Micheál Martin had it been any other TDs but those from Fianna Fáil”.Ms McDonald said this isn’t about electronic voting. At the core it was about the “contempt for the institutions of Government”.She asked “do we need to tell Fianna Fáil that it’s not okay to vote twice” and she said there had to be a consequence for them for that.But Independent Catherine Connolly TD accused Fine Gael of using the Dáil as a “star chamber to score points” and said Mr Martin’s speech was “disgraceful” when he should have just apologised and sat down.People should “stand up, apologise and take whatever consequences the committee next week decides”.Labour leader Brendan Howlin described the controversy as an “inter-party slug-fest” and said “the war of the buttons has fed into a very unwelcome narrative on public confidence in politics and it has also distracted from real issues of concern”.But the House was being distracted from “the real issues of public concern”, including homelessness.An index of selected articles available exclusively to our readers with an  digital subscription "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4062542.1571997324!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"varadkar says he would like to see a united ireland in his lifetime","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tLeo Varadkar on Brexit: ‘Members are deciding, making sure that the kids are looked after, deciding the financial settlement that type of thing’. Photograph: Simon DawsonBloombergTaoiseach Leo Varadkar has said he would like to see a united Ireland in his lifetime.Mr Varadkar was taking part in a phone-in show on Irish radio station Today FM where listeners “could ask him anything”.Asked if he would like to see a united Ireland, he said: “I would, but only in accordance with the Good Friday Agreement so that’s only with the consent of the majority of people in Northern Ireland. “That’s really important stuff and nobody should be forced into anything they don’t want.“And also, I think, if we ever get to that point, we need to make sure that unionists in Northern Ireland and British people in Northern Ireland feel that a united Ireland is a warm place for them.“We don’t want to have a repeat of what happened 100 years ago when a minority were left behind.”Earlier this week, British prime minister Boris Johnson was warned that loyalists in Northern Ireland will “not tolerate an economic united Ireland”.Sinn Féin vice-president Michelle O’Neill said on Tuesday that Brexit means the British and Irish governments needs to begin preparing for holding a border poll to have a united Ireland. Ms O’Neill said the poll could take place within five years.DivorceAsked how he feels about the current Brexit impasse, Mr Varadkar said Britain leaving the EU is only stage one of the process, and compared the proceedings to a orce.“There is the sense that we will get a deal. They will ratify it and they will leave the European Union, but then the next thing starts, which is negotiating a new relationship,” he said.“What we’re doing at the moment is a kind of orce. Members are deciding, making sure that the kids are looked after, deciding the financial settlement that type of thing.“The next step then is, how do we get on with each other after orce because we’re still going to need to have a friendship of some sort.“So, it just moves on to the next phase, but the most important thing in the first phase was just to protect those really important things like making sure that wasn’t the Border between North and South and people’s rights are protected and that people can still travel freely between Britain and Ireland.”Mr Varadkar said he has a good relationship with Mr Johnson.The pair had a “private one-on-one meeting” in Cheshire earlier this month in a last-ditch effort to break the Brexit deadlock.Mr Varadkar said: “He is the guy you see, like he is personable, he’s intelligent, he’s witty — he is very normal.“You can talk to him about stuff, you know. Some politicians are really hard to talk to. He’s a little bit eccentric, a little bit alternative.”– PAAn index of selected articles available exclusively to our readers with an  digital subscription "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4061407.1571917259!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"vote controversy report recommends no sanctions against tds","story":"The Dáil voting system needs to be reviewed, according to a report into the recent  controversy involving Fianna Fáil TDs Timmy Dooley and Niall Collins, but no sanctions or disciplinary action were recommended. \t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe report examined last week’s events, when Fianna Fáil TD Niall Collins (left) voted six times for colleague Timmy Dooley while he was absent from the Dáil chamberAn investigation in the Dáil voting controversy has found it is not “legally appropriate” to recommend sanctions against a number of Fianna Fáil TDs because another inquiry into the issue is ongoing.A report which examined the events of last week, when Fianna Fáil TD Niall Collins voted six times for party colleague Timmy Dooley while he was absent from the chamber, was published today.Addressing the Dáil after the report’s publication, Ceann Comhairle Seán Ó Fearghail said the controversy over voting has “further eroded confidence in how our national parliament conducts its business”.The report by Dáil clerk Peter Finnegan has not recommended sanctions because the committee does not want to prejudice the work of another committee which is also investigating the matter.Mr Dooley has denied asking Mr Collins to vote for him when he was absent from the Dáil chamber saying: “No, I am clear on that fact.”Mr Dooley told the investigation that he left the Dáil complex instead of returning to vote in last Thursday’s voting bloc.What happenedDetailing what happened on the day, the report says: “Deputy Dooley approached Mr Collins, who was speaking with another colleague at the time.“When asked about the nature of the conversation with Deputy Collins, Deputy Dooley said that he told Deputy Collins that he needed to speak with him.”The report says Mr Dooley told Mr Collins: “I’ll see you at the vote but I have to make a call.”“When asked what he meant by pointing at the seats, Deputy Dooley was indicating to Deputy Collins that he would see him when they were voting.”Mr Dooley told the investigation that Mr Collins had assumed he was in the chamber and that is why he voted for him. Mr Dooley confirmed he had not taken any steps to correct the record.Returned to his officeMr Dooley confirmed to the inquiry that that he did not vote in any of the eight scheduled votes.“He indicated he had returned to his office to make a call. He stated that he should have gone back but that he left the complex. He could not say how long the call lasted, nor could he say at what time he left the complex.”Mr Collins told the investigation he was not asked to vote for Mr Dooley.“When asked what he believed Deputy Dooley meant by pointing, he said that he had no idea, that he was looking at Deputy Dooley’s face and not his hands. He further states that he did not see Deputy Dooley leave the chamber.”Mr Collins said there was “no particular reason” why he then sat in the wrong seat. He said he “assumed” Mr Dooley was in the chamber.SanctionsThe report found the Dáil committee on procedures and privileges (CPP) needs more powers to sanction politicians who vote for absent colleagues or colleagues who are away from their designated seat and should have a role in considering irregularities during votes.The report also recommends that voting should not start until all members are in their seats. If an error comes to light it must be notified to the Ceann Comhairle.Ceann Comhairle Seán Ó Fearghail told the Dáil that the report was “factual and evidence-based,” and though it didn’t make findings, the facts were “stark and unpalatable”.He said there would be statements on the issue in the Dáil later and said it was his “sincere wish that members read the report before they express their views”.A separate complaint about the issue has been made to the Dáil’s internal ethics committee by Fine Gael TD Noel Rock about Mr Dooley, Mr Collins, Fianna Fáil TD Lisa Chambers and Fianna Fáil TD Barry Cowen.This committee is scheduled to meet later today and has the power to recommend a motion to the Dáil on the matter.

Photograph: Getty ImagesAmbassadors of the EU27 are expected on Friday morning to set in train the process to endorse a three-month Brexit extension to January 31st to allow the UK House of Commons to complete scrutiny of Brexit legislation.The not-unexpected announcement on Thursday night by Boris Johnson of a timeframe for the debate and a subsequent election in December is unlikely to affect the ambassadors’ decision, not least because of the uncertainty about whether the British prime minister can get his plans approved by MPs. The process may well get stretched out into January, and EU leaders will not want to be seen to force an unnecessary no-deal exit.Diplomats in Brussels suggest there are still some lingering doubts about whether the French will block an emerging consensus to agree the British extension request as it stands. Paris still maintains a shorter extension would be preferable, but Johnson’s announcement would appear to make that option moot and his call for an election meets one of President Emmanuel Macron’s main demands.European Council president Donald Tusk, who has recommended the longer extension, backed by Taoiseach Leo Varadkar, has engaged in a lengthy series of consultations with the capitals to test the water. European Parliament leaders also backed the longer extension at a meeting on Thursday.Unanimous agreement by the ambassadors would see the formal decisions taken by “written procedure” and obviate the need for an emergency summit early next week.The member states are expected to agree again, as they did for the last extension, that the UK will be allowed to leave earlier than January 31st if and when it ratifies the EU-UK withdrawal agreement if the British prime minister’s schedule is successfully followed through that would see the UK leave the EU on December 2nd with a deal. Negotiating strandsMeanwhile the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, has been asked by the European Commission, with the backing of incoming president Ursula von der Leyen, to continue to oversee the evolving EUUK relationship\u0026nbsponce Brexit has happened.Mr Barnier has been asked to head a “UK Task Force” that will be charged with co-ordinating the separate negotiating strands on the future EUUK relationship, expected to involve 12 separate directorates and including such disparate areas as judicial affairs, the economy, defence, and foreign policy.Talks are due to start once the Withdrawal Agreement is ratified, and are expected to take several years.The most crucial and difficult of these strands will be on a free trade agreement,\u0026nbsp and will be conducted by the EU trade directorate under its new commissioner Phil Hogan and its new secretary general Sabine Weyand, Mr Barnier’s deputy for most of the Withdrawal Agreement negotiations.\u0026nbspOfficials insist that Mr Hogan’s role has not been diminished by the Barnier appointment.Speaking to MEPs in Strasbourg on Tuesday, Mr Barnier said his new role would be about “rebuilding” ties after Brexit marked the “unpicking of 45 years of co-operation”. \u0026nbspMr Barnier will keep his current Brexit task force team and take over responsibility for its unfinished business and for the work being done on “no-deal planning”.

On Thursday former economy minister Thierry Breton got the nod instead from Paris.Although the nomination leaves the von der Leyen Commission unbalanced from a gender point of view, it is expected it will be accepted – despite Mr Breton’s having business connections that may raise hackles at the EU parliamentary hearing.

Video: ReutersThe EU27 has deferred a decision on whether to endorse a three-month extension Brexit until next week, according to the first ambassador to leave the meeting.The ambassadors have agreed that a Brexit extension is needed, with a diplomat saying they will continue discussions on its length on Monday.Ambassadors of the EU27 were considering whether to endorse a three-month Brexit extension to January 31st to allow the UK House of Commons to complete scrutiny of Brexit legislation.The British government expects the EU to delay Brexit by three months, says British chancellor of the exchequer Sajid Javid.Donald Tusk, the president of the European council, told British prime minister Boris Johnson in a phone call on Wednesday his reasons for “recommending the EU27 accept the UK request for an extension”.The debate among the EU27 is whether to follow Tusk’s lead and offer a three-month delay that could be terminated following ratification of the deal, or seek to put pressure on MPs with a shorter extension, an idea raised by France’s president, Emmanuel Macron.The not-unexpected announcement on Thursday night by Boris Johnson of a timeframe for the debate and a subsequent election in December is unlikely to affect the ambassadors’ decision, not least because of the uncertainty about whether the British prime minister can get his plans approved by MPs.The process may well get stretched out into January, and EU leaders will not want to be seen to force an unnecessary no-deal exit.Diplomats in Brussels suggest there are still some lingering doubts about whether the French will block an emerging consensus to agree the British extension request as it stands.A senior EU official told Reuters the EU27 may agree in principle to a delay but set no new date until after parliament’s vote on Monday on whether to have a snap election on December 12th.General electionMr Javid said Britain was stuck in a “zombie parliament” and that the nation needed to put end to its dysfunction through a general election.He says the Conservatives will ask parliament again and again to back an early general election if the opposition fails to support a snap poll in a vote on Monday.“We’re going to bring a vote forward for a general election on Monday,” he told LBC radio.“If Labour does not support that vote, then we will continue to ask for a general election and bring a vote again and bring a vote again.”It comes as the British government cancelled Mr Javid’s budget planned for November 6th.Opposition parties have signalled that they will deny him the two-thirds majority he needs for it. The British prime minister said he would give MPs until November 6th to scrutinise the withdrawal agreement Bill if they agree to an election.“The way to get Brexit done is, I think, to be reasonable with parliament and say if they genuinely want more time to study this excellent deal, they can have it, but they have to agree to a general election on December 12th,” Mr Johnson told the BBC.Jeremy Corbyn said he would wait for the European Council’s decision on the extension before saying how Labour would vote on the general election motion.“Take no-deal off the table and we will absolutely support an election. I’ve been calling an election ever since the last one because this country needs one in order to deal with all the social injustices, but no-deal must be taken off the table,” he said.EU leaders could grant an extension until January 31st but agree, as they did last April, that the UK could leave earlier if the Brexit deal is ratified. Or they could offer a short extension of a few weeks to allow the deal to be ratified at Westminster but agree to extend it until the end of January if parliament rejects the withdrawal agreement. – Additional reporting from ReutersDeal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Photograph: Hollie AdamsPA Wire Prime Minister Boris Johnson has called for a general election on December 12th to break Britain’s Brexit impasse, conceding for the first time he will not meet his “do or die” deadline to leave the European Union next week.Moroever, the Government has also cancelled chancellor Sajid Javid’s budget planned for November 6th. “Parliament has voted for a delay. We’re calling for an election, so we won’t be delivering the Budget on November 6th,” said a Treasury source. Mr Johnson said in a letter to opposition Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn he would give parliament more time to approve his Brexit deal but that politicians must back a December election. It will be his third attempt to try to force a snap election.Just a week before Britain was due to leave the European Union, the EU looks set to grant it an extension to the Brexit deadline, something Mr Johnson has repeatedly said he does not want but was forced to request by the country’s ided parliament.An election is seen by his team as the only way of breaking the deadlock over Brexit after parliament voted in favour of his deal, but then, just minutes later, rejected his preferred timetable which would have met his October 31st deadline.The Labour Party has repeatedly said it will only back an election when it is sure that Mr Johnson cannot lead Britain out of the EU without a deal.“This parliament has refused to take decisions. It cannot refuse to let the voters replace it with a new parliament that can make decisions,” Mr Johnson wrote to Corbyn.“Prolonging this paralysis into 2020 would have dangerous consequences for businesses, jobs and for basic confidence in democratic institutions, already badly damaged by the behaviour of parliament since the referendum. Parliament cannot continue to hold the country hostage.”In parliament after the government announced the new vote on an election for Monday, Labour’s parliamentary business manager Valerie Vaz did not say whether the party would back the move, saying only it would wait to see what the EU says about a delay on Friday.‘Dead in a ditch’More than three years after voting to be the first sovereign country to leave the EU, the future of Brexit is as unclear as ever with Britain still debating when, how or even whether it should go ahead.Last month, Mr Johnson said he would rather be “dead in a ditch” than ask for a delay.But several of his aides think he can weather any criticism for failing to meet the deadline at an election by arguing he was thwarted by politicians and pitting the “people versus the parliament”.At a meeting of his cabinet, some media reported there was disagreement over whether the government should try for an early election, fearing that going to the polls before Brexit was settled might damage the party.But Mr Johnson seems to still hold out hope of securing a deal with Brussels, offering parliament until November 6th to ratify an agreement he settled with the EU last week.“This means that we could get Brexit done before the election on 12 December, if MPs choose to do so,” he said.Labour has long said it cannot back an election until a no-deal Brexit is off the table. But if the EU grants an extension until the end of January, that would appear to remove the threat of Mr Johnson taking Britain out without an agreement.ExtensionEarlier, a senior Downing Street source said Britain would ultimately leave the EU with Mr Johnson’s deal despite the likely additional delay, with the EU considering offering London a three-month flexible Brexit extension.“This ends with us leaving with the PM’s deal,” said the Downing Street source. All eyes are now on not whether, but by how long, the EU decides to extend the Brexit process: Berlin supports a three-month delay, while Paris is pushing for a shorter one.While German chancellor Angela Merkel and French president Emmanuel Macron appear to be fatigued by Brexit, they fear a no-deal exit that would almost certainly hurt global growth, roil financial markets and create a potentially deeper EU crisis.To offer Britain a long extension would take the pressure off British politicians to approve Mr Johnson’s deal and open up possibilities such as a referendum on it. A short extension might focus minds in the British parliament.Brexit was initially supposed to have taken place on March 29th but Mr Johnson’s predecessor, Theresa May, was forced to delay twice as parliament defeated her Brexit deal.Mr Johnson was forced by parliament on Saturday to send a letter to European Council president Donald Tusk requesting a delay until January 31st. He did so reluctantly, sending an unsigned photocopied note, but the correspondence was accepted.“Our policy remains that we should not delay,” Mr Johnson told parliament on Tuesday after it defeated his extremely tight legislative timetable for ratifying the deal he clinched in Brussels a week ago. – ReutersDeal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

We have had no rain. Farmers are not only not able to produce their products, there is no rain for their water tanks for domestic use. No water for growing, no feed, no water at home when you turn on the tap,” she said.Ms Dobie said almost one third of Southern Downs economy is directly related to agriculture, and the knock on impact of the drought on other sectors is dire.“No income, no money to spend in towns. Business is heavily impacted... not only retail, also health - people can’t afford to go to a dentist,” she said.The Mayor said her Council resolved at the beginning of 2018 to manage their response to drought as they would “any other disaster”.“(Australia) needs to be better prepared for longer and more frequent droughts, with less rain in between. The water storages (are) designed for three years without inflow, do we need to build them for five years? And drought means bushfires. We need to prepare bushlands in the winter for the hot dry summers.Farmer Johnnie McKeown walks near the shells of dead mussels lying in the dried-up bed of the Namoi River located on the outskirts of his drought-affected property, near the north-western New South Wales town of Walgett“We must conserve every drop of water we can. The water waste we have in this country is phenomenal. State governments are not doing enough on compliance to water rules because compliance costs money,” she said.The NFF said the request for exit packages is for this particularly severe drought, not as an ongoing response to droughts in the future.“I believe the NFF has put forward some good options to the Government, as has our Council.  Our agricultural sector is erse and impacted in different ways by the drought there cannot be a one size fits all solution,” said Ms Dobie.In 2007, the Australian Prime Minister at the time, John Howard, announced $150,000 grants for drought-affected farmers to sell their properties. The state government of Western Australia also trialled $150,000 exit grants in 2011.NFF President Fiona Simson told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation that exit grants would help “a number of families now really considering their future”.(They) would provide some support for those people making the difficult decision and enable them to establish themselves in a new location, with a new future in front of them,” she said.A car and a house destroyed by bushfire are seen in Rappville, NSW, earlier this monthThe NFF said its request to Mr Morrison and Drought Minister David Littleproud for immediate assistance also included help with paying local government charges payroll subsidies for farming businesses a two-year interest-free period on government loans and a plan to work with state and territory governments to eradicate feral pigs.This week in Senate Estimates hearings, the Labor Opposition said the Government’s claim to have a $7 billion drought policy was misleading, as $5billion of it is designated for a drought future fund which begins making disbursements in 2020.Earlier this month Mr Littleproud said he was waiting for the NFF\u0027s drought recommendations to take to Cabinet, along with the still-confidential report produced by Drought Co-ordinator Major General Stephen Day, for consideration.The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

The company received a further 3,000 complaints in the first half of this year.Sean Moran, partner and insolvency specialist at law firm, Shakespeare Martineau said payday lenders have been under huge pressure from stricter rules brought in by the Financial Conduct Authority which capped the total amount of charges and interest payable on loans.“A lot of these companies ruthlessly target young men and women,” Mr Moran said. “The significant rise in personal insolvency rates for the under-25’s is of grave concern - they now make up 6.5 per cent of all personal insolvencies in the UK.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Responsible lending is much needed in these difficult times for the UK economy.”David Fisher, chief executive of Cash Euro Net’s parent company Enova International blamed the FOS for QuickQuid’s collapse“Over the past year and a half, we have experienced a challenging and uncertain regulatory environment in the UK, despite the fact that the FCA reviewed and approved our business practices and affordability criteria in 2015, he said.“FOS, the financial ombudsman, has continued to move the goalposts with its complaints handling decisions, in effect setting ever-changing de-facto policies that in many instances was inconsistent with FCA guidelines,”People who have outstanding loans with QuickQuid are advised to continue making repayments as normal.“If you miss any repayments you could be hit by fees and additional charges, and it could also harm your credit rating,” said Caroline Siarkiewicz, acting chief executive at the Money and Pensions Service.“Eleven and a half million adults have less than £100 in savings and investments so lots of people face cash-flow problems which can make quick, short-term credit feel like the only option.\u0026nbsp“If you know you need a specific amount of money for a short while there may be more affordable alternatives out there so it’s a good idea to shop around before you borrow.”The Money Advice Service website has a guide on alternatives to payday loans, and you can also contact our free helpline on 0800 138 7777.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Only British Gas would be larger.Any interested party can comment on the proposed transaction until 6 November, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) watchdog said on Thursday.Ovo, founded a decade ago, has consistently been rated the best energy supplier by comparison site uSwitch. It has sought to present itself as environmentally friendly and has invested in developing home battery technology to allow consumers to store energy generated from renewable sources.Energy firms face crackdown after string of suppliers go bustEnergy firms ordered to pay £15m green taxes or face losing licencesThe acquisition of SSE’s retail gas and electricity unit would follow another purchase by Ovo: last year it took over Spark Energy after the challenger supplier collapsed. That deal gave Ovo 290,000 new customers.Competition in the retail energy market has soared over the past decade, reaching a peak of 70 suppliers in mid-2018, up from only 12 at the end of 2009.However, a record number of companies went bust last year and more have failed this year. According to the latest figures from energy regulator Ofgem, by March the total number of gas and electricity suppliers declined to 60.The latest casualty is Toto Energy, which ceased trading on Wednesday. Ofgem said it will choose a new supplier to take on all of Toto’s 134,000 domestic customers. Until then, their energy supply will continue.Despite the greater competition – as well as the price cap for customers on prepayment meters introduced in April 2017 – more than one in 10 English households remain in fuel poverty, according to the latest government data, covering 2017.gas and electricity\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It delivered 97,000 cars to customers in the period to 30 September, comfortably surpassing the previous record of 95,356.Tesla now expects to launch the Model Y, an all-electric SUV, by the summer of 2020, months earlier than originally planned, and its new “gigafactory” in Shanghai has already started trial production. Manufacturing in China enables the carmaker to avoid import duties and offer lower prices in one of its most important markets.Following the news on Wednesday, Tesla’s shares jumped nearly 21 per cent after market close to levels last reached in February.“Tesla nails it at last,” said Neil Wilson, chief market analyst for Markets. The results stand in contrast to the repeated large losses the company has made since its inception. In the second quarter, Tesla reported a loss of $408m.Tesla’s cheapest electric car wins top prize at industry awardsPolice abandon chase after Tesla electric patrol car runs out of powerElon Musk says ‘cyberpunk’ Tesla pick-up truck coming in NovemberBut Mr Wilson added: “In one sense, we shouldn’t get too excited”, noting the much smaller profit of $143m in the latest quarter and lower revenues compared with a year ago.Tesla is pinning much of its hopes for sustained profitability on the Model Y. Chief executive Elon Musk said on Wednesday that the mid-size SUV could outsell the Model S, X and 3 combined.SUVs have become very popular in the US, Europe and Canada, but most models still run on petrol, leaving Tesla to cater to consumers looking for an all-electric alternative.Tesla’s earnings improved partly thanks to the recognition of deferred revenue from its “Smart Summon” feature, which allows drivers to call for their car to pick them up using a smartphone app.US federal safety regulators are examining the feature as videos have appeared online showing driverless Teslas running into obstacles or nearly hitting other cars.Mr Musk said on Wednesday that software updates over the coming weeks would improve Smart Summon.The company also stuck to its earlier forecast that it will deliver over 360,000 vehicles in the year as a whole.Additional reporting by agenciesOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Sat with his entourage, Weinstein\u0026nbspwas in attendance to watch Actor’s Hour, a monthly event dedicated to aspiring comedy and acting talent.According to BuzzFeed, comedian Kelly Bachman made a number of comments about Weinstein’s presence while performing her set, including comparing him to the A Nightmare on Elm Street villain Freddy Krueger.“I didn’t know we had to bring our own mace and rape whistles to Actor’s Hour,” Bachman said on stage to a cluster of boos from the audience.Two additional patrons of the bar also confronted Weinstein, and told BuzzFeed that they were ejected from the bar shortly after by men they believed to be security.Created with Sketch.Best films of 2019 (so far) Show all 41Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.“Macabre and fraught though The Favourite gets, this isn’t so much a film about sex or power as it is about plain mischief. It’s a hilarious, buffoonish pleasure, right down to the sets and costume design, and a breeze to spend 120 minutes with.” Christopher Hooton“Casting Chalamet as Nic was a very clever move. The young actor from Call Me by Your Name and Lady Bird has a natural charm and charisma. He still engages an audience’s curiosity and sympathy even when his behaviour is at its most selfish and erratic.” Geoffrey Macnab341 The House by the Sea“Guédiguian’s storytelling style is deceptive. At first, it seems as if this is low-key social realism in the Dardennes or Ken Loach mould, albeit set on the French Riviera. Gradually, though, we realise how stylised and theatrical his approach really is.” Geoffrey Macnab“Director Jon S Baird, whose previous film was scabrous Irvine Welsh adaptation Filth, wrings every last drop of pathos he can from his material. This is very much a case of the tears of the clowns.” Geoffrey Macnab“Vice is bravura storytelling. McKay isn’t only taking us through Cheney’s life and career but is giving us a whistle stop tour through US politics from the Nixon administration almost right to the present day.” Geoffrey Macnab“Playing Lee Israel, McCarthy manages something very special: she makes a character who is odd, obnoxious, difficult and alcoholic seem lovable and even heroic. The rest of the world is at fault, not Lee.” Geoffrey MacnabGreen Book flatters the audience about its own good sense and tolerance. It deals with racism and homophobia but still has a fairytale, fantasy feel to it. Whatever humiliations Don endures on their road trip, we know no real harm will ever come to him as long as Tony is at his side.” Geoffrey Macnab“The golden age of bonkers horror movies is gloriously evoked by Netflix’s latest feature length presentation. Beginning as a satire of the arts world, Velvet Buzzsaw swiftly and gleefully descends into a savage splatter-fest, smeared in paint, viscera and garishly-bright blood.” Ed Power“Written by Ben Elton and directed by its star Kenneth Branagh, the film plays so fast and loose with the playwright’s final years that they needn’t have bothered fitting Branagh with a prosthetic nose – accuracy is clearly not the priority here.” Alexandra PollardThe Lego Movie 2: The Second Part is the doomed progeny of a celebrated genius – brilliant but slightly stunted by the knowledge they will never live up to their predecessor.” Clarisse Loughrey“Nicolas Pesce’s sleek and stylish horror comedy is repulsive and funny by turns. In adapting Ryu Murakami’s cult novel, Pesce strikes just the right balance between humour and Grand Guignol-style shock tactics.” Geoffrey MacnabThe best moments here are remarkable. Labaki elicits an astonishing performance from her young lead. He’s an irrepressible figure with such an inbuilt sense of moral decency the film seems upbeat and optimistic, even at its darkest moments.” Geoffrey MacnabRalph Fiennes combines thriller elements with poetic flashbacks to ballet legend Rudolf Nureyev’s childhood and keeps a tight focus on the dancer. When he is most at risk, Nureyev makes decisions with his artistic future more in mind than his personal safety. As Fiennes reminds us again and again in what is his best film yet as a director, the \u0027white crow\u0027 will do anything to put himself in the limelight, the one place he is convinced he belongs.Border reverses the perspective taken by most other horror films. In more conventional genre fare, Tina and Vore would be portrayed as malevolent outsiders, but in the world conjured up by director Ali Abbasi, the humans are the monsters. Tina is the innocent – a visionary who hardly understands her own powers but who can sense human venality and corruption wherever it appears.1641 Fighting with My FamilyCertain scenes feel very trite and predictable but the film gets you in a choke hold early on and won’t let you go. It is far more gripping than its subject matter might suggest. Who ever would believe a story about a wrestling family from Norwich could have quite such heart and resonance?Doppelgangers abound in Jordan Peele’s weird, creepy and ingenious new horror film. As in his Oscar-winning 2017 feature Get Out, Peele leavens matters with ironic humour but the joking becomes increasingly uncomfortable once the main characters come face to face with dark shadows of themselves which wish them extreme harm.The Avengers cycle comes to a rich and very satisfying conclusion with Endgame, surely the most complex and emotional superhero movie in Marvel history. At 181 minutes, this is a veritable epic, but with so many characters and plot strands, it fully warrants its lengthy running time.It’s a rare and precious feeling when a film completely dismantles you. Eighth Grade – the directorial debut of US comedian Bo Burnham – breaks down every delusion we have about ourselves and burrows deep into those parts we’ve made such an effort to lock away. You may cry. You may shudder as every awkward social interaction that’s kept you up at night replays in your head all at once. You may feel the sharp pain associated with those moments when you feel completely isolated from the world. Burnham may have crafted a simple story about the most ordinary of teenage girls, but it speaks with the emotions of a true cinematic epic.Natalie Portman gives her fiercest, most memorable performance since Black Swan in Brady Corbet’s enjoyably subversive satire about a troubled pop star whose loss of innocence mirrors the fall from grace of the US itself. Portman’s character, Celeste, is certainly one of the most objectionable figures she has played: a pampered, hard-drinking drug-taking “floozy” whose appearance and high-handed behaviour rekindle memories of Liz Taylor and Joan Crawford at their monstrous worst.Robert Pattinson gives one of his most striking performances as Monte, the death-row criminal in outer space, tricked into making a voyage described at one stage as a “class-one suicide ride”. The former Twilight star makes his shaven-headed, gaunt-faced character seem hyper naturally sensitive and feral at the same time.Amazing Grace is as uplifting a film as you will see all year. It’s a concert movie filmed over two nights and featuring Aretha Franklin, the “first lady of soul”, performing gospel standards in a church in Los Angeles in 1972, with a huge backing choir and an enthusiastic congregation.Disney’s live-action remake of its 1992 animated feature is a rip-roaring, old-fashioned matinee-style spectacle that turns out far better than we had any right to expect.“Olivia Wilde is a visually inventive director, who keeps the tempo here so brisk that we hardly notice how glib the storytelling sometimes becomes. We can tell exactly how the film will end, but it still feels original both in its screwball energy and in the deft way it continually reverses stereotypes and gender clichés.” “Late Night is a caustic satirical comedy that turns into an unlikely tearjerker. It’s by turns snide and uplifting, and often very funny too. Its writerproducerstar Mindy Kaling makes vicious observations about the inanity, narcissism and corruption of the mainstream US media at the same time as she celebrates the professionalism of many of those who work within it.“Gloria Bell is somewhat exhausting – both unbearably intimate and at a constant remove – but it is endlessly pulled back into focus by Moore, who has a firm understanding of the delicate balance between contentment and yearning, joy and pain, recklessness and spontaneity. In a remake that could have felt indulgent in the hands of people less skilled, she more than justifies its existence.”The brilliance of the new film lies in the surefooted way it caters both for children too young to have seen its predecessors and for adults who’ve grown up (or grown older) watching the previous instalments. It takes some kind of genius for the Pixar animators to give such a searing emotional charge to a story in which one of the main characters is a single use plastic spork retrieved from the trash.Perhaps The Flood isn’t quite the urgent, profound film a crisis of this scale deserves, but in a culture where refugees are so rarely shown any empathy in mainstream media, maybe this is the film we need right now.Ari Aster\u0027s follow-up to Hereditary serves up much of the same: it’s a break-up movie wrapped up in pagan horror. It’s also bound to be one of this year’s most memorable films, proving that Aster is far from a one-hit wonder.The Lion King is undoubtedly a technological marvel that, much like Avatar, will come to be viewed as a milestone in special effects history, yet it’s just as interesting to see how all this innovation has been employed.3241 Varda by Agnès  For a film that’s almost entirely narrated by Agnès Varda\u0027s own voice, it doesn’t feel driven by ego, but by pure intellectual and emotional curiosity.Animals treats its subjects with patience and generosity. You’ll find no life lessons here. Its main characters are free to pursue their desires, to whatever end.3441 Blinded by the LightBlinded by the Light offers not only a reminder of Springsteen’s lyrical genius, but of how he’s always served as a beacon for the disenfranchised.Lined up against some of this year’s other more heartfelt offerings, including Booksmart, Good Boys offers further proof that putting a little humanity in our comedy always gets the best results. Hustlers is an electrifying response to the deluge of stories we’ve had over the years about very rich, very bad dudes. Finally, we can turn the tables on every film that’s used women, specifically strippers, as decorative accessories to drape over businessmen as they conduct their illicit backroom meetings. Or, failing that, to shake their out-of-focus tits in the background of a shot.For Sama is one of the most profoundly intimate depictions of the Syrian conflict ever put to film. It’s the push to help those on the outside process something so incomprehensible in the depth of its horrors.The real drama here is not whether or not apocalypse can be avoided but whether Brad Pitt’s character can reconcile himself with his father and overcome his own extreme emotional repression. In other words, in spite of all the jargon and the hardware, this is an intimate family melodrama at heart. Thanks to Pitt’s performance and Gray’s delicate direction, it turns into a very moving one.Wrapped up in all the intricacies of immigrant identity and family politics, The Farewell is a comedy of warmth and bracing honesty. Simply put, it’s one of the best films of the year.This is Renée Zellweger’s Judy. It doesn’t belong to Rupert Goold, its director. Nor does it belong to Tom Edge, its screenwriter. It’s a performance of such overwhelming force that it wrests authorship from every other hand that guided the film’s creation.4141 Ready or NotAs absurd and self-indulgent as Ready or Not can get, it doesn’t mess around with its social commentary. The class system is the game we never asked to play, don’t get a fair chance at, and have no hope of winning. It’s a timeless metaphor.“Macabre and fraught though The Favourite gets, this isn’t so much a film about sex or power as it is about plain mischief. It’s a hilarious, buffoonish pleasure, right down to the sets and costume design, and a breeze to spend 120 minutes with.” Christopher Hooton“Casting Chalamet as Nic was a very clever move. The young actor from Call Me by Your Name and Lady Bird has a natural charm and charisma. He still engages an audience’s curiosity and sympathy even when his behaviour is at its most selfish and erratic.” Geoffrey Macnab341 The House by the Sea“Guédiguian’s storytelling style is deceptive. At first, it seems as if this is low-key social realism in the Dardennes or Ken Loach mould, albeit set on the French Riviera. Gradually, though, we realise how stylised and theatrical his approach really is.” Geoffrey Macnab“Director Jon S Baird, whose previous film was scabrous Irvine Welsh adaptation Filth, wrings every last drop of pathos he can from his material. This is very much a case of the tears of the clowns.” Geoffrey Macnab“Vice is bravura storytelling. McKay isn’t only taking us through Cheney’s life and career but is giving us a whistle stop tour through US politics from the Nixon administration almost right to the present day.” Geoffrey Macnab“Playing Lee Israel, McCarthy manages something very special: she makes a character who is odd, obnoxious, difficult and alcoholic seem lovable and even heroic. The rest of the world is at fault, not Lee.” Geoffrey MacnabGreen Book flatters the audience about its own good sense and tolerance. It deals with racism and homophobia but still has a fairytale, fantasy feel to it. Whatever humiliations Don endures on their road trip, we know no real harm will ever come to him as long as Tony is at his side.” Geoffrey Macnab“The golden age of bonkers horror movies is gloriously evoked by Netflix’s latest feature length presentation. Beginning as a satire of the arts world, Velvet Buzzsaw swiftly and gleefully descends into a savage splatter-fest, smeared in paint, viscera and garishly-bright blood.” Ed Power“Written by Ben Elton and directed by its star Kenneth Branagh, the film plays so fast and loose with the playwright’s final years that they needn’t have bothered fitting Branagh with a prosthetic nose – accuracy is clearly not the priority here.” Alexandra PollardThe Lego Movie 2: The Second Part is the doomed progeny of a celebrated genius – brilliant but slightly stunted by the knowledge they will never live up to their predecessor.” Clarisse Loughrey“Nicolas Pesce’s sleek and stylish horror comedy is repulsive and funny by turns. In adapting Ryu Murakami’s cult novel, Pesce strikes just the right balance between humour and Grand Guignol-style shock tactics.” Geoffrey MacnabThe best moments here are remarkable. Labaki elicits an astonishing performance from her young lead. He’s an irrepressible figure with such an inbuilt sense of moral decency the film seems upbeat and optimistic, even at its darkest moments.” Geoffrey MacnabRalph Fiennes combines thriller elements with poetic flashbacks to ballet legend Rudolf Nureyev’s childhood and keeps a tight focus on the dancer. When he is most at risk, Nureyev makes decisions with his artistic future more in mind than his personal safety. As Fiennes reminds us again and again in what is his best film yet as a director, the \u0027white crow\u0027 will do anything to put himself in the limelight, the one place he is convinced he belongs.Border reverses the perspective taken by most other horror films. In more conventional genre fare, Tina and Vore would be portrayed as malevolent outsiders, but in the world conjured up by director Ali Abbasi, the humans are the monsters. Tina is the innocent – a visionary who hardly understands her own powers but who can sense human venality and corruption wherever it appears.1641 Fighting with My FamilyCertain scenes feel very trite and predictable but the film gets you in a choke hold early on and won’t let you go. It is far more gripping than its subject matter might suggest. Who ever would believe a story about a wrestling family from Norwich could have quite such heart and resonance?Doppelgangers abound in Jordan Peele’s weird, creepy and ingenious new horror film. As in his Oscar-winning 2017 feature Get Out, Peele leavens matters with ironic humour but the joking becomes increasingly uncomfortable once the main characters come face to face with dark shadows of themselves which wish them extreme harm.The Avengers cycle comes to a rich and very satisfying conclusion with Endgame, surely the most complex and emotional superhero movie in Marvel history. At 181 minutes, this is a veritable epic, but with so many characters and plot strands, it fully warrants its lengthy running time.It’s a rare and precious feeling when a film completely dismantles you. Eighth Grade – the directorial debut of US comedian Bo Burnham – breaks down every delusion we have about ourselves and burrows deep into those parts we’ve made such an effort to lock away. You may cry. You may shudder as every awkward social interaction that’s kept you up at night replays in your head all at once. You may feel the sharp pain associated with those moments when you feel completely isolated from the world. Burnham may have crafted a simple story about the most ordinary of teenage girls, but it speaks with the emotions of a true cinematic epic.Natalie Portman gives her fiercest, most memorable performance since Black Swan in Brady Corbet’s enjoyably subversive satire about a troubled pop star whose loss of innocence mirrors the fall from grace of the US itself. Portman’s character, Celeste, is certainly one of the most objectionable figures she has played: a pampered, hard-drinking drug-taking “floozy” whose appearance and high-handed behaviour rekindle memories of Liz Taylor and Joan Crawford at their monstrous worst.Robert Pattinson gives one of his most striking performances as Monte, the death-row criminal in outer space, tricked into making a voyage described at one stage as a “class-one suicide ride”. The former Twilight star makes his shaven-headed, gaunt-faced character seem hyper naturally sensitive and feral at the same time.Amazing Grace is as uplifting a film as you will see all year. It’s a concert movie filmed over two nights and featuring Aretha Franklin, the “first lady of soul”, performing gospel standards in a church in Los Angeles in 1972, with a huge backing choir and an enthusiastic congregation.Disney’s live-action remake of its 1992 animated feature is a rip-roaring, old-fashioned matinee-style spectacle that turns out far better than we had any right to expect.“Olivia Wilde is a visually inventive director, who keeps the tempo here so brisk that we hardly notice how glib the storytelling sometimes becomes. We can tell exactly how the film will end, but it still feels original both in its screwball energy and in the deft way it continually reverses stereotypes and gender clichés.” “Late Night is a caustic satirical comedy that turns into an unlikely tearjerker.

He denies\u0026nbspall allegations against him.Last month, Weinstein’s attorney Donna Rotunno claimed that her client’s “whole life has been ruined” and that her client “will pay the biggest price there is” regardless of the outcome of a sexual assault case trial that is due to occur next year.Weinstein’s trial on rape charges is scheduled for January and will take place in New York.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailVaccinations could be made compulsory for schoolchildren, says HancockHowever, the NAO report found “limited evidence of any major impact on vaccination uptake rates” in England from anti-vaccination messages on social media.But it did find that some parents have concerns that make them reluctant to vaccinate their children.While a combination of all these factors appear to be behind falling vaccination rates, NHS England and Public Health England (PHE) “do not know the relative impact of each potential cause”.Professor Helen Stokes-Lampard, chairwoman of the Royal College of GPs, said the figures on vaccine drops were “very concerning”.She said GP practices had\u0026nbspsystems in place to notify patients when childhood vaccinations are due and to follow up children who miss their jabs.“However, these systems will be on a practice-by-practice basis, and we would agree with the NAO that a more standardised approach would be a sensible measure to consider,” she added.Professor Stokes-Lampard added that GPs “try to be as flexible as possible” in offering appointments at certain times, but doctors are “working under intense resource and workforce pressures”.A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: “Vaccines save lives, and are a cornerstone of public health. We are incredibly concerned by the decline of vaccination rates, and are taking urgent action to reverse this.“We expect anyone who needs a vaccine to be able to access it, and our upcoming vaccination strategy will bring together concerted efforts across the health system to improve uptake rates.”Additional reporting by Press Association Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

There’s a lot of mordant chat about the weather, illustrated with shots of dark grey clouds above even darker grey lochs.” 341 The Paras: Men of War (ITV)“From the outset the production is elevated by its sensitive handling of the men – and the Paratroopers remain exclusively male – involved. These kinds of programmes have a tendency to fetishise toughness, lingering on assault courses and weaponry.”“Despite what some feared, the casting of Cumberbatch doesn’t simply flatter Cummings – the A-lister is too good a chameleon for that. But, inevitably, as he scrawls out his campaigning brainwaves on a whiteboard, there is a touch of that deductive maverick Sherlock in his portrayal of this scruffy, balding political saboteur.” 541 A Year of British Murder (Channel 4)“The programme-makers must have done much to win the confidence of so many friends and families, as they went through unspeakable personal pain but they repay that confidence with an understated and powerful film.” 641 The Secret Life of the Zoo (Channel 4)“This documentary goes behind the shrubbery to show off these animals and their s. The humans are a pretty exotic bunch too, judging by some of the lines they come out with.”“You see, saint or sinner, prince or pauper, we are all part of one race, the brotherhood of man. And the saintly and regal Danny Dyer stands as its finest ambassador.” “West believes Valjean to be “the greatest hero in all literature”, and he plays the part with all the care and intricacy such a character deserves.” 941 Inside Europe: Ten Years of Turmoil (BBC2)“For anyone who’s not altogether sure how British politics turned so suddenly into a rolling dumpster fire from which all exits are blocked then Inside Europe: Ten Years of Turmoil is a necessary public service to explain exactly, and exactly how needlessly, we all came to be here.”“There’s really been nothing quite like Catastrophe on our screens before, and it deserves its cult status for the quality of everything the production team do, not least the stunning cinematography in this finale. Thanks, all. I’m glad Catastrophe died happy. “Yet again the Williams have woven a brilliantly tangled web, helped in no small part by Karyo’s quietly arresting central turn” “It is both a revisionist – and frequently batty – take on the caped milieu and a winningly knotty mystery. And it surely is the first big-budget superhero tale more indebted to Wes Anderson than to Stan Lee.” “Like all the best detective dramas, Shetland engages the audience in the very process of detection. That way we grow intrigued, and we care. And so we find ourselves sitting next to Henshall in his (prominently featured) Volvo V70 estate, sharing his thoughts, intercepting suspects and being driven off the road by unidentified enemies.” 1441 This Time with Alan Partridge* (BBC1)This Time with Alan Partridge is such a consistently strong creative achievement that fears for the future of Alan Gordon Partridge, may, once again, be allayed. Or Alayned, perhaps.” Michael Jackson has long looked like a burning tire yard. There were the allegations, the out-of-court settlements, the arrest, the trial and not-guilty verdict. But there has been nothing like Leaving Neverland” Home is a rather gentle, unobtrusive variation on the sitcom theme – but one that is built on a quite a bizarre premise. The twist is that a family who returns to Surrey from a holiday touring around France discover a Syrian refugee stuffed in the back of their SUV. Not only that, but, after a few moments of blind terrified panic about a suicide bombing, they eventually adopt him like he’s stray cat that’s just wandered in.1741 The Murder of Jill Dando (BBC)A tremendously sad, strange story then, and just as unfathomable today. Dando’s friends, family and the producer and director of the film have made a fitting and balanced tribute to her, something she deserves. I can’t really add anything to that.It is sometimes remarked that the Troubles in Northern Ireland make for an unpromising backdrop for a sitcom about adolescent kids. Well, yer man’s wrong, as they might say. Derry Girls, returning for a triumphant and exuberant second run, proves that humour, dark or otherwise, can be quarried from even the most unlikely of locations.While there are plenty of well-turned one-liners, the deeper attraction of Fleabag is schadenfreude. The character is as old as Daisy Buchanan or Lydia Bennett or Scarlett O’Hara. The best compliment to Waller-Bridge and her cast is that they find fresh clothes in which to dress these ancient monsters.2041 Road to Brexit (BBC)The Road to Brexit is easily the best thing to emerge from the whole brexit imbroglio. OK, not much competition, but still... Despite the po-faced title, you realise very quickly that it’s not yet another drama starring Benedict Cumberbatch or yet another attempt by Laura Kuenssberg to explain the inexplicable, or yet another show with the public arguing about stuff they don’t understand. Rather, it’s a very clever, very funny, very \u0027different\u0027 parcel of bollocks to Brexit.The footage is glorious, especially the side-on tracking shots of the birds and the hunting, where it is as if the cameramen were able to set up a rail along the ocean. Most spectacular of all is the sequence of a glacier collapsing into the ocean, where 75m tons of ice being sloughed off in less than 20-minutes. But at times Our Planet feels a little unfocused. Attenborough’s last big BBC series, Dynasties, won almost unbearable amount of emotional resonance through its focus on animal families. Our Planet is more of a greatest-hits parade, with overblown orchestral soundtrack and ponderous intonation. You can’t buy love, even if you pay for David Attenborough.2241 Line of Duty (BBC)Plausibility is a spectrum Bodyguard became ridiculous but Line of Duty stays just the right side, and as usual there is more plot in an hour than in whole series of other programmes. As well as being gripping entertainment, Line of Duty has become an effective examination of the relationship between the state and the inidual. The shadowy government forces are elected the organised crime gangs are fuelled by the drug trade. The police are there to save us from ourselves but can only do it if they are subjected to constant scrutiny. It’s exhausting work, policing the police.Joseph is almost never out of shot, whether seen from afar, contemplating a bottle of strong cider in a playground, or in visceral close-up, clutching his doner to his face. There are few actors you could trust with so much screen time, especially with such a pared back and naturalistic script. The fact any of it is remotely watchable is testament to Stephen Graham’s abilities. No man working in Britain today can drink a pint with more pathos.\u0027Good Omens is a hugely enjoyable, imaginative premiere, as close to Pratchett’s vision as anyone could have dared dream. And while the melancholy tone may not be for everyone, fans of the book will surely be sated.\u00272541 Years and YearsYears and Years, then, is favoured by some wit, a cornucopia of fab talent and promising characters. The dominant one as we continue our quest into the 2030s and beyond, will be Vivienne, or Viv, Rook, played brilliantly by Emma Thompson. As a bit of a long-term Emma-sceptic I was actually startled by how good she is in the role of the epitome of everything she has spent her life hating and campaigning against, for Viv is a horrifically nasty businessperson turned populist politician with the most terrifying of views. Viv Rook makes Ann Widdecombe look like, well, Emma Thompson at an Extinction Rebellion sit-in.As the series develops, it’s clearer than ever that Eve and Villanelle are more similar than they are different. Villanelle’s new vulnerability invites us to question what it is exactly she wants from Polastri. First time around she was toying with a more worthy adversary, but why now? Polastri, by contrast, is frayed around the edges, a terrible wife to her husband Nico (Owen McDonnell) and an even worse intelligence agent to her boss Carolyn Martens (Fiona Shaw). The script is still tight and the jokes are still there, as are Villanelle’s accents, outfits and abrupt killings, but without the will-theywon’t-they energy of the initial plot, it is harder to care.Timely, bleak, intelligent and compelling, Chernobyl is a triumph of a disaster.Season three\u0027s knuckle-whitening finale is far less disappointing than the last.The writing is sharp and well observed, probing the fault lines between small talk and real problems.A touching tribute to a flawed reality TV star.Despite the strength of its ensemble cast, Succession is a feat of writing above all. Although it is ostensibly a business show, you won’t learn much about the minutiae of media deals by watching it. Its key dynamic, between father and children, means that it is limited in the amount that can actually happen without risking the magic. The writers, led by the creator Jesse Armstrong, who also gave us Peep Show, weave just-about-plausible and sympathetic characters from a web of insults and backstabbing, and tight editing and camerawork ratchets up tension from a slow-moving plot.In Kathy Burke’s All Women on Channel 4, the unapologetic, effing-and-blinding, salt-of-the-earth actor meets lots of different women – from nuns to reality stars – to understand what it means to be a member of the fairer sex, so to speak, in 2019.So here we have an intriguing, but rather flawed sort of Big Brother thriller set in our contemporary world of digital snooping, near constant surveillance and (a topical touch) widespread use of facial recognition technology.Top Boy can be bleak and violent, with dialogue so naturalistic that it verges on the impenetrable, but in telling stories that rarely get heard, it asks us to think differently about the city we live in.Criminal uses its small canvas to ask big questions. The focus on these intricate dances means that after a while we begin to question the idea of objective truth, as well as the facts at hand. I have no idea if it is a realistic depiction of detective work, but it makes for gripping drama.3641 Tories at WarAfter an hour of Tories at War (Channel 4), I felt I had to get out into the fresh air and go for a walk. The foul language the visceral hatred the unbearable tensions the violence being inflicted on ancient institutions and this poor old knackered country by the Tories, as if with chainsaws and zombie knives – it was like watching my first Saw movie.3741 World on FireIn a TV world where too often we are encouraged to see the Nazis as warm and cuddly real people with emotions, it’s refreshing that they are here relegated back to pure baddies, strafing cafes, shooting surrendering fathers and generally being Nazi-ish about things.3841 Catherine the GreatAt last, an answer to the question, what could be more fabulous than Helen Mirren playing The Queen? Helen Mirren playing an empress, altogether madder, badder and more dangerous to shag. Better costumes, too.Sarah Phelps’s adaptation of crime writer Tana French’s novels finds two detectives trying to solve the murder of a young girl, with plenty of twists and turns.Romance is complicated, cathartic and messy, regardless of age or circumstance. But such uncomfortable realities are swept beneath the rug in John Carney’s rigorously whimsical new Amazon series. Modern Love is adapted from a New York Times column (it also spawned a hit podcast) and is as much a valentine to a fantasia vision of Manhattan as it is a dissection of the human heart.Damon Lindelof’s version of the beloved graphic novel is a compelling demonstration of what can happen when source material is treated with sensitivity and imagination.“As a slightly cheesy reminder of what we love about Doctor Who – i.e. the fact it gives us an intergalactic eccentric in a big flappy overcoat shouting at Daleks  – this is a New Year treat that more than delivers” 241 Billy Connolly: Made in Scotland (BBC2)“Billy Connolly: Made in Scotland is a meandering look back over his life, career, and national identity – a “Proustian wander through Scotland”.

After the album again failed to appear, West posted on Twitter to say he was adding final touches to certain songs on the album.We\u0027re going to be posting updates for if and when West decides to release\u0026nbspJesus is King\u0026nbspin the liveblog below:Kanye West has delayed his album yet again so he can fix the mixes on three different tracksControversial rapper recently claimed he told people in his studio not to have pre-marital sexHe also said that his support for US president Donald Trump was \u0027God\u0027s practical joke to all liberals\u0027The rapper, who identifies as a Christian,\u0026nbspalso revealed he tried to ban people working on his album from having pre-marital sex.“I thought if we could all focus and fast - families who pray together stay together, he said.\u0026nbspWest also touched upon his exposure to pornography from a young age, and admitted he became addicted to sex following the death of his mother in 2007, which he has previously said had a profound effect on him.Another bold claim from the Zane Lowe interview:\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspHe also claimed that he would one day become leader of the Free World, saying: “There will be a time when I will be the president of the US and I will remember - any founder that didn\u0027t have the capacity to understand culturally what we were doing.”\u0026nbspKanye West on the lineage of hip hop, during his Zane Lowe interview:\u0026nbspI love all of these people but you gotta know there’s a lineage of Jay to Ye to Drake. This person is your idol, then you get to know em, then you be friends, then you turn to frenemies, then you turn to enemies, and then you gotta bring back the positive energy. But that’s the lineage of rap kings and inspirers, because Jay was my BIGGEST inspiration. By the time I got to New York and we had the throwbacks, Big Boi had throwbacks first, but there was a little stand at Lenox and I’d be going down there doing beats with Jermaine Dupri and I’d pull up with my throwback and Jay is be like ‘man that’s nice’ then I pull up the next day with another throwback, and then day four they say, ‘what, you stay in Atlanta?\u0027More gems from Kanye\u0027s interview with Zane Lowe:\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp“Give me some other examples where someone is saying what isn’t culturally what you’re supposed to say…Give me an example where someone is saying what you’re not supposed to say. You don’t want to say it, do you liberal?”“And now—I am unquestionably, undoubtedly, the greatest human artist of all time. It’s not even a question at this point. It’s just a fact. For the greatest artist in human existence to put a red hat on was God’s practical joke to all liberals. Like, ‘Nooo, not Kanye!\u0027”In case you missed it the last time Kanye West\u0027s album was delayed, this great piece by Ed Power still seems relevant\u0026nbspHere are the details on those wild no sex before marriage comments.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsphttps:www.arts-entertainmentmusicnewskanye-west-jesus-is-king-sex-marriage-new-album-release-tracklist-stream-date-a9170426.html\u0026nbspOh, and Kanye has also now revealed that he\u0027s releasing ANOTHER album – that\u0027s right, even while Jesus is King is yet to appear – on Christmas Day, titled Jesus is Born.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspFortunately, I\u0027ve already drawn the short straw and will be working this Christmas. Otherwise I\u0027d start to think Kanye is personally trying to ruin my life.\u0026nbspA reminder, or explanation for those who have better things to be getting on with than refreshing West\u0027s Spotify page to see if he\u0027s released his new album: West was supposed to release Jesus is King, a Gospel-inspired album, on 27 September – at least according to his wife, Kim Kardashian-West. She then promised the album would definitely be released on 29 September. Obviously that didn\u0027t happen.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspWhich brings us to today, 25 October, the newly announced release date. Only, the record was supposed to drop at midnight Pacific time, which has now passed. West has since explained he\u0027s decided to change some of the mixes on three tracks, but will not sleep until the album is finished and released.He also claimed that his support for US president Donald Trump was \u0027God\u0027s practical joke to all liberals\u0027. Because of course.\u0026nbsphttps:www.arts-entertainmentmusicnewskanye-west-donald-trump-jesus-is-king-zane-lowe-a9170296.html\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspWest recently gave a controversial interview with Zane Lowe on the presenter\u0027s Beats 1 show, where he announced another album,\u0026nbspJesus is Born,\u0026nbspfor Christmas Day.\u0026nbspHe also explained why he refused to be silent over his support for US Donald Trump, and declared himself to be the greatest human artist of all time.\u0026nbspIn another revelation, West – who has identified as a Christian –\u0026nbspsaid he told people working in his studio not to have sex before marriage.\u0026nbspThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The company received a further 3,000 complaints in the first half of this year.Sean Moran, partner and insolvency specialist at law firm, Shakespeare Martineau said payday lenders have been under huge pressure from stricter rules brought in by the Financial Conduct Authority which capped the total amount of charges and interest payable on loans.“A lot of these companies ruthlessly target young men and women,” Mr Moran said. “The significant rise in personal insolvency rates for the under-25’s is of grave concern - they now make up 6.5 per cent of all personal insolvencies in the UK.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Responsible lending is much needed in these difficult times for the UK economy.”David Fisher, chief executive of Cash Euro Net’s parent company Enova International blamed the FOS for QuickQuid’s collapse“Over the past year and a half, we have experienced a challenging and uncertain regulatory environment in the UK, despite the fact that the FCA reviewed and approved our business practices and affordability criteria in 2015, he said.“FOS, the financial ombudsman, has continued to move the goalposts with its complaints handling decisions, in effect setting ever-changing de-facto policies that in many instances was inconsistent with FCA guidelines,”People who have outstanding loans with QuickQuid are advised to continue making repayments as normal.“If you miss any repayments you could be hit by fees and additional charges, and it could also harm your credit rating,” said Caroline Siarkiewicz, acting chief executive at the Money and Pensions Service.“Eleven and a half million adults have less than £100 in savings and investments so lots of people face cash-flow problems which can make quick, short-term credit feel like the only option.\u0026nbsp“If you know you need a specific amount of money for a short while there may be more affordable alternatives out there so it’s a good idea to shop around before you borrow.”The Money Advice Service website has a guide on alternatives to payday loans, and you can also contact our free helpline on 0800 138 7777.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

RBS said it remains on track to hit its full-year forecasts.\u0026nbspChief financial officer Katie Murray said: “These results demonstrate our solid underlying performance in a tough operating environment.“We have seen strong growth across the business, and our sustained high levels of capital and liquidity mean we are well-positioned to support our customers in these uncertain times.“Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Only British Gas would be larger.Any interested party can comment on the proposed transaction until 6 November, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) watchdog said on Thursday.Ovo, founded a decade ago, has consistently been rated the best energy supplier by comparison site uSwitch. It has sought to present itself as environmentally friendly and has invested in developing home battery technology to allow consumers to store energy generated from renewable sources.Energy firms face crackdown after string of suppliers go bustEnergy firms ordered to pay £15m green taxes or face losing licencesThe acquisition of SSE’s retail gas and electricity unit would follow another purchase by Ovo: last year it took over Spark Energy after the challenger supplier collapsed. That deal gave Ovo 290,000 new customers.Competition in the retail energy market has soared over the past decade, reaching a peak of 70 suppliers in mid-2018, up from only 12 at the end of 2009.However, a record number of companies went bust last year and more have failed this year. According to the latest figures from energy regulator Ofgem, by March the total number of gas and electricity suppliers declined to 60.The latest casualty is Toto Energy, which ceased trading on Wednesday. Ofgem said it will choose a new supplier to take on all of Toto’s 134,000 domestic customers. Until then, their energy supply will continue.Despite the greater competition – as well as the price cap for customers on prepayment meters introduced in April 2017 – more than one in 10 English households remain in fuel poverty, according to the latest government data, covering 2017.gas and electricity\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It delivered 97,000 cars to customers in the period to 30 September, comfortably surpassing the previous record of 95,356.Tesla now expects to launch the Model Y, an all-electric SUV, by the summer of 2020, months earlier than originally planned, and its new “gigafactory” in Shanghai has already started trial production. Manufacturing in China enables the carmaker to avoid import duties and offer lower prices in one of its most important markets.Following the news on Wednesday, Tesla’s shares jumped nearly 21 per cent after market close to levels last reached in February.“Tesla nails it at last,” said Neil Wilson, chief market analyst for Markets. The results stand in contrast to the repeated large losses the company has made since its inception. In the second quarter, Tesla reported a loss of $408m.Tesla’s cheapest electric car wins top prize at industry awardsPolice abandon chase after Tesla electric patrol car runs out of powerElon Musk says ‘cyberpunk’ Tesla pick-up truck coming in NovemberBut Mr Wilson added: “In one sense, we shouldn’t get too excited”, noting the much smaller profit of $143m in the latest quarter and lower revenues compared with a year ago.Tesla is pinning much of its hopes for sustained profitability on the Model Y. Chief executive Elon Musk said on Wednesday that the mid-size SUV could outsell the Model S, X and 3 combined.SUVs have become very popular in the US, Europe and Canada, but most models still run on petrol, leaving Tesla to cater to consumers looking for an all-electric alternative.Tesla’s earnings improved partly thanks to the recognition of deferred revenue from its “Smart Summon” feature, which allows drivers to call for their car to pick them up using a smartphone app.US federal safety regulators are examining the feature as videos have appeared online showing driverless Teslas running into obstacles or nearly hitting other cars.Mr Musk said on Wednesday that software updates over the coming weeks would improve Smart Summon.The company also stuck to its earlier forecast that it will deliver over 360,000 vehicles in the year as a whole.Additional reporting by agenciesOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Ad engagements increased 23 per cent, but the cost per engagement dropped 12 per cent.Those bugs include the company\u0027s collection of device data from users that it wasn\u0027t supposed to be targeting, then using that data for targeted ads.

More than  per cent of voters in my mining villages voted Leave in .”She concluded rightly that the public “feel MPs should work together to resolve Brexit” instead of “slugging it out.”Her attacks at the weekend on the anti-Brexit brigade are part of a consistent pattern since , driven by her belief that the will of the British people must be fulfilled.Her approach is all the more potent because she actually voted Remain in the referendum.But, unlike too many other Remainers in Parliament, she accepted the verdict and has battled to make Brexit work.In that quest, she has had no time for the Parliamentary shenanigans and legalistic manoeuvres that have dominated the withdrawal process, with MPs always “kicking the issue down the road.”Nor, in contrast to most of Labour, does she favour membership of the Single Market and Customs Union, which she said in  would represent “staying in the EU in all but name.”For her principled stand, she has been viciously condemned by others on the left, who have called her a Tory, a turncoat and a traitor.With typical fortitude she has shown no signs of buckling.“I was not elected to Parliament to bow to threats and intimidation. I won’t now,” she says.The charge of treachery is absurd, given that she is abiding by Labour’s  manesto.Moreover, she has devoted most of her adult le to the party.Caroline Flint in  - shes been a Labour MP for  yearsHer warm but steely confidence is a reflection of her tough working-class upbringing.Her deprived background is very dferent from the worlds of privilege inhabited by so many of the affluent liberal Remainers.She was born in  in a home for unmarried mothers in London, the daughter of a -year-old typist Wendy Beasley who later died of alcohol-related liver problems.Flint never knew her biological father.At the age of two, she was adopted by a couple who lived in a one bedroom flat.“My sister and I slept on one side and my parents on the other,” she later recalled of her childhood.Her adoptive parents split up when she was .Her dficulties continued into her young adulthood.Though she was the first member of her family to go to university, she embarked in  on a disastrous marriage to Saief Zammel, a Tunisian stockbroker, by whom she had two children.The marriage fell apart after a series of incidents, including Zammel’s arrest on charges of violent disorder.He was eventually deported from Britain, and Flint was left to bring up their children alone.These were hard times, during which she was turned down for a job at Woolworth’s.But she turned her le around, partly through her involvement with the Labour movement.An MP for  years, she has been a card-carrying Labour member for  years, since she first joined when she was just .Before she was elected to the Commons, she worked as an official for the GMB trade union.“She has more integrity in her little finger than many in that place,” says her fellow Labour MP Laura Smith, referring to the barrage of criticism Flint has endured in Parliament.Despite the fury from the pro-EU mob, she seems to have her Don Valley constituency behind her, precisely because she represents its views.“I think she’s wonderful, absolutely wonderful. She has listened to her constituents, it’s as simple as that,” said Bob Davis, an engineer.Flint was reelected by her constituency Labour party last week, after a petition to throw her out got just  signatures.Part of the admiration for her stems from her capacity – as she has shown over Brexit – to speak her own mind, instead of meekly following the trendy left-wing orthodoxy.So while others in her party wailed about Tory benefit cuts, she attacked the culture of welfare dependency, where claimants expected something for nothing.Given her experience, it is a travesty to pretend she is some kind of anti-Labour hack.With her roots in the working-class, she is far more in touch with ordinary people that most posturing, preening Remainers.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Under Theresa May’s we could have been trapped in it forever, unable to do global trade deals.To put it back into the agreement kills it. Not least because the deal agreed with Brussels is merely the mechanism by which we leave — it is not meant to determine our future relationship.One Labour MP vows to support Boris’s Bill, then back this amendment destroying it. If the public considers MPs ocean-going idiots, this is why.But the EU should help get the deal over the line by rejecting the extension Remainers forced the PM to request.MPs would have to pass it or revoke Brexit. They lack the guts for the latter.HARRY and Meghan are not victims. Not of tabloid “bullying”. Not of racism.Their claim that they are “existing, not living” is a tin-eared insult to millions who find joy despite daily struggles dwarfing those of this cosseted pair.The Sun could not have been happier for them when they married. We called their magical wedding “a wonderful symbol of the country we have become. Open, warm-hearted, brilliantly erse”.We’re sorrythey didn’t understand that along with the adulation would come other stories in the public interest — and scrutinythey chose to lecture the public on how to live their lives.Instead of maturely accepting it, or ignoring it, they declared war on the Press and indulged in a giant whinge.No, Royals with publicly-funded mansions, fabulous holidays and staff are not disqualied from being unhappy. Harry and Meghan do seem to be ­vulnerable and need help. But they should count their many blessings too.And spare a thought for those who endure crippling rents, mortgages, bills and tough, low-paid jobs with far more fortitude and less self-pity.FUNNY how so many MPs trashing our democracy no longer have skin in the game.Take giggling birdbrain Oliver Letwin whose calamitous career, a bulging ­dossier of catastrophic failure, will end before the next election. Or Speaker Bercow — the grandiloquent, circumlocutory, periphrastic, tautological Remainer slug — who is off soon too.Meanwhile Labour is now openly betraying its  Leave voters while desperately trying to avoid an election.So many politicians — unaccountable and yet key to thwarting the .million majority.

Meghan is struggling with le as a new motherand the global attention that comes with joining the “The Firm”. And Harry wants to protect her.But their latest complaints seemed poorly timed and worryingly self-indulgent. How  can you describe the royal couple seeing impoverished young African girls learning to box so they can fight off sexual predators, then using air time to address their First World problems with the media The same media, I might add, that was praising Meghan’s obvious intelligence and charm and had hitherto featured glowing reports from their first official overseas tour together.Prince William is reportedly “worried” about his brother’s state of mind, and after watching the documentary Harry  Meghan: An African Journey, one could only agree and conclude that we’re seeing a man teetering on the edge.The rampant paranoia, the relentless victim narrative and a tendency towards the dramatic are all perhaps signs that Harry does indeed need to take a break from public le before he unravels even further.But during that respite, he must surely seek specialist help and ask himself this: Is his obvious angst really just down to the media occasionally writing inconvenient truths about his we’s fractured family and questioning the couple’s obvious hypocrisy at using private jets while preaching about climate change OR is it the result of unresolved issues surrounding his mother Diana’s untimely death  My money’s on the latter, not least because Harry’s escalating rhetoric around the “safety of my family” rang alarm bells with me.As a child, my husband witnessed the accidental death of his -month- old brother and was put in the ambulance with his screaming mother. When he was , his -year- old father died suddenly at home during an afternoon nap.Both were deeply traumatic events that, by the time we met in , he thought he’d dealt with. But, in late , the birth of our daughter triggered a delayed response and he became riven with anxiety that something might happen to her.He developed the now resolved habit of what psychiatrist’s might refer to as “catastrophising” where, in his mind, a cut finger would escalate to potential sepsis and, like  Harry, “the safety of my ­family”  was an oft repeated mantra to try to  quash rational debate.Put simply, he felt a loss of ­control over what happened to his brother and father, which then manested itself in a disproportionately dramatic reaction to even the simplest of le’s problems and an inability to see past them.So I can only wonder whether the birth of his son Archie has triggered the same powerful reaction in Harry, who admits he thought he was out of the woods with his mental health, “but suddenly it all came back.” It would certainly explain his tears at the recent WellChild Awards, where his speech centred on his and Meghan’s feelings since having achild rather than focusing on the stories of those being celebrated.And it was “the safety of my family” he used to explain the use of private jets when, just a few days later, William and Kate — the future King and Queen of Britain — quietly boarded a commercial flight to Scotland with their kids and the dference in attitudes was there for all to see.Both William and Harry suffered the untimely loss of their mother and — wrongly, to my mind — faced the intolerable pressure of having to walk behind her coffin while the world looked on.BUT as William has clearly learned toaround the trauma and get on with his le in a mature and rational way, Harry still seems troubled, angry and prone to irrational outbursts.“I will not be bullied into playing a game that killed my mum,” he declared to interviewer and friend Tom Bradby.The tragic sequence of events that led to the death of his mother were going to the Paris Ritz with an international playboy, deciding to leave the safety of their hotel suite at midnight when they knew there were motorbike paps outside, unwittingly getting into a car driven by someone well over the drink-drive limit and not wearing a seatbelt.So yes, the paparazzi followed the carand, in an ideal world, they wouldn’t have.But a French inquiry cleared the bikes of involvement in the crash and, in the real world, anyone famous knows thatyou don’t want to be “papped” you live your le accordingly by maintaining a low profile and avoiding celebrity hang-outs.The Cambridges know that ­living a quiet, unremarkable le is the greatest antidote to unwanted media attention but also accept that the trade-off for the privilege le of being royal is that, ­occasionally, there will be “off message” stories and opinions they don’t like.On the South Africa tour, tetchy Prince Harry behaved like an entitled elite when he chastised Sky’s invited royal correspondent Rhiannon Mills for asking him a perfectly anodyne question about his visit.Later, while reporting from William and Kate’s hugely successful tour of Pakistan, Rhiannon praised the Cambridges for their regular and friendly interactions with the media.She observes that they clearly understand that official duty for Queen and country come first.“Compare it with the tone of the end of Prince Harry and Meghan’s tour a few weeks ago and you couldn’t have a bigger contrast,” she adds. “Harry had made it all about them by releasing a statement announcing legal action against The Mail on Sunday and criticising the Press.”EQUALLY, it’s worth noting that, like Meghan, Kate also had to adapt to royal le and, despite being mum to three young children, has never publicly complained about her lot.Probably because she understands that there are millions of people in the country with far worse problems and without the support network or finances to cushion the blow.That’s a rational outlook but, right now, Harry is clearly locked in a victim narrative where the nasty Press hunted his mother to her death and even the mildest criticism of him or his we is taken as “bullying” behaviour that threatens their very existence.I feel sympathy for him, but only he can change that self-pitying narrative, with his we’s support. Unfortunately, unlike Kate, Meghan doesn’t have a close-knit family around her and, judging by what she said in the same ­documentary, may be enabling rather than ­calming his paranoia.She said her British friends had warned her off marrying Harry because “the British tabloids will destroy your le.” Really  Or did they rightly just advise that the Press attention would be several notches higher than she’d been used to  Particularly as she has a rather off- message family Certainly not the poor man at Wimbledon who got ticked off by “Meghan’s ­people” for trying to take a photo of her when he was actually taking a selfie.No, it’s definitely time for a ­period of rest and, ­hopefully, reflection.  And , at the end of it, they decide to step away from royal le and live as private citizens, then we wish them nothing but the best.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Boris believes in better times.Like Buzz Lightyear he punches the air and cries: “To infinity and beyond!”What do you think when you see Big Ben or a photograph of the twirly-towered Houses of Parliament standing next to the gracious River Thames Most of us, I guess, used to feel a little bounce of patriotism when we heard Big Ben’s bongs.But the bonging has long since ceased to have that effect — indeed, the bongs don’t even sound any more, owing to the repairs being done to the clock tower.The sheer sight of Parliament now, I suspect, fills many voters with feelings of irritation and boredom, and maybe worse.As Bonfire Night approaches, it may never have been easier to sympathise with Guy Fawkes and his gunpowder plotters.This is, please, not an incitement to you all to burrow into the cellars under the Palace of Westminster with barrels of explosives and fizzing fuses.But would it not be tempting to tie a stick or two of dynamite to the tail of Commons Speaker John Bercow Is there not at least a small part of you that would welcome a big, cartoon-style ka-boom in the Commons lavatories and seeing the likes of Hilary Benn and Dominic Grieve QC and Yvette Cooper and Sir Oliver Ruddy Letwin emerging with their faces sooted, their hairdos standing up on end and their trousers round their knocking knees Back in the days of the Soviet Union there was a man called Andrei Gromyko, who was almost a self-parody of grumpiness.Gromyko was foreign minister for the Soviets from - and he undoubtedly had a brilliant mind.Yet there he would stand on the Kremlin’s viewing balcony at the May Day parades, wrapped tight into his smart coat and hat, and his grim, unyielding face said it all.Gromyko wanted no change. He wanted the status quo to last forever.He became known as Mr Nyet. That’s Nyet for No, never forever. Well, the brutal Soviet empire didn’t last for ever, as we now know.Gromyko stood on the wrong side of history. Soviet Marxism was shattered and the Berlin Wall fell.Parliamentary opponents of Brexit will one day be seen to have been similarly obstructive.Like Gromyko, the only answer they have is the negative.It is not because they are stupid. Labour’s Sir Keir Starmer, and that giggling nitwit Letwin, are well-read gents.Hilary Benn is probably brighter than his old man Tony was.Grieve and Anna Soubry are both lawyers, though you might not want them defending you in a big trial in case they got up the jury’s noses with their stone-faced insistence that no one  can possibly ever be right.And then there’s Bercow. The soon-to-depart speaker is a chippy, itchy, batey little piglet and one of the most gloriously public cuckolds of the kingdom but he has a perfectly good brain on him.It’s not lack of cleverness that afflicts them. It is their inability to realise that the public wants hope.Voters crave optimism in their politicians.They want leaders who offer solutions, not dismal shroud-wavers like Labour’s Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell.And after three years of this inertia, the desire for some brightness and happiness has never been keener.That is why Boris is flying in the opinion polls.It may not be that we all like every dotted I and crossed T of his Brexit deal.Plenty of us would have accepted No Deal. It is not that the voters have suddenly become Tories.But they warm to the Johnsonian can-do spirit.When everyone said he would never extract concessions from Brussels, he did.When everyone said he was a shallow joker, he found a statesmanlike tone which hailed European civilisation while embracing British independence.His opponents, lips curling, said he was just a racist, sexist nationalist who would sell out to Donald Trump.Boris crinkled his eyes, spoke up for the NHS and talked of healing and progress.Britain has had enough of the grumps and glumbuckets.Parliament needs to rediscover the miraculous qualities of the words “can” and “yes”. Buzz Lightyear Boris gets that. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Most Labour “moderates” in Leave seats cannot be trusted to back it, however much they hope to pull the wool over their constituents’ eyes.But the PM can then go to the polls promising that a Tory majority will reverse their tricks and finalise his deal.As it stands, Labour must agree to any election. And it is truly jaw-dropping to watch them running away, having screamed for so long for the chance to replace the dastardly Tories.With their ratings in freefall and in mortal fear of Boris’s popularity, they concoct ever more ludicrous excuses to dodge a reckoning. It is shredding the last remnants of their credibility.The public wants an election, by  per cent to . Labour cannot hide from it.They are stricken, ided and handicapped by the most unpopular political leader in UK history — but they will be seen too as snivelling cowards who put their party before their country.For the moment, though, Boris’s best bet is as his slogan says: to get Brexit done.IT is a scandal that the fracking revolution was strangled at birth.The Whitehall report saying it is “years behind schedule” doesn’t nearly cover the failure.Shale gas could power Britain cheaply for a generation, lower bills and create thousands of jobs. It would be far more eco-friendly than burning coal.But the Tories lost the PR war against a green social media campaign which terried the public using debunked and out-of-date US scare stories. Most people know little of fracking except that they are meant to despise and fear it.The Cameron Government could have pushed back hard. Instead it buckled and hit fracking firms with regulations making exploration all but impossible.What a calamitous missed opportunity.IT is impossible to imagine the terrying ordeal of the  migrants who died in a refrigerated truck.And we recoil at the evil and greed of the traffickers who have profited from this appalling tragedy.The only comfort is that there is every chance, from the details already known, that they will be brought to justice.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

What led to such a snub The Sussexes had learned the Prince of Wales’ team might have television cameras present for the filming of an upcoming TV special about Charles’ work.As we now know, Meghan Markle and Prince Harry were already planning their own bombshell documentary for ITV and Team Sussex was not prepared to allow the Duchess a starring role in a rival show.It might appear petty but such a decision shows the very real tensions behind the scenes between Harry and the Royal Family, including dad Charles and brother Prince William.As I revealed yesterday, the Queen, now , is quite rightly deferring to Charles, , when it comes to the deeply complicated interpersonal dynamics currently iding senior members of the Royal Family. So how on earth did we end up here While Prince Harry, , and Meghan Markle, , are most certainly not to blame — each side is equally competitive — their union provided the early spark for the ision.While previously incredibly tight, strains started to show between William and Harry soon after the relationship started.  There were a few key moments.In November  I was the first to reveal Kate and Meghan had a falling out over the way the new American princess had spoken to staff.  That was quickly followed by news Meghan had left Kate in tears over her demands for Princess Charlotte’s bridesmaid dress.It would later emerge that around the same time, William had warned Harry he was rushing into marriage. A distancing of the two brothers personally would have real implications for the future shape of the monarchy.Dreams of a modernising Fab Four made up of Kate, William, Meghan and Harry were quickly dashed.  Meghan and Harry would leave their residence and office they shared with William and Kate, both , at Kensington Palace and set up house at Windsor.Harry and Meghan were also to quit the incredibly successful charity foundation — responsible for the mental health initiative Heads Up and the Invictus Games.The Sussexes wanted their own court, which would allow them total freedom. But Prince Charles and his team at Clarence House were not having it.Given his place in the pecking order, Harry would have to sit with other more minor royals like Prince Andrew and Princess Anne under the Queen’s court at Buckingham Palace.Crucially, that allowed Charles a degree of power over funding for the couple. But the culture clash was near immediate.Harry and Meghan, and their millennial staff who do not give a damn about royal traditions, have felt the old-timers at Buckingham Palace were out to get them — blaming them for leaking ious stories to the Press about everything from the location of their new offices to private jet travel arrangements.The splits in the royal households were exacerbated by the departure of the Queen’s respected former private secretary Christopher Geidt, who resigned in  after ten years.A royal source said: “Charles and Prince Andrew engineered his removal in order to have more power but it has backfired because Christopher acted as a central authority and he brought people together. Nobody does that any more.”At the same time, Wills and Kate went through a total overhaul at Kensington Palace to position him very much as a king in waiting.As the lives of Harry and Meghan dominated the media on both sides of the Atlantic, Charles felt like the forgotten man.  And as we revealed yesterday he is “absolutely furious” that he has, yet again, been undermined by Harry and Meghan’s bombshell ITV documentary on Sunday night.His trip to Japan and own ITV series, which started last night, have been virtually ignored. But royal sources say it is still Charles who holds the key to being able to bring the Sussexes back in line.And right now many in the royal household are pushing him to take action after the couple’s outlandish briefing to CNN that claimed they had “single-handedly modernised the monarchy”.A senior insider tells me: “Harry and Meghan are partly funded by the sovereign grant and partly by Charles. He could threaten to pull funding. Meghan doesn’t have much of her own wealth. Harry has got about million in the bank.  If they behave in a disruptive and disreputable manner, that tap will be turned off.”However, Harry and Meghan feel very dferently about the situation, believing the royal institution had not been there to support the new American entrant.That is why ex-Suits actress Meghan’s decision to damn the British stf upper lip mentality as “damaging” during her dramatic and emotional interview with Tom Bradby on Sunday was so telling this week.No longer were the couple going after their ious enemies in the media, but it appeared to be a direct attack on the monarchy itself, reminiscent of criticism by Princess Diana in her bombshell  Panorama interview.In a further escalation of the rhetoric, a source close to Harry and Meghan told me this week: “Harry is back at Frogmore Cottage and has never been stronger. This is an institution full of people panicked they may potentially look out of touch and ultimately to blame for a lack of support.”There is no other way to take such a comment than as a direct attack on an institution run by Harry’s grandmother and father.  Charles in particular feels echoes of his concern for Diana, someone he feared for right up until her death but never felt he could help.Harry has most certainly inherited his mum’s ability to feel emotion and pain deeply — traits not celebrated in the Royal Family.Some say he also shares her tendency to have a victim complex and be deeply paranoid about those who actually are trying to help him. A senior royal source said: “Charles’ concern is being driven out of his love for Prince Harry.“This carefree young guy who used to be the best thing the Royal Family had — messing about with the Obamas, making the Queen laugh — he seems to be sad and to have lost his way.  If they seem fragile in public, it’s worse in private. Meghan is in tears regularly and this brings out Harry’s protective instincts.”For now, royal sources hope Harry and Meghan will recharge away from the spotlight during six weeks of holiday, expected to start imminently in the US. Certainly, nobody expects them to be around on December  when the Queen plays host to Nato leaders including US President Donald Trump, to mark its th anniversary.A royal source said: “Meghan missed Trump during the State visit and Harry acted like a sulky teen around him.”Harry and Meghan have both been urged to cut down on political pronouncements but they have ignored the advice so far. Tomorrow, for example, the Duchess will attend a roundtable discussion on gender equality at Windsor Castle.Another royal insider explained: “They don’t take advice well and shut out opposing views. It’s not wise but who can tell them otherwise   Harry’s war on the tabloid Press is of a piece with that. Who thinks that’s a good idea  Almost nobody in the royal household.”Tensions are never far from the surface. There is a plan for William to go to the Rugby World Cup finalWales get there, while Harry will join himEngland beat New Zealand. But let’s seehe can get permission from his we,” sniped one royal staff member. So what happens next One ally of Charles said: “Everyone needs to stand back, take a deep breath, stop sniping and work out what is the best long-term strategy to make this work. Harry and Meghan clearly need a break. If it doesn’t calm down, I could see them moving abroad and scaling back their royal duties.”Many within the Royal Family are desperate for The Queen to step in, bang some heads together and sort the whole situation out.  Especially given the series of damaging headlines the monarchy is already facing over Prince Andrew’s close connections with disgraced child sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein, who killed himself in prison earlier this year.But a senior royal source told me this week: “The Queen obviously doesn’t like this type of drama playing out in public.  Her entire success as monarch has been rising above situations like this. That would be a good lesson for some of her relatives to learn from.One would love to see what advice the monarch would offer to her very restless relatives that have plunged her beloved institution into one of their biggest crises in recent years.A Buckingham Palace spokesman said last night: “Whilst this story contains a signicant number of factual inaccuracies and hoods, we will not provide a running commentary on every piece of conjecture and gossip except to restate that family matters will always remain private.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I didn’t realize I needed to bring my own mace and rape whistle to Actors Hour.”Some in the audience then began to boo her and tell her to “shut up” to which she responded: “Sorry, that killed at group therapy for rape survivors.”Comic Amber Rollo said she also confronted Weinstein - and was also kicked out.“I went in and called him a f***ing monster and told him he should disappear,” she tweeted.“His friend bodyguard goon family member called me a c–t and I really really wanted to lunge over the table and strangle him… I restrained myself…“There was a woman at the table with him who gently guided me out.”“I’m shocked because he was invited to an event put on by and for artists,” Rollo added.Weinstein said in a statement through his rep: “I am happy to address anyone’s questions.“We should all be offered the courtesy to voice opinions and be heard, and to even get answers. I am glad we all still have these rights.”A spokesperson for Weinstein said whoever used the word “c**t” was not employed by Weinstein.The bar rep said that none of the staff had recognised Weinstein when he arrived around pm with two women because “he used a walker and looked pretty beat up.”When he was confronted by Stuckless he “stayed stoic” then “asked her to try to calm down and talk to him,” the rep said.“He didn’t seem worked up about the incident, he just sat back down and carried on drinking water.

and her wrist extended - while ladling chocolate in with her other hand.The completed mould weighed around two kilos, it is claimed, and Ms Anderson aimed to produce around  cards per day.On top of that, she had to “demould and trim” the cards with a paring kne to “perfect them and scrape off excess chocolate”.The process had to be carried out under time pressure as it had to be completed before the chocolate set in each mould, her barrister, Charles Robertshaw, says in court papers.Her kitchen sht then switched to making whisky wine gums between pm and pm, she says, and she would produce around  by hand.Miss Anderson followed the restaurant when it moved to Melbourne, Australia, in January , while the Bray premises were renovated.From February , her work followed a similar pattern to le in Bray, she claims, although she was under pressure to handle even more moulds, due to wastage caused by cards melting faster in the warmer climate.In June , she began complaining of pain in her forearm, Mr Robertshaw says.By  June , the pain had become signicant and on this date she visited a physiotherapist who advised her that the pain was being caused by her long hours and repetitive work, he continued.She temporarily stopped work due to the pain, but three months later resumed work at the revamped Bray restaurant, before hanging up her apron for good in November .Her role during her final phase at the Fat Duck again involved tasks such as “hand-piping whisky wine gums” and wrapping petit fours sweets.But she also spent a week preparing mushroom logs, requiring her to “pinch creases into  sugar sheets per week with her fingers”, she claims.Medics later pinpointed a torn ligament in Ms Anderson’s left wrist, although most of her forearm pain has now resolved.She now suffers “signicant wrist pain” even after carrying out normal manual tasks, court documents state.The injury means she has recurring problems with daily tasks such as heavy lting, driving and - crucially - cooking.Lawyers for Ms Anderson, of Glentidally, Milford, Letterkenny, Co Donegal, say the restaurant failed to allow sufficient rest periods or support, and “required her to work under time pressure throughout the day”.But the Fat Duck is denying all the claims and points out that Ms Anderson was transferred to lighter duties after she complained about making chocolate patisserie.The work she carried out had no known risk of triggering an “upper limb disorder”, defence lawyers insist, and the techniques she practised are standard in the world of haute cuisine.Her workload was not oppressive and Ms Anderson was given all the support and assistance she needed, they maintain.They also say she filed her claim too late after learning she had a potential claim against the restaurant.Ms Anderson’s case reached the High Court recently as lawyers on both sides discussed how it should progress towards trial.“In view of her condition, it’s quite dficult for her to find employment,” her solicitor David Poole told the court, adding: “she can’t work as a chef at the moment”.The case willto court next year.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Then Labour MPs were told to block it. But then Jeremy Corbyn came out and suggested itaposs not a final decision after all. It comes after Christmas Brexit Grinch Mr Johnson announced he wanted a snap poll on December  - and MPs would hold a vote on triggering it on Monday. Yet Mr Corbyn indicated Labour might vote against. He said Labour first needed to take no-deal Brexit off the table - and that, he suggested, means full-blown amendments to the Prime Ministeraposs Brexit Bill. Meanwhile, er, the right-wing Tory PM threatened to go on strike. So what on earth is going on  Hereaposs what has happened tonight and what happens now.  First, let’s set the scene. This all comes after MPs voted down Boris Johnson’s bid to rush his whole Brexit deal through the Commons in three days. That, in turn, forced him to accept a likely Brexit delay from the EU. Boris Johnson said he’ll allow Parliament more time to scrutinise his Brexit Withdrawal Agreement Bill - which, despite losing on the timetable, passed its first hurdle in the Commons earlier this week. That would allow MPs some time to tackle problems in the -page Bill, which puts the Brexit deal into law. Those problems include on workersapos rights, a border down the Irish Sea and crucially a apostrapdoorapos to no-deal Brexit - which could allow it by default in . But his offer of more time came at a price. The Prime Minister said he would only agree to a new timetabletwo-thirds of all MPsvote in favour of holding an election on Monday night. He wants to hold that election on December , which would mean dissolving Parliament after the end of the day on November .  On Friday, EU leaders are expected to decide whether to grant a Brexit extension to the UK - and for how long. In all likelihood, they’re expected to approve a delay of up to three months to January . On Monday MPs will vote on whether to hold an early election under the Fixed Term Parliaments Act . It requires a fixed threshold of two-thirds of MPs to back it -  votes in total. In other words, it canapost pass without at least some Labour support. If the bid for an election passes, MPs will be offered until Parliament is dissolved on November  to scrutinise Boris Johnson’s Withdrawal Bill. This leaves just a week and a half. Mr Johnson offered to extend Commons hours with Fridays, weekends, the earliest starts and the latest finishes as Cabinet minister Jacob Rees-Mogg vowed: We are willing to work  hours a day.  But itaposs much, much less time than Labour asked for. Then there’s a five week campaign leading up to an election on December .    Will Labour back an election  It looks like they could kill off the bid for an election - but we donapost know for sure yet. Oh really  So whataposs going on with Labour   OK, so. A few things have happened here. First of all, whips instructed Labour MPs to abstain in the vote on Monday - or vote againstthey want to. In an election vote, this is basically the same thing because what counts is getting  MPs to vote FOR - otherwise, an election doesnapost happen. Yet then, a short time later, Jeremy Corbyn suggested that this decision wasnapost final. Instead, the Labour leader said, there would be a decision after  EU leaders announce on Friday whether theyaposll delay Brexit. He said: The principle is take No Deal off the table, the EU answer tomorrow then we can decide. A Labour source later said the whip was a holding decision that could change in certain circumstances. However, the source could not explain what those circumstances are. One MP dismissed this as absolutely not true. Jeremy Corbyn insisted: Thereaposs no confusion at all. Why are Labour poised to kill off the election   Labour have always said theyaposll back an election once the threat of no-deal Brexit is off the table. The key problem is, the definition of the threat of no-deal Brexit changes from one person to another. It always used to mean once EU leaders agreed to delay Brexit until January  - something theyaposre now preparing to do. But Labour now says the definition includes the trapdoor to no-deal in  thataposs bound up in Boris Johnsonaposs Brexit Bill. Under the trapdoor clause, MPs wonapost get the chance to demand an extension to the Brexit transition periodthe government doesnapost want Parliament to have a say. That could mean Britain crashing out on  December . Jeremy Corbyn said: No deal is a threat that Boris Johnson has been using all along, and indeed it’s included in his legislation that’s before Parliament at the moment, the legislation that he’s paused. I want us to not crash out of the EU because of all the damage it will do to jobs across this country.  Yes. Corbyn-backing group Momentum swung behind an election saying bring it on - but dozens of MPs were poised to vote against an election no matter what. Some shadow cabinet ministers including Jeremy Corbyn met between Commons votes as the drama unfolded. One source said those present were unanimous that they shouldnapost play Johnsonaposs game. They added: “He wants to bounce the Bill through with a no-deal trapdoor intact and get a general election where he hopes to be able to push that button afterwards. But a second source later said that was completely wrong because shadow ministers were far from unanimous. And it was not a full meeting of shadow cabinet as several key members were not there - including Tom Watson, Keir Starmer, Emily Thornberry, Shami Chakrabarti and chair Ian Lavery.  So far, only the DUP have said they would back the election vote. The SNP say they won’t vote for it, and would instead press for a vote of no confidence in the PM. The Lib Dems say they want to see what the EU’s offer of a delay looks like todaybefore committing to a poll. Leader Jo Swinson said: Weaposre not in the business of bailing out Boris Johnson. Plaid Cymru say their priority is a referendum on the terms of the deal. Green MP Caroline Lucas warned there must not be an election until a trapdoor to no-deal in  is closed in the Bill. I hope MPs will oppose this dangerous and cynical manoeuvre, she declared. SNP MP Pete Wishart accused the Prime Minister of trying to play games. He said: We will not be pushed today by this Prime Minister. He might be hoping the electorate will fall for his con tricks but the SNP certainly will not! What happensMPs donapost back an election   The Prime Ministeraposs spokesman has suggested Boris Johnson will leave his Withdrawal Agreement Bill on icehe loses the election vote - effectively going on strike. The spokesman told The Sun: Nothing will come before Parliament but the bare minimum. We will pursue a general election every day from then onwards, and do everything we can to get it. Mr Johnson said he would “campaign every day and at every opportunity for a general election.” But after that, it’s unclear. He has other ways to trigger a general election before Christmas, outlined below, but theyaposre all fraught with their own problems. He could resign - admitting failure - and make way for a new leader. Or he could actually try to get his Brexit Bill through the Commons before January . How is a general election called   There are two main ways to call an early general election before  - and Boris Johnson is opting for the first one below. The first is to get two-thirds of all MPs in the entire House of Commons to back one under the Fixed-Term Parliaments Act. This requires  MPs - so for example, that could be all Tory MPs and all but about  Labour MPs. Boris Johnson tried this twice in September and failed both times. The second is for the government to lose a vote of no confidence. The vote can be brought by Jeremy Corbyn and won by a simple majority . This takes longer because before an election is triggered, thereaposs a -day window where smaller parties can jostle to form a caretaker government. Thereaposs a third wayLabour is refusing to back an election. This is for the government to bring a one-line Bill repealing the Fixed-Term Parliaments Act. The advantage is it only needs simple majorities to pass. But it takes longer and MPs can table amendments - such as forcing votes at age  or a second referendum. Why does Boris Johnson want an election   The PM has a majority of minus  so Parliament has repeatedly thwarted his plans. From rushing his Brexit plan through the Commons in three days, to withholding secret no-deal Brexit plans, to, er, having an election, the Prime Ministeraposs schemes have been voted down at almost every turn. With several polls putting the Tories more than  points ahead of Labour, the Prime Minister believes he can win back a Commons majority by fighting a whole election on the ticket of delivering Brexit. He renewed calls for an election as the EU prepared to delay the Brexit deadline by three months to January . The PM tried to characterise the delay - which breaks his own promises to the people - as Parliamentaposs fault saying an election is needed to break the deadlock. Can EU citizens vote in a general election   No. EU citizens living in the UK can register to vote, and can vote in the following:European Parliament elections . Council elections Police and Crime Commissioners London mayoral and Assembly Northern Ireland and Welsh Assemblies and Scottish ParliamentBut EU citizens cannot vote in UK Parliament elections - a general election - unless they are citizens of the Republic of Ireland, Cyprus or Malta. For more information click here. When is the register to vote deadline  It is always  working days before polling day. Sothereaposs an election on December , it will be on November .  Boris Johnsonaposs Brexit deal has been agreed by EU leaders and stands, regardless of an election, ready to be agreed. The Bill to implement the deal is a dferent kettle of fish. Itaposs passed its first hurdle in the House of Commons - meaning it is still active and in progress until the moment Parliament is dissolved for an election. If itaposs completed before that election, then it becomes the law of the land. A future government can unpick it one way or the other, to make it harder or softer, but this could be a long and dficult process. If it gets snarled up and doesnapost get Royal Assent before November , then it falls away - and MPsapos hard work will go to nothing. A new PM would then have to come back, legally, from Square One with a new Bill when they open the new Parliament. But itaposs not at Square One in a political sense because the deal is already agreed with the EU and a Bill is already written. If the Tories win, there is nothing to stop them bringing back the same Bill word-for-word to a more Brexity House of Commons. Boris Johnson finally agreed a Brexit deal with the EU on  October , though it still needs approval by MPs and is now on ice. The -page list of amendments keeps a transition period up to  December  and the £bn orce bill. But it scraps the Irish backstop, an insurance policy designed at preventing a hard border between Northern Ireland the Republic. In the backstopaposs place would effectively be apostwo bordersapos in a hybrid system:Northern Ireland and Britain would share a legal customs territory - technically forcing customs checks on goods crossing the -mile border with the Republic. But in practice, to avoid checks at the border, the checks will instead happen when goods reach Northern Ireland on the island of Ireland. Critics say this puts a customs border across the Irish Sea - more of this below.  Northern Ireland and the Republic would share some EU single market rules - forcing checks on manufactured and agricultural products crossing the Irish Sea.The Northern Ireland Assembly - known as Stormont - will get a vote every four years on whether to let EU law continue. But this vote could be passed by a simple majority - denying the DUP a veto on staying under EU laws long-term. Meanwhile commitments on workersapos rights are deprioritised - moved to the non-legally-binding Political Declaration for agreement later.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailI was on the way to a friend Abdul’s UK citizenship ceremony, when I heard about the  people who had died inside a refrigerated trailer in Essex. The horric news was made especially poignant as Abdul came to the UK under a lorry as a teenager. It was a terrying journey across the Channel which he survived by a miracle, but those  souls, as frightened and desperate as he was, did not. At am on Wednesday, the lorry carrying the lost  reached its final destination in Grays. At pm Abdul became British. The anguished last hours of those people’s lives are almost unimaginable, except to those who have come that way. As a -year-old, Abdul clung on to the gap above the wheel of the lorry that brought him so dangerously to safety. Another asylum seeker, Ahmad Al Rashid, travelled inside several lorries, two of them refrigerated, on his way to the UK from Syria. Inside one such Nestle lorry, after two hours of not moving, he and his seven companions began suffocating. “I could see death coming with my own eyes,” says Ahmad, who remains deeply traumatised. “No air, nothing but the smell of death.”    Yesterday all he could think of was that moment – “the panic, the feeling that all we were left with was death”. Eventually, the smugglers responded to the banging and shouting and let them out. But, of his entire journey from Syria, he says this was the closest he came to dying. In another lorry he climbed into at Calais, he and other migrants were almost submerged in bread flour. It was in their lungs and eyes, and the lorry was in total darkness. “For seven or eight hours, we didn’t move anywhere,” he says. “After  hours, a child started suffocating. We were knocking and knocking. Eventually the driver let us out.” Their journey was for nothing because the lorry had gone not north but south. “We weren’t in the UK but on the Italian border,” he says. “It was the wrong lorry.” Ahmad eventually paid , to travel from Germany to Hull, where Britain gave him asylum and where he has been able to bring his we and precious children from war-torn hell. Every time we hear of deaths in lorries or from dinghies on the wild seas, people ask what on earth could propel people to make such journeys.    Maybe it should be enough to know that getting on a flimsy dinghy or into a frozen lorry seemed a better option. In Ahmad’s case, ISIS had come to his town near Aleppo and beheaded people and left their heads as warnings. A critic of the regime, he had fled to Iraq where he used his skills as an English graduate to work for the UN. But then Mosul fell to ISIS. They poisoned the wells with bodies and beheaded anyone who argued. “Babies were born dead from lack of water and thrown away,” he says. Ahmad fled to Turkey where he bought safe passage on a ‘luxury yacht’ in Izmir. Except, of course, it wasn’t a luxury yacht, but a flimsy dinghy crowded with men, women and children. Somehow, he survived to Greece, then to Marseilles, then to Calais. Then the terrible detour to the Italian border and on to Germany and Hull. In my friend Abdul’s case, his village in Darfur was burned to the ground by the Janjaweed, killing his parents. His journey as a child took him through the failed state of Chad, the war in Libya and destitution in France.  There are refugees with versions of this story in every town in the UK, some now in safety. Some live on the streets because they are so afraid of being locked up. We don’t yet know the stories of those in that desperate lorry. It appears they may have come from China where human rights abuses are amongst the worst in the world. But we know that whatever they were escaping from felt worse than climbing into a refrigerated container and taking their chance against the traffickers and the cold. We believe they froze to death, and that the good people of the emergency services will never forget the experience of respectfully gathering their last remains. The answer to this tragedy is not to harden our borders, but to ask what more we could be doing to promote human rights and peace in the world. And to ask why the prosperous, safe UK took only % of refugees through safe and legal routes last year.

Heartbroken Donna Mitchell wants to ensure her son lives le to the full before the cruel disease takes over. She said Reece was a normal, fun-loving boy before he was struck down with Batten disease.     The youngster, from North Kessock, Inverness, Scotland, used to enjoy the outdoors, playing with cars and watching Peppa Pig .Now Reeceaposs days are numbered after being diagnosed with CLN type Batten disease a rare, neurodegenerative condition thataposs incurable and untreatable. Over the course of this year Reece has gone from aposa ball of energyapos to losing his mobility and speech and is fed through a tube. Cruelly, Batten disease has also left him with childhood dementia. Donna is determined to make Reeceaposs final days count as she watches her son deteriorate each week. The -year-old told the Record: I am living every parentaposs worse nightmare. Watching Reece go from a normal wee boy to this is devastating.    With Batten disease things can progress and change within weeks, months or years, we just donapost know how long we have left. Le has been turned upside down for Donna and her daughter Alex Brown, , since Reeceaposs diagnosis. Donna added: I was a classroom assistant at Inverness College for  years before Reece became unwell. Alex has dreams of going to university but sheaposs left school and put that on hold. Weaposre taking one day at a time but the kids have been so strong. After being diagnosed with autism and epilepsy in February , Reece began taking monthly overnight seizures. As time progressed, Reeceaposs seizures worsened. He had multiple brain scans, blood tests and an MRI which found issues with his brain cells and back area of the brain. In August  an eye test led to the devastating Batten disease diagnosis. Donna said: Reeceaposs condition definitely got worse going into . Originally he knew what was going on and would fall over a lot.  But heaposd always pick himself up and carry on. Now itaposs like looking after a baby in a six-year-oldaposs body. We not really surehe recognises us now but the one things that keeps me going is that he can still say Mamma. Their family home, a council house, does not have a large enough downstairs room for a hospital bed and all of the equipment Reece will need in the near future. The local council ruled out an extension to the property. The only other council property that would meet Reeceaposs needs is  miles away in Dingwall, Donna added. Uprooting Reece and Alex away from family at this time would be awful. Donna is now fundraising for a specially adapted pod to be attached to the house, which would allow Reece to live within easy access to the rest of the house via the ground floor. She has launched an online fundraising page to try to meet the £, price tag for the special pod. Asking others for money is embarrassing and humiliating, Donna added.

Snakehead thugs may have plotted the journey as part of a lucrative ­people-smuggling ring. Police were tonight given more time to quiz driver Mo Robinson after the bodies were found in his truck at Grays, Essex. One source said: “Those who died had hopes of a future in a good country.” The gang prey on people desperate to escape ­destitution for a better le in the West. And a source said the heartless Snakehead thugs will feel no shame over sending the  men and eight women to their ends – but will be furious at the cash they have lost because they never arrived alive.  The hopes of the migrants died with them, trapped in unimaginable horror in a refrigerated truck at an Essex dockside, after travelling , miles from their poverty-stricken homeland. Lorry driver Robinson is said to have fainted when he found the bodies piled up in the trailer he was pulling from Purfleet at Grays. The -year-old managed to dial  but was arrested on suspicion of murder. But friends insisted he would have had no ­knowledge he was carrying a human cargo of tragedy. It is feared they came to Britain with help from the Snakeheads, notorious people-smugglers with links to ­ruthless Triad gangsters in China. They are said to tout the streets for victims, enticing them with the promise of a better le before charging thousands of pounds to take treacherous trips to the West in a “fly-drive” service costing £,. They are usually flown from the Fujian region of China to Europe, all expenses paid, then placed in accommodation. They are then placed in goods lorries and driven in darkness, without food, ventilation, water or toilet facilities.  A source, who cannot be ­identied for her own safety, said: “This is not a crime in Chinese culture, this is an opportunity. It is an agreement between the Snakeheads and their customers. They are willing, they feel no shame in breaking the law. “There is a pride that they get out of Fujian and have a chance of a good le with good money in places like Northern Ireland, England, Scotland where there are good benefits. Yes the journey is dficult, it is uncomfortable and it is frightening, but the gamble is normally worth it. The chances of a good le is worth the risk. In this case it didn’t work. Something went wrong but the Snakeheads will just go again. “There will be no tears. In Fujian there is little employment, little money or opportunity, so we get it where. “These customers get paid as little as £ a month in China and live in horrible conditions. In the UK, they can get £, a month in a job with no responsibilities, get benefits, get married and live a decent le. “These people who died in this container had hopes of a future in a good country. Another group will be waiting for their chance to get on a lorry now somewhere in Europe.  “This will not put them off. The plan normally works. The Snakeheads have contacts everywhere. They are ­practical people, not emotional. They have lost £.million in ­earnings in this. So they will go again.” The source claimed migrants who make it to the West start paying back the Snakeheads the moment they get a job, over three years. If they cannot pay, the gangs will put pressure on their families back in China to hand over the cash. The source spoke as police began moving the bodies of the migrants from the lorry to a mortuary. Officers are trying to find outdriver Robinson, from ­Portadown, Co Armagh, knew the  were in the trailer being pulled by his Scania truck. His parents, Mark, , and Nichola, are believed to have flown from Northern Ireland to support their son in England. Officers searched their modern semi-detached home in the nearby village of Laurelvale. They also raided a £, home in nearby Markethill, where it is believed the suspect lives with his pregnant girlfriend. A third property in the area was also searched.  A friend of Robinson said: “I’ve known Mo for years. He’s the best in the world and would give you the shirt off his back. He’s not the kind of man that would do this. He would have had no notion what was in that trailer.” Another claimed Robinson opened the container to collect ­paperwork. The friend added: “He was ­absolutely horried.” A Bulgarian national was ­questioned by police about his alleged links to the truck which is reportedly licensed there to a firm run by an Irish woman. But the person authorities claimed owned it said last night: “We sold it  months ago.” The refrigerated trailer came to the UK via Zeebrugge in Belgium. It is still unclear where it started its journey. It is owned by Global Trailer Rentals Ltd, which is based in Dublin. The firm said it was “entirely unaware the trailer was to be used in the manner in which it appears to have been”. Social Services have taken around six “unaccompanied children”, thought to be from Africa, into care after they were found in the Belfast harbour area, it has emerged. Dover horror exposed mobaposs sickening trade Notorious gangs based in Rotterdam’s Chinatown have controlled smuggling routes between Europe and the UK for decades. They are the prime suspects in trafficking the tragic Chinese migrants found dead inside the refrigerated unit on Wednesday. British detectives are now desperately trying to find out how the human cargo made the , mile journey from their homeland. The tragedy echoes the UK’s worst migrant mass-killing, when  Chinese nationals were found dead in a lorry at Dover. Authorities made the horrendous discovery in  after stopping a Dutch truck that had arrived from Zeebrugge. The victims had each agreed to pay £, to Chinese ‘snakehead’ gangs to be smuggled into the UK. All of the migrants -  men and four women - came from villages in rural China’s eastern Fujian province. The impoverished coastal region is the hub of human smuggling operations and a hotbed of ‘snakehead’ activity.  Families pay for their sons and daughters to be trafficked to the West so they can earn money to send back home. Jing Ping Chen - also known as ‘Little Sister Ping’ or ‘Godmother of the Snakeheads’ - was linked in a Dutch court to the Dover plot. Originally from Fujian province, in the late s and early s she was among the most prolic traffickers of human cargo in Europe. She was notorious in Rotterdam’s Westkruisad Chinatown and suspected of being the main organiser of the Dover shipment. Her boyfriend at the time was a powerful Triad based in the city and they had a holiday home in the Greek islands. She was also said to have strong connections among Communist Party officials in Fujian. Dutch investigators said the ft ins-tall smuggler went into hiding within hours of the deaths at Dover. She was jailed for three years in  after being accused of smuggling up to , - earning around £m.  The judge said she was the “leader of a group smuggling human beings” but cleared her of any involvement in the Dover case. Chen, now , was released in . Her current whereabouts are unknown. The ‘snakehead’ smuggling operations had remained shrouded in secrecy for decades until the Dover lorry deaths. Crucially two migrants survived the tragedy and gave investigators a chilling insight into how they were trafficked. Su Di Ke, , and Ke Shi Guang, , said their families in China agreed to pay gangsters £, so they could get to the UK. They handed over £ initially - with the remaining £, due once they arrived in Britain. Before leaving Fujian along with other migrants they were given a code number identying which gang ‘owned’ them. They had been promised they would be flown directly into the UK, where they could claim asylum. But instead they were flown Belgrade, Serbia, on legal Chinese documents before having their passports taken off them. They were handed fake South Korean documents before being taken into Hungary and smuggled through Austria and France to the Netherlands.  There they were housed in a safe house in Rotterdam and passed on to Turkish mafia middlemen who arranged the crossing. Finally in a warehouse in Waalhaven they were put into the lorry and sent on their final journey to the UK. Most victims were in several layers of clothing because they were only allowed to bring what they were wearing. During the trial of Dutch trucker Perry Wacker, the two survivors gave harrowing about their hellish crossing. They said the trailer’s air vent was initially tied open and they were given four buckets of water for the journey. But Wacker closed it before he left Belgium to avoid the migrants being spotted and never checked on his human cargo. They were trapped inside the air tight container for more than nine hours on one of the hottest days of the year. During the six-hour crossing Wacker left his lorry to enjoy a meal of roast lamb and rice, with shrimp salad, and watch two films. Meanwhile the migrants began banging frantically on the inside of the container with their shoes as their air supply ran out. “People began to panic because the window was shut and there was no air,” said Su Di Ke.  “Some people removed tomatoes and wanted to kick open the doors. There was a lot of shouting and screaming, but no-one came.” Finally they held hands and ate tomatoes because in China it is believed you should not die on an empty stomach. Su Di Ke and Ke Shi Guang only survived because they were last to be loaded onto the truck and were sat near the doors. Police found the telephone number of the same UK-based Chinese translator, Ying Guo, on the bodies of  victims. After recovering from the ordeal, the survivors confirmed ‘snakeheads’ were behind the plot. “I didnapost have a good le at home and the snakehead told me there would be no risk,” said Su Di Ke. “We want to come to Britain because you can earn good money. Le is good there.” The survivors had been told to ring Guo, known as Jenny, once they arrived in Britain so she could help them claim asylum. “The snakeheads asked us to write her number down and,we were arrested by police, to call her,” said Su Di Ke. Ke Shi Guang added: “The snakeheads at home cheated us. They said they would be buying the tickets and we would be travelling by air.” Wacker, , from Rotterdam, was jailed for  years in  and quietly released from prison in .

Susan McLoughlin, from Netherton, Liverpool, who was already mum to three boys, died on October  while giving birth to their daughter Leila. Her heartbroken partner Jason McKevitt said Susan, , had been sent to Royal Hallamshire Hospital, in Sheffield, for specialist care after being diagnosed with hypertension at  weeks.But Susan tragically died during childbirth and never got to meet the aposgirl theyaposd always wantedapos, the Liverpool Echo reports.   Jason said: I had to tell my sons their mum has gone to heaven. One of them doesnapost really understand and keeps asking for their mum and I canapost give her to them. She was a great mum. All we ever wanted was a little girl and she was just an amazing mum. Everything she did was for the kids. Weaposve never had a night out together because we wanted it all to be for the kids. Weaposve known each other since we were kids, she was my childhood sweetheart, we both lived on Netherton Estate and our families knew each other. Jason, , who works as a chef, said he is facing bringing up their four children alone after his partneraposs shock death.  Leila only weighed lbs when she was born born and needed specialist care in hospital. Once she was strong enough, Jason was able to bring Leila home but was told he would have to pay up to £, to bring Susanaposs body home. The fee would be for funeral directors to transport the body, which are usually private businesses or council-run. Although there is no set cost, some funeral directors will only operate within a certain number of miles, while pre-payment funeral plans also restrict the number of miles a body can be transported. Despite a belief to the contrary, there are no charges for taking a body across county lines, although dferent rules apply to the Scottish border.  Along with costly funeral fees and childcare, Jason said he is concerned he wouldnapost be able to afford the fee. Since Susanaposs death, Jason said: Itaposs just been so hard. A friend of the couple has set up a JustGiving page in the hopes of raising £, to help with Jasonaposs bills. Speaking of the moment Susan became unwell, Jason said he immediately called an ambulance when she started to cough up blood. Following tests at Aintree University Hospital, Susan was told her baby girl was not growing properly, and she was diagnosed with pulmonary hypertension, which needed immediate medical intervention. Jason said his partner of  years was told the right hand side of her heart was blocked, despite Susan being fit and healthy and not a drinker or smoker. The family were told the best care Susan could get would be at the Royal Hallamshire Hospital, in Sheffield. This meant the couple were separated as Jason had to ide his time between childcare and driving to Sheffield.  Jason said: She got moved there and all the while she was asking aposam I going to die  Am I going to see my kids again apos He says she was told she would be OK. Before giving birth, Jason said Susan called to say I love you. Jason then received a call from the hospital to say Susan had died. He said: I was on my way to pick the kids up from school and I got a call to say you need to get to Sheffield, sheaposs poorly. We tried to get a police escort there, but we couldnapost and I was driven. I was asking them aposwhataposs happened, whataposs happenedapos but they would not tell me. I knew at the back of my heart something had happened. Jason said Susan didnapost even get to meet their baby, the first girl in the whole family. When told he would need to pay to bring his childhood sweetheart back, he said: I was just thinking of my little boys and my little girl.

Gary Smart, , was due to marry -year-old Laura next year but the couple were forced to change their plans when he was diagnosed with terminal cancer last month. The dad-of-six was fighting aggressive lung cancer and was given just days to live when he told staff at Northampton General Hospital he wanted to die a married man. Heartbreaking photos show him holding hands and exchanging vows with Laura as he lay in his hospital bed last Friday evening. After the touching ceremony, which included a hastily arranged buffet in the ward for guests, Laura lay down with her new husband.    Tragically, just seven hours later Gary died with his new bride at his side. Laura, who has a daughter from a previous relationship, said: After Gary was diagnosed with terminal cancer he told me he wanted to die a married man. We thought we might have more time together but it wasnapost to be. Last Friday staff said it wouldnapost be long and they helped us organise our wedding. Mum and I went out, got the rings, came back and we were told the staff had sorted it all. They said, aposWeaposve got your special marriage licence and a priest. Youaposre getting married at seven oaposclock.apos    In just an hour more than  family and friends dashed to the hospital to witness the couple exchange vows. Laura said: We had about  people there. We said we should have done it years ago. It was like everyone was saying goodbye to him at the same time. We all knew he was going to go. He managed to say his vows and put the ring on my finger and give me a kiss.  That night I laid in bed with him. We watched Fast and Furious  as he was into cars. I managed to fall asleep and woke up when the call button went off at am. I looked at Gary and he was staring at me, like he was trying to reach out to me. I had a conversation with him and then realised, his oxygen mask was not on right and he wasnapost breathing. We only had seven hours of marriage but I was so grateful I could give him that. He was a kind, lovely man. He loved his cars.  He was always building things, offering to make things for people. If anyone messaged him saying aposIaposve got problems with my carapos he would be straight there, wanting to help out. He was very selfless and caring. Last year, I was off work for a while with an infection and he knew I couldnapost afford Christmas. He went out and bought presents for my daughter.  As long as his kids got what they needed, that was all that mattered. The kids always came first. The couple met when they were teenagers but split up before getting back together in their late s. Gary, from Northampton, started feeling poorly in July when he came home from work with a bad back and complaining of chest pain. He started losing weight and was unable to sleep so went to the doctors who ordered an X-ray and drained fluid from his lungs.  Laura added: The doctors said they had found something but they didnapost know what it was so they did a biopsy. We got him home but he was clearly still in pain. He wasnapost eating properly and was very weak. We took him back to the doctors, but a dferent one this time. The GP was concerned about lumps that had appeared on his body and on his lymph nodes.

He wants £, in holiday pay £, in unpaid salary increases £, in Returning Officer election fees and £, in legal fees.  Mr O’Sullivan argues that he was unable to take holidays because he was on special leave, that he should have received the salary increase awarded to other staff who were working, that he would have been entitled to the election feeshe had not been on special leave, and that he should have been indemnied for his costs in defending himself against the criminal charge which was dropped. A report to next week’s council meeting states: “The former chief executive has indicated that he incurred considerable expense in the defence of the criminal proceedings and is seeking reimbursement of these costs from the council.” The report sets out details of the  Welsh Assembly Order that makes provision for such reimbursement.

Met Office forecaster Aidan McGivern said  to mm of rain is possible over the peaks of Snowdonia and the Brecon Beacons in Wales. The organisation has changed its flood warnings for today and tomorrow, with one alert for Wales raising the prospect of aposdanger to leapos flooding. The yellow weather warning will be in force from noon today until pm tomorrow.    Two other rain alerts have been issued for south-west and north England. They will both be in force from pm today until the same time tomorrow. Meteorologists predict flooding for south-west England as up to mm of rain hits higher areas and wind speeds reach mph.

The average total rainfall for October in the UK is mm.    There will also be a north-south ide in temperatures today as polar air washes over northern Britain, while tropical area sweeps across the south.

Local river flooding may continue through Sunday and into Monday on some longer, slower-responding rivers. Properties may flood and there may be travel disruption. A spokesman for netweather.tv added: There is warm air pushing north over Europe, from Africa up to Scandinavia, plenty of energy and there has already been atrocious weather in the Mediterranean with flooding for Spain and Italy.  There is also a push of cooler then colder air from the north-west wrapping around the low pressure north of Scotland. A large temperature contrast and this strong frontal band bringing the likelihood of flooding. By daythe temperature contrast will be stark, C in the north, low to mid-teens in south. For a time on Friday evening there could be some snow for the higher routes of Cumbria and Yorkshire. To add to the wintery plight of those living to the north of the Isles, snow is forecast to fall in the Highlands today.

There will be some sunshine in between the snow showers.  Snow flakes are likely to fall in Inverness and the Isle of Mull ahead of lows of C in Scotland this evening. Exacta weather expert James Madden said: “October is now looking like it will turn out to be colder than average with more of a chance of something wintry setting in through the second half of the month. “There is a strong chance of widespread frosts and the chance of snowfall which will set the scene for November. “This will pave the way for what is shaping up to be a colder than average winter with some extreme cold weather events.

Crowds have for decades enjoyed clambering up Uluru , formely known as Ayers Rock in Anangu, Australia, as it is believed to have great spiritual and cultural importance. But locals won a long battle to end the practice - and a new law finally comes into force on Saturday making it illegal. This is our home. Please donapost climb, reads a sign at the base of the red monolith. Residents in Anangu also argue it is often unsafe to climb Uluru. Dozens died on the -metre rock since the s.    And Professor Marcia Langton, chairwoman of the Australian Indigenous Studies at Melbourne Universityaposs faculty of medicine, was scathing in her criticism of those who took their last opportunity to legally mount the rock. She tweeted a timelapse of the crowds waiting to climb and said: A curse will fall on all of them. They will remember how they defiled this sacred place until they die  history will record their contempt for Aboriginal culture. Sonita Vinecombe, a visitor from the Australian city of Adelaide who lined up early in the morning to make the trek, said she had mixed feelings on the issue. You want to respect the cultural side of things, but still you want to have it as a challenge to get up the rock.

The newborn was missing a nose, eyes and part of his skull after the birth earlier this month. But the parents of Rodrigo, born in Portugal, did not know of his abnormalities before he was delivered. Medical council officials have voted to suspend Dr Artur Carvalho over allegations of negligence. It has since emerged that the same doctor has racked up other complaints, dating back more than a decade, involving other babies. Reports of those cases, detailed by Portuguese media, have provoked widespread outrage.    Dr Carvalho has not commented publicly on any of the allegations. Rodrigo was born on October  at São Bernardo Hospital in Setúbal, about  miles south of Lisbon. His parents had been under Dr Carvalhoaposs care for three ultrasound scans throughout their pregnancy at a private clinic, according to Portuguese media. They say he raised no concerns about the foetusaposs health. However the mum then reportedly had a fourth D ultrasound at a dferent clinic while six months pregnant. That scan raised the issue of possible abnormalities but Dr Carvalho dismissed concerns.    He explained that sometimes some parts of the face are not visible ... when the babyaposs face is glued to the belly of the mother, Rodrigoaposs aunt was quoted by AFP as telling a local broadcaster. After Rodrigoaposs birth and his abnormalities became clear, his parents were reportedly told he would only survive for hours. But more than two weeks on the boy is still alive under hospital care. His parents have reportedly submitted a complaint about Dr Carvalho to the Portuguese Prosecutorsapos Office. It has been reported that at least six medical complaints are currently open against him, dating back to . Other parents have come forward to share their personal stories with Portuguese media of Dr Carvalhoaposs alleged failure to detect health issues in their own pregnancies.

The killers poured kerosene over -year-old Nusrat Jahan and set her on fire on the roof of her school in April. She died five days later in Dhaka hospital following the horric attack. The teenager had claimed the head of her religious school in Feni, Bangladesh had attempted to rape her. Police said in their charge-sheet the murder was carried out on the orders of the principal Siraj-Ud-Doula.    All  men had been on trial following the death of Nusrat on Wednesday, April , which sparked protests across the country against oppression of women and girls. The case took  days and was overseen by Feni Women and Children Repression Prevention Tribunal Judge Mamunur Rashid. The court was told Nusrat had gone to the school to sit her exams. She heard one of the witnesses to her sexual assault had been taken to the roof to be beaten, so she rushed there to help. Four people with their faces covered then held her and poured the kerosene on her, and when she again refused to withdraw her complaint, she was set alight. Shahadat Hossain Shamim, a senior student, got involved in the attack because Nusrat had earlier refused his proposal for a relationship, police said.  Nusrat’s classmates Saur Rahman Mohammad Zobair, Kamrun Nahar Moni, Poppy and Jabed directly took part in the arson attack on the rooftop, according to the law enforcers. Poppy, a niece of Siraj, called and followed Nusrat to the rooftop, while Umme Sultana Poppy pinned the victim down by her neck. Shakhawat Hossain Jabed doused her with kerosene and set her alight with a matchstick, police said citing their statements. The judgement proves that no one is above the law, public prosecutor Hafez Ahmed told reporters after the court verdict. He said the defence lawyers had tried unsuccessfully to establish that Jahan had committed suicide. Defence lawyer Giasuddin Nannu said his clients will challenge the verdict in the High Court. Jahanaposs death sparked public outrage and mass demonstrations calling for her killers to be punished. She had faced pressure to withdraw a complaint to police in March accusing the school principal of attempted rape, her family said.    Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina had met her family and vowed to bring the killers to justice. I canapost forget her for a moment. I still feel the pain that she went through, mother Shirin Akhtar said as she burst into tears at her home following the verdict. Jahanaposs brother, Mahmudul Hasan Noman, demanded that the death sentences be carried out swtly and sought protection for his family against reprisals. We live in fear. We were threatened even today in the courtroom, Noman said. Bangladesh has seen a dramatic rise in the number of rape cases in recent months, with  women and children raped in September, the highest in any single month since , according to a report published by Bangladesh Mahila Parishad, a womenaposs right group.

The owner of the burger van did not respond to requests for a comment."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column september 6 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWe do not profess to be experts, but the costs involved in renewing  miles of power transmission lines, along with pylons and substation # plus the removal of what was there before # must be astronomical.What would be the problem for SSEN Transmission to look at burying the line passing across the Tarbert isthmus, or even laying a shortof subsea cable under the upper reaches of West Loch Tarbert  It may have been costed based on the published design, but the money involved, relative to the whole project, would surely be negligible.The company states no #formal objections# were received and that it will #do all it can# to minimise the visual impact.

Last year, it rehomed over , domestic pets and successfully released , wild animals back to their natural environment. The society now also delivers industry-leading animal welfare educational programmes to people of all ages.In my short time with the society I know of hundreds of examples of our dedicated people going above and beyond to do all they can for the animals and humans they come across. So, I can only imagine how many fantastic stories must be out there about the people who’ve worn our unorm since we were formed.As well as those who have had a positive experience with us in the recent past, we are hoping to uncover some long lost tales from descendants of those we’ve touched in decades gone by.The society wants anyone with any interesting anecdotes or memorabilia to get in touch via the website or by emailing .years@scottishspca.org.Kirsteen Campbell, chief executive, Scottish SPCASir,The likelihood of the UK exiting the EU has now shted from ‘possible’ to ‘probable’.That gives greater focus to our efforts to prepare and proof our farming industry from the impacts of no deal.Whilst it always has been  the position of NFU Scotland that the UK must secure a favourable deal on the terms of exit with the EU, we must also support our industry through any change in the operating environment.Many NFU Scotland members might think that their businesses won’t be impacted, but the reality is that there will be implications for all of us. Some will be direct and immediate, and others more indirect and emerging through time – but the one certainty is that these will be felt by all of us involved in the agri-food chain.There are a few things that would make a big dferenceapplied right across the board in the UK.First, the UK Government’s proposed import tarf schedule desperately requires revision. It would expose some produce # specically cereals, oilseeds, potatoes, eggs and horticultural produce # to a tarf going into the EU, but would allow that same product to come into the UK with no tarf.This is farcical.To apply asymmetrical tarfs on any products between us and the EU is to completely misunderstand the nature of food security in the UK and fails to recognise that trade is vital to both the UK and the EU.One thing that can be done, regardless of Brexit, is for our own governments to prioritise using our own products when it comes to public procurement.All our politicians like to talk about how good our agricultural industry is in comparison to others across the world in terms of standards and environmental benefits, but we don’t see near enough in the way of Scottish or British products being prioritised for use in schools, hospitals and other public services.Yes, it may add one or two pence to a meal – but I would challenge governments and public procurement buyers what the real cost is of bringing products in from other parts of the world.These products certainly don’t meet our standards – not to mention the impact on climate change with food miles taken into consideration.It’s only a couple of years since the kids in our schools were getting their chicken from Thailand. Things are improving, but it’s still not Scottish chicken.This is within the gt of both Holyrood and Westminster, but it might just be the catalyst for governments to work with local authorities to do the right thing when it comes to feeding those who use our public services.Martin Kennedy, vice president, NFU ScotlandSir,I read with interest the letter from Doctor Strain in the August  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser.Might I suggest that to produce a meaningful logo for the GP practices the following criteria are applied:The logo will need to show:May I suggest there are better ways to provide a service to treat patients, without resorting to gimmicks.Name and address supplied.Sir,I was intrigued to read Finlay Craig’s ramblings in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser.Would he be willing to share the location of his magical bramble bush for it appears the fruits of this bountul bush, when mixed into a pie, contain mystical properties that can transport the diner to another world May I suggest he tries a cold slice of reality pie now and again which would snap him out of his biased reverie and bring him back to the reality of the UK parliament being suspended and the Scottish representative of the party responsible for that outrageous manoeuvre vacating her post in protest In contrast, the Scottish government is working, along with others, to stop Scotland being dragged out of Europe against its wishes. Or perhaps the suspension of democracy is okay in his dream world If Mr Craig or any of his friends eat too much of his prodigious pie, I am sure they will not hesitate to avail themselves of a free prescription for their malaise and, should they need it, free bus travel to the chemist to pick it up, all supplied by the Scottish Government. If they live on one of our beautul islands, they can soon jump on one of the new ferries being completed as I write, again thanks to the Scottish Government.All this aside, when he rejoins us on planet earth, Mr Craig might think of entering his mysterious pie in the baking section of next year#s Mid Argyll Show, though I think by that time we may all be in need of something a little stronger from Scotland’s political larder to extract us from the bitter reality of Brexit Britain.Charles Ambrose, Lochgilphead.Sir,The National Autistic Society wants to find exceptional people, schools and services making a huge dference to autistic children and adults and their families.

It keeps its money as close to home as possible so that, amid historically drastic cuts, the amount spent locally has gone up as featured inon January ,  which notes #where other authorities privatise, Preston grows its own businesses#.Preston ensures that its resources prioritise local providers and businesses wherever possible. Argyll and Bute Council#s Procurement Strategy   falls some way short of this. Its stated aims commendably include:There is no particular emphasis, however, on using its resources to grow Argyll and Bute businesses, to reduce carbon emissions and food transport miles or to foster healthy eating strategies that would benefit our local farmers through #joining up the dots# of local supply and demand.The climate emergency demands a bolder and more innovative respond, and demands it now.Mary MacCallum Sullivan, ArdrishaigSir,I wish to comment on Mr Henderson#s  open letter to Brendan O#Hara in the September  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser.The expression #crash out# of Europe is used by Conservative members of parliament, the BBC and the press. While emotive, this is what many people directly affected by Brexit feel is happening.For example, on the matter of Germans buying our fish without a trade agreement the tarf will be  per cent on our fish exports to the EU. The Germans will no longer buy our fish.We can all read about other examples of the harm being done in the press every day. The cost of implementing a no deal exit will be borne by all of us, through further austerity , increased taxes , increased national debt or a combination of all three. To my mind, such measures will indeed cause serious economic and social harm.While Brendan O#Hara received a minority of the votes in Argyll, the present government was elected  by less than  per cent of the  electorate.David Inglis, Ardrishaig.Sir,During this, National Air Ambulance Week , may I draw readers# attention to the amazing work of the country#s only charity-funded air ambulance service # Scotland#s Charity Air Ambulance .Since  this le-saving service has been flying help and hope to communities all across Scotland in response to serious illness and injury.From our base at Perth Airport, we have responded to more than , time-critical emergencies and impacted on the lives of thousands # and the need goes on.The recently-established Scottish Trauma Network has seen four key major trauma centres created at hospitals in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Dundee.

Two men were paid to accompany Patrick the Fool on his journey from England to provide entertainment for the King and his guests while residing at Tarbert.Also recorded is a figure for #making a suit for the King at Tarbert#.  Bruce visited Tarbert on many occasions. His final visit was in the year of his death.Tarbert is believed to have been one of the earliest Royal Burghs in Argyll. An early reference as such was made in . It is also said to have had one of the earliest paved streets in Scotland.King James IV also had a close connection with Tarbert. The addition of the #keep# to the castle, part of which still stands today, was constructed at his direction. Whilst this work was underway, James summoned parliament to meet him here to discuss matters local to the area. This meeting took place on July  .Over the years, many travellers of note have passed this way and commented on Tarbert and its scenic surroundings.In  Thomas Pennant arrived by sea at East Loch Tarbert and described the scenery as #picturesque#.CGS Teighnmouthpassed through the Kyles of Bute in  and commented that #it offers no scenery worthy of notice#. He continued to note that #the romantic little harbour of East Loch Tarbert – with the overhanging keep of its ruined castle # form a scene singularly picturesque#. He became a frequent visitor to Tarbert.In  Lord Cockburndescribed the Kyles as #rugged and picturesque# but, arriving at his destination, exclaimed: #But Tarbert! East Tarbert!

The visual impact of this scheme as presently proposed will have a negative effect on the experience of everyone who lives in, or visits, Tarbert.Tarbert was designated as a conservation area in the s. Argyll and Bute Council imposes restrictions on works likely to have a visual impact on its appearance.But the council has apparently raised no objection to this visually damaging proposal. Similarly, Visit Scotland is reported as having raised no objection as well as closing all its tourist offices in Cowal, Mid Argyll and Kintyre in the past year.With the recent decline in the Loch Fyne fishing industry, Tarbert is increasingly dependent on tourism to provide employment.Other issues include the sterilisation of ground under the proposed line of overhead wiring. Opportunities to extend social housing will be restricted under the present plan.OFGEM administers a £ million fund set up to mitigate the impact of electricity infrastructure on national parks and #scenic areas#.Tarbert, along with its harbour and the isthmus linking it with West Loch Tarbert, without doubt, constitutes a #scenic area#.Reconsideration of this proposal is essential."},{"url":null,"title":"accordion and fiddle club back in tune","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe new season of Inveraray and District Accordion and Fiddle Club gets underway on Wednesday October .Guest artistes for the opening night are accordion maestro Gordon Pattullo from Coupar Angus, with Malcolm Ross on drums making a welcometo the club.Margaret Mather encouraged supporting players to join for a tune: #Without you there would be no club, so why not look out your accordion or fiddle and head for the Inveraray Inn.#This season, the club has opted for a new starting time of .pm for each session."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column october 4 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsTo an observer, it seems that Argyll and Bute Council is, at best, confused over its approach to autism.The people who know this best are those affected by the condition and their families and their view of senior council officials was made crystal clear when Autism Argyll gave up banging its head against a brick wall a year ago.Little seems to have changed since then.A council Autism Strategy Group is apparently being bypassed in the formulation of a strategy, yet the councillor in charge of health and social care says the strategy is the responsibility of the HSCP.Yet again, it is people affected by autism who are losing out.

further improvements are required across much of the local authorityambitious savings plans and satisfaction ratings are to be met.Audit Scotland carried out a major review into Scottish Borders Council between January and May.As well as interviewing councillors and senior officers, auditors sat in on meetings, reviewed documents and files, and held meetings with trade union representatives.While the resulting -page report card highlights an improving picture since the previous audit in , bosses have been told to communicate better and form better relationships with partners, such as NHS Borders.The report also highlights required improvements in some departments and the need for elected councillors to be better equipped for the tough decisions they face.Graham Sharp, chair of the Accounts Commission, told us: ldquoThe continued progress Scottish Borders Council has made to transform services is encouraging.\"Now it must focus on several critical areas including tackling underperforming services, ensuring councillors have the right training to enable them to fulfil their responsibilities and getting to grips with both staff and community engagement.Across the  performance indicators used in the Best Value Assurance Report, Scottish Borders Council was found to be below average in more than half.While education and social work are doing well, other aspects of the local authority arent quite making the grade.A lack of investment in creating employment and boosting tourism was criticised, as was the low amount of contracts awarded to local companies and the fall in the number of bills settled within  days.The deteriorating condition of local authority buildings was also highlighted.Problems since the outsourcing of IT services to multinational firm CGI - a -year contract worth pound million - were also raised by auditors.While the report identies the delays and issues which plagued customer access of the councils online services, auditors said it was too soon to gauge the impact of iPads taking over more traditional teaching methods in Borders schools from this year.And the methodology of farming out senior staff, such as the Executive Director for Commercial Activity spending four days of his week as managing director of the failed SB Cares, and the Executive Director for Strategic Partnerships seconded to the South of Scotland Enterprise Agency three days each week, was also questioned.The report stated: \"While this is a positive and innovative approach aimed at realising the councils wider ambitions, it must continue to ensure that there is sufficient capacity to deliver local services.\"But, perhaps, coming in for the most criticism was the current culture of secrecy and the need for better communication and engagement with staff, councillors and the public.The report stated: \"The council should be more effective in evaluating, managing and reporting its performance, bringing greater clarity on where and how its services need to improve.\"It also needs to get better at the reporting of performance - both in terms of information considered by members and in reporting to the public.\"Budgeting at the local authority, though, was applauded by auditors.And, during extremely dficult economic times, the managing to maintain its usable reserves in case of emergencies was also identied.Although Audit Scotland identied further development was needed for the ambitious Fit for  mid-term savings plan, which aims to trim pound. million from budgets by , the report is complimentary of cost cutting to date.The report stated: \"The council has a good record of achieving savings and has reflected the impact of demographic change on demands for services and pay

QuickQuid customers.The Money and Pensions Service warned customers of the payday loans firm not to be tempted to stop making repayments.Doing so could mean their credit ratings could be hit and they

have been inundated with complaints from customers, often encouraged by claims management companies.These claims were a major reason that rival Wonga was forced to close its doors a year ago.The claims management companies themselves are worried that the failure of QuickQuid could be damaging for consumers who have already had to deal with one collapse in the sector.ldquoAt a time when CMCs are being pushed to the limit by delays in PPI repayments, and the aftermath of the PPI deadline, this further news will mean that some CMCs will have to lose staff or close in the run up to

council plans to spend poundm over the next decade on six large playparks, three skateparks and four fitness shelters.However, following a backlash from residents in Hawick and Kelso, two petitions have been handed into the local authority objecting to the plans.Nine Kelso playparks are at risk of closure: High Croft Meadow Court Orchard Park Rosewood Gardens Springwood Rise Spylaw Park Sydenham Court Woodside Gardens and the Kelso petition has attracted  signatures.Ten playparks are at risk in Hawick: Bowden Road Burnfoot School Hawick Green Hislop Gardens Leaburn Drive Mayfield Millers Knowe Waverley Walk Wellington Court and Wilson Drive and the Hawick petition has attracted  signatures.Those petitions were presented to the councilrsquos audit and scrutiny committee today, October

They live here, they are required to pay their council tax and, consequently, they have a right to determine how that money should be spent.ldquoI quote from the petition: lsquowe believe in this instance lsquobigger and better facilitiesrsquo should not be justication to remove the smaller playparks that are situated in the ious housing estates in Hawick and the Borders.ldquolsquoIt is very clear from the comments associated with this petition and via social media these smaller parks are still well used and have been described as a safe place to play and exercise on the doorstep of many homes.ldquo lsquoNot everyone can access the likes of Wilton Lodge Park on a regular basis, and children with additional needs also find these areas too busy and noisyrsquo.Councillors discussed a number of possible actions including sending the playpark proposals back out to the public for further consultation and gauging the opinion of community councils in affected areas.In the end, councillors voted to support sending a motion to the next full council meeting, scheduled for Thursdayasking it to reconsider giving authority to officers to determine which playparks can be closed.That motion was proposed by Tweeddale East councillor Heather Anderson and seconded by Selkirkshire councillor Elaine Thornton-Nicol.A counter motion, proposed by East Berwickshire councillor Jim Fullarton and seconded by Jedburghrsquos Scott Hamilton, was also put forward, but it lost out to Ms Anderson and Ms Thornton-Nicolrsquos suggestionby five votes to three.Speaking after the meeting, Ms Wichary said: ldquoIrsquom very happy that itrsquos going to have to go back to the council to be reconsidered.ldquoIrsquom assuming, hopefully, that our petitions in both Kelso and Hawick have given them a lot of food for thought and that we wonrsquot see the closure of all the parks that were mentioned.ldquoItrsquos very clear that there are cost implications, but Irsquom quite confident that there will be some sort of compromise made.Mr McAteer added: ldquoI am delighted that the majority of the councilrsquos audit and scrutiny committee have supported the Hawick petition designed to stop the council closing a number of our playparks.ldquoTheir decision will now resulted in this matter being referred to a full meeting of Scottish Borders council where elected members

That race took place over the course of last weekend.The series featured five rounds at dferent venues, and each race was set up like a car rally, with untimed uphill transition stages leading to ious timed downhill sections, the results of which were amalgamated into an overall race time. The stages ied massively in , from as little as  seconds to an absolute behemoth we endured at Laggan in April which took us  minutes to ride! The topography and trail surface dfered wildly from venue to venue but also from stage to stage, and the taped trails we raced down last weekend at Fort William epitomised this eclectic set-up.Stage  was the easiest and least technical track we have raced on all year, an entirely man-made sprint through flowing banked corners coated in compacted quarry dust. Of course you had to be careful you didn`t push too hard, it is all too easy to wreck a race run by hitting the deck on an easy stage. We assumed that the organisers were trying to lull us into a  sense of security with stage #and we were so right!Stage  started halfway down the legendary World Cup track , channelling riders through some savage rock gardens before cutting off to the right along a lung-busting fireroad before descending into another sculpted hardpack track which then erted down a horrendously muddy, freshly cut chute that was littered with roots big enough to swallow a bike wheel whole. Even walking down it was impossible.A big transition ride towards Torlundy took us to the top of stage , which was the famous Blue Crane trail running into Ridgeline. Both of these tracks are black-graded on a good day, but there is a huge dference between trying to ride these ‘for fun’ and then trying to race on them once  people have spent a whole Saturday skidding them to bits in the tipping rain! A lot of people fell foul of this stage, but we survived and we absolutely loved it.Stage  was a dferent animal altogether. We had tackled it fairly early on practice day and hadn`t had any issues with it, but the swarm of maniacs who had ridden it in the rain since our earlier visit had turned it into an absolute swamp and the ruts were so deep that I found it almost impossible to negotiate with my limited skills. Dave telling me afterwards that he had romped it didn`t help my mood one bit!The last  stages were so high up the mountain that we needed a trip on the gondola to get to them. The black graded Top Chief track is a fearsome animal that follows the best twisty bedrock line around the hill before plummeting several hundred feet straight down off it into the tree line below, where it once again becomes sanitised into a flowing, twisty and utterly hilarious serpent of a trail that had riders drting and whooping all the way to the carpark. The organisers had cleverly split the Top Chief track into two stages, as there is a long section of perched wooden boardwalk high up on the mountain that is great fun to ride but would be far too dangerous to race on. Stage  was therefore very short -taking most riders about  seconds to ride- while stage  was a  minute monster. What a way to finish a season!So how did we do David was fastest of the three of us, as he has been all season. He finished in a time of  minutes,  seconds. He races in the Senior category , so it is a tough school littered with sponsored riders and crazy kids. He finished th in seniors on the day, and th overall out of an entry of  riders. Having failed to finish the race at Laggan earlier in the year due to a mechanical breakdown, David has been constantly playing catch-up but he still managed to finish in a brilliant nd place overall in the seniors category for the season.Alex has ridden consistently all year and has managed to tread the fine line between wrecking and ruling perfectly at every round. He had one of his very few crashes on the last stage at Fort William which cost him a few seconds, but he still ed a very respectable time of : to finish nd in the Masters category. The Masters section almost always attracts the largest entry and it is full of well-heeled chargers on very expensive steeds, so for Alex to finish in th place in that championshipin his first full season is a highly respectable result.I have continually been either on par or just slower than Alex on nearly every stage of the year, and nothing changed here. I knowI`ve kept within a few seconds of him I have done just fine, and I managed my ride to achieve this perfectly right up until the last stage where a cruel puncture right on top of the hill put paid to any chances of a good result to finish the year. With  top s already in the bag for the season though , I managed to hold onto th place in the Grand Veteran`s championship which was some consolation for a day that finished with me feeling, well, a bit deflated.Competing in this series has been a brilliant experience for us. We have had some hilarious times racing our bikes through some of Scotland`s very best scenery, and we have loved camping out of the back of vans. The organisers at No Fuss Events have done an outstanding job of setting up a professionally run race series in some dficult locations and have always managed to tread the right side of a precarious line, providing us with stages that have been just barely on the rideable side of ridiculous!David Muirhead leads Alex Dickson down the rocky Top Chief track during Saturday#s practice.

A high-energy showing in Paisley saw the McFadyens-sponsored side run out convincing winners.With the match going ahead at the Kibble’s grass park despite the heavy rain overnight and during the week leading up to the game, the surface was in surprisingly good condition, allowing the Pupils to get into their attacking flow early on.Up against a home side not lacking in height and physical stature, the Pupils had to be ready to contend with some lofted early balls from back to front by the hosts, whose game plan seemed to be to get the ball to their forwards as quickly as possible, but the Pupils# defence of Fraser Wylie, Ross Souden, Ryan McConnachie and Stuart Crossan, stood up to the task well.The Feathers Inn-sponsored Pupils quick passing and inidual pace and skill in the final third caused the hosts problems early on, and Ryan Gilchrist and Gregor McFadyen, and both had almost identical attempts to score, but snatched at their shots at the vital moment.However, the Kintyre Park side would not be denied for long, and scored after  minutes through a sharp passing move that released Gregor McFayden, who buried an arrowed shot from the edge of the box to continue his excellent goalscoring form.Then, the visitors made it - after  minutes, when an enterprising move out of defence found right-back Crossan, whose ball through to Johnny McCormick allowed the right winger to cut inside onto his left foot and release a thunderous first-time drive into roof of the net for a great goal, his second of the season.After seeing their deficit doubled, Carlton for their part put their Kintyre visitors under a bit of pressure from several corners and free kicks, but the Pupils’ defensive discipline continued to win over.Into the second half, the Pupils made it - when Donald McCallum scored another great goal, in a move started by Liam Renton, whose in-swinging corner was cleared to the edge of the penalty box where the ex-Dumbarton man McCallum made space to drive a deflected shot into the top corner of the net.At this point in the match, all three subs were used, with Ellis Robertson and Michael McKinlay replacing the excellent deep-lying midfield pairing of Ryan Gilchrist and Liam Renton, and Ross Brown entering in the fray in a direct swap with winger McCormick.The youngster Brown quickly got involved to create the Pupils# fourth goal, outpacing the Carlton full-back to draw out the last defender and square the ball across for Scott Souden to cheekily chip the ball over the home keeper into the net.The rampant Pupils completed the scoring in the th minute after hesitation between a Carlton defender and his keeper allowed McFadyen to nip in, touch the ball round the keeper to score a simple but well-earned second goal, for his brace on the day, and his fourth of the season.At the other end, the Pupils were determined to get their second consecutive clean sheet in league action, and while young keeper Alistair Ferguson spilled a deflected free kick in the latter stages, he bravely ed at the feet of the striker to smother his effort. The Pupils management noted how Ferguson’s kicking and distribution was first-class throughout the match.A Pupils spokesman said: ‘It was a great team effort, with our attacking players working together to cause problems all game. At the back, we defended high balls and direct play really well.’The Pupils are in league action again tomorrowwhen they welcome Argyll rivals Lochgilphead Red Star. Kick off is pm, with Kintyre Park the expected venue.The Pupils’ Liam Renton on the ball with Ryan Gilchrist looking on at Saturday#s match in Paisley.

George reminisced: ‘It was announced at a Town Council meeting that the Royal couple was scheduled to visit. It was all to be top secret, but that didn’t happen. The next morning the #secret# was ulged in a queue in one of the town’s shops and the news was out.’With a smile that showed how fond these memories are to him, George continued: ‘The Royal Yacht Britannia was anchored out in the loch and a small boat brought the Queen and Prince Philip to the quay where my father was delegated to catch and secure the rope. They were then driven to the Town Hall and there was a huge crowd present.‘Campbeltown Gaelic Choir, conducted by Mr M G McCallum who was also a councillor, had a lovely surprise for the Royal visitors. Prince Charles had just been made Prince of Wales, so the choir sang ‘God Bless the Prince of Wales’. This was very well received, and the Queen said that she had not heard it before.’George and Mrs McMillan were present at a reception given by the Town Council in the Town Hall. George remembers that he shook hands with the Queen and spoke with the Duke of Edinburgh. He said: ‘Only those invited could speak to the Queen, but the Duke moved among the gathering and spoke to some of the councillors. I was a coal miner at Machrihanish at that time and he asked me and some other miners about our work.’He continued: ‘The food and drinks were served on silver trays by waiters in tails and bow-ties. Afterwards, when the couple was taken on a tour of the town, the heavens opened and oh how it rained and rained.’A town councillor from May  to its disbanding in , and then a councillor on the District Council and the Strathclyde Regional Council, George was to meet the Queen and other members of the Royal Family on other occasions.

instance, the Coal Authority appears to have taken an overly excessive amount of time to meet its responsibilities, he said.ldquoHaving known about complications caused by an adjacent listed wall, some nearby protected trees and the neighbouring gas main, the Coal Authority appears to have singularly failed to address each of these all at once, a failure further compounded by their poor communication to the town of progress in dealing with the sinkhole.ldquoLocal residents simply wish for a speedy conclusion to this issue, which has undoubtedly caused alarm to those whose houses

What is it I always do riddles when I tell stories. I think of riddles and stories as close cousins which support each other.A good brain-teasing riddle is usually fun, and children in particular love the challenge of solving a riddle, as well as making their own ones up.Irsquom often greeted with pleas for ldquoTim, tell us one more riddle when I enter a school, and Irsquom often challenged to solve a riddle made up by one of the children.They are an ancient form of learning and entertainment.The first discovered written riddles are close to , years old. They were written in Cuneorm, the writing of the ancient Sumerians.A shortened and simplied version of one of these earliest riddles is: ldquoA house you enter blind, but come out with sight. What kind of house is it  The answer is a school, although some may raise an eyebrow at this answer.Perhaps the most famous riddle from antiquity is the Riddle of the Sphinx to Oedipus, recorded in ancient Greek around the fth century BC: ldquoWhat is the creature that walks on four legs in the morning, two legs at noon, and three legs in the evening The answer is a human being. When a baby we crawl on four legs, as an adult we walk on two legs, in old age we need a third leg .With my now continuous painful knee, this riddle has particular relevance for me, although Irsquom stubbornly resisting the stick!I use riddles as ice breakers in storytelling sessions and as an engagement technique because they quickly hook an audiencersquos attention since they are, by their nature, interactive.But they are also great fun to use with the children in your family.I use them to help distract and calm my younger ones when they are fractious. I use them in the morning when the kids are getting ready for school so they concentrate on them while they are getting ready.We make the riddles about the things we can see and the things we are doing, for example: ldquoTherersquos a big one and a wee one and three in between, we are two families of five, we are all going to nursery, but we are usually not seen. Who are we  The answer, of course, is my sonrsquos toes!For younger kids, itrsquos important to repeat riddles they already know the answer to. It helps them learn the riddle and how wordplay works. It also teaches them the rhythm of how they are told.My four-year-old is getting pretty good at this, although the answers to his own made-up riddles donrsquot always make sense.That doesnrsquot matter at this stage, whatrsquos important is hersquos developing an understanding of how they work and it encourages him to look for things to make riddles about.His nearly six-year-old sister likes to challenge him too.Her riddle ldquoI am short when I sit, I am long when I jump, what am I  had me thinking for some time before I got the answer: a frog.To make a riddle, think of the answer first. Then work the riddle up to the answer. It involves thinking about all the dferent qualities, uses of and parts of the answer and how they can be twisted or described dferently.For example, a shoe has a tongue but canrsquot talk, a clock has a face and hands but no body, a river has a bed but doesnrsquot sleep.Once introduced to riddle-making, children can get really engaged with it. A group of seven-eight-year-olds in a P class challenged me last week with a riddle they had made up themselves: ldquoI have a brain full of teacherrsquos knowledge, I crash without moving, I freeze while staying warm, what am I  The answer is a computer.Some riddles rhyme and it can be an extra challenge to think of a rhyming riddle, but they donrsquot have to rhyme.It really is a fun and rewarding activity to make a regular habit in the car, dinner table, on a walk or even a bedtime riddle.To help you out, there are literally thousands of examples of riddles in books, on the internet, in history, films and ones you hear. But the best ones will be those made up yourself, and the more you do it, the better at it you will become.And the benefits of riddling regularly with your family can be signicant, especially for children. It can promote critical thinking, encourage the observation of the world around us, help language development and can be a powerful bonding process with your child. And itrsquos fun!And so when next time you are with your kids, grandchildren, nieces or nephews and find yourself waiting for food to be delivered in a restaurant or have no time for a proper bedtime story, or you just want to spend some quality time together without a screen, try make riddling part of it. Trust me, it will be fun.Oh, and the answer to the well-known riddle at the beginning  Itrsquos a coffin."},{"url":null,"title":"positives-negatives-plans-haddington-town-centre-says-group","story":"Proposals were revealed by the Courier last month that would see a complete revamp of Haddington town centre.Dozens of spaces could be removed from High Street and Market Street, with the introduction of cycle lanes, wider footpaths and a communal space on High Street.The proposals have been met with concern by businesses in the town centre, who fear that the removal of up to  spaces ndash and the introduction of a car park of more than  spaces on Whittingehame Drive ndash could have a negative impact on their way of le.Haddington and District Community Council heard from both Haddington Business Community Partnershipand residents last Tuesday before asking non-community councillors, including the Courier, to leave to discuss the proposals in private.Now, a sub-group ndash made up of community councillors Jan Wilson , Fiona McEwan , Paul Darling , Pat Lemmon and Jack Worden ndash is to meet to draft a letter to East Lothian Council outlining concerns and any positives regarding the scheme.Mrs Lemmon said: ldquoAll community councillors managed to finally see the draft plan that has already been submitted to Sustrans.ldquoThere are some positives but there are also negatives.ldquoSo the community council has formed a sub-group, which is meeting on Tuesday to draft a letter to East Lothian Council. It is felt at the moment that the draft in its entirety is not acceptable until this letter is lodged and any concerns we have are taken on board.ldquoNot everybody understood everything that was involved in the draft plan but time was needed to make sure not only all the community councillors were more familiar with the draft plan but we had heard from HBCP and Haddington residents.ldquoIt was felt in the past that at community council meetings not enough time had been dedicated to it, hence the reason why Tuesday night happened.When the controversial proposals were revealed, the local authority confirmed it was ldquoexploring additional options for sustainable travel improvements in and around Haddington town centre.The new lsquoedge of centrersquo car park, dubbed a park and stride or a park and ride, would encourage people to walk or be bussed from Whittingehame Drive back into the town centre.No location has been confirmed for any new car park, although there have been concerns raised as to how it would impact upon community events such as Nungate Gala and the townrsquos fireworks.The long-stay car park at the townrsquos Tesco store, which is used by many people working in the town centre, could also become a short-stay car park.Joanna Gibson, HBCP chairwoman, outlined the grouprsquos feelings about the proposed scheme before non-community councillors were asked to leave the meeting ndash a decision that, according to East Lothian Council, was entirely down to the community council.A number of businesses feared they would not be able to operate through a y construction period.

This includes improved pedestrian and cycle access, as well as exploring additional options for sustainable travel improvements in and around Haddington town centre.ldquoOur priorities are to protect and enhance the local environment while supporting the local economy.

Despite the objection of the Democratic Unionist Partyand anti-abortion crusaders, it was ruled that from midnight it would be legal to have an abortion in Northern Ireland, as in the Republic of Ireland, as in the rest of the UK.With the passage of this legislation, women in the first  weeks of pregnancy who wish to have a termination will no longer have to skulk out of the country, or purchase online pills, rendering them open to prosecution should these make them so unwell they require medical attention.After next April, following an interim period during which access to services on the mainland will be freely available, the situation in Northern Ireland will change radically. Those who are pregnant as a result of incest or rape those who know their foetus has an incurable disease that will allow them little quality of le for as long as they survive those who have been told they must go full term, even though the baby has died, will finally be given a degree of dignity and comfort. At last, they will be able to end a pregnancy of their own volition, in their homeland, without stigma and with the full support of the medical professionals who tend to them.It is a not a subject for wild rejoicing, as was evident in the sombre response of campaigners on learning the law had been passed. The mood was more of relief than jubilation. Nobody can feel joy at the idea of a pregnancy that, for whatever reason, is better ended.But it is possible to feel gratitude that an old and crippling injustice, a hangover of a puritanical stranglehold on womenrsquos lives, has been overturned. As of now, Northern Irish women are entitled to decide on their own welfare and that of their unborn child. It is a right that is not only legal but ethical.That these new laws are among the most liberal in Europe is remarkable, given the strength and tenacity of opposition to this issue. It must exacerbate the fury of the anti-abortion camp to watch the political mothership in London impose its will with such vigour.That this has happened under a Conservative government with which the DUP was in partnership, is an added grievance. As is the fact that even the Republic of Ireland, once a by-word for religious conservatism, last year voted to allow terminations . This volte face was salt in the wound for pro-lers and pro-choice activists alike.The measure of how historic this landmark will prove can be gauged by the opening of the padlock on the Assemblyrsquos gates. Sinn Fein did not turn up, but Arlene Forster, leader of the DUP, announced that, despite this act, her party would explore ldquoevery possible legal option to prevent the provision of abortion services within their borders.A fuming zealot was less restrained: ldquoin todayrsquos world the most dangerous place to be is actually in the womb of a woman. There could hardly be a more calculated insult to womankind, but the depth of this manrsquos misogyny highlights the intensity of prejudice and oppression with which the pro-choice lobby has had to contend.This momentous step is good news for the United Kingdom, as is impending legislation to allow same-sex marriage from next January. All this is positive. Yet it is a sad day for the Union that both decisions, which will have far-reaching social implications, are not the work of Irish politicians but of Westminster.Since the Assembly collapsed in January , its day to day business has been handled by civil servants. You might argue they are doing such a good job they are enabling Sinn Fein and the DUP to maintain their stand-off. That not even the murder of the journalist Lyra McKee could encourage these parties to put aside their quarrel indicates the bitterness and ision at the heart of Irish politics.Yet while the Assembly has been lying all these months in an induced coma, London has not been idle. Those on the pro-choice side of the debate might have mixed feelings, since their argument has been vindicated thanks to action by the English. Time was when anything that came out of Westminster was regarded in certain quarters as toxic. How ironic, then, that the Assemblyrsquos denizens have allowed their internal wrangling, their myopia and obstinacy, to allow an often loathed overlord to step into their shoes and usher voters into a more compassionate age.That must be galling for everyone. Then again, perhaps not. When Stormont reconvened for the space of roughly an hour, squabbling made any hope of constitutional challenge impossible. It was hardly edying. Rather than acting as a reminder that the Assemblyrsquos members have the power to settle the countryrsquos affairs without interference from outside, it was instead a shambles, a pantomime whose script had been lted straight from the myth of Pandorarsquos Box.I would not be surprised , following this, some are wonderingthey should dispense with the Assembly altogether, since they are better served by panjandrums across the sea. Others, meanwhile, will be looking south towards the Republic, anticipating the time when old isions are lted, and all of Ireland is united peacefully once more.What lies between now and that day, should it ever arrive, will be turbulent, to say the least. For the meantime, it is paradox enough that it has taken Westminster to unlock the chains in which Northern Irelandrsquos women have been shackled. The symbolic signicance of this long overdue act should give the refusniks at Stormont pause for thought."},{"url":null,"title":"gps-travelling-england-plug-gaps-rural-highland-island-practices","story":"The recruitment initiative funded by the Scottish Government has signed up  GPs to date following adverts posted in the British Medical Journal in .The vast majority are from England and are either retired or close to retirement.Participants in the scheme, known as ldquoRediscover the Joy of General Practice, agree to work for  to  weeks annually, in stints of one to four weeks at a time, in GP practices in the Highlands, Western Isles, Orkney and Shetland, which have struggled with doctor shortages.It can include providing cover in single-handed practices when the sole GP goes on holiday or requires leave due to sickness or bereavement.: Call to end independent contractor model which allows GPs to set own earningsldquoThe Joy GPs are employed via NHS Shetland and paid a fixed salary by the GP practices, making it cheaper than employing locums.Although membership of the scheme was available to GPs across the UK ndash including in Scotland ndash it has proved particularly popular among GPs from England.Ralph Roberts, chairman of the Scottish Rural Medicine Collaborative , which is overseeing the project, said: ldquoPart of the point was to bring a new pool of GPs into Scotland so we were very keen to attract from outside Scotland.ldquoI think itrsquos about a change of scene and that this is an opportunity for people who want to practise medicine without a lot of the bureaucracy around running your own practice.Mr Roberts, who is currently the chief executive of NHS Borders but was in charge of NHS Shetland when The Joy scheme was drawn up, said the SRMC will carry out a second recruitment drive later this year to increase the GP pool.: Call for an increase in Scottish medical school places and more intakes from Scottish studentsPlans are also under way to expand it into other health board areas, including potentially Dumfries and Galloway, he added.The scheme will also be exhibited from today at the Royal College of General Practitionersrsquo annual primary care conference in Liverpool.One Joy recruit is Dr Peter Glennon, , who recently retired from general practice in Stafford.He said: ldquoI could have carried on working as a locum in Stafford but I was drawn to the challenge of The Joy.

For many undecided Scottish voters this sort of alternative appears to appeal ndash it avoids the big leap while still rejecting arrangements as they are today.But federalisation or any form of a signicantly re-imagined UK is never going to happen. My experiences as an undergraduate at Oxford taught me at least that much. The English elite simply have no interest in a radical reform. While the discourse along this theme rages on north of the Border, the silence in the south-east of England roars a definitive ldquono. Sweeping reform simply isnrsquot on the radar. Andit werenrsquot after a heartfelt vow to change was made on the eve of the  poll and % still voted Yes, it is never going to be.:Lobby row Ruth Davidson set up her own consultancy firm  days agoBecause in a ldquoprecious union of nations, as the nauseatingly insincere phrase goes, we would have said that given two nations rejected Brexit and the overall result in that referendum was narrow, we should leave but in a very soft form. A Union that respects the views of all its nations would allow for flexible arrangements where Scotland could have a deal tailored to its needs and respecting its anti-Brexit vote. But no such recognition of national dferences within the UK came Scotlandrsquos way. On Wednesday we even heard from the Prime Minister that the devolved legislatures have no role whatsoever in consenting to the Brexit deal ndash a claim as outrageous as it is erroneous.For most of the southern English who go on to rule the UK roost, Scotland piques interest only for carefully selected performative acts. At Oxford the usual crowd of boys schooled in England with refined English accents and London homes would don their kilts for formal dinners and balls. Burns Night is one such favoured occasion of the Scottish-when-it-suits-me cohort. And then therersquos the annual English middle-class pilgrimage to Edinburgh for the Fringe.Scotland deserves better than the disregard the English demonstrate the rest of the year.As much as our Westminster leaders profess their deep love of the Union, it feels much more like a love of the cultural prestige Scotland affords England and a fear of the symbolic blow to the UK that would come with independence.Better to look at what the UK Government does in relation to Scotland than continue to listen to the endless stream of verbal assurances insisting they care.I do believe the English and Scots have broadly the same values. The talk of Scottish progressiveness has probably been somewhat overdone in a country which in my letime had a private postal ballot on whether to continue banning discussion of gay peoplersquos existence from schools. But that is irrelevant. Where the Scottish and English erge is in voting behaviour. If the UK had not ed a Conservative government driven by English votes in , there never would have been a Brexit referendum that no one outside a rabid fringe was calling for. If the English had voted like the Scottish in that referendum, we would not still potentially be just days away from a catastrophic No-Deal Brexit that no one said was on the cards. But here we are.:MPs could hold Boris Johnson hostage over Brexit dateVoting patterns matter more than the values professed in polling. Voting choices have put us in the dire straits the UK is in today. And a voting choice can extract Scotland from this vicious cycle of disappointment with a UK seemingly hell-bent on damaging not just Scots but everyone  in Britain too.In recent weeks the possibility of border controls between Scotland and England has been raised in the event of independence. Our borders are best when theyrsquore invisible. There is a group which shares that view and has demonstrated its commitment to it through action. Itrsquos the European Union. If controls appear at the Border with an independent Scotland is in the EU, it will only be because the English have chosen not to sign up to the European norm, not because Scotland, like the vast majority of Europe, will have chosen to do so.As an Englishman due tosouth of that Border in February, I can only hope the rest of the UK would re-assess the situation in light of the new realities of a post-independence world and join Scotland and Ireland back in the EU. The choice will be for the rest of the UK to make.I am by no means wedded to the idea of independence. Through serious reform Canada redefined itself after Quebec voted by less than . per cent against splitting off in . Itrsquos an outcome the Queacutebeacutecois seem happy with, as independence is no longer under serious discussion. Are the British ruling class willing to radically overhaul the UK  They would sooner just grant independence than go to the trouble."},{"url":null,"title":"nicola-sturgeon-speak-scottish-independence-rally-glasgow","story":"The First Minister will address crowds at the#indyref: The Nationalrsquos Rally forIndependence whichtakes place in George Square on Saturday, November .It is the first time Nicola Sturgeon has addressed an independence rally since .Speaking to The National, the SNP leader said: ldquoIrsquom really looking forward to speaking at the #indyref rally in George Square next Saturday afternoon ndash and I hope people from all over the country will come together and makeScotlandrsquos voice heard.Speaking on the importance of the event in George Square, a location that has been at the heart of many independence movements, RichardWalker, who edits the Sunday National, said: ldquoWe want to bring the movement together and speak with one voice to send a message toWestminsterthat we donrsquot ask, we demand the opportunity to take control of our own future.:All Under One Banner march as it happened: Edinburgh confirmed as biggest march yet with over , participantsldquoWe hope that people will come from all over the country to join us in Glasgow.ldquoWe are putting together an impressive range of speakers, full details of which will be unveiled over the coming days.He added:ldquoThis is the first time The National has organised a public event.

These bus services are described as “commercial”.Local authorities such as Aberdeenshire Council have a duty to identy travel needs within their area which are not otherwise met, and secure what public transport is appropriate taking into account the funds available. These bus services are described as “supported”.In addition to funding fixed route bus services, the council supports community transport, for example dial-a-bus and voluntary car schemes operated by the voluntary sector, provides door-to-door dial-a-bus services and also provides a TaxiCard Scheme which offers a discount on taxi fares, usually £ per journey, for older and disabled residents.Chair of the council’s Infrastructure Services Committee, Councillor Peter Argyle, said: “It was agreed earlier this year that the network should be reassessed by means of a ‘clean-sheet’ approach, in order to identy a more sustainable network in the longer term that will more effectively cater for otherwise unmet travel needs, assist in addressing patronage decline and provide better value for money.“I would encourage all those who currently use bus services or may require them in the future to complete this quick survey which will provide vital information for our wider consultation.”Vice-chair Councillor John Cox added: “In addition to getting the views of residents, our survey is being issued to a wide range of organisations including community councils, rural partnerships, schools and social care facilities.“That feedback will assist us in developing cost-effective, fit-for-purpose services for Aberdeenshire communities in the years to come.”data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.fraserburghherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Here are  of the strangest UK parking laws to be aware of to ensure you avoid being fined by authorities\"   of the strangest UK parking laws viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"FRAS | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"FRAS | Article Teaser\"Further information on the council’s strategy and associated current policies for the support of passenger transport including local bus services, can be found in the Passenger Transport Strategy https:www.aberdeenshire.gov.uk media  passengertransportstrategy.pdfThe questionnaire will be available online from Monday, October  to Monday, December  at https:www.aberdeenshire.gov.uk roads-and-travel public-transport policies-strategies-and-contracts Printed copies being available in local libraries, Aberdeenshire Council offices, Ellon Park  Ride, and Peterhead Interchange, with effect from November ."},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"October ,  at : amRoad maintenance work is planned for Stromness, next week.

The new agreement has been criticised by commentators for undermining the links between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.Speaking in the house yesterday, Mr Carmichael asked: “The creation of a customs border down the Irish Sea and the necessary declarations as a consequence of that is something about which Ruth Davidson and the former Secretary of State for Scotland warned last year.#They said then, and it’s true now, that it will undermine the Union. Why is the Secretary of State disregarding his Rt Hon Friend’s advice ”Responding in the house, the secretary of state said: “This is a deal that protects the border, this was a key priority for me as Secretary of State. It protects the peace process. The economy of Northern Ireland, I think, will benefit from this deal . . . and I would work over the implementation period to minimise any problems for Northern Ireland businesses in exporting and selling into Great Britain.”Responding after the exchange, Mr Carmichael said: “The Secretary of State’s response was muddled and confused. It shows once again that the Conservative Party is now so fixated with Brexit that it is blind to the damage that they risk doing to the constitutional integrity of the United Kingdom. The lack of concern shown by the Government about this issue is deeply concerning.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Customers travelling from Kirkwall will now be able to fly to destinations such as Exeter, Norwich and Southampton with just one ticket.Loganair and Flybe routes to and from Aberdeen, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Inverness and Manchester – the five main airports where the airlines’ networks meet – are included. According to the companies, this means that customers making a single booking for a connecting journey between Flybe and Loganair flights will be  check-in bags right through to their final destination with the assurance that they will be re-booked to their destination free of chargeweather conditions or other delays lead to missed connections.The airlines have said that the new codeshare agreement also offers a signicant saving for customers as they no longer have to pay the multiple Air Passenger Duty charges they faced previously when buying separate tickets from Loganair and Flybe to build their own connecting itinerary.Alan Tune, Flybe’s director of sales, alliances and strategic partnerships, said: “We are pleased to add Loganair to our ever-increasing list of codeshare partners, offering customers even more flight connection opportunities by linking our route networks.#The new codeshare agreement with our Loganair partner offers unrivalled connectivity between most of the main cities, islands and regions of the UK, and onwards to several key European cities, too.”Jonathan Hinkles, Loganair’s Managing Director, added: “I’m incredibly pleased to be launching this new partnership with Flybe, which will bring tremendous benefits for customers through assured connections, reduced travel costs and convenient through check-in.#The new codeshare agreement will link all of the communities that we’re proud to serve as Scotland’s airline with major destinations throughout the UK and Europe, and I’m sure that this will be fantastic news for UK tourism, business and by making it easier to visit friends and family.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

This scheme will include looking at prehistoric seafaring and what the Isles were like thousands of years ago, what travel would have been like between the isles with very dferent sea levels. Shipwrecks will also be considered — uncovering more information about wrecks around the isles, looking at any that might still be unrecorded and sharing anecdotes and stories passed down through families and between friends. One aspect of the project will look at maritime cultural landscapes and how sea links and industries have shaped the character of each isle. Maritime art will also be explored in more detail in each island including the possibility of creating an art exhibition or trail that is inspired by the maritime nature of the isles.   Andy Golightly, programme manager for the North Isles Landscape Partnership said: “If people get involved in this project as well as the opportunity to find out more about maritime history and perhaps add to the existing research there will be the chance to learn new and interesting skills including surveying, mapping and even expanding their creative and artistic abilities too”     Natalia Bain from Wessex Archaeology added: “We have arranged a series of information events across isles so people can find out more about the project, the opportunities for involvement and what they would like to research.” Information sessions about the project will be held throughout next week. This includes events at Sanday Community School on Monday, October  Westray Junior High on Tuesday, October  St Ann#s Community Room in Papa Westray on Wednesday, October  Eday Heritage Centre on Thursday, October  North Ronaldsay Community Centre on Friday, November  and at the Boathouse in Shapinsay on Saturday, November .Dates in Stronsay and Rousay, Eglisay and Wyre are to be confirmed.For further information, you can contact the North Isles Landscape Partnership Scheme via its Facebook Page.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

This further three month delay is the last thing communities in Orkney and Shetland needed, given the ongoing uncertainty it creates.“It seems that every time Ministers make an announcement the deadline for the new contract gets pushed back. This latest delay is blamed on concerns raised by the European Commission. Given the regular dialogue between the Scottish Government and the Commission over the past year, it beggars belief that Ministers should have been caught out in this way.“Meanwhile, businesses and communities in Orkney and Shetland are left wondering when they will ever get clarity over the future of these leline ferry services.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Orkney currently outranks every other Scottish partnership in eight out of nine of these indicators.Sally Shaw, chief officer for Orkney Health and Care, said: #In undertaking the activities set out in this plan and the developing Strategic Commissioning Implementation Plan, we are determined to use all available community assets and also to ensure our third sector colleagues become equal partners.  Equal does not just mean sitting at the same table, it means having an equal say in how, what and when we commission, amongst other things.#We also seek to ensure that we break down hierarchy and other barriers that hinder our staff in their day to day work. We want to develop imagination, innovation and a culture where staff feel engaged, enabled and are part of a learning organisation.  We see this as essential for driving forward what will be a ‘health and social care revolution’ here in Orkney.#The plan is available on Orkney Islands Council’s website # https:www.orkney.gov.uk Service-Directory S ohac-strategic-commissioning-plan.htmcopy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

That is a vital part of our parliamentary democracy. The desperate-for-some-name-recognition, game-playing Tory MSP, Jamie Halcro Johnson, knows this fine well.As far as I can see, Brexit is nothing more than to distance ourselves from the EU, and to have a trade dealwith the USA. This will, in turn, justy the privatisation of most government responsibilties and duties of care going to US companies where the Tories will benefit as shareholders of such companies. It does not make economic sense to withdraw our markets in the EU, for the sake of other markets within the USA. It is not only this, but the tax payer will foot the bill for negotiating trade with the USA, where, as mentioned, it will be under the USA#s control, terms and conditions. The tax payer will also foot the bill for any trade deal arrangement where the USA will benefit immensely with a # forced to take it or leave it # scenario for the UK citizen. Meanwhile, the Tories will be rubbing their hands with glee at the prospect of making a kill economically, whilst the rest of us suffer under the austerity of an USA based economy where profit and greed are the priorities regardless to any suffering this may cause.As the  Electoral Areas of Scotland voted REMAIN I#m content for Alistair to follow the instructions of his Electorate and vote AGAINST BREXIT, unlike the  Tory MP#s who will be voting against the wishes of their electorate.Get real Mt Johnson.Those  tory MPs were elected after both referendums went against you and were voted in on the ticket of getting Brexit done.So they did Charles. The majority also voted to stay in the UK. Now get over it, sometimes a referendum may not go your way. It is a democracy thing!Interesting times. Boris Johnson seemed almost happy to have sabotaged his deal with the the unrealistic timescales he set. The election will be interesting when it comes. Judging by my murky paddlings in the comments section of ious newspapers, there#s a push to identy Corbyn as the biggest threat. Realistically, however, I think that Johnson has the unenviable task of uniting Brexit Party supporters, hard-brexit ERG supporters and moderate Conservatives who do not entirely trust him. This could just as easily lead to a broadly pro-left, pro-remain parliament as one that has a majority for a hard brexit.I would preferMP#s would listen to their electorate, after all, we put them in the position to vote the way we say, we need people in those positions to do our bidding, not theirs!I#m not content for Alistair Carmichael to speak for me. . million people voted to leave and my family were part of that number.I#m all for a referendum, but to stay with the EU is out of the question.

The proposal was supported by the two SNP councillors in the Barra and South Uist Ward and the five SNP councillors from Lewis and Harris.”In his statement, Councillor MacMillan also accused Labour Highlands and Islands MSP Rhoda Grant of calling for a government inquiry into the issue as a means of “taking the focus” off of comhairle convenor Councillor Norman A MacDonald # whom he described as a “Labour party colleague” to Rhoda Grant # and who has voted, according to Councillor MacMillan, to back the Uist dental plan.Councillor MacMillan added: “Rhoda Grant#s proposal for an inquiry is a politically motivated ersionary tactic designed to prevent the truth about Labour Party councillors voting to close the medical provision at Uist Hospital.“Rhoda Grant should instead call for the Western Isles NHS to start telling the truth, to publish the voting record of the [Integration Joint Board]meeting and explain the real reason for centralising the dental provision into the Uist Hospital which is to close the Operating Theatre and Resuscitation Room to remove the surgical capacity from the hospital.”Responding to the claims, Norman A MacDonald stated that he wasn#t present at the last IJB meeting, and said that “assurances had been given” that the relocation of the dental service in Uist would have “no detrimental impact on the Uist and Barra hospital whatsoever.The convenor added: “After the original vote at the IJB on this matter resulted in a split vote, from then on it was up to the chief executives to decide what would take place.“I have no idea what kind of influence Councillor MacMillan might think I have, as both Uist and Barra hospital and the Western Isles Hospital hospital are solely the responsibility of the health board and it is not for councillors to make any decisions on their future.“I have never discussed in any shape or form either the dental service in Uist or her call for an inquiry with Rhoda Grant.“As to the colour of my politics, Councillor MacMillan#s claims are equally questionable. I have registered for the last fteen years as an independent councillor.”Mrs Grant said: “Councillor MacMillan#s assertion would be laughable were it not such a serious issue in question.“I have, from the outset in , listened to the concerns being raised by constituents, by the Uist Locality Planning Group, by the Association of Community Councils, by a stakeholder event held in Lochboisdale, and by all local elected members serving when this proposal to centralise dental services was first aired.“I have repeatedly made representation to the IJB, to NHS Western Isles, to the comhairle, to the previous Health Secretary, and to the First Minister.“Health boards and local authorities throughout Scotland are having to make incredibly dficult decisions to fit with the reducing budgets they are being given and perhaps Councillor MacMillan, instead of throwing meaningless insults around, would do better focusing on bringing this to the attention of his colleagues in the Scottish Government, opposing jobs and services being taken out of local communities.“This is an appalling decision, which flies in the face of local democracy, and constituents in Uist deserve to have their concerns heard, and heeded.”Officially, it was something called the Integration Joint Board that made the announcement at the end of last month: all roads will soon lead to Balivanich. But the IJB began le as a creature of the big boys it is staffed by officials from both public agencies. Is its independence nominal  It#s hard to be sure.Whatever the limits of its power, it is a useful fig leaf to hide behind. The barrage of flak directed at this rotten decision to centralise a vital health service can be dodged by the likes of NHS Western Isles chief executive Gordon Jamieson. The plan to close three dental surgeries came from the IJB. At least that#s how it was sold to the public.Before too long, everyone in the Uists will have to go to hospital in Balivanichthey need a filling or a tooth extracted. So much for the “professional concerns” comhairle chief executive Malcolm Burr has supposedly spent that last six months mulling over. At the end of September, he fell into line. Unanimity was required in order to proceed, and he delivered it.One particular paragraph from the IJB decision paper is worth quoting in full: “Given his familiarity with the subject matter, the chief executive of NHS Western Isles was able to come to an early view about the best arrangements for the provision of dental services in Uist but the chief executive of the comhairle, having no previous experience of these services, required more time to familiarise himself with the detail.”This admission is revealing. Completely out of his depth, it took Mr Burr six months to swot up on the intricacies of closing three dental surgeries before wielding the axe. In doing so, he perhaps exposed the limits of integrating health and social care, which is the IJB#s raison d#etre. Put simply, it should not be the responsibility of someone with no background in health care to make a decision like this. The IJB say there will be an “outreach” service aimed primarily at South Uist and Eriskay, the latter  miles away from Balivanich along single-track roads. What this pledge means, in dental terms, is still to be decided. Perhaps teeth can be extracted safely in the back of a van.If the fruits of integration — a much-hyped national paradigm — are vandalism on this scale, then we suggest a rethink is in order. The hybrid organisations driving the agenda don#t seem to be accountable to anyone, least of all the voters.Speaking of which, we are glad to see that Western Isles MSP Alasdair Allan has had a quiet word with Public Health Minister Joe Fitzpatrick about referring the matter to the Scottish Government. Ultimately, it is Health Secretary Jeane Freeman who has the power to stop this. Hopefully, she#ll use it before Stornoway wrecks a system that has worked well for decades."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/MOD-GLW-19-GOLD-MEDAL-1.jpg","title":"both of this years gold medals are won by glasgow","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineAfter  years living in the city, Claire and family were due to move back to her native Ness in Lewis on Monday.The -year-old teacher had previously won the Traditional Gold when the mòd was in Stornoway in .

Ms O’Neill said the poll could take place within five years.Asked how he feels about the current Brexit impasse, Mr Varadkar said Britain leaving the EU is only stage one of the process, and compared the proceedings to a orce.“There is the sense that we will get a deal. They will raty it and they will leave the European Union, but then the next thing starts, which is negotiating a new relationship,” he said.“What we’re doing at the moment is a kind of orce. Members are deciding, making sure that the kids are looked after, deciding the financial settlement that type of thing.“The next step then is, how do we get on with each other after orce because we’re still going to need to have a friendship of some sort.“So, it just moves on to the next phase, but the most important thing in the first phase was just to protect those really important things like making sure that wasn’t the border between North and South and people’s rights are protected and that people can still travel freely between Britain and Ireland.”Here in Cheshire in the UK with PM @BorisJohnson to talk #Brexit.

It was rejected by Dublin.The proposal is outlined in a new book, Inside Accounts, by University of Portsmouth academic Dr Graham Spencer. In an interview with the author, Mr Lillis describes the border plan as \"a sort of crazy British proposal, although not a random one\" as it was Cabinet-approved.The proposal was rejected by Dublin because while the Garda and Irish Army were universally popular with their public, the same was not true of the security forces in Northern Ireland.\"For virtually one half of the population, the army is regarded as an occupying force, while for the other half its regarded as our army and, while the RUC was seen as our police force for unionists, for nationalists it was an oppressive, foreign police force,\" Mr Lillis said.\"Because of that, the idea of having those people on our side of the border, when they were regarded as oppressors of nationalists in the north, was unthinkable. \"Even so, Armstrong and Goodall came over to the taoiseachs department and they made this proposal in writing. \"It wasnt just Mrs Thatcher and it wasnt just the foreign secretary it was a Cabinet-approved proposal, as well.\"Mr Lillis said he thought the proposal was \"remarkable\" because the Republic would \"have our folks on the other side of the border, working in nationalist areas inside the north ... although we had no interest in having the RUC in Co Monaghan, we had nevertheless broken a mould\".He added: \"If you consider the Cabinet saying to these foreigners, Come in to our territory and help us to solve this chaotic situation, well that was a big deal.

The delay is due to issues relating to routine testing of the Fluenz Tetra nasal flu vaccine by the manufacturer and is not related to the safety or the efficacy of the vaccine. Work is under way to minimise potential disruption to the childhood flu immunisation programme in the Northcaused by this. In line with the rest of the UK the Chief Medical Officer has requested GP’s prioritise children with underlying health conditions and pre-schoolers over the age of two. googletag.cmd.push Dr Gerry Waldron, Assistant Director of Public Healthat the PHA, said: “We have been exploring how to best use the available stock based on evidence and clinical advice, and taking into account projections on the revised delivery schedule to maximise protection in the community. “Practices will continue to offer the vaccine to pre-schoolers and children in at risk groups as normal. The school vaccination programme is currently continuing as normal. Pupils at special schools have already received their vaccine. “However, the disruption to supply may lead to vaccinations in some primary schools being rescheduled, but all eligible children will have an opportunity to receive their vaccine. “Whilst this situation is unfortunate, it is completely outside our control and we would continue to urge eligible people to get vaccinated, as we know this is the best way to protect against the flu.

The delay is due to issues relating to routine testing of the Fluenz Tetra nasal flu vaccine by the manufacturer and is not related to the safety or the efficacy of the vaccine. Work is under way to minimise potential disruption to the childhood flu immunisation programme in the Northcaused by this. In line with the rest of the UK the Chief Medical Officer has requested GP’s prioritise children with underlying health conditions and pre-schoolers over the age of two. googletag.cmd.push Dr Gerry Waldron, Assistant Director of Public Healthat the PHA, said: “We have been exploring how to best use the available stock based on evidence and clinical advice, and taking into account projections on the revised delivery schedule to maximise protection in the community. “Practices will continue to offer the vaccine to pre-schoolers and children in at risk groups as normal. The school vaccination programme is currently continuing as normal. Pupils at special schools have already received their vaccine. “However, the disruption to supply may lead to vaccinations in some primary schools being rescheduled, but all eligible children will have an opportunity to receive their vaccine. “Whilst this situation is unfortunate, it is completely outside our control and we would continue to urge eligible people to get vaccinated, as we know this is the best way to protect against the flu. Parents of at-risk children and pre-schoolers should make themselves aware of their own GP surgery’s flu vaccination arrangements.” This issue does not impact on the adult flu vaccination programme, and we encourage all adults who are eligible to receive the flu vaccine to get it.

These sides are no strangers to each other and it is a game that features two of the outstanding underage teams in the country over the past few years having clashed with each other in the last two All Ireland Feile finals, Burren winning the  Feile and Magherafelt gaining revenge in the final of the  Feile. Both teams are no strangers to the Paul McGirr tournament either with Burren’s latest visit being last year where they were defeated narrowly in the semi final by Lavey, they have fonder memories of the tournament however from  when they won it with a team from which many of the players have already progressed onto their senior team which won last year’s Down title. googletag.cmd.push This season Burren’s success has continued having blitzed their way through the Down league and championship culminating in a - to - victory over Bredagh in the championship final. With  of their starting team from last year’s Paul McGirr campaign there is no doubt that Burren are the team to beat this year. James Kelly, Patrick McCarthy and Ryan Magill backbone a talented defence, Odhran Murdock and Conlin Bradley will be looking to dominate proceedings in midfield while up front James Duggan, Zach Murdock and Eoin Loughran are all noted score getters. However their talisman Niall Toner is the man the Derry champions will really have to look out for, his displays in the tournament last year were breathtaking to say the least and there is no doubt he will have a major bearing on the contest. Lead coach Neil Coulter feels his preparations have been hindered somewhat but is looking forward to the occasion ‘Burren are delighted to be once again representing Down in this year’s Paul McGirr Ulster Tournament, preparations have been tough going as  of our players were involved with the minor’s in last Sunday’s championship final replay so getting them together this past few weeks hasn’t been easy, however we are really looking forward to Saturday’s game against Magherafelt, it is a repeat of the Feile finals and will be a really tough battle.’ Magherafelt are a club that’s riding on a crest of a wave at the minute with this week being one of the most memorable in the south Derry club’s history, adding the Derry U title to their historic senior victory last weekend. Wednesday evenings - to - victory over a fancied Lavey in wet and windy conditions was met with great euphoria and Enda Qunn’s men will be looking to take that momentum into Saturday’s fixture. They won’t have had much time to recover but they are a side laced with quality, Luke McCann and Eoin McEvoy the fulcrum of a solid defence with McCann likely being given the unenviable task of keeping tabs on Toner. Cormac Bateson and Dan Higgins form a very solid midfield partnership and up front they have their own talisman in Daragh Wade who was part of last season’s Derry minor . This game has the potential to be one of the best in the long history of the Paul McGirr tournament and no doubt both clubs will bring a huge support with them for the fixture. It is an intriguing match up with both sides being used to success and being very familiar with each other. Magherafelt will definitely not be ring rusty but may feel the effects of their draining battle with Lavey on Wednesday night. The hurt of having lost out to Lavey in last years semi final should give Burren that bit of an extra incentive and this could well tip the scales in their favour, either way whoever emerges from the tie will be favourites to annex the  Paul McGirr title.

They won’t have had much time to recover but they are a side laced with quality, Luke McCann and Eoin McEvoy the fulcrum of a solid defence with McCann likely being given the unenviable task of keeping tabs on Toner. Cormac Bateson and Dan Higgins form a very solid midfield partnership and up front they have their own talisman in Daragh Wade who was part of last season’s Derry minor . This game has the potential to be one of the best in the long history of the Paul McGirr tournament and no doubt both clubs will bring a huge support with them for the fixture. It is an intriguing match up with both sides being used to success and being very familiar with each other. Magherafelt will definitely not be ring rusty but may feel the effects of their draining battle with Lavey on Wednesday night. The hurt of having lost out to Lavey in last years semi final should give Burren that bit of an extra incentive and this could well tip the scales in their favour, either way whoever emerges from the tie will be favourites to annex the  Paul McGirr title.

When I was doing my GCSE’s and AS’s, nothing was too much bother for them. “The whole school community in St Brigid’s is very friendly and welcoming,” said Caacuteit with a smile.According to Gerry the whole family was “really proud” of Caacuteit’s achievement.He said: “Caacuteit’s mammy and I and her brothers, Miacuteċeaacutel Piaras and Ultaacuten Rua, were really proud when we heard Caacuteit had been made Head Girl of St Brigid’s. googletag.cmd.push “It is a fantastic school, with brilliant staff and pupils, where she is thriving. Also, because St Brigid’s offers Irish medium education and has promoted Gaeilge under the current principal, Mr Oacute Mianaacutein, and his predecessor, Dr OacuteCuinneagaacutein, Caacuteit, who is bilingual, was encouraged to use her Irish from day one.“The whole family was pleased. We had a long association with the school, so it meant a lot. Caacuteits uncles, Miacuteċeaacutel, John and Michael and her aunt, Clare, are all St Brigid’s past pupils.”Reflecting on his time at St Brigids College, Gerry said: “The recent sad passing of Mr Brian Rainey, who was vice-principal throughout my seven years at the school, gave me great pause for thought.“In September , I left St Brigids for Queens University, Belfast, thanks to many fine people in that school community and their incredible teaching, encouragement and belief in me. I was not alone, however, further and higher education was a path lots more St Brigid’s students were to take in the years that followed and continue to do so to this day, which is good to see.“I will always be thankful to the wonderful people in St Brigid’s who enabled me to get to where I am today, especially Marianna Doherty, George Chambers and Charlie Doherty, who taught me A’ Level Physics and Maths. Not forgetting the famous ‘Bun Brigade’, Jim Zammit and John Christie.“That is not to mention, Catherine Boyle, Mairead McShane, Ms Coyle and Ms BradleyOwen McColganDan O’Reilly, Liam Gallagher and Tony Carlin, for the shows, especially ‘Dracula Spectacular’ Adrian Brothers and Kevin RaffertyBrendan Burns, Mr McNally, Dave Simpson and Ms HayeWillie BradleyDeirdre DohertyMs FryEd Henryand Piaras Mellon . Last but not least, Harry Sharkey and Mickey McGrath,” said Gerry.“Apologies to anyone I might not have remembered, you were all a great bunch, whose invaluable encouragement and advice, given to me from my first year to my last, allowed me the space to develop into the person I am today,” said a thoughtful Gerry.

The midfielder believes there are no excuses for the manner of Tuesday’s defeat to St. Patrick’s Athletic, which has all but ended the Candystripes’ hopes of finishing third and has put them under added pressure to get the one point they need against their Northwest rivals. City are still expected to get the job done against Harps but Tuesday’s defeat served as a timly warning that nothing is yet certain. googletag.cmd.push “It’s kind of hard to put your finger on it,” he said. “I’m surprised with ourselves given what was at stake that we didn’t kick on. It’s a disappointing night there’s no two ways about it and we’re disappointed with the result and we need to put that right on Friday night. “There are factors out of our control like we had a fixture on Saturday with a heavy pitch in Sligo but it’s not an excuse. We needed to bring more to the game and we didn’t and we’ve come out on the wrong side.” It all looked to be going City’s way when David Parkhouse gave them the lead in the early stages of the second half, but a quick equaliser from Chris Forrester plus two goals in three minutes from substitute James Doona meant that St. Pat’s gave themselves one more fighting chance of stealing fourth place from Derry City. “We expected to kick on and win the game from there but they score and get a bit of a momentum sht and the ball has fallen their way of the second goal and we are chasing the game,” Sloggett reflected. “No matter what stage of the season you’re at, when you lose a game you want the next game to come as quickly as possible and we’re lucky in that sense. We’ll freshen up and we’ll be ready to go and we’ll put another three points on the board hopefully.” Tuesday’s game was City’s second in four days after a break of , an inconsistency in the scheduling that has happened more than once this season. Again, however, Sloggett dismissed that as an excuse. “This is what the league decides,” he continued. “The international fixtures came at a strange time and this is the way that the games fell. We needed to deal with that but we’re disappointed with that. “We’ll have to go back and look at it and see where we went wrong and where we can make things better. They were good on the night and played with a lot of energy and we failed to match that. We can’t make excuses and we have to go and fix things.” After the celebrations at Sligo on Saturday past, it was widely expected that City would get the point they needed on Tuesday night to secure Europa League football at the Brandywell next season. The fact that they didn’t surprised many, but Sloggett dismissed suggestions of complacency. “I don’t think so,” he said. “I think we came with the intention to win the game because we were targeting that third spot. It’s out of our hands now but it’s still a possibility. I don’t think we came complacent. “We’re obviously very disappointed with our performance and not to have kicked on and won the game when we went - up but we have to put that right. “I think at the start of the season you would have taken a win in your last game to qualy for Europe and hopefully we can go and do that.”  Recognition Meanwhile, City striker David Parkhouse has been named in the PFAI Team of the Year and has also been nominated for the Young Player of the Year award.

The Harps youngsters were flag bearers for the game between Stoke City and Fulham on Saturday.  The Harps players were really looking forward to getting down to action however and their first game of an enjoyable weekend came against Hypton Madrid, which turned out to be a real thriller which produced eleven goals.

After they were put through their paces by some of the finest coaches in the country, Harps travelled to the Britannia Stadium to watch James McClean’s Stoke City take on Fulham. Before the game the kids acted as flag bearers on pitch side and while it has been a dficult season for Stoke, the Derry team proved to be a good luck omen as they won three vital points with a - victory.

The surprising loss to St. Pat’s has added just a touch more pressure ahead of tomorrow night’s game against Finn Harps, with a point still required to qualy for European football. Devine admitted that the better team won on Tuesday. Even when we went - up I didnt feel confident,” he admitted. “I thought we were very open and let them have too much of the ball. On another night they probably couldve hurt us more. But we gave away poor goals, really bad goals and we didnt take the half chances we created but overall St Pats deserved to win the game. googletag.cmd.push Fortunately enough weve done a lot of good work early on this season and were still in the driving seat going forward. Weve been poor, he admitted. Its the first time I can actually stand here and say we werent at the races for one reason or the other. Collectively, as a team, we werent good enough. St Pats deserved to win the game. They were better than us in every area so thats something we have to reflect on. It just wasnt like us.” St. Patrick’s Athletic must defeat Dundalk at Oriel Park and hope that City slip up against Finn Harpsthey are to have any chance of stealing fourth place. The odds are still very much in City’s favour but Devine is taking nothing for granted. Weve got to lose here on Friday night and St Pats have to win at the champions on TV so theres a lot of dferent things that can get us across the line,” he acknowledged. Id still rather be in the position were in as opposed to the position St Pats are in but fair play to them they deserved their win. Im still confident and have a high level of belief in the players in the dressing room but we made it dficult and made it drag out a bit more. Weve now got to make sure we have a better application come Friday night. ChallengingTomorrow’s game will be the nd of Derry City’s season and at the end of a long and challenging season, there is just one more task to complete. Tiredness could well have played a part in Tuesday’s defeat, Devine admitted. “Maybe it was the extra days rest, Id have to watch it again but it certainly wasnt like the way weve performed all year,” he said. “It was very unlike us. We didnt have too many players who were better than average. We had a couple of decent performances but thats not enough when youre playing your biggest competitors for a European place. They came with a better appetite which is worrying for me but I have to back these bunch of players because over the course of the year theyve been magnicent and Im still confident well get across the line.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The surprising loss to St. Pat’s has added just a touch more pressure ahead of tomorrow night’s game against Finn Harps, with a point still required to qualy for European football. Devine admitted that the better team won on Tuesday. Even when we went - up I didnt feel confident,” he admitted. “I thought we were very open and let them have too much of the ball. On another night they probably couldve hurt us more. But we gave away poor goals, really bad goals and we didnt take the half chances we created but overall St Pats deserved to win the game. googletag.cmd.push Fortunately enough weve done a lot of good work early on this season and were still in the driving seat going forward. Weve been poor, he admitted. Its the first time I can actually stand here and say we werent at the races for one reason or the other. Collectively, as a team, we werent good enough. St Pats deserved to win the game. They were better than us in every area so thats something we have to reflect on. It just wasnt like us.” St. Patrick’s Athletic must defeat Dundalk at Oriel Park and hope that City slip up against Finn Harpsthey are to have any chance of stealing fourth place. The odds are still very much in City’s favour but Devine is taking nothing for granted. Weve got to lose here on Friday night and St Pats have to win at the champions on TV so theres a lot of dferent things that can get us across the line,” he acknowledged. Id still rather be in the position were in as opposed to the position St Pats are in but fair play to them they deserved their win. Im still confident and have a high level of belief in the players in the dressing room but we made it dficult and made it drag out a bit more. Weve now got to make sure we have a better application come Friday night. ChallengingTomorrow’s game will be the nd of Derry City’s season and at the end of a long and challenging season, there is just one more task to complete. Tiredness could well have played a part in Tuesday’s defeat, Devine admitted. “Maybe it was the extra days rest, Id have to watch it again but it certainly wasnt like the way weve performed all year,” he said. “It was very unlike us. We didnt have too many players who were better than average. We had a couple of decent performances but thats not enough when youre playing your biggest competitors for a European place. They came with a better appetite which is worrying for me but I have to back these bunch of players because over the course of the year theyve been magnicent and Im still confident well get across the line.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

She insists that she intends to deliver the authentic voice of moderate, progressive Irish nationalism in a place where it needs to be heard.And she has vowed to be a hard working Peer, lobbying and building alliances with other peers and parties across the chamber that will bring benefit to people in Northern Ireland.And while the former MP regrets no longer being a member of the SDLP, she said her political views have not altered and will reflect the partyrsquos central social democratic messages focused on the needs of people and the principles of equality, fairness and social justice for all in the House of Lords.With her new title now confirmed, Baroness Ritchie described Downpatrick as a ldquohistoric place on the island of Ireland, where St Patrick began and ended his ministry.ldquoThe town is a place of immense heritage and has a longstanding history. It is uniquely associated on the island with the patron saint and is also associated with the Normans and the Vikings, she continued.ldquoDownpatrick is also place of inclusion and a shared society. The area was one of the first to share power at local government level and in the days of the old Urban Council, it had responsibility for allocating housing and did so very much on the basis of need.The Baroness said the Downpatrick area was very much at the vanguard of political inclusion in terms of ensuring that people belonged, explaining that she plans to use her new title to promote the town.Her House of Lords induction takes place on November  with her formal introduction taking place the following day when she will be introduced by her two sponsors on the floor of the chamber.Baroness Ritchiersquos sponsors will be former Northern Ireland Secretary of State, Lord Paul Murphy and Baroness Angela Smith, who is the shadow leader of the Lords.She is also former NIO minister who was responsible for the the health, economy and environment portfolios during her time at Stormont.Lord Murphy was also Minister of State and led the British Government in the talks process that led to the Good Friday Agreement.Baroness Ritchie continued: ldquoI have picked my two sponsors on the basis that while I am going into the House of Lords as non-aligned and independent, my two sponsors understand the mechanics of the Good Friday Agreement and understand inclusion and power-sharing.ldquoMy maiden speech will hopefully take place sometime before the end of the year, although that could be subject to changea general election is called.Looking to the future, the Baroness said she has been using the past few weeks to get briefed on key issues which are important to her, including Brexit and its impact on the agri-food economy and local economy.ldquoTo me, there is no such thing as a good Brexit. The best deal for me is one where we will remain in the EU. What we have been presented with is one that is a bita curatersquos egg in many ways. There will ne no hard border which means no economic border and no veto in terms of the Assembly. Having said that, I am going to have to examine the Brexit deal in greater depth, she continued.ldquoThere are other issues that I want to focus on including the contaminated bloods issue, tourism VAT and what can be done to help our economy and ensure that we can grow and develop. The vaginal mess issue is something I have been associated with as is the importance of the Co Down fishing industry.Baroness Ritchie said while she does not have constituents, she will be speaking in a general Northern Ireland-wide context.ldquoI will be highlighting the importance of reflecting our political ersity and respect for political dference, ensuring that our institutions are up and running and that they respect the relationships between Ireland and Britain and Northern Ireland and the South.

The three of them were regularly checking the weather in the last few weeks leading up to race day as the temperatures were well up in the high s.Far too hot to be running a marathon, but thankfully in the final week it took a dramaticdown to nine degrees. Flying over on Friday with no time to waste, it was straight to the hotel and then immediately to the Expo to pick up their race numbers and buy some of the many race souvenirs that were on sale.In the Expo there was a wall of fame for all the runners who had completed the six majors. Murlough ACrsquos very own Paula McKibbin and Ann McAlarneyrsquos names were spotted on the wall for all to see.There was no time to get over the six-hours jet lag as they were all up at five in the morning and headed downtown to the start of the km friendship run.This was a bit of fun and involved a quick lap of the city centre finishing in Grant park. The rest of the day was spent in true MAC style with a boat cruise along the Chicago river before dinner in an Italian restaurant.The evening got better as needing a taxi for six people to take them back to the hotel, they managed to acquire the use of a party limousine at a very good rate.Another early start on Sunday as the marathon began at .am in the neighbouring Grant Park. Thankfully, it was only a  minute walk from the hotel. Theyrsquod only just made it into the corrals and the race started.A field of , runners, heading off north through the city, with defending champion Mo Farah expected to retain his title.As the route wound through the city it passed through many dferent districts, all with a party atmosphere and lined with people cheering and screaming encouragement.The noise during a major marathon in the USA is beyond belief, the bands playing, spectators lsquohigh fivingrsquo and the streets lined with people three or four thick is an experience like no other. We passed through the Mexican Quarter with bands playing and guys dancing, wearing sombreros and then on to Chinatownrsquo with the streets lined with drummers.It was then onto the Gay Quarter with drag queens performing on stage. It was a celebration for both runners and spectators.As with all marathons, the last five miles were a real test of mental determination as fatigue kicked in and Carol, unfortunately, was suffering from a knee injury that she picked up during training which ed at mile .They all pushed on with Hugh crossing the line first and recording a new personal best by one and a half minutes. Orla was next home followed by Charisse who recorded a huge personal best of  minutes.Carol was next home and managed to finish in a respectable time as she battled through the final  miles with knee problems. As the runners walked down the street after finishing they were greeted by four lines of local school kids applauding and congratulating all the runners. After the kids there were long tables either side of the street where one of the local sponsors, which happened to be a brewery, handing out free beer. Then onto the next table where they were given food and water.It makes you wonder what is not to like about this marathon  In the ladiesrsquo race a new world record was set as Brigid Kosgei beat Paula Radclfersquos record of  years. Ironically, as Carol finished her race and walked down to collect her medal she was presented with it from no other than Paula herself.It was back to the hotel to get ready for dinner that evening. As Hugh and Charisse walked back they talked about getting a pint of milk each for recovery.As the shop was a ten-minute walk away, Charisse said that even though she knew it would be a bit more expensive she was happy to buy milk for them both in the hotel bar.Being content with the two half pints that the bar served it was only when the bill was produced that they both discovered that they must have drunk the most expensive two glasses of milk ever, with a bill of  dollars. Anything to save tired feet.That evening they continued in MAC style, celebrating with a meal on Cindyrsquos roof top restaurant followed by a few beers in Buddy Guyrsquos Blues bar where we were treated in style with a table in the VIP area. The le of a Murlough AC member is indeed a good one and already planning has begun for the next Major.Meanwhile, the week before, Kieran McShane made the long trek to Australia to complete in the Melbourne Marathon.The race began with an early am start along Batman Avenue in the glorious sunshine. This was Kieranrsquos first big run in over three months due to injuries, so took him a lot longer to finish, but he says it just meant he had more time to take in the lovely views of Melbourne.It was an amazing race from start to finish taking in all the iconic places around Melbourne such as St Paulrsquos Cathedral, Flinders Street, Botanic Gardens and the Shrine of Remembrance.Followed by a lap around the GP circuit then up and down St Kildarsquos beach along the promenade. The finish line was held inside the Melbourne Cricket Ground where the runners had to complete a lap inside the stadium in front of the roaring crowd as they crossed the line in an amazing atmosphere..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/23rd October 2019 Relive.jpg","title":"Relive the glory days as Down swept all before them to lift Sam Maguire  ","story":"THE countdown is on for a night of nostalgia with the Down  All-Ireland legends when they descend on Loughinisland GAC this Saturday where they will look back at their historic journey which is part of sporting folklore.However, the night will be tinged with sadness after the sudden passing of the former Down and Bryansford star Eamonn Burns, , who won two All-Ireland titles in  and rsquo and managed the county for a three-year spell which ended when he stepped down last year.During that tenure he led his Down team to the  Ulster SFC final with wins over neighbours Armagh and Monaghan.The highlight of Eamonnrsquos career, undoubtedly, was his two points which helped edge out Meath in , including a point which put the Mourne side into a lead they would not relinquish, finishing with a - to - victory.There will be a special tribute on the night to show Eamonnrsquos valuable contribution to Downrsquos glory years.The celebration is to mark the th anniversary of the sidersquos historic win over Dublin in Croke Park during a poignant year for those in the village and surrounding areas.A large contingent of the  Down squad will be in attendance, including captain DJ Kane, lsquoMayobridge Flyerrsquo Mickey Linden, James McCartan, Ross Carr, Downpatrick pair Conor Deegan and Barry Breen, Castlewellanrsquos Gregory McCartan and Ciaran McCabe, Bryansfordrsquos Brian Burns, Carryduff goalkeeper Neil Collins, and, of course, Loughinislandrsquos Gary Mason and Gerard Colgan, plus many more.Compere for the night will be TV and radio personality Frank Mitchell.

Letter to the editorAs Ben Lowry asserted in his column ‘Middle England chose Brexit over NI fully in UK,’ October , Boris Johnson’s loyalty is first and foremost to the Conservative party and its English electorate. It was always going to be the case and therein lies the harsh lesson for unionism to learn . It is imperative that unionists consolidate and ensure that maintaining the Union remains in our own hands. That is the battle line drawn for the next election when unionists bite the bullet andthe maximum number of MPs possible to hold firm for the unionist cause .We have been here before with shyster prime ministers and survived. This time we now know in advance where we all stand in terms of having our unionism undermined. What unionism requires are cool heads, sharp minds and positive leadership as never before . Solidarity tied into a unity of defence and purpose in upholding the integrity of the Union and reasserting our right to self determination is the number one unionist priority.David McNarry, Comber©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings  Terms and Conditions  Privacy policy    d.onerror  d.onload  d.src  [\"secure-uk.imrworldwide cgi-bin m ciuk-hcgccsi\", escape, \"rp\", escape, \"tscompactrnd\", .getTime].join"},{"url":null,"title":"people","story":" getRequiredClientIdforjpiconsole.log requiredClientIdcatch]EV.Core.updateUserProfile]EV.Core.updateUserProfile....... , , , , Would you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast News Letter via email \"Newsletters\"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia, publisher of Belfast News Letter, via occasional emails keeping you informed about new features, relevant offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"By clicking on register, you will be creating an account with Belfast News Letter and agreeing to JPIMedia Ltd#s Standard Terms and ConditionsWould you like to receive any of the following newsletters from Belfast News Letter, via email Daily news, news features and service updates\"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia, publisher of Belfast News Letter, via occasional emails keeping you informed about new features, relevant offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \" addCustomTextToCreateAccountTemplateNewslettersWould you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast News Letter via email \"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia, publisher of Belfast News Letter, via occasional emails keeping you informed about new features, relevant offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"  \". s .  \". ss+s+  \". s  \".after+text+ .+text+ .before+text+ .after+text+]]]]]]]]]]]]]] initInArticleOnlySiteText, initArticleSiteText, isInArticleOnlyTemplateReady. s isArticleTemplateReady. s addCustomTextToSiteTemplate addSiteName.html  People   Jobs Cars Homes  Directory  Announcements  Advertise My Business Subscribe#jp #login-widget #login-flip.flip RegisterLoginEdit Account\"Sign Out\" --\"    --       News People Traffic and Travel Crime Weather Politics Business Education Health Opinion Read This News Traffic and Travel Crime Weather Politics Business Education Health Opinion Read This Sport Football Rugby Union Motorcycling More Sport Sport Opinion Whats On Arts  Entertainment Things To Do Nightle Lestyle Retro Cars Homes Must Read           People      Larnersquos dementia-friendly choir going from strength to strengthA choir that was supposed to exist for just six week is proving an exemplar for Mid and East Antrim Council#s dementia-friendly community initiative.

We have a long waiting list.ldquoWe have to make sure these are properties we have finance for and they are up to our standards as well. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This compares to five per cent of the population in , when  per cent of adults smoked.However, there has also been an increase in the numbers of ex-smokers who now vape.:The National Survey for Wales shows that, in ,  per cent of e-cigarettes users also smoked cigarettes. This fell to  per cent in  .Across the UK the number of vapers who are ex-smokers reached . per cent in  with the main reason given for using e-cigarettes being to help them quit.Of those surveyed by ASH Wales,  per cent of e-cigarette users cited health as their main reason for vaping.Suzanne Cass, chief executive of ASH Wales said: ldquoThe rise in the numbers of ex-smokers who now vape in Wales shows that many smokers are using e-cigarettes to quit.ldquoIndeed, when coupled with behavioural support e-cigarettes have been shown to be one of the most effective ways to give up smoking, enabling thousands of smokers in Wales to break a habit that destroys lives.ldquoHowever, with more than double the amount of people in Wales smoking compared to vaping, we still face a major challenge when it comes to changing peoplersquos behaviour and de-normalising what has become an entrenched habit in many of our most deprived communities.Despite the increase in the number of people vaping, the survey also revealed perceptions of the relative harm of e-cigarettes compared to tobacco cigarettes have worsened.Now almost a third of people in Wales believe e-cigarettes are equally or more harmful than tobacco cigarettes.Suzanne Cass said: ldquoThere is work to be done when it comes to raising awareness of the relative harm of e-cigarettes compared to tobacco cigarettes and addressing concerns about the safety of vaping.Since the survey was carried out, reports of a possible link between e-cigarette use and deaths from lung disease in America have led some medical experts to warn of the dangers of vaping.According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention many of those vapers affected had used products with liquids containing cannabinoid products.E-cigarettes are regulated in the UK in line with a set of European-wide rules by the medicines regulator, the MHRA. The MHRA also monitors adverse reactions through its yellow card system, which to date has not identied serious respiratory problems similar to that found in the US.Meanwhile vapers in the UK are urged by ASH to only ever purchase e-cigarettes from reputable suppliers. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We were a mix of young people, parents and other concerned citizens of Penarth, and met outside Grfin Books.ldquoWe joined the young people who have been striking from school. In a year this movement has grown from Greta Thunberg by herself to millions worldwide.ldquoThe evidence on climate change is clear. Our actions through burning fossil fuels and demands for continued economic growth cause global warming and climate change. People are already suffering and nature, upon which we all depend, is collapsing. Governments need to be honest about this and act upon the crisis.ldquoWe were over the moon with the response from Penarth residents, who walked with us or cheered us on, the day really gave us hope that the message is seeping in and change can happen. Myself and others had been feeling quite down because climate change is scary, we are worried about our childrenrsquos futures. Lets hope this walk leads to more local action on climate change.The young people on the march also spoke about their concerns.ldquoI went on strike because people cut down rainforests just to be able to eat meat, said seven-year-old Mylo Kitchiner. ldquoIf we keep cutting down trees we wonrsquot have oxygen to breath.

Any proposals would be subject to full consultation, meaning all interested parties would have an opportunity to share their views before any decision is made.ldquoShould proposals progress, they would also be subject to separate planning consultation.ldquoThis would include consideration of highways and traffic concerns. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We have had nine spaces taken away, which means  cars will be battling for spaces.ldquoWe understand the need to reduce cars and danger in the area but the way itrsquos been done will lead to reductions in house prices and make parking dficult for current residents.

A former head of two other schools in Gwent, he is clearly proud of his school and all they have accomplished.ldquoItrsquos a wonderful school and everyone here has worked so hard to make it that way, he said. ldquoBut it does face challenges.Like other head teachers in Penarth, Mr Rees had signed the open letter to the Welsh Government calling for fairer funding for Vale schools earlier this year. He had discussed coming in to the school on weekends to clean the toilets himself to help balance budgets. But he is firmly optimistic.ldquoBetween kind donations and fundraising efforts from our PTA, renting out the school hall, and younger members of staff taking on some extra burdens we are just about able to balance our budgets, he said. ldquoTo be honest, next year might start looking grim, but wersquore keeping our heads high.ldquoWith that said, wersquove been working hard on incorporating new initiatives and the new curriculum, we have a great crop of pupils and staff morale is high. We are very positive here.ldquoItrsquos also our th anniversary this year, so we have loads of ex-staff and pupils coming through the doors to say hello, a celebratory PTA barbecue and more planned.Taking a tour around the school, this positivity is reflected in students and staff alike. Children seem genuinely excited to learn, smiling, waving and saying hello to Mr Rees.Evenlode Primary School itself has an interesting history.It was opened in  as the first open plan primary school in South East Wales.The population of the school has risen dramatically over the last  years, from  on roll in  to the present .The building itself, a maze of classrooms and corridors plastered in colours, has also changed to accommodate more pupils.Much of the semi-open plan design has disappeared, making way for more conventional classrooms.The school benefits from having a superb site with two playgrounds as well as a large playing field, a designated play area for Reception children, a wildle area, open access to the local tennis club facilities, a newly constructed lsquooutside classroomrsquo and adventure trail.One of the first stops was a hall used by its lsquoSaplingsrsquo Out of School Care, the pre and after-school club for children.Saplings provides childcare for around  children from all year groups, providing breakfast in the morning and looking after children from .am to pm when needed.There, the children can access a wide range of activities, switched up on a regular basis.These have included cooking, gardening, art, crafts, sporting activities, outdoor play and plenty more.A couple of pupils, part of the Saplings, are called through. They happily talk about their favourite part of the clubs. One says arts and crafts another, going outside and playing sport four more say the food.Saplings isnrsquot the only place the students can indulge in a little food.Pupils have set up a fruit tuck shop in the school yard, a group endeavour that students control all aspects of - from placing orders for snacks, selecting the products, handling finances and, of course, selling to their friends.A small group of budding merchants were excited to show me their wares, selling oranges and bananas at break time.There was plenty more to do outside, as well.Mr Rees himself taught fire-making lessons in their fire pit, while the school also made use of rope courses, and a newly refurbished gazebo.Bike racks could be found at the front and back of the site, with students encouraged to cycle to school.Sport is very high on the schoolrsquos agenda.ldquoWe have kids from the school representing us in cricket, rugby and tennis at a county level, said Mr Rees. ldquoWersquore also fielding regular football, rugby and netball teams, and we are pushing plenty of other outdoor activities - like our new ropes and outdoor assault course.ldquoWersquore lucky to have parents in this area who are incredibly supportive of sports, and we have some shining examples of sporting prowess in our children.ldquoWe think itrsquos a very important part of being a rounded and healthy inidual.The school doesnrsquot just focus on sport - they aim to nurture minds and souls too.ldquoExpressive arts is a major area of focus at the moment, said Mr Rees. ldquoWersquore lucky enough to have a drama specialist supporting us, helping coach the children through both acting and production.ldquoWe are even working with the Welsh Government on a production of H.G. Wellrsquos The Time Machine, to be held in our school hall.The hall had been built with money raised from selling off surplus land, with a further loan from the Vale council.It is tidy, modern, and neatly decorated, with a sophisticated looking lighting system - built with help from parents.ldquoWersquore very proud of the relationship we have with parents here, said Mr Rees. ldquoThey have been enormously helpful with our budgetary concerns.Evenlode is a school with a cheerful outlook, a happy student body and a strong working relationship between staff, students and parent alike.It deserves to go far. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

In the past he chaired the all-party Parliamentary group on nuisance calls and secured changes to the law to restrict cold telephone calling.ldquoThere have been a number of complaints about the increase in nuisance callers and the rise of the doorstep economy in the Vale of Glamorgan. Ahead of the clocks going back, Alun wants to provide constituents with a proven means of reducing the number of doorstep callers.Welsh Labour parliamentary candidate for the Vale, Belinda Loveluck-Edwards said: ldquoIt appears that Alun Cairns is using public money to try and block his political opponents from speaking to voters. This must be investigated.ldquoThis is a deliberate attempt to present a  equivalence between genuine political canvassing and those who would wish to scam vulnerable people.ldquoMany people will be deeply unsettled by this behaviour from Cairns at the same time as the Tories are attempting to suppress votes by making it a requirement to show ID at polling stations- a move that will disproportionately affect working class, ethnic minority and young voters.ldquoThis is not how politics should be done. In contrast, Welsh Labour is opening up politics by extending votes to  and  year olds in future Assembly elections.

However he is recognised as one of the greatest ever British rugby league players.Elizabeth lsquoBettyrsquo Campbell, also born in  in Butetown, was the first black head teacher in Wales.Following a public vote on hidden heroines Cardf Council confirmed earlier this year that a statue of Betty will be built in Cardf - the first woman to feature in our capital city.On the weekend I will be on a question and answer  about institutionalised racism in Wales, across sport, the media, politics, and the world of work.I look forward to sitting on the  with Cllr Saeed Ebrahim, lawyer Hilary Brown, and Chisomo Phiri from EYST.As more and more Black History Month events take place across Wales, I cannot help but feel a sense of pride in how far we have come as a nation.I hope that these events continue to inspire the next generation of young black leaders as we still have so much more to change.To all my constituents, to everyone across Wales, I hope you all join in with the celebrations and festivities of this historic month, attend the events, learn about those that have trailblazed for us and make this a Black History Month to remember. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It would require the removal of seven of the  ancient trees in the Conservation Area.Many of the trees had been assessed in September  as deserving of a Tree Protection Order, which would prevent them from being cut down, though the Vale council has said they are in the process of securing the protection orders.Residents say one ndash Ash Tree , crucial to development ndash has already been removed. John Lean, a resident of Kymin Terrace, said: ldquoAround a week ago, the first ash tree was sawn down. It was painted as a routine tidying up of their grounds, that it was sick, and was carried out not by the architects who made the main application, but by the warden. We do not believe there was anything wrong with that tree.ldquoAn application was made under Section  of the Planning Acts for the removal of Ash Tree , another tree not in the wood but next to the house, and the removal of a fallen tree. No notice was given to local residents the Vale council did not inspect the site before permission was given, and the first we knew of it was when we heard the chainsaws.Ash Tree  would have to be removed for any development to take place, to allow construction traffic to pass.David Burnett, a resident, said: ldquoThis creates a dangerous precedent for further development here.ldquoWhen the construction of Homeside House was permitted on appeal in , the inspector at the time made it clear that it should not impinge on the woodland. The woodland was described as lsquoinviolatersquo ndash itrsquos at least  years old. What was true then is true now. Other residents had further complaints about the proposed development, and the methodology used to carry out inspections.The large footprint of the dwelling occupies over half the site. The access road would also have to be able to take construction traffic, which residents fear would further damage the site and could limit parking.One resident described a bat survey as lsquocompletely inadequatersquo, as the resident said the survey carried out on behalf of the applicant noted observation was made on two occasions only.William and Karen Stonehouse said: ldquoThe development would involve the destruction of a valuable natural habitat without any benefit to the community whatsoever.ldquoPenarth is not short of expensive properties. It is affordable housing that is desperately needed to prevent the continuing drain of its young people who can no longer afford to buy any property here.ldquoThis proposal does nothing to address that.Joanna Masters said: ldquoI am very concerned about the proposed plan to fell the wood.ldquoI thought the world was becoming more environmentally aware, particularly regarding the value of trees, but it seems the Vale council is, in its own way, as irresponsible as Brazilrsquos Bolsonaro.A spokesman for the Vale council said: ldquoThis planning application has yet to be determined and will be considered in exactly the same way as any other, with the views of all interested parties taken into account.ldquoThat will involve reviewing all letters of representation and consultation responses on the matter. IldquoIt has been resubmitted after a previous one for a similar development was withdrawn as it failed to provide full details of the impact on nearby trees.ldquoWe are in the process of arranging Tree Preservation Orders for trees there that meet the criteria for that protection.ldquoThe council did approve an application to fell an ash tree from Homeside House as, after inspection by an officer, it was deemed to have a fungal bracket, which can structurally weaken trees to the point of breakage. That being the case, it was decided a TPO was not appropriate.The freehold for the woodland was purchased by Proxima GR Properties in  from McCarthy  Stone, who had built an unsheltered accommodation around the site.The Penarth Times has attempted to reach Proxima GR Properties for a comment. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Caroline Siarkiewicz, acting chief executive at the Money and Pensions Service, which is sponsored by the Department for Work and Pensions, said: ldquoMany QuickQuid customers will be feeling uncertain about what this means for them.ldquoWhile you may be tempted to stop your repayments, it is crucial to keep to your regular schedule, becauseyou have entered into a loan agreement you must fulfil it.ldquoIf you miss any repayments you could be hit by fees and additional charges, and it could also harm your credit rating.Enova had been working for months to reach a deal with authorities after customers filed more than , complaints about the company in just the first six months of the year.ldquoWe worked with our UK regulator to agree upon a sustainable solution to the elevated complaints to the UK Financial Ombudsman, which would enable us to continue providing access to credit for hard-working Britons, said chief executive David Fisher as he announced that the company would withdraw from the UK this quarter.Enova will take a one-off after tax charge of around  million US dollars , which includes a cash charge of  million US dollarsto support the end of its lending in the UK.QuickQuid is the best-known brand of CashEuroNet UK.The payday sector has faced a squeeze since facing tougher rules from City regulator the Financial Conduct Authority , to prevent people being trapped in debt spirals, following an outcry from charities and consumer campaigners.A cap was placed on the amounts payday lenders are allowed to charge and they have had to meet the FCArsquos stricter standards in order to continue operating.The Financial Ombudsman Servicereceived more than , complaints relating to CashEuroNet UK between January and June .Some , new cases relating toCashEuroNet UK were received ndash and % of complaints dealt with during the period were upheld in consumersrsquo favour. Earlier on Thursday, Sky News reported that auditor Grant Thornton had been lined up to take the company into administration.Industry insiders say the sector is constantly having to change to meet expectations.Meanwhile, lenders have been inundated with complaints from customers, often encouraged by claims management companies.These claims were a major reason that rival Wonga was forced to close its doors a year ago.The claims management companies themselves are worried that the failure of QuickQuid could be damaging for consumers who have already had to deal with one collapse in the sector.ldquoAt a time when CMCs are being pushed to the limit by delays in PPI repayments, and the aftermath of the PPI deadline, this further news will mean that some CMCs will have to lose staff or close in the run up to Christmas, leading to further job losses and strain on the economy, said Simon Evans, the chief executive of the Alliance of Claims Companies.It is unclear how many jobs at the payday lender might be put at riskit goes under.Enova did not clary what will happen to its UK customers.The company claims to have lent to more than . million people in the country.Tola Fisher, a personal finance expert at Money, said borrowers will likely still have to pay back their loans.Meanwhile, those with complaints against the process could face delays.ldquoIf yoursquore currently claiming compensation from QuickQuid for a mis-sold loan and it goes bust, you will need to wait until the administrators have wound up the company, said Ms Fisher.ldquoUnfortunately you might find yourself at the back of a long queue to get hold of your money..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: QuickQuid customers urged to keep up repayments amid closure plans article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--Promoted Stories       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

With uncertainty still surrounding exactly what the knock-on effects will be following news that QuickQuid is to shut its doors, the ombudsman put a brief statement on its website on Friday which read: ldquoWe are aware of reports that CashEuroNet, which includes the QuickQuid trading name, will be exiting the UK market.ldquoWe are working to understand what this means for complaints about the company and will be providing more information to consumers as soon as possible.John Cullen, business recovery partner at accountancy firm, Menzies LLP, said: ldquoFor former customers, who feel they have been taken advantage of and are in financial hardship, the future is still uncertain, as the value of any compensation payouts will now depend on the process of closing the company.ldquoWhat is clear is that in the face of growing regulatory pressures, the curtain appears to be drawing on the payday lender market.Have questions about debt, borrowing or pensions  You can now talk to us on Whatsapp: https:t.co USMCwCb pic MkrJpvHLrmdash Money Advice ServiceOctober , The regulatory landscape is tougher for payday lenders than it once was, following a clampdown by the Financial Conduct Authorityto make sure people could only afford to take out loans that they could afford to pay back.Wonga, which had once been Britainrsquos biggest payday lender, collapsed last year.Customers who still owe QuickQuid money on loans have been urged by money experts to keep up their repayments ndash or potentially face damage to their credit ratings or extra charges.Some Twitter users welcomed the news, with one remarking: ldquoGood riddance is all I can say!!But others were concerned that it could lead to more people struggling to find a loan.One wrote: ldquoWhere will we get our payday loans from now  Caroline Siarkiewicz, acting chief executive at the Money and Pensions Service, said that. million adults have less than pound in savings and investments ndash ldquoso lots of people face cash-flow problems which can make quick, short-term credit feel like the only option.But, she continued: ldquoIf you know you need a specic amount of money for a short while, there may be more affordable alternatives out there so itrsquos a good idea to shop around before you borrow.With the number of payday lenders in the market having shrunk in recent years, some alternative options for borrowers could include community development finance Institutions .These are small independent organisations that offer loans to people who have been turned down by their bank or credit card company.Or, it may be that getting free debt help from a body such as StepChange or Citizens Advice could avoid the need for a loan altogether.More help on finding alternatives to a payday loan is available at the Money Advice Service website: www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk en articles alternatives-to-payday-loans..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title:  uUncertain u future for QuickQuid customers article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--Promoted Stories       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Before starting as a trainee solicitor in a City of London firm, I initially worked as a paralegal for three months in a law firm in Perth, enjoying the lestyle and dferent culture of le in Australia, and then spent a further three months travelling in Australia, New Zealand and Asia. After ing to London, I qualied as a solicitor and then spent eight years working in the real estate department of a London law firm. With two young children, we decided to move back to Northern Ireland in  when I joined Cleaver Fulton Rankin as an assistant solicitor. I have been here ever since and was made a director in . What have you found the most challenging during your years of business, so far  As we will all be aware, the real estate market can be a bit of a rollercoaster. Having been involved in some fantastic deals here in Northern Ireland, largely courtesy of the peace idend, this all came crashing to a halt in . For real estate lawyers in particular, this presented a fresh challenge in terms of expanding client base and ensuring that our teams were kept busy. For a number of years I spent more time advising clients on restructuring, acting for administrators or receivers in selling off assets and working on refinancing transactions. This proved to be a huge contrast to the positive and very visible growth in the economy seen in the previous years. Thankfully, the real estate sector again currently seems to be enjoying good growth with high rates offor investors. However, it has to be said that the lack of political leadership here does still give cause for concern. How would you describe your management style  The most important resource that we have is our young people, so I hopefully lead by example and seek to encourage them. In my view the carrot is always better than the stick. What would you changeyou could go back and do it all again  I have spent over  years now practising law, butI could go back to university again, rather than doing a law degree, I would have studied history. It would have meant an extra year spent in training, but I think it may have kept my interest slightly more than lectures on tort and equity. Have you done it all on your own  No, absolutely not. One of the main reasons for coming back to Northern Ireland was, with a young family, we had the benefit here of family support. My parents in particular, played a key role in helping with child care at a time when I was trying to establish my career. I never underestimate the dficulties facing working parents with young children who deserve all the credit and support that they can get. A strong support network is also very important in the office and I am lucky to have the benefit of some great lawyers around me to whom I can turn to for help when needed. How would you like your business to be remembered  As a leading commercial law firm in Northern Ireland that is independent and innovative provides high quality legal advice to its clients conducts business in a socially responsible and ethical matter has a strong commercial awareness and specialist legal professionals.

The Top  Northern Ireland Companies  dinner, with AL Goodbody, brought together some of top business chiefs making the list, to the grand backdrop of Queen’s University’s Great Hall. The event heard renewed calls for securing a deal on Brexit, and the restoration of Stormont, as we approach , days without a devolved government here. John Mulgrew, editor of Ulster Business, told those gathered: “On the precipice of Brexit, the voice of business has never been stronger or more important – further enforcing the need for a deal. Avoiding a hard exit. And retaining a strong trading relationship across the island. “But we should also take this opportunity to clearly note, that we are approaching , days since having a devolved government – up and running. “It affects you and your businesses, and it’s cited as the key reason putting off investment from overseas, and our own local companies, from making key investment decisions.” The Top  edition is an annual showcase of the leading and largest companies, located right across Northern Ireland. This year sales rose by almost %, approaching a combined figure of £bn. And for the eighth year in a row, poultry processing giant Moy Park has come in at the number one spot, with turnover of £.bn. Michael Neill, head of Belfast office at AL Goodbody, said: “What the Top  companies have achieved in the past  months in what can only be described as capricious circumstances is truly remarkable – but imagine what could have been achieved had we some semblance of ‘normality’. “My hope is that we find ourselves doing so in a Northern Ireland that is embarking on a new and positive era of opportunity, rather than picking up the shattered pieces of a ‘no deal’ Brexit for many years to come.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"firms must prepare for no deal as economic forecast revised down","story":"Posted on Tuesday October  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland firms must prepare for a ‘no deal’ Brexit – a bank chief economist has warned – as it downgraded its forecast for the economy to .%.  Danske Bank’s Conor Lambe said there were still a number of possibilities for what might happen over the next  days, with the UK due to leave the EU on October . Possibilities included a no-deal exit, a withdrawal agreement being reached, an extension of Article  period or a general election. But predictions were \"incredibly dficult\", he said. \"Businesses should behave prudently and use this time to ensure they are as prepared as they can be for a worst-case scenario, no-deal Brexit, in case it occurs at the end of this month,\" he said. The .% is down from the bank’s previous forecasts, delivered in June, that growth would hit % in  and .% in . In its latest Northern Ireland Quarterly Sectoral Forecasts report, Danske Bank said that the Northern Ireland economy likely expanded in the second quarter of the year, but the rate of growth over the first half of the year remained modest. “We have revised our forecast for economic growth in Northern Ireland downwards for both  and ,” he said. “This largely reflects the modest data for the first half of the year, increased Brexit-related uncertainty and the weaker global economic environment. “Assuming that a no-deal Brexit is avoided, we expect the Northern Ireland economy to grow by .% in  and .% in , below the .% we expect UK GDP to grow by in both years. “A combination of strong wage growth and more stable inflation is likely to lead to solid growth in consumer spending, but the lack of clarity around the UK’s future relationship with the EU is expected to continue holding back business investment.” It says the information and communication, and professional, scientic  technical services sectors are expected to be the fastest growing parts of the economy over the next two years. Meanwhile, output in the construction sector is forecast to rise by .% in  and .% in , while expected output growth in the wholesale and retail trade sector has been revised down to .% in  and .% in . Public administration and defence is continuing to have the weakest outlook of all the sectors of the Northern Ireland economy, with output expected to contract by .% in , and by a further .% in . “Over the coming weeks, a number of potential Brexit options are possible, including a no-deal exit, a withdrawal agreement being reached, an extension of the Article  period or a general election,” Mr Lambe said. “Predicting what will happen next in the Brexit process is incredibly dficult, but businesses should behave prudently and use this time to ensure they are as prepared as they can be for a worst-case scenario, no-deal Brexit, in case it occurs at the end of this month.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/BOI11_web.jpg","title":"bank of ireland uk empowering colleagues to support local communities","story":"Posted on Tuesday October  by Ulster Business Paul Slevin, Alison Mitchell, Ian Sheppard, Sally Irvine, Christine Graham and Paul Magee With a purpose to enable customers, colleagues and communities to thrive, Bank of Ireland UK staff are building on a long history of supporting local charities and community organisations. Ulster Business speaks to Northern Ireland managing director Ian Sheppard, and learns more about how colleagues are being empowered to play an active role in the local communities where they live and work Bank of Ireland UK sees developing its colleagues and helping customers and communities to thrive as part of its DNA, according to Ian Sheppard, managing director in Northern Ireland.From key charity partnerships, to fundraising, volunteering, sponsorship and more, Ian says the desire for Bank of Ireland UK is to make a positive impact by empowering colleagues to make a dference.“When I speak to my colleagues, I hear how really active and involved they are in their own community,” Ian says. “There are so many examples and I never cease to be amazed by their passion and commitment.An important partnership for the bank is with Alzheimer’s Society, its flagship charity for the last two years. In that time around £, has been raised in Northern Ireland, but as Ian explains it’s about more than fundraising.“We realised that not only can we help them financially, but there are resources we can share and opportunities we can offer which can help to signicantly raise the charity’s profile and raise much needed funds.”One example in which the bank has supported Alzheimer’s Society in this way is through its own long-running partnership with Ulster Rugby.“We donated our advertising and promotion activity for a televised game at the Kingspan Stadium making the charity ‘Sponsor for a Day’. This included using their logo on the back of the Ulster Rugby jerseys, taking over the pitch side boards and inviting a group of people living with dementia, their family and carers to the game – helping to get their brand message out to not only a stadium with capacity of , people but to a much wider TV audience.”Alzheimer’s Society sees some fantastic people giving their time to help others. That’s no clearer than its Side by Side programme, which Bank of Ireland UK helps to fund.The photograph on the front of this edition of the magazine taken at the Grand Opera House in Belfast features Mary Dalzell a Side by Side volunteer, alongside Hazel Whiteside, who has been living with dementia for two years.They share a love of music, theatre and cinema and the Side by Side programme, which re-connects people with dementia to their communities by doing the things they love, has not only put a smile on both their faces but has had a positive impact on their lives.There are so many people impacted by dementia and Alzheimers in our local communities, and its touching so many people’s lives, taking this as our motivation, the bank now has almost , staff trained as Dementia Friends.The bank’s ‘Give Together’ programme means staff can take one day a year to spend the time working with a charity or community organisation of their choice. “This day can involve anything from gardening work to painting a youth centre,” Ian says“Beyond Alzheimer’s Society, colleagues are helping many other organisations such as Macmillan Cancer Support, Cancer Research UK through its Relay for Le Legenderry, the Wooden Spoon children’s rugby charity, and Space NI, which offers support services in health and social care sectors to the local community.” You canabout some of the good work colleagues have done further on in this feature.“We are also committed to reflecting the community by developing a erse and modern workforce – which is part-and-parcel of a progressive company,” Ian says. “It’s something that current and future employees expect in their employer. For us its part of our DNA, something that’s always been there but we are now putting a clear and visible structure around it,” Ian says.This has included being a founding member of FuSIoN – the Financial Services Inclusion Network which drives to support and promote LGBT+ professionals across the sector, becoming JAM Card members – allowing staff to knowcustomers with a communication barrier need ‘just a minute’, as well as recently being awarded the Diversity Charter Mark.“Our community involvement is something we are very clear about - something I’m passionate about and it’s an easy ask to get staff engaged. It’s very natural, and it has always been developed from the ground up,” Ian says.He believes this contributes to the huge numbers of staff doing their bit – enabling their own local communities to thrive.  ALISON MITCHELLA customer service manager for Bank of Ireland UK in Londonderry, Alison has worked for the bank for  years, but her motivation for fundraising and support for Alzheimer’s Society began in , following her mother-in-law’s diagnosis with dementia. Alison trained at her local hospital to become a dementia volunteer and learned so much she asked Alzheimer’s Society to run similar sessions in her own branch to enable staff to better assist customers with dementia.Sadly, Alison’s mother-in-law passed away in May of this year but to mark her passing and to raise vital funds in her memory, Alison took part in Alzheimer’s Society Cupcake Day. Initial plans to simply sell cupcakes within her own branch changed rapidly as colleagues from nearby branches heard of the event and wanted to support both Alison and the charity.  Faced with orders for more than  cupcakes, Alison requested a Give Together day, which is time given by the bank to both iniduals and teams to give back to their communities. Alison says: “I was in the kitchen from am to pm baking and icing but it was worth it. The event raised £, which Bank of Ireland UK matched doubling the amount raised to £,. “I could not have achieved that without the support of family, colleagues and the wider business. I was proud to raise the funds in my mother-in-law’s memory and I am proud to work for an organisation that not only values our role in the wider community but supports it too.” CHRISTINE GRAHAMChristine Graham has helped to raise funds for Cancer Research UK through the Relay for Le “Legenderry” event held in St. Columb’s Park, Londonderry.The Derry-based senior business manager for Bank of Ireland UK has personally been touched by cancer as she lost two close family members to the disease. Her young great niece was also diagnosed with a rare form of cancer in  and is now doing well, but seeing the impact a cancer diagnosis has on a family inspired Christine to get involved with the Relay for Le event.“Our event truly is ‘legenderry’,” she says. It is a -hour relay race that brings the whole community together to celebrate the lives of cancer survivors, to remember those lost to the disease, to fight back by increasing our knowledge of cancer and by raising money to fund le-saving cancer research.”In just three years the event has raised over £, for Cancer Research UK with Christine helping to raise £, in  – not only the most successful Relay for Le event in the UK this year but all funds raised in Northern Ireland stays here.  Christine values the support she has had from the bank who promote the event to the wider community and from her colleagues who enter teams.“Relay for Le is for all ages and stages, all shapes and sizes,” she says. It’s cross community and intergenerational and the atmosphere every year is electric.”Plans are already underway for Relay for Le  which promises to be another massive event. PAUL MAGEEPaul Magee, associate director of the corporate banking team, became involved with the Ulster Region Committee for Wooden Spoon, the Children’s Charity of Rugby, five years ago after he successfully completed the charity’s Four Peaks Challenge, reaching the summits of the UK and Ireland’s highest peaks. He is now an active committee member for Wooden Spoon, helping to raise funds to provide le-enhancing experiences for disadvantaged and disabled children. “All funds raised in Ulster stay in the region and benefit the children here,” Paul says. “For instance, we provided £, to the Mae Murray Foundation to buy specialist equipment for the first fully accessible beach in Ulster at Benone Strand. When we created the access to the beach, one parent was very emotional as he watched his teenage daughter in the sea for the first time. It’s those occasions where we’re responding to a need within the community that makes the effort worthwhile.”Wooden Spoon has funded numerous charity projects, most recently £, for a new multi-sensory room at Parkview Special School in Lisburn and purchasing a horse for Riding for the Disabled Association in Coleraine, a charity that enhances children’s lives every day.  With his passion for and involvement in Wooden Spoon, Paul is grateful for the support Bank of Ireland has given him in his role with the organisation, specically the corporate banking team who value his dedication to making a dference. He says: “The bank has been fantastic – I appreciate the flexibility the team offers in the lead up to events and my colleagues often attend Wooden Spoon fundraisers. I’ve also benefited from the bank’s Give Together initiative, which offers days of paid leave that employees can use for volunteering. The bank’s support has helped facilitate my commitment to Wooden Spoon, where I can really see and be a part of the impact the charity has on the local community.” SALLY IRVINEOver the last  years Sally Irvine’s coffee mornings have become a highlight in the office calendar, in turn raising more than £, for MacMillan Cancer Support and funding  days of specialist nursing care for cancer patients across Northern Ireland.Sally, a business lending and credit governance manager at Bank of Ireland UK, arranged her first Macmillan Coffee Morning in  following a colleague’s cancer diagnosis. She found herself wanting to do something to help people living with cancer and so took the plunge and decided to be a host as part of Macmillan’s biggest coffee morning fundraising event. From the outset, Sally had tremendous support from her team members and the wider business, and this has contributed to the ongoing success of the event.The bank plays a huge part in ensuring Sally can deliver the event each year by giving her support through their Give Together scheme.Sally says: “The coffee morning has become a very special occasion and a great day of fun where people from across the bank come together to have a wee cuppa and a cake and take time to catch up while raising money for a really important cause. One in two of us will face cancer at some time in our lives and I am passionate about continuing to fundraise to provide the specialist nursing care that’s so vital for those living with cancer.”Plans are already underway for this year’s Macmillan Coffee Morning and Sally is hopeful the annual fundraiser will continue to hold a special place in the office calendar. PAUL SLEVINBranch manager at Bank of Ireland UK in Newry, Paul Slevin is someone who embodies the bank’s ethos of community involvement through his role with the charity Space NI.  Space NI offers support services in health and social care sectors to the local community. Through its service Home to Hospital, the organisation has helped  elderly people travel to crucial hospital appointments, while its Family Support Hub offers vital assistance to families in distress. Paul joined the charity in  and has just completed five years as chairman of the Board of Directors. He is proud that his background in finance has enabled him to support the charity through its repositioning process to ensure that its activities best serve the community.  Since Paul’s involvement with the charity began, Space NI has won the ‘One to Watch’ award at NI Social Enterprise Awards and the ‘Community Wellbeing Initiative’ at the All Ireland Pride of Place Awards.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: \"We’ve got a great new deal that takes back control — now Parliament should get Brexit done on Saturday so we can move on to other priorities like the cost of living, the NHS, violent crime and our environment.\" Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European Commission, said: “This agreement is a fair compromise between the EU and the UK. It is testament to the commitment and willingness of both sides to do what is best for EU and UK citizens. We now have a newly agreed Protocol that protects peace and stability on the island of Ireland and fully protects our Single Market. I hope that we can now bring this over the line and provide the certainty our citizens and businesses so deserve.” Michel Barnier, the European Commissions chief negotiator, said: “We had dficult discussions over the past days. We have managed to find solutions that fully respect the integrity of the Single Market. We created a new and legally operative solution to avoid a hard border, and protect peace and stability on the island of Ireland. It is a solution that works for the EU, for the UK and for people and businesses in Northern Ireland.” The DUP has said it could not support the deal brokered by Mr Johnson. So, what deal was agreed  A statement from the European Commission says: “In terms of regulations, Northern Ireland will remain aligned to a limited set of rules related to the EUs Single Market in order to avoid a hard border: legislation on goods, sanitary rules for veterinary controls , rules on agricultural production marketing, VAT and excise in respect of goods, and state aid rules. “In terms of customs, the EU-UK Single Customs Territory, as agreed in November , has been removed from the Protocol on Ireland   Northern Ireland, at the request of the current UK government. EU and UK negotiators have now found a new way to achieve the goal of avoiding a customs border on the island of Ireland, while at the same time ensuring Northern Ireland remains part of the UKs customs territory. This agreement fully protects the integrity of the EUs Single Market and Customs Union, and avoids any regulatory and customs checks at the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland. “Finally, the EU and the UK have agreed to create a new mechanism on ‘consent, which will give the Members of the Northern Ireland Assembly a decisive voice on the long-term application of relevant EU law in Northern Ireland. The Commission has been in close contact with the Irish government on this point.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/redbus.jpg","title":"wrightbus deal struck to buy ballymena bus maker","story":"Posted on Tuesday  October  by John Mulgrew A deal has been struck to buy the business and assets of Ballymena bus maker Wrightbus after it entered administration with the loss of , jobs.

We hear about the firm’s plans for growth hereBelfast City is changing and its transportation network and parking strategy have a key role to play in supporting its growth. Innovative use of technology to make parking ‘smarter’ and promoting better use of city centre space will contribute to creating the right environment for business investment and the lestyle of residents, commuters and visitors. The need for effective parking planning reaches beyond Belfast city though as parking issues are common in towns across the country. Parking planning is not just about the provision and management of spaces – the majority of parking acts require some sort of enforcement system to ensure effectiveness. As an experienced parking operator, APCOA can work with the public and private sectors to contribute knowledge and expertise to the planning and implementation of effective parking strategies. An on-going investment in developing parking technology also offers new ways of improving services to clients and the public.In August, APCOA acquired the business of Nationwide Controlled Parking Systemsin Ireland, including subsidiaries Parking Enforcement Solutionsand Mobile Research Solutions.The combined operation resulting from the acquisition sees APCOA’s business in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland double in size to cover more than , site locations and it will enable them to service all counties in both countries.APCOA’s existing business in Northern Ireland operated a number of sites including two city centre multi storey car parks in Belfast city centre.

We’re really excited about the opportunities ahead.”Neil Cunningham, managing director of APCOA in Ireland, explains why he sees the acquisition as a positive move for the business in Northern Ireland.“This investment strengthens APCOA’s ability to offer countrywide services and gives us a stronger base for future growth. Colleagues in both companies have a keen focus on customer service and we’ve brought together two experienced management teams.“I’m also delighted that Jason Ballard, founder and chief executive of NCPS and PEA, will continue to work with us for the next six months to support the smooth integration of the business.
